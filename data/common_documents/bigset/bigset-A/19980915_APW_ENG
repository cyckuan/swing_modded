Nurse convicted in Saudi murder of Australian colleague returns to
</HEADLINE>
work

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British nurse convicted in Saudi Arabia of
murdering an Australian colleague has returned to work, her
brother-in-law has said.
	   Jonathan Ashbee said that Deborah Parry, 40, was working at Holy
Cross hospital in Surrey, southeast of London.
	   ``She is looking after elderly people and detox patients,''
Ashbee said Monday.
	   Parry, 40, previously worked at the hospital in 1982 and
received a warm reception from the many friends she had there,
Ashbee said.
	   ``She has two ambitions at the moment _ to clear her name and to
return to nursing,'' said Ashbee.
	   Parry, with Scottish nurse Lucille McLauchlan, was convicted in
Saudi Arabia for the December 1996 murder of Australian nurse
Yvonne Gilford, who was stabbed, suffocated and beaten in her room
at a Saudi hospital where all three women worked.
	   Saudi King Fahd freed the two nurses on May 20 in an act of
clemency.
	   Parry and McLauchlan said their confessions to the murder were
extracted by brutal treatment from Saudi authorities, and they
later retracted them.
	   The two nurses faced beheading until Gilford's brother, Frank,
waived the death penalty in return for dlrs 1 million, a right
given to him under Saudi law.
	   Most of that money was later given to charity.

Malaysia to freeze trading of its stocks in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Trading of all Malaysian stocks on
Singapore's over-the-counter market will be frozen at the end of
trading Tuesday, Malaysia's stock exchange announced.
	   ``No transactions or transfers whatsoever will be allowed in
respect of the accounts,'' the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange said in
a statement.
	   Singapore authorities had planned to end trading in the stocks
on Friday, after allowing local investors to transfer their
holdings into U.S. dollars or to accounts in Malaysia.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Singapore Stock
Exchange to the Malaysian move.
	   Malaysia had previously said it would no longer allow trading of
its stocks in Singapore, where they make up about 90 percent of the
republic's over-the-counter market. Stock exchanges of the two
countries had not agreed on how the Malaysian securities were to be
transferred to a central depository in Kuala Lumpur, but the
Singapore exchange said it was working on the arrangements.
	   In the meantime, the value of the stocks in Singapore dived, and
some investors lost hundreds of thousands of Singapore dollars
before Singapore authorities suspended the trading of
over-the-counter Malaysian stocks on Sept. 4. They allowed trading
in the shares to resume this week, until Friday, to allow accounts
to be closed out.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange statement said that all
Malaysian shares held in the accounts of brokers would no longer be
valid until a final agreement is reached on how the shares will be
transferred.
	   The Malaysian authorities are bringing all trading of Malaysian
securities onshore as a way of closing any loopholes resulting from
the Sept. 1 introduction of sweeping capital controls.
	   Those curbs prohibited offshore trading of Malaysian currency,
effectively pegging the ringgit at 3.80 to the U.S. dollar.

Braves clinch 7th straight division title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Tom Glavine was on hand for Atlanta's first
division title of the 1990s. Appropriately, he played a key role
Monday night when the Braves made it seven in a row.
	   Already the only team with six straight division titles, Atlanta
added another to its collection when Glavine fought through control
problems to become the NL's first 19-game winner, beating the
Philadelphia Phillies 4-2.
	   Chipper Jones homered over the center-field wall leading off the
sixth after Michael Tucker hit his first homer in over a month to
tie the game 2-2 in the fifth.
	   Glavine (19-6) allowed two runs in six innings, moving within
one victory of his fourth 20-win season. Dennis Martinez, John
Rocker and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched one scoreless inning apiece,
with Ligtenberg earning his 28th save.
	   Division titles have become so routine in Atlanta that the
clinching game drew only 33,367, the second-smallest crowd at
Turner Field since May 28. Even the celebration at the end of the
game seemed routine.
	   Glavine, who allowed eight hits and walked three, and John
Smoltz are the only players remaining from Atlanta's first division
winner of the decade in 1991.
	   The Braves won three consecutive NL West titles before switching
to the East in 1994. That season was halted by a strike, which may
have helped extend Atlanta's streak; Montreal led the division by
six games when play stopped Aug. 12.
	   Since the strike ended the following spring, Atlanta has cruised
to four more division titles.
	   Curt Schilling (14-14) took the loss despite giving up only six
hits and striking out 12 _ his 15th game with double-figure
strikeouts.
 &UR; Mets 7, Astros 4, 13 innings
	   In Houston, Brian McRae hit a tying homer in the ninth inning,
then hit a two-run double in the 13th as the New York Mets
prevented Houston from clinching the NL Central.
	   The Mets, who began the day one game behind Chicago in the
wild-card race, trailed 4-2 when McRae hit a two-run homer off
Astros relief ace Billy Wagner in the ninth.
	   In the 13th, Edgardo Alfonzo led off with a double and continued
to third when right fielder Derek Bell misplayed the ball for an
error. John Olerud grounded out and Mike Piazza, who had four hits,
was intentionally walked by Mike Magnante (4-7).
	   McRae followed with his go-ahead double off Doug Henry and later
scored on a wild pitch.
	   Greg McMichael (4-4) was the winner. John Franco got his 37th
save, breaking his own team record.
 &UR; Cardinals 7, Pirates 3
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire was back in the lineup. He just
didn't look like a home run king.
	   A day after leaving a game at Houston early because of minor
back spasms, the St. Louis Cardinals' slugger was a quiet 2-for-4,
taking few healthy swings in a win over Pittsburgh.
	   McGwire had a two-run single in a four-run second inning off
Jason Schmidt (11-12). He has just three singles in 18 at-bats in
six games since hitting homer No. 62, and has been caught by Sammy
Sosa.
	   Against Schmidt, McGwire struck out in the first on a checked
swing and grounded out to first on a checked swing in the fourth.
In the sixth, he had a rare single to right off Todd Van Poppel on
another awkward, incomplete swing.
	   As a precaution, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said he won't
use McGwire in both games of Tuesday night's doubleheader against
the Pirates.
	   Jose Jimenez (1-0), making his first career start, held the
Pirates to four hits and one run in seven innings.
 &UR; Brewers 2, Reds 1
	   In Cincinnati, Jeromy Burnitz drove in two runs with his 37th
homer and an RBI double, leading the Milwaukee Brewers over the
Cincinnati Reds.
	   Steve Woodard (10-11), who had lost six straight decisions since
beating St. Louis on Aug. 3, allowed six hits in seven-plus
innings, struck out three and walked one.
	   Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 24th save. After Wickman
walked the bases loaded with one out, Roberto Petagine grounded
into a game-ending double play.
	   Burnitz homered off Pete Harnisch (12-7) with one out in the
second, his second solo home run in two days. In the fourth, his
two-out double scored Dave Nilsson, giving Burnitz a career-high
122 RBIs.
 &UR; Expos 4, Marlins 2
	   In Montreal, Dustin Hermanson won his third straight decision
and Brad Fullmer hit a three-run homer to lead the Montreal Expos
over the Florida Marlins.
	   The Marlins lost for the 16th time in 18 games. Florida leads
the majors with 102 losses.
	   Hermanson (14-10) allowed two runs on five hits in seven
innings. He won for the seventh time in his last eight decisions.
Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 32nd save.
	   Fullmer hit his 12th home run off Brian Meadows (10-12) with two
outs in the sixth and the score tied at 1.

New polls show both Labor and the government ahead for elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Almost halfway through Australia's
five-week national election campaign, two public opinion polls were
in conflict Tuesday, showing both the conservative government and
the opposition Labor Party in the lead.
	   A Newspoll survey published in Tuesday's The Australian
newspaper shows Labor is attracting 44 percent of the primary vote,
against 42 percent for the conservative coalition of Prime Minister
John Howard.
	   Newspoll is historically the most accurate national poll. The
latest poll surveyed 1,720 people nationally on the weekend of
Sept. 11-13 and has a margin of error of 2.4 percent.
	   A second poll gives the coalition a clear lead, with a primary
vote of 44 percent against Labor's 34 percent. The poll, to be
published in The Bulletin magazine Wednesday, surveyed 550 people
nationally on Sept. 11-13 and has a margin of error of 4.3 percent.
	   Australians will vote in national elections on Oct. 3.
	   After the distribution of voting preferences, the Newspoll gives
Labor a two party-preferred vote of 53 percent, against the
coalition's 47 percent.
	   Mark Textor's Australasian Research Strategies organization,
which conducted The Bulletin poll, said that his poll showed the
coalition's two party-preferred vote was 47 percent, against
Labor's 42 percent.
	   The Newspoll shows that both the Labor Party and the coalition
have benefited from a drop in support for right-wing populist
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party. One Nation scored seven percent
of the vote in the Newspoll, down from 7.5 percent in the previous
poll and from the mid-teens months ago.
	   However, analysts say support for One Nation is still highly
concentrated in particular places, in parts of Queensland and
Western Australia states, and warn that may effect the election
results.
	   Howard won the last election in March 1996 with a two party
preferred vote of 53.7 per cent to Labor's 46.3 per cent.
	   Support for Labor leader Kim Beazley has risen to its highest
level in nine months. Beazley polled 39 percent of the vote as
preferred prime minister in the Newspoll, up three percent from the
previous poll.
	   Howard also attracted 39 percent of the latest vote as preferred
prime minister, unchanged from the previous Newspoll survey held
Sept. 4-6.

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Dwight Gooden won his fifth straight start as
the Cleveland Indians beat Toronto 6-3 Monday night, keeping the
Blue Jays from closing in the AL wild-card race.
	   Cleveland, seeking its fourth straight AL Central title, reduced

	   The Blue Jays entered with 14 wins in their last 17 games but
remained three games behind Boston in the wild-card race.

Australia defends jail sentence proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Olympic Committee
president John Coates has defended an Australian proposal that
athletes should face jail sentences if they trafficked in
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The International Olympic Committee declared its opposition
Monday to the proposal, with one senior IOC official saying no
international sports organization would want to stage events in
Australia in the future if the proposal goes through.
	   The Australian Olympic Committee last month said the penalty for
possession, manufacturing and trafficking of steroids and other
banned substances should be the same as those for illicit
narcotics.
	   Under the proposal, anyone importing large amounts of drugs into
Australia could be jailed for life, while an athlete testing
positive for steroids could face a two-year prison term. That
raised the prospect of drug cheats being thrown into jail during
the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   The IOC executive board, which opened a four-day meeting Monday
in Seoul, said it firmly opposed criminal penalties for athletes.
While drug traffickers should face criminal prosecution, athletes
should be sanctioned by sports bodies, IOC leaders said.
	   ``There is quite a bit of consensus that jail should be reserved
for the traffickers, dealers, suppliers and true criminals,'' IOC
director general Francois Carrard said. ``The athletes should be
subjected to the sanctions of the world of sports.''
	   But Coates told Australian Broacasting Corp. radio Tuesday that
the measure was needed because some of the drugs, such as anabolic
androgynic steroids, had been shown to have the same adverse health
and social effects as narcotics.
	   ``The medical people all tell us that they have the same
deleterious effects as narcotics and amphetamines,'' Coates said.
	   ``The only circumstance (where athletes would face a jail term)
would be if the athletes have in commercial or traffickable
quantities the hard sports drugs such as steroids,'' Coates said.
	   Coates said under the proposed system, Chinese swimming
officials who were found with performance-enhancing drugs at
January's world swimming championships in Perth would have faced
jail terms. (djp)

Vietnam plans additional amnesty this year, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam plans another amnesty of prisoners
this year following the release of 5,219 inmates Sept. 1 that
included a handful of top dissidents, an official said Thursday.
	   No timetable or number of inmates to be freed has been fixed,
said the official, who works in the president's office. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Youth newspaper reported that Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen
Tan Dung, chairman of the central amnesty council, asked provincial
councils to submit lists of inmates for amnesty before Sept. 30.
	   Under the guidelines, inmates considered for amnesty include
those serving jail sentences of less than five years.

as well as promoting commercial and cultural exchanges, Menem hoped
to persuade Jamaica, a former British colony, to help champion its
claim to Las Malvinas, as Argentinians call the Falklands.
	   At international forums, Argentina has been campaigning for
support to persuade Britain to relinquish its claim on the islands,
over which the two countries fought a 74-day war in 1982.
	   Menem leaves Jamaica late Wednesday for Houston, Texas, to
attend an international energy conference.
	   Argentina and Britain renewed relations in 1990 and later signed
treaties on oil and fishing rights in the waters surrounding the
islands.

Report: Britain, China support Hong Kong's market intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Britain and China firmly support the Hong Kong
government's recent intervention in the financial markets to defend
its currency link, a news report quoted their diplomats as saying.
	   Alan Paul, British team leader of the Joint Liaison Group, said
Britain supported Hong Kong's controversial decision to step into
the market, official Radio Hong Kong reported Tuesday.
	   Wang Guisheng, the mainland Chinese leader, also reiterated
China's support for the move, but added the mainland would not
intervene into Hong Kong's decisions, the radio report said.
	   The working group, which was set up to handle details of the
transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in July 1997 from Britain to
China, is meeting in the territory Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In the second half of August, the Hong Kong government took on
currency and stock speculators, ultimately intervening and changing
market rules to close the door on what it called market
manipulation.
	   Hong Kong officials say the intervention was aimed at protecting
the 14-year-old currency peg to the U.S. dollar. The peg has come
under repeated attack by speculators since October.

Martinair plane makes emergency landing after engine explodes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW to some points. UPDATES with new quotes, witnesses
reporting engine exploding, other details; CORRECTS that Swissair
plane was McDonnell-Douglas. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ A Dutch charter plane carrying 285
people was forced to make an emergency return to Calgary
International Airport when one of its engines exploded upon
takeoff.
	   There were no injuries reported among the 274 passengers and 11
crew of the Boeing 767 operated by Martinair, a charter airline
based in Amsterdam.
	   Calgary residents who heard the blast and saw flames streaming
from the aircraft jammed emergency phone lines to report the
incident.
	   ``It was a pretty solid bang,'' said Bruce England, a printer at
the Calgary Sun, who watched a trail of smoke pouring from the
right engine and then heard a pop as flames burst out. After the
explosion, the plane stopped climbing, he said.
	   Crew on the plane, which was en route to Amsterdam, called
Calgary's air traffic tower shortly after takeoff at 7:40 p.m.
Monday to report engine trouble.
	   The pilots managed to extinguish the blaze by shutting down the
right engine of the two-engine jet.
	   The jet circled the city but only managed to dump some of its
fuel, sparking concern about the aircraft's ability to land safely
under its weight.
	   The pilots brought the plane down safely on the airport's
longest primary runway at 8:14 p.m. Three tires were flattened
during the process.
	   ``The landing was picture-perfect,'' said Wayne Reimer, duty
manager for the Calgary Airport Authority.
	   The passengers were bused to the terminal afterward.
	   Neither airport officials nor Martinair staff were immediately
aware of the cause of the fire.
	   Martinair officials were inspecting the plane late Monday night.
	   The aborted flight comes less than two weeks after Swissair
Flight 111 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off Peggy's Cove, Nova
Scotia, killing all 229 on board.
	   Electrical problems are believed to have contributed to the
crash of the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 widebody on Sept. 2. The pilot
reported cockpit smoke before his systems failed.

Cyclist Wilson makes up for blunder; Aussies dominate again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with swim finals, later events &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ This time Anna Wilson got it
right.
	   The Australian cyclist, whose foot slipped out of the pedal in
the long road race with the finish line in sight on Sunday,
triumphed in the 28-kilometer time trial Tuesday, winning by a
minute to capture the gold medal.
	   ``It was the hardest I have dug and the most I have hurt in a
time trial,'' said Wilson, adding that the victory more than made
up for Sunday's disaster when she finished third.
	   A lawyer riding in in her first major championship, Wilson
clocked 37 minutes 34 seconds to take the gold.
	   Canada's Linda Jackson finished second in 38:34, five seconds
ahead of another Australian, Kathy Watt, the Olympic road race
champion and owner of four Commonwealth Games gold medals.
	   Wilson's win was Australia's 22nd gold medal of a Games it is
dominating, especially in the pool.
	   Susie O'Neill has collected four golds here so far and later
Tuesday went in search of her fifth, which would tie Australia's
best individual swimming haul at one games by Hayley Lewis at
Auckland in 1990. O'Neill, who has eight from three Games, also is
chasing the all-time swimming record of nine by fellow Australian
Mike Wenden.
	   In Tuesday's heats, she clocked the fastest qualifying time in
the 100-meter butterfly. But O'Neill was expected to come under
pressure from countrywoman Petria Thomas, who was second fastest
into the final.
	   Simon Cowley, who won the 100-meter breaststroke Saturday, was
quickest qualifier for the 200-meter event and admitted his gold
medal performance may have been a little distracting.
	   ``I haven't been able to sleep much since then,'' said Cowley.
``I haven't been sick, just on a high from the first race.''
	   The Aussies, who triumphed in 12 of the first 15 swim finals,
were on course for another sweep of golds with Helen Denman and
former world record champion Sam Riley clocking the fastest two
times in the women's 100 meters breaststroke.
	   Gold No. 23 for Australia came in the women's pairs air pistol,
which was won by Annemarie Forder and Christine Trefry, whose
triumph was her second here and fifth in two Commonwealth Games.
	   New Zealand's Tania Corrigan and Jocelyn Lees gained the silver
and Malaysia's Kamisah And Jalal and Suriani Othman the bronze.
	   Canada's Christina Ashcroft and Sheron Bowes triumphed in the
pairs smallbore rifle with South Africa's Val Martin and Donne
Potgeiter taking silver and Scotland's Shirley McIntosh and Janis
Thomson capturing the bronze,
	   Highlight of Tuesday's cricket schedule was a high-powered
confrontation between test playing nations Australians Australia
and India in Group B.
	   Put in to bat, Australia slipped from 53 for one to 84 for five
with Ricky Ponting going for 13, Michael Bevan for two and Darren
Lehman for nine.

Australian coach urges full-strength sides for 1999 event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian soccer coach Raul Blanco
has urged European teams not to field second-string sides at next
year's Confederations Cup despite it being scheduled in the
northern hemisphere's off-season.
	   Blanco, an assistant coach when Australia made the final of last
year's Cup in Saudi Arabia, has picked a home-based 20-man squad
for the Oceania Nations Cup next week which should qualify
Australia for next year's tournament.
	   Australia plays Fiji in the opening match at Suncorp Stadium in
Brisbane on Sept. 25, then face the Cook Islands the following
Monday before the finals round. New Zealand, Tahiti and Vanuatu are
also in the Oceania qualifying round.
	   Blanco said that it's possible that European nations may not
send full-strength teams to Mexico if the date remains in January.
They are pushing for the Confederations Cup to be shifted to a June
time slot.
	   ``I do believe somebody in FIFA is saying it's the wrong month,
everybody's playing in Europe and they can't afford to take the
strongest teams,'' Blanco said.
	   ``I find that very difficult to understand because it is the
second-biggest tournament after the World Cup. I can't believe that
they would allow that to be.''
	   Blanco said he would wait until Australia qualified to find out
the availability of stars such as Leeds striker Harry Kewell and
Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bosnich. (djp)

Zedillo fears death toll will rise from Mexican flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details.
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EJIDO LA LIBERTAD, Mexico (AP) _ Isabel Reyes trudged across
what had been a banana plantation but was now a vast, stinking
panorama of mud along Suchiate River bordering Guatemala.
	   ``We have been left in ruin,'' said the 90-year-old farmer _ one
of tens of thousands of victims of the floods that devastated
Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas.
	   ``With canoes and boats we saved the lives of companions who
were trapped between pieces of wood, trees, mud and rocks,'' he
said Monday under a 95F (34C) sun that followed last week's storms.
	   But of the banana plantations on which life here depends,
``nothing was saved, and the water wasn't content to have carried
away our crops, it also carried away our lands and we are going to
have nothing.''
	   Residents in this village on the Guatemalan border say relief
has been slow to arrive _ though President Ernesto Zedillo promised
the government is doing its best.
	   ``To assure your supply, we have organized the largest fleet of
military and civilian helicopters ever massed in our history,'' the
president said Monday in the nearby city of Tapachula.
	   The president called for national unity on behalf of the victims
of one of Mexico's worst disasters in memory.
	   ``The emergency situation will last for many more days,''
Zedillo said. ``There are several communities ... where the houses
are filled with mud. We must have people who have not been reported
as dead and we are going to find them.''
	   The Health Secretariat said 90 people have been confirmed dead
in Chiapas. The number of missing is not known. More than a dozen
people also have died in storms elsewhere in Mexico over the past
10 days.
	   ``The primary thing is that you don't die of hunger or thirst,''
Zedillo told victims at a shelter in Acapetagua.
	   Zedillo said the government is trying to supply an average of
250 tons of food, water and medicine daily to the coastal region
swept by flooding _ a region where 1.2 million people live in 5,000
communities.
	   The National Water Commission estimated that in five days last
week the coast received nearly 2 feet of rain, a quarter of the
average annual total for the area.
	   Zedillo told flood victims _ some angry, some weeping _ that no
aid packages would be handed out, a change in policy apparently
instituted in response to charges of political partisanship in aid
distribution after Hurricane Pauline swept the same coast a year
ago.
	   ``The fraud of hidden aid packages will not be allowed. There
are no aid packages. There is food in the community kitchens,''
Zedillo said.
	   Accusations of fraud were already coming from the Zapatista
National Liberation Army, which rebelled in the jungle canyons of
eastern Chiapas in 1994.
	   In a communique that reached reporters on Monday, Zapatista
leader Subcomandante Marcos accused the Chiapas state government of
``a scandalous robbery'' of humanitarian aid, claiming that
donations of food and money were being diverted.
	   He also claimed that some officials were directing aid to
members of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party _
despite Zedillo's calls for Mexicans to rise above partisanship in
confronting the disaster.
	   The army said it expects to be able to patch together undamaged
stretches of highway, nearby dirt roads and provisional bridges
made of drain pipes, about half way up the coast within the next
few days.
	   Electrical power already has been restored to some areas.
	   But the disaster was almost too much to bear for one of Reyes'
neighbors, Isaias Lara.
	   ``It's not fair that after being owners of plantations, we are
going to have to work as peons on farms because the government
offered us aid and did not comply,'' he said, clenching his fists.
	   ``If we were poor,'' he added, ``now we will be poorer.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Houston clinching NL Central, adds late games,
 &UR; National League Capsules &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; Braves beat Phillies 4-2

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Tom Glavine was on hand for Atlanta's first
division title of the 1990s. Appropriately, he played a key role
Monday night when the Braves made it seven in a row.
	   Already the only team with six straight division titles, Atlanta
added another to its collection when Glavine fought through control
problems to become the NL's first 19-game winner, beating the
Philadelphia Phillies 4-2.
	   Chipper Jones homered over the center-field wall leading off the
sixth and after Michael Tucker hit his first homer in over a month
to tie the game 2-2 in the fifth.
	   Glavine (19-6) allowed two runs in six innings, moving within
one victory of his fourth 20-win season. Dennis Martinez, John
Rocker and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched one scoreless inning apiece,
with Ligtenberg earning his 28th save.
	   Division titles have become so routine in Atlanta that the
clinching game drew only 33,367, the second-smallest crowd at
Turner Field since May 28. Even the celebration at the end of the
game seemed routine.
	   Glavine, who allowed eight hits and walked three, and John
Smoltz are the only players remaining from Atlanta's first division
winner of the decade in 1991.
	   The Braves won three consecutive NL West titles before switching
to the East in 1994. That season was halted by a strike, which may
have helped extend Atlanta's streak; Montreal led the division by
six games when play stopped Aug. 12.
	   Since the strike ended the following spring, Atlanta has cruised
to four more division titles.
	   Curt Schilling (14-14) took the loss despite giving up only six
hits and striking out 12 _ his 15th game with double-figure
strikeouts.
 &UR; Mets 7, Astros 4, 13 innings
	   In Houston, the Astros clinched their second straight NL Central
championship despite their 13-inning loss to the New York Mets.
	   The Astros' title was ensured about an hour later when
second-place Chicago lost to San Diego 4-3. The Cubs' defeat
dropped them into a tie with the Mets for the wild-card lead.
	   Brian McRae hit a tying homer in the ninth inning, then hit a
two-run double in the 13th for the Mets. The Astros delayed their
celebration by wasting a late lead for the second straight night.
	   Houston also won division titles in 1980, 1986 and last season.
	   The Mets trailed 4-2 when McRae hit a two-run homer off Astros
relief ace Billy Wagner in the ninth.
	   In the 13th, Edgardo Alfonzo led off with a double and continued
to third when right fielder Derek Bell misplayed the ball for an
error. John Olerud grounded out and Mike Piazza, who had four hits,
was intentionally walked by Mike Magnante (4-7).
	   McRae followed with his go-ahead double off Doug Henry and later
scored on a wild pitch.
	   Greg McMichael (4-4) was the winner. John Franco got his 37th
save, breaking his own team record.
 &UR; Padres 4, Cubs 3
	   In San Diego, Sammy Sosa struck out four times for the first
time this year, cooling off following an amazing weekend in
Chicago, and Ken Caminiti's home run in the eighth inning lifted
the San Diego Padres over the Cubs.
	   The Padres (95-56) pulled within a game of Atlanta and Houston
(96-55) for the NL's best record.
	   The Cubs' loss handed the Astros the NL Central title _ Houston
lost 7-4 in 13 innings to New York, which pulled even with the Cubs
in the NL wild-card race.
	   Caminiti's leadoff homer off Matt Karchner (3-1), his 29th, was
the fourth of the game, all solo shots.
	   Greg Vaughn hit his 49th for the Padres. Glenallen Hill and Jose
Hernandez connected for the Cubs.
	   Sosa came in on a tear, having hit four homers in three games,
including Nos. 61 and 62 on Sunday to catch Mark McGwire in the
race for the most glamorous record in all of sports.
	   Sosa struck out three times against Sterling Hitchcock and once
against Dan Miceli (10-4). Sosa has struck out a major
league-leading 156 times.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for the major league-leading
50th save, making him the fourth pitcher in history to reach 50
saves.
 &UR; Cardinals 7, Pirates 3
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire was back in the lineup. He just
didn't look like a home run king.
	   A day after leaving a game at Houston early because of minor
back spasms, the St. Louis Cardinals' slugger was a quiet 2-for-4,
taking few healthy swings in a win over Pittsburgh.
	   McGwire had a two-run single in a four-run second inning off
Jason Schmidt (11-12). He has just three singles in 18 at-bats in
six games since hitting homer No. 62, and has been caught by Sammy
Sosa.
	   Against Schmidt, McGwire struck out in the first on a checked
swing and grounded out to first on a checked swing in the fourth.
In the sixth, he had a rare single to right off Todd Van Poppel on
another awkward, incomplete swing.
	   As a precaution, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said he won't
use McGwire in both games of Tuesday night's doubleheader against
the Pirates.
	   Jose Jimenez (1-0), making his first career start, held the
Pirates to four hits and one run in seven innings.
 &UR; Brewers 2, Reds 1
	   In Cincinnati, Jeromy Burnitz drove in two runs with his 37th
homer and an RBI double, leading the Milwaukee Brewers over the
Cincinnati Reds.
	   Steve Woodard (10-11), who had lost six straight decisions since
beating St. Louis on Aug. 3, allowed six hits in seven-plus
innings, struck out three and walked one.
	   Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 24th save. After Wickman
walked the bases loaded with one out, Roberto Petagine grounded
into a game-ending double play.
	   Burnitz homered off Pete Harnisch (12-7) with one out in the
second, his second solo home run in two days. In the fourth, his
two-out double scored Dave Nilsson, giving Burnitz a career-high
122 RBIs.
 &UR; Expos 4, Marlins 2
	   In Montreal, Dustin Hermanson won his third straight decision
and Brad Fullmer hit a three-run homer to lead the Montreal Expos
over the Florida Marlins.
	   The Marlins lost for the 16th time in 18 games. Florida leads
the majors with 102 losses.
	   Hermanson (14-10) allowed two runs on five hits in seven
innings. He won for the seventh time in his last eight decisions.
Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 32nd save.
	   Fullmer hit his 12th home run off Brian Meadows (10-12) with two
outs in the sixth and the score tied at 1.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 14, Giants 2
	   In Phoenix, Travis Lee drove in five runs, three with a two-out
double in the second, as Arizona routed San Francisco for its most
one-sided victory.
	   The Giants are 3 1/2 games behind Chicago and New York in the
wild-card race.
	   Arizona had club-record 17 hits. The last one came when Yamil
Benitez hit a high fly ball in the eighth inning that became the
first ever to strike the roof of Bank One Ballpark.
	   Brian Anderson (12-12) scattered seven hits in eight innings.
Shawn Estes (7-11) was pounded for seven runs, eight hits and two
walks in 1 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Rockies 1
	   In Los Angeles, Carlos Perez pitched a seven-hitter for his
third consecutive complete game and Juan Castro scored the go-ahead
run on a three-base error as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the
Colorado Rockies.
	   Perez (10-13) struck out nine and walked one. He had
complete-game victories at Arizona on Sept. 9 and against
Philadelphia on Sept. 2, making him the only Dodgers starter to
throw back-to-back complete games this season.
	   With the game scoreless, Castro led off with a single. Trenidad
Hubbard laid down a bunt in front of the mound and Bobby Jones
(7-8) slid to field it, but his throw sailed past first baseman
Angel Echevarria and Castro scored.
	   Jones injured himself on the play and, after lying on the grass
for five minutes, he was carried off the field.

	   JALAPA, Mexico (AP) _ Two Mexican legal experts said they fear
that letting Mexicans abroad vote in elections could endanger their
country's sovereignty.
	   ``I am against it because 7 million Mexicans resident in the
United States would vote, so they could have the possibility of
determining who would be the next president of Mexico,'' former
Attorney General Jorge Carpizo told a seminar here Monday on the
issue.
	   Mexico's Congress and its Federal Electoral Institute are
discussing ways to let Mexicans vote for the first time while
abroad.
	   But with perhaps 10 percent of Mexico's voting-age population
living abroad, the issue is raising hard questions for a country
where elections are increasingly closely fought.
	   Diego Valades, a former deputy attorney general, said he is
worried that confusion could arise from a recent law allowing
Mexicans to maintain their nationality even while taking foreign
citizenship.
	   That law supposedly does not give dual nationals voting rights,
but Valades indicated it might be difficult to draw the line.
	   ``By chance, now we have the problem not of Mexicans voting
abroad, but of people who have foreign nationality voting in
elections,'' he said.
	   He said that raises ``a grave problem of national sovereignty,
because foreign citizens would be deciding who is our president and
eventually participating in constitutional reforms.''
	   ``We would have the case of numerous members of the U.S. armed
forces of Mexican origin who have acquired our nationality, or who
conserved it, having recently acquired U.S. (citizenship) voting in
Mexican elections.''

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Dwight Gooden won his fifth straight decision
as the Cleveland Indians beat Toronto 6-3 Monday night, keeping the
Blue Jays from closing in the AL wild-card race.
	   Cleveland, seeking its fourth straight AL Central title, reduced
its magic number to three.
	   The Blue Jays entered with 14 wins in their last 17 games but
remained three games behind Boston in the wild-card race.
	   Gooden (8-6) struck out a season-high eight in seven innings and
allowed three runs, six hits and one walk. Mike Jackson pitched the
ninth for his 39th save. Steve Sinclair (0-2) was the loser.
 &UR; Yankees 3, Red Sox 0
	   In New York, Orlando Hernandez (10-4) pitched a three-hitter for
his first shutout. The Red Sox lost for the ninth time in 11 games.
	   Ramon Martinez (18-6) allowed all three runs and seven hits in
seven innings, striking out nine and walking none. Martinez,
winless in three starts, lost to the Yankees last week at Fenway
Park.
 &UR; Angels 4, Devil Rays 2
	   In St Petersburg, Florida, Todd Greene and Garret Anderson hit
RBI doubles during a four-run eighth inning as Anaheim ended a
three-game losing streak and Angels increased their AL West lead to
two games over Texas.
	   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-3) pitched two scoreless relief innings.
Troy Percival pitched a perfect ninth for his 40th save, extending
his own career high.
	   Anaheim won for just the fourth time in 58 games when trailing
after seven innings.
	   Tim Salmon had three hits for Anaheim. Albie Lopez (6-3) took
the loss.
 &UR; Orioles 1, Rangers 0
	   In Baltimore, Pinch-hitter Eric Davis drove in the game's lone
run with an eighth-inning sacrifice fly as Baltimore won its sixth
straight.
	   Juan Guzman pitched seven shutout innings, Alan Mills (3-4)
pitched a perfect eighth and Armando Benitez struck out the side in
the ninth for his 21st save. Xavier Hernandez (6-6) was the loser.
 &UR; Royals 16, Athletics 6
	   In Kansa City, Mike Sweeney and Jeff King hit three-run homers,
and Dean Palmer drove in four runs.
	   Ricky Bones (2-1) relieved Jose Rosado with one out in the
fifth, and Scott Service pitched 2 1-3 innings for his fourth save.
	   The Royals' Jeff King homered for the third straight game,
hitting his 24 of the season off Blake Stein (5-9).
 &UR; Mariners 10, Twins 3
	   In Minneapolis, Mac Suzuki (1-1) got his first major league win
and Russ Davis hit a three-run homer as Seattle dealt Minnesota its
fifth straight loss. Suzuki allowed three runs and five hits in 6
1-3 innings.
	   Edgar Martinez hit his 27th homer, a 412-foot drive off Brad
Radke (11-14). Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the AL with 51 homers,
went 0-for-5.

 &UR; OPEC may cut oil production further over reduced demand

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The president of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said Tuesday that the 11-nation cartel may cut
production further to prop up the falling price of oil products.
	   Facing a glut of oil on world markets and reduced demand because
of the economic crisis in Asia, OPEC ministers might decide to take
further action when they next meet in November, Obaid bin Saif
al-Nasseri said.
	   Given the current situation, ``it might be possible to look for
more cuts,'' al-Nasseri told the Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference.
	   OPEC pledged at its last major meeting in June to cut output by
2.6 million barrels a day in an attempt to drive up flagging oil
prices, which are near 10-year lows. Non-OPEC countries, including
Mexico and Russia, pledged another 500,000 barrels per day in cuts.
	   World oil prices started to plummet last year, dropping from
dlrs 25 per barrel in 1997 to between dlrs 12 and dlrs 14 per
barrel this year, because production had increased while demand _
notably from struggling Asia _ subsided.
	   The move by OPEC to cut production, which took effect on July 1
and has now been mostly implemented, aims at driving the price back
to about dlrs 18 per barrel. It has so far been mostly ineffective.
	   ``The current low oil price environment is unacceptable to our
countries,'' al-Nasseri said.
	   He stressed the significance of the Asian economic debacle for
the current volatility in oil prices, emphasizing that 40 percent
of OPEC crude oil was exported to Asia last year.
	   Al-Nasseri also said that OPEC members had in the past increased
oil production capacity on the assumption that rapid economic
growth in the Asia-Pacific region would continue.
	   But he said the region's energy demand will fall well below
pre-crisis forecast levels.
	   Referring to the United Arab Emirates, of which he is the oil
minister, al-Nasseri said current production levels stand at 2.16
million barrels a day, below capacity and in line with the June
output cut agreement by OPEC.

Cambodian capital calm after agreement on steps to end crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian capital enjoyed a
welcome respite from over a week of violence Tuesday, the day after
rival parties agreed on steps to end the country's political
crisis.
	   All was quiet, with even the street by the U.S. Embassy _ the
unofficial gathering point where anti-government protesters
demanded the ouster of strongman Hun Sen _ virtually empty. No
confrontations were reported elsewhere.
	   Police on Monday had continued to crack down on demonstrators
marching in support of the opposition protests over alleged
election fraud. About 20 people were arrested and several badly
beaten by police.
	   In more than a week of marches, at least four people were killed
by police violence.
	   The agreement calls for the cessation of demonstrations by all
sides, a summit meeting of party leaders hosted by King Norodom
Sihanouk, and the convening of the National Assembly as scheduled
on Sept. 24.
	   In July 26 parliamentary elections, Hun Sen won a majority of
seats in the assembly, but did not gain the two-thirds necessary to
form a new government.
	   The opposition had said it would boycott the assembly _ leaving
the country with no legal government _ if its complaints about
election fraud were not taken seriously. Hun Sen-appointed election
bodies have dismissed almost all election protests.
	   The agreement was brokered by Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra, who met Monday in the capital with ruling
party and opposition leaders as well as U.N. officials. He had met
Sunday with King Sihanouk in the northwestern town of Siem Reap,
and took on a role of informal mediator.
	   A letter from Sukhumbhand to Chea Sim, president of the
Cambodian People's Party, said that opposition leaders Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy had accepted Chea Sim's
three-point proposal.
	   But it seemed to indicate that the agreement was conditional on
the assurance by the government of `the safety, freedom of movement
and freedom from arrest and detention of all parties.''
	   The government has banned several dozen opposition figures from
leaving the country, despite constitutional guarantees of freedom
of movement.
	   Ranariddh's opposition FUNCINPEC party has complained it is
difficult for them to negotiate with the government when the travel
ban puts them in the position of ``hostages.''
	   The excuse for imposing the ban was the suspected involvement of
opposition figures in a Sept. 7 grenade attack on Hun Sen's home.
He was not there and no one was hurt. Opposition leaders accused
him of staging it himself as a pretext to crack down on what had
been weeks of relatively peaceful protest.
	   There are several other potential roadblocks to implementing the
agreement, including how spoiled and unused ballots should be
accounted for and an explanation of a controversial formula for
allocating parliamentary seats.
	   It is also uncertain if the opposition parties can actually
control anti-government street protests. Sentiment against
strongman Hun Sen runs deep in the capital, and has been
intensified by police brutality.
	   Even after Ranariddh called for an end to demonstrations Monday
afternoon, a crowd of about 400 people took to the streets, with
participants claiming they were not aligned with any party.
	   The march was broken up when about 50 policemen arrived on
trucks, arresting one person and sending the others fleeing. One
man was badly beaten and was taken for medical treatment by human
rights workers.
	   Club-swinging riot police dispersed a separate Monday morning
march of about 1,500 people.

	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ A Dutch charter plane carrying 282
people was forced to make an emergency return to Calgary
International Airport when one of its engines apparently exploded
upon takeoff.
	   There were no injuries reported among the 272 passengers and 10
crew of the Boeing 767 operated by Martinair, a charter airline
based in Amsterdam.
	   Calgary residents who heard the blast and saw flames streaming
from the aircraft jammed emergency phone lines to report the
incident.
	   ``It was a pretty solid bang,'' said Bruce England, a printer at
the Calgary Sun, who watched a trail of smoke pouring from the
right engine and then heard a pop as flames burst out. After the
explosion, the plane stopped climbing, he said.
	   Crew on the plane, which was en route to Amsterdam, called
Calgary's air traffic tower shortly after takeoff at 7:40 p.m.
Monday to report engine trouble.
	   The pilots managed to extinguish the blaze by shutting down the
right engine of the two-engine jet.
	   Martinair spokesman Chris Richardson did not know if the engine
had caught fire. Richardson said there was no smoke in the cabin.
	   ``The crew said the instruments showed the engine wasn't
operating properly and I didn't ask them any questions,'' he said.
	   ``I am told there was no panic in the cabin. It may have been an
overheated engine and the crew may have said that but certainly I
don't know of any fire.''
	   The jet did not dump any fuel during the 35 minutes it was in
the air, Richardson said.
	   ``It was a very, very controlled situation,'' he added.
	   The pilots brought the plane down safely on the airport's
longest primary runway at 8:14 p.m. Three tires were flattened
during the process.
	   ``The landing was picture-perfect,'' said Wayne Reimer, duty
manager for the Calgary Airport Authority.
	   The passengers were bused to the terminal afterward.
	   Martinair officials were inspecting the plane late Monday night.
	   The aborted flight comes less than two weeks after Swissair
Flight 111 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off Peggy's Cove, Nova
Scotia, killing all 229 on board.
	   Electrical problems are believed to have contributed to the
crash of the McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 widebody on Sept. 2. The pilot
reported cockpit smoke before his systems failed.

 &UR; OPEC may cut oil production further over reduced demand
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in graf 3 that al-Nasseri was speaking to reporters,
in graf 7 to the conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The president of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said Tuesday that the 11-nation cartel may cut
production further to prop up the falling price of oil products.
	   Facing a glut of oil on world markets and reduced demand because
of the economic crisis in Asia, OPEC ministers might decide to take
further action when they next meet in November, Obaid bin Saif
al-Nasseri said.
	   Given the current situation, ``it might be possible to look for
more cuts,'' al-Nasseri told reporters while attending the
Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference.
	   OPEC pledged at its last major meeting in June to cut output by
2.6 million barrels a day in an attempt to drive up flagging oil
prices, which are near 10-year lows. Non-OPEC countries, including
Mexico and Russia, pledged another 500,000 barrels per day in cuts.
	   World oil prices started to plummet last year, dropping from
dlrs 25 per barrel in 1997 to between dlrs 12 and dlrs 14 per
barrel this year, because production had increased while demand _
notably from struggling Asia _ subsided.
	   The move by OPEC to cut production, which took effect on July 1
and has now been mostly implemented, aims at driving the price back
to about dlrs 18 per barrel. It has so far been mostly ineffective.
	   ``The current low oil price environment is unacceptable to our
countries,'' al-Nasseri said said in his speech to the conference.
	   He stressed the significance of the Asian economic debacle for
the current volatility in oil prices, emphasizing that 40 percent
of OPEC crude oil was exported to Asia last year.
	   Al-Nasseri also said that OPEC members had in the past increased
oil production capacity on the assumption that rapid economic
growth in the Asia-Pacific region would continue.
	   But he said the region's energy demand will fall well below
pre-crisis forecast levels.
	   Referring to the United Arab Emirates, of which he is the oil
minister, al-Nasseri said current production levels stand at 2.16
million barrels a day, below capacity and in line with the June
output cut agreement by OPEC.

Weather foils rescuers searching for plane crash survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with search called off until weather breaks in 6th
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Low clouds and wind gusts
hampered for a second day Tuesday search and rescue efforts to
reach a tourist flight which crashed on a glacier peak on New
Zealand's South Island, authorities said.
	   Rescue coordinators still hoped that the missing trio, a New
Zealand pilot and two middle-aged Japanese women, were surviving
freezing temperatures by using emergency equipment on board the
plane.
	   The names of the pilot and the two tourists, have not been
released.
	   Police Sgt. Noel Brown said emergency locator beacon signals had
helped pinpoint the plane's crash site at about 10,800 feet (3,300
meters), on the side of the Rudolph Glacier, north of Mount Cook.
	   Fluctuating weather conditions Monday and early Tuesday grounded
helicopters and prevented a team of specialist alpine rescuers from
reaching the area, 280 miles (450 kms) southwest of Wellington.
	   Later Tuesday, authorities said the search had been called off
until there was a break in the weather, possibly around midday
Wednesday.
	   The alpine guides were airlifted onto the eastern side of the
glacier at about 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) but were forced back by
wind-driven snow, low clouds, gusting winds and poor visibility,
Brown said.
	   Four helicopters were involved in the search, but the
fluctuating weather conditions meant they could operate for brief
periods only, said Emma Peel, spokeswoman for the National Rescue
Coordination Center.
	   Planes flying in alpine regions are required to carry emergency
equipment including rescue blankets, clothing, shovels, dried food
and a cooker, and it was possible for the missing trio to survive,
said Brown.
	   The rescue center continued to receive intermittent readings of
signals from the emergency beacon, which was still active. Normally
a beacon has enough power to run for four to five days.

Malaysia to freeze trading of its stocks in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 1-4 to note that Singapore had already
extended trading until Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Trading of all Malaysian stocks on
Singapore's over-the-counter market will be frozen at the end of
trading Tuesday, Malaysia's stock exchange announced.
	   ``No transactions or transfers whatsoever will be allowed in
respect of the accounts,'' the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange said in
a statement.
	   Singapore authorities had planned to end trading in the stocks
last Friday, but extended the deadline until this Tuesday to allow
local investors to transfer their holdings into U.S. dollars or to
accounts in Malaysia.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Singapore Stock
Exchange to the Malaysian statement.
	   Malaysia had previously said it would no longer allow trading of
its stocks in Singapore, where they make up about 90 percent of the
republic's over-the-counter market. Stock exchanges of the two
countries had not agreed on how the Malaysian securities were to be
transferred to a central depository in Kuala Lumpur, but the
Singapore exchange said it was working on the arrangements.
	   In the meantime, the value of the stocks in Singapore dived, and
some investors lost hundreds of thousands of Singapore dollars
before Singapore authorities suspended the trading of
over-the-counter Malaysian stocks on Sept. 4.
	   They allowed trading in the shares to resume this week, until
Friday, to allow accounts to be closed out.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange statement said that all
Malaysian shares held in the accounts of brokers would no longer be
valid until a final agreement is reached on how the shares will be
transferred.
	   The Malaysian authorities are bringing all trading of Malaysian
securities onshore as a way of closing any loopholes resulting from
the Sept. 1 introduction of sweeping capital controls.
	   Those curbs prohibited offshore trading of the Malaysian
currency, effectively pegging the ringgit at 3.80 to the U.S.
dollar.

Australia's Labor would appoint a special envoy on East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Labor Party would appoint
a special envoy to advance the cause of self determination in East
Timor if elected at Oct. 3 national elections, foreign affairs
spokesman Laurie Brereton said Tuesday.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it in 1976. Australia is the only country recognizing
Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. The United Nations does
not.
	   Brereton said he welcomed recent developments on East Timor
including talks between Indonesia and Portugal. He also praised
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's government for new openness on
the issue.
	   But any approach to the situation had to recognize the
continuing right of the East Timorese people to self determination,
Brereton said.
	   The appointment of a special envoy was contained in Labor's
human rights policy for the elections, released Tuesday.
	   Asked by a reporter if former Labor prime minister Paul Keating
had the right credentials, Brereton said he would not discuss
possible candidates unless Labor is elected.
	   He said that if elected, Labor would also appoint a special
ambassador for human rights and impose trade and investment
sanctions on the military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Labor did not consider that these steps amounted to interference
in the internal affairs of other countries, Brereton said.
	   He said he accepted that Australia should also be subject to
scrutiny of its human rights performance, particularly in its
treatment of the country's 386,000 Aborigines, who are now a small
minority in a mostly white population of more than 18 million.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police negotiating with rebels; Rally scheduled
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, in the wake of armed
clashes on Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted. And it urged armed
Berisha supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party
headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   One of the tanks was parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands.
	   Police were negotiating with the armed Berisha supporters,
trying to convince them to hand over at least their heavy weapons,
said the statement.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened arrest by the government, has called for the Socialist
government to resign, but insists he is not plotting a takeover .
	   ``These people who are in a great panic are inventing such
things as a coup, and I never attempted and never will attempt''
it, he told CNN late Monday, responding to authorities'
accusations.
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis in the
continent's poorest nation. Many fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday the Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would
try to arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But the 53-year-old Berisha said he would never leave Albania.
	   He said the building takeovers were simply his supporters'
reaction to the slaying of well-known opposition legislator Azem
Hajdari, who was gunned down along with a bodyguard Saturday in
front of party headquarters. Berisha blames his rival Nano.
	   Dan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the U.S. and European
envoys had sent a signal that the Democratic Party had ``gone too
far.''
	   In Washington Monday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
condemned the use of violence both by government and insurgent
forces, but emphasized the United States would not recognize a
government that came to power through violent means. Washington has
backed Nano's efforts at reform.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ More than 180 feet (54 meters) under
the ocean surface, the jagged edges of a mangled airplane and the
broken bodies of its victims greet the navy divers who are combing
the seabed off Peggy's Cove.
	   Mixed among the electrical cables, landing gear and fuselage of
Swissair Flight 111 are reminders of the 229 people who died so
violently there on Sept. 2 _ suitcases, wallets, a child's ``Lion
King'' puppet.
	   ``It was like you were standing in the middle of a landfill.
There was just stuff everywhere,'' said Marcel Maynard, a Canadian
navy diver who helped retrieve the jet's flight data recorder. ``It
was just busted up so much it didn't look like an airplane.''
	   The murky waters envelop the wreckage like the fog that hovers
over the Nova Scotia coast, giving divers views of 40 or 50 feet
(12 or 15 meters) at best. At such depths, things appear in
black-and-white. Fish don't seem much interested.
	   The largest sections of the MD-11 are about 50 feet (15 meters)
long, Maynard said. From what he's seen, all the plane's windows
were smashed.
	   Also hidden in the gloom _ a treasure trove worth millions. The
valuables, including diamonds, jewels, millions of dollars in cash
and a Picasso painting worth an estimated dlrs 1.5 million were on
their way to Geneva when the jet crashed into the Atlantic,
Swissair said Monday.
	   There are more than 200 American and Canadian divers on the
site, and they descend to the gruesome depths in pairs of two.
	   They spend long hours preparing for the descent into the frigid
waters, studying sonar scans of the sites below and dressing in
dual-layer wetsuits that pump 170-degree Fahrenheit water around
their bodies. They wear large helmets reminiscent of B-grade
science fiction movies.
	   Some say a ``Hail Mary'' before they head down, said Lt.
Commander Jacques Fauteux, a Canadian navy spokesman.
	   The actual descent, by an elevator, takes just five minutes. The
divers pass through currents that swirl objects around them _ human
remains, pieces of wreckage.
	   Breathing a mixture of helium and oxygen through umbilical-like
cords, the divers can spend 30 to 35 minutes on the bottom, being
careful that their cords don't get tangled in the wreckage.
	   They talk to their colleagues on the ships by radio, but a
special scrambler must decode their high-pitched, helium-fed
voices.
	   The divers can cover 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 meters) in each
mission, not much considering the wreck covers at least a square
mile (2.6 square kilometers) of ocean floor.
	   Their ascent must be done slowly, taking about 40 minutes, to
prevent the ``bends,'' a dangerous ailment caused by sudden changes
in pressure when divers return to the surface. Back on the ship,
the divers spend more than an hour in a decompression chamber.
	   During their missions, known as ``Operation Persistence,'' they
carry mesh bags to fill with whatever they find: human remains and
personal effects.
	   A few days ago, some divers retrieved a wallet. Inside was a
photograph of a man and a boy, the boy wearing a child's cowboy
hat.
	   ``These guys are tough, and are doing an incredibly tough job, a
hard job, but they all have soft spots,'' Fauteux said, speaking by
telephone from the ship on Monday. ``It's like a 2-by-4 (board)
that you feel straight in the eyes when you see that (picture).''
	   Maynard, 34, didn't want to talk much about what he saw _ the
worst in his experience. Helping the families identify their loved
ones makes the job easier, he said.
	   ``I feel we're supplying a service to find out what exactly
happened and hopefully this won't happen again,'' he said.
	   Authorities say they won't begin hoisting large chunks of the
plane until the human remains are removed, and divers have been
told it could take months to clear the crash site completely.
	   ``We don't want to treat them like a piece of wreckage,'' said
Lt. John Oliveira, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy, which mans the
salvage vessel USS Grapple.

Shiite Mosque set ablaze by Sunni militants in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Scores of Sunni Muslim militants set
ablaze a Muslim mosque close to Islamabad on Tuesday, the latest
violence between rival Islamic groups, police said.
	   No one was injured.
	   Militant Sunni Muslims belonging to Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians
of the Friends of the Prophet, attacked the Shiite mosque in Wah
Town, some 40 kilometers (24 miles) west of Islamabad, local police

Canada keeps its perfect synchronized swimming record intact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jacinthe Taillon and Kasia Kulesza
won the duet gold medal Tuesday, leaving Canadian synchronized
swimmers still unbeaten since their sport became part of the
Commonwealth Games in 1986.
	   The Canadian pair received marks of between 9.3 and 9.6 for both
technique and artistry in Tuesday's free routine, amassing a total
of 93.824 points.
	   Australian Naomi Young won her second silver medal in these
games, joining with Irena Olevsky for a score of 91.077. Young also
had finished second Monday in the solo event, behind Canada's
Valerie Hould-Marchand.
	   The Australians received marks between 8.9 and 9.6.
	   English swimmers Katherine Hooper and Adele Carlsen won the
bronze with 87.130.
	   Both the Canadian duet swimmers are university students in
Montreal. Kulesza, 22, competed for her native Poland in the 1990
world junior championships and won one gold and two silvers for
Canada in the 1993 world juniors. She also was a champion fencer in
Quebec.

In China, no one can miss appeal for money for flood victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Students at Beijing No. 27 Middle School wasted
no time mulling over how best to help the millions of people whose
homes were destroyed in China's worst flooding in decades.
	   By the second day of school, they were lugging in bundles of
quilts and clothes, adding their small share to an enormous
outpouring of help from Chinese in all walks of life.
	   Improved living standards in recent years mean that many Chinese
have at least a little extra to give to those in need.
	   But not all the giving is voluntary. Although the government no
longer allocates all resources, it can still exert pressure on
those who draw their salaries from government factories and
institutions.
	   All donations from the No. 27 Middle School were voluntary,
teacher Zhao Qunqing said cheerfully as she helped haul cardboard
boxes full of clothing and quilts to a government drop-off center.
	   ``Most are new things, but the used items are all still very
nice,'' she said.
	   When news media were besieged this summer by people asking how
to help, the Ministry of Civil Affairs organized collection
stations and hotlines, said ministry spokesman Ge Changrong.
	   When school started, teachers asked children to get involved.
	   ``My son said, `Dad, I need money to send to the kids in the
flooded areas,''' Ge said.
	   Because China does not have a strong system of independent
charities, the donation drive is largely government-run. Apart from
the Ministry of Civil Affairs, only the Chinese chapter of the Red
Cross and the China Charity Federation are authorized to collect
funds at donation boxes.
	   With corruption and crime rampant, Chinese are wary of scams. Ge
said the government had guidelines to ensure that donations go to
the needy, including oversight by lower-level officials,
investigative reporting by the government-controlled media and
prosecution of those caught filching.
	   The government estimated that donations reached about 1 billion
yuan (dlrs 120 million) by the end of August. But even that, added
to the government's direct assistance, has fallen far short of what
is needed, ministry officials said.
	   Facing the huge cost of feeding and sheltering millions of
homeless people, some officials have resorted to stronger tactics.
	   At ``mobilization meetings,'' a throwback to the mass movements
of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong's day, government employees were
summoned to hear reports about the floods and urged to contribute.
	   If everyone gave ``fen by fen'' _ change worth about one-tenth
of a cent _ ``the total amount will be tremendous,'' the People's
Daily said in a front-page commentary.
	   Officials in the town of Jingzhou, an area ravaged by Yangtze
River flooding, were told to donate between half and all of their
August salaries, state media reported. Soldiers also have given
part of their meager pay.
	   Workers at a hotel in south China had about 8 percent of their
salaries deducted for flood relief, a hotel spokeswoman said.
Hotels in Guangxi and Shanghai have charged a tax on room rates
since last year for flood relief.
	   The Xinmin Evening News carried a photo showing prisoners in
central Henan province pushing donations through the bars of a cell
as guards looked on.
	   ``When one part has hardship, eight parts help,'' President
Jiang Zemin and officials down through the ranks have proclaimed,
using an old saying.
	   As Jiang toured flood zones recently, people who had received
help after they were washed out of their homes showered him with
thanks, state television news reported.
	   Aid channeled through the government proves ``that under
socialism we're one big family,'' one woman told the president.

Singapore government confirms Leeson appeal denied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Singapore government confirmed Tuesday that
it has denied an appeal for the early release of ailing rogue
trader Nick Leeson, jailed for fraud and forgery in connection with
the 1995 collapse of Barings Bank.
	   ``This is to confirm that the appeal for the early release of
Mr. Leeson has been carefully considered and that Mr. Leeson's
current medical condition does not warrant the grant of early
release,'' said a statement from Singapore's Prisons Department.
	   Leeson, serving a 6{ year term at Changi Prison, is suffering
from colon cancer. Doctors operated to remove the tumor last month,
and have given him a 70 percent chance of recovery.
	   He was seeking release on compassionate grounds, which required
approval by Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong.
	   Leeson's lawyer in London said the Singapore authorities had
informed him about the decision by fax Monday morning.
	   ``Although this decision was not unexpected, it is very
disappointing,'' said Stephen Pollard, who is not in contact with
Leeson but plans to visit him in jail at the end of September.
	   In a statement issued through Pollard, Leeson's sister Sarah
said: ``We are all upset that we will not be able to look after
Nick over the coming months and we send him all our love.''
	   Leeson made unauthorized futures deals worth millions of dollars
from his base in Singapore, leading to the collapse of Britain's
oldest bank.

Year 2000 computer glitch low on list of Russian priorities
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has the world's second largest arsenal of
nuclear weapons and perhaps a dozen decaying nuclear reactors. No
one appears to know what will happen when the clocks on aging
Soviet-era computers that control them click over from 1999 to
2000.
	   Despite the possible dangers, Russia has been dragging its feet
in confronting the so-called millennium bug.
	   ``Compared with other countries, I must say we are behind,''
said Alexander Krupnov, chairman of Russia's Central
Telecommunications Commission, which has just been assigned to work
on the computer problem that many countries began tackling several
years ago.
	   Even Krupnov isn't quite sure how much of a danger Russia faces,
or where it's going to get the hundreds of millions of dollars
needed to fix critical systems.
	   Consumed by pressing day-to-day problems and grappling with
economic crisis, Russia's government has paid scant attention to
potential failures in computers and embedded circuits that could
now be fewer than 500 days away.
	   The millennium bug threatens all computer software and chips
that, to save programming space, use just the last two digits to
designate a year. When 2000 arrives, many computers won't know if
it's 2000 or 1900, which could cause them to go haywire.
	   Analysts say Russia's most vulnerable systems are in its aging
nuclear plants and defense systems. Information about those
computers is secret, and predictions about whether failures can be
expected are varied and probably unreliable.
	   One thing is clear. The people who oversee these sectors don't
seem concerned.
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman, who refused to give his name, said
he knew about the millennium bug. As for the ministry's efforts, he
gave a Soviet-style response: ``We're working on it, but I can't
give you the details.''
	   In June, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a
congressional hearing in Washington that he was concerned Russia
had no program for determining whether its ``fragile'' nuclear
missile early warning system might be crippled by the bug.
	   Igor Sergeyev, Russia's defense minister, was asked about the
issue during a news conference in August. His answer was nothing
short of confusing.
	   ``This problem mostly affects sectors where they use
conventional computer technologies. There is no such danger, since
in the Strategic Missile Forces we use special technologies,'' he
said, without offering details.
	   An errant missile launch against the United States brought on by
a computer clock failure would be highly improbable because
Russia's nuclear weapons can't be unleashed by machines alone. But
computer snags could gum up related systems, such as radar and
telecommunications networks, said Ron Piasecki, an American
consultant who has worked extensively with the U.S. government on
the millennium bug.
	   Warning systems at nuclear power plants could also be affected,
Piasecki said. Yet that possibility doesn't seem to bother Russian
nuclear officials.
	   ``We're taking measures, but we're going to deal with the
problem when we get to the year 2000,'' said Vladislav Petrov, a
spokesman for Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry.
	   Despite such nonchalance, increased pressure from the West is
beginning to show results.
	   In July, the Central Telecommunications Commission released
guidelines to help government departments prepare. And then-Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko discussed it during a visit by U.S. Vice
President Al Gore in July.
	   Still, for a country with so many sensitive computer systems,
Russia has no systematic plan of attack. The commission's
checklist, for example, primarily helps government agencies
understand how vulnerable they are. It doesn't tell them what to do
about it.
	   Russian businesses also seem to be moving slowly.
	   In a survey of 50 Russian companies by the international
consulting firm Coopers and Lybrand, only a third said they were
even aware of the problem.
	   Some Russians believe the nation's financial and banking systems
are better off than those in the West because the Russian computers
are more up-to-date than many of those running Western exchanges.
	   As a whole, Russia's economic woes mean it hasn't had the cash
to become as technology-dependent as some Western countries.
	   ``Businessmen don't know about it,'' said Alexander Grek, a
columnist for Expert magazine, who says hardly any Russian
journalists have written about it. ``But the problem is much less
serious here than for Western countries because Russia is not as
strongly computerized.''

Ghana protests boxing decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ghana sports officials lodged an
official complaint against boxing judges who declared South African
Phumzile Matyhila the winner over Ghana's Abdulai Amidu in the
Commonwealth Games flyweight quarterfinals Tuesday.
	   ``This is a lie. This is useless,'' screamed team manager A.K.
Johnson, jumping in anger.
	   Matyhila was awarded the victory by a single point, 16-15.
	   Ghana officials then drew up their protest letter, which had to
be accompanied by a dlrs 100 protest fee.
	   ``You saw the fight. We clearly won,'' said Coach Miguel Perez
Castellaous, shaking his head in disbelief.
	   ``It's a bad result. It's even worse for my boxer. He's young
and full of high spirits,'' said the Cuban, who has coached Ghana's
boxers for three years.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, in the wake of armed
clashes on Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted. And it urged armed
Berisha supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party
headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   One of the tanks was parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   Police were negotiating with the armed Berisha supporters,
trying to convince them to hand over at least their heavy weapons,
said the statement.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday near the building
remained closed. Dozens of vans sped through downtown Tirana
carrying armed police, some wearing stocking masks.
	   The Democratic Party headquarters is less than 500 meters
(yards) away from Skanderbeg Square, site of the planned rally.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ In an attempt to prevent new violence,
the Albanian government banned an opposition rally on Tuesday and
ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and

of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in

	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14

	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, looters broke
into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city, firing in the
air.
	   One of the tanks was parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened arrest by the government, has called for the Socialist
government to resign, but insists he is not plotting a takeover .
	   ``These people who are in a great panic are inventing such
things as a coup, and I never attempted and never will attempt''
it, he told CNN late Monday, responding to authorities'
accusations.
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis in the
continent's poorest nation. Many fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday the Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would
try to arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But the 53-year-old Berisha said he would never leave Albania.
	   He said the building takeovers were simply his supporters'
reaction to the slaying of well-known opposition legislator Azem
Hajdari, who was gunned down along with a bodyguard Saturday in
front of party headquarters. Berisha blames his rival Nano.
	   Dan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the U.S. and European
envoys had sent a signal that the Democratic Party had ``gone too
far.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
condemned the use of violence both by government and insurgent
forces, but emphasized the United States would not recognize a
government that came to power through violent means. Washington has
backed Nano's efforts at reform.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.

Group appeals for detained Chinese reporter's release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An international press freedom group called on
China's president Tuesday to release a detained Chinese journalist
who has championed the cause of political reform.
	   Shi Binhai's arrest shows ``the severe constraints on
journalists in China,'' the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists said in a letter to President Jiang Zemin.
	   State security agents took Shi from his home in Beijing on Sept.
5. They confiscated notebooks, name cards and other materials. His
family has been given no explanation for the arrest nor told where
Shi is being held.
	   An editor with the China Economic Times, a reformist newspaper
with loose connections to China's State Council, or government, the
36-year-old Shi also helped compile the popular book ``Political
China: Facing the Era of Choosing a New Structure.''
	   The Committee to Protect Journalists said unnamed sources in
China were worried Shi's arrest was the result of his work on the
book. The collection of 39 essays by journalists, academics and
former officials addressed the need for changing China's political
structure.
	   While a reporter for the Shanghai Law Monthly, Shi ran afoul of
the authorities by taking part in student-led democracy
demonstrations in 1989. Arrested in the nationwide crackdown he
spent two years in prison and government-backed media reports in
Hong Kong branded him an ``agitator.''
	   The committee also noted that Shi's arrest came three days after
security agents detained a freelance producer for the U.S.
television network CBS. Natalie Liu was released after two days and
has since left China to rejoin her husband in the United States.
	   Considering the treatment given Shi and Liu, the committee drew
a bleak picture of the pressures Chinese journalists face.
	   ``With a government-controlled press and little access to due
process and the rule of law, reporters and editors routinely face
the threat of arbitrary arrest and detention as a consequence of
their work,'' the committee said.
	   The letter was the second appeal on Shi's behalf in two days.
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (Reporters sans frontieres)
sent a letter of protest to Jiang on Monday.

Good aim could make shooters rich

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A world record could be especially
rewarding for Malaysian shooters in the Commonwealth Games.
	   The City Bayview Hotel in Langkawi, site of the shooting
competition, says it will give 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,600) to any
Malaysian shooter who breaks a world mark.
	   ``The contribution hopefully will encourage our shooters to
fight for more medals for Malaysia,'' said Lee Kun Seong, the
hotel's general manager.
	   Malaysian shooters who break a Commonwealth Games record will be
given 1,000 ringgit (dlrs 260), he added.
	   The hotel is also offering gold medal winners three nights in a
suite.
	   Most shooters and officials in Langkawi are staying at the
Bayview Hotel.

	   BOLDON THE BOWLER? _ Imagine sprint star Ato Boldon as a
fearsome fast bowler _ running in at speed with a cricket ball in
his hand.
	   It might happen.
	   Boldon, the world 200-meter champion who has his eyes on a world
record in the 100 here, is from the cricket-loving island of
Trinidad, birthplace of West Indian team captain Brian Lara.
	   ``I'm going to watch the cricket,'' the sprinter said when asked
what he might do while he's preparing for Wednesday's heats.
``That's a good place to hang out all day.
	   ``I think that if I weren't running I'd take up cricket,'' he
said. ``It seems to me that you don't have to expend much energy
playing cricket compared with other sports.
	   ``And Brian Lara is a good friend of mine.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JUST FOR FUN: Australian coach Richard Charlesworth has defended
the worth of the Commonwealth Games women's field hockey tournament
after a string of lopsided victories by his world champion team.
	   The Australian women have scored 29 goals in just three
preliminary round matches and have scarcely looked like conceding
one, trouncing Scotland 6-0, Malaysia 11-0 and Jamaica 12-0.
	   In about 170 matches of world hockey dominance under
Charlesworth, the team had only once previously scored double
figures because it usually plays only other strong teams.
	   Even Charlesworth admitted one of the problems for his side at
the games was trying to find purpose in such one-sided contests.
	   ``I think there is value in that it is an Olympic-like
experience for us where we have to live in a village, rely on buses
to get around, eat canteen-style food and have all the other
distractions around,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SCORING REMINDERS: The official scoreboard is keeping Indian
field hockey forward Pritam Rani's heart warm.
	   The word ``Swatch'' blazing on the electronic scoreboards
reminds her of her fiancee, Kuldeep Swatch, back home in northern
India.
	   She is happier when she scores because her name goes up on the
board along with ``Swatch.''
	   The 21-year-old is going to marry Swatch soon but continue her
hockey career as well as keeping her job with the Indian Railways.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with scene at party headquarters; UPDATES with police
negotiating with rebel. Rally scheduled for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to prevent new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to resistance from supporters of
former President Sali Berisha, after armed clashes Monday between
them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted. And it urged armed
Berisha supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party
headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   One of the tanks was parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   Police were negotiating with the armed Berisha supporters,
trying to convince them to hand over at least their heavy weapons,
said the statement.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday near the building
remained closed. Dozens of vans sped through downtown Tirana
carrying armed police, some wearing stocking masks.
	   The Democratic Party headquarters is less than 500 meters
(yards) away from Skanderbeg Square, site of the planned rally.

Love for India draws Malaysians in droves at India-Australia match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The good news: a record 2,000
people packed the stands at the Australia-India cricket match
Tuesday. The bad news: many of them had not the faintest idea how
cricket is played.
	   Apart from a handful of expatriate Indians and Australians,
ethnic Indian Malaysians paid between 30 and 100 ringgits (dlrs 8
and dlrs 25) to watch the match.
	   They were drawn largely by their fascination for all things
Indian and a deep-rooted loyalty for the country that their
grandfathers and great grandfathers had left decades ago to settle
in Malaya, as Malaysia was then known.
	   The crowd may have missed the finer points of Aussie captain
Steve Waugh's fluent cover drives in his unbeaten century. But the
cheers at medium pacer Debashish Mohanty's dismissal of the
opposition's top order were as loud as as they would have been in
India.
	   ``We are Indians. We always go back to our roots,'' said Amy
D'cruz, the media manager at the grounds who was introduced to
cricket when she was at university in India in 1978. ``I learned to
appreciate the game. I learned to love the game in India,'' said
D'cruz whose great grandfather came to Malaysia from southern India
in the 1930s.
	   Like D'cruz, most of the workers and volunteers at the seven
grounds where the cricket competitions are being held are Indians.
	   Indians form about 10 percent of Malaysia's 18 million people
but cricket never was a popular sport in a country more used to
badminton and soccer. A little cricket is played in schools, only
by Indians, said Thomas Matthew who played for Malaysia in the ICC
Trophy matches in Kenya in 1995 and in Malaysia in 1997.
	   The ICC games gave a little publicity to the sport among
Malaysians in as much as making them aware of cricketing greats
such as India's Sachin Tendulkar. Matthew said even some Malays and
Chinese, the dominant communities, have start playing the game now.
	   When Tendulkar took over to bowl his gentle medium pacers on
Tuesday, the crowd was up on its feet.
	   ``I just found out who Sachin is,'' exclaimed Shameela Chandran,
18, who came with five friends who are a little more familiar with
cricket.
	   Asked who she is backing, Chandran said: ``India of course!''
	   Why?
	   ``Because I am an Indian,'' said the biology student, a third
generation Indian.
	   No other match in the previous preliminary rounds at the
Commonwealth Games had attracted such an attendance.
	   The patron of Malayasian cricket is King Tuanku Jaafar Abdul
Rahman's son Tuanku Imran. He had pressed for cricket being
introduced for the first time at the Commonwealth Games.
	   On Tuesday, the king arrived with little fanfare to see the
match from an open air pavilion, sitting on a high backed yellow
cushioned chair.
	   The crowd, however, had one complaint: the names of the players
_ many of them youngsters and not well known _ were not stenciled
on their shirt backs as is the practice in professional matches
	   ``It is so difficult for us to identify them,'' said Dr.
Jayashree Pillai who drove from the eastern city of Kuala Trengannu
for seven hours to see the match.
	   ``I closed my clinic, I drove all night long and I can't even
identify the blokes.''

Shiite Mosque set ablaze by Sunni militants in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Scores of Sunni Muslim militants set
ablaze a Shiite Muslim mosque close to Islamabad, the latest
violence between rival Islamic groups, police said Tuesday.
	   No one was injured.
	   Militant Sunni Muslims belonging to Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians
of the Friends of the Prophet, on Monday attacked the Shiite mosque
in Wah Town, some 40 kilometers (24 miles) west of Islamabad, local
police officials said. Three houses were also torched.
	   The militants, shouting slogans against Shiites, surrounded the
mosque before setting it on fire, partially destroying it, police
said.
	   The attack came two days after four gunmen shot and killed a
Sunni Muslim leader and three of his companions in Islamabad.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in feuding
between the rival Islamic sects in Pakistan. Most Pakistanis are
Sunni Muslims but they generally get along with their Shiite
brethren. However extremist groups from both sects often clash.
	   Sunni groups blame Iran for helping the Shiite extremists, while
Shiite groups accuse Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant
organizations. Both countries deny the allegations.

Olympic gold-medal diver Fu Mingxia eyes World University Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Three-time Olympic gold-medal diver Fu Mingxia
has resumed training, but not for the 2000 Olympics, China's
official Xinhua News agency reported Tuesday.
	   Fu, who retired after taking two golds in Atlanta in 1996 and
started studying at elite Qinghua University, is training for the
World University Games in 1999 and 2001, Xinhua said.
	   ``I'm a student of Qinghua University. I have the responsibility
to dive for her,'' Xinhua quoted the 20-year-old Fu as saying. ``So
far I have not thought about the Sydney Olympic Games.''
	   Physically and emotionally exhausted after Atlanta, Fu stopped
training for nearly two years but returned to the pool in July,
Xinhua said.
	   Diving for Qinghua at the World University Games would reunite
Fu with former national coach Yu Fen, who coached Fu to Olympic
stardom, Xinhua said. Fu won golds for the platform and springboard
in Atlanta and for the platform in Barcelona in 1992, at age 14.
	   But Xinhua noted that after Atlanta Fu and Yu had a falling out
over prize money and ``have not been on very good terms since.''

Sculptures of Thai politicians removed from Buddhist temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Limestone sculptures of leading Thai
politicians have been removed from a Buddhist temple in Bangkok
after complaints from supporters of some of the politicians, the
temple's abbot said Tuesday.
	   ``For the sake of the temple's peace, I ordered the removal of
the three figures. We as Buddhist monks, do not wish to be in the
center of political arguments,'' Phra Sophon Dharmmawongse, the
abbot of Wat In temple, told The Associated Press.
	   He said his temple had been flooded with anonymous telephone
calls complaining that it was improper to allow the sculptures on
the temple grounds.
	   Some opposition members have even accused the government of
creating the sculptures to use black magic against its opponents.
	   Thai Buddhist temples traditionally have sculptures of figures
from Buddhist mythology on their grounds. Over the centuries, the
temple sculptors have also added figures of Chinese merchants and
European soldiers, the first Westerners to visit Thailand.
	   The figures at Wat In depict Thai Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart riding on the shoulders of former Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
	   In another sculpture, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai wears an
ancient soldier's uniform and holds a sword and pike.
	   The objections to the statues have come mainly from Chavalit's
supporters.
	   The abbot said there was no relation between current politics
and the sculptures because they were created almost eight years
ago. He said the artist intended to show that power does not last
and is just a delusion.
	   ``I can understand that people view the same thing differently.
Some people are narrowed-minded and we can do nothing with that but
forgive them,'' said the abbot.

Marv Albert makes a low-key return to broadcasting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marv Albert's back _ and this time it's not in a
lurid tabloid headline about his sex life.
	   A year earlier, Albert, star sportscaster at NBC news channel,
was fired after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge.
	   He was accused of throwing his former girlfriend on a bed in a
Virginia hotel room in February 1997, biting her on the back more
than a dozen times and forcing her to perform oral sex.
	   A visibly nervous Albert made his return to broadcasting Monday
night, anchoring a sports highlight show for the MSG cable network,
which a year earlier accepted his resignation following the scandal
that made him a national punch line.
	   He was hired back by MSG this summer, and capped a year of
therapy by getting married earlier this month.

High profile candidates clash on women-only issue

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election-Polls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The two most high-profile women in
Australia's national election campaign clashed Tuesday over the
height of a hem line and who better appeals to women.
	   Leader of the right-wing populist One Nation party Pauline
Hanson accused the opposition Labor Party's Cheryl Kernot of
betraying parliamentary sisterhood by suggesting Hanson was using
her legs as a campaign tool.
	   Kernot said Hanson had a right to dress as she pleased, but
wondered if the thigh-length skirt worn by Hanson during campaign
events on Monday was an attempt to distract voters from her
policies.
	   Hanson's legs were good, Kernot said, but ``what else is there
to say about her? I'll be judged on my policies and my actions,
thanks.''
	   Australians will vote in national elections on Oct. 3.
	   At the launch of Labor's women's policy Monday, Kernot said
there had been an ``almost overwhelming rejection by women of
Pauline Hanson's bleak and bitter agenda for Australia.''
	   Hanson said Kernot's comments were a disappointing personal
attack from another female politician.
	   ``It is tough enough for women in politics as it is, without
another woman politician coming out an attacking,'' she said.
	   Hanson denied the skirt was a miniskirt, describing the length
as ```regulation height when I went to school.''
	   ``I wish they'd pay more attention to my policies. I've brought
out some very good policies ... isn't that more important than
talking about my legs?'' Hanson said.
	   Hanson's policies include halting immigration, ending special
welfare payments to Aborigines, economic protectionism and a tax
scheme critics have described as economic suicide.

Asian markets mixed; Singapore, Manila and Hong Kong surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fueled by Wall Street's two-day rally, share
prices in Singapore and the Philippines surged early Tuesday. Other
Asian markets were mixed.
	   Singapore's key Straits Times Index was 3.8 percent higher at
the midday close, and the key PSE index in the Philippines closed
up 3.6 percent.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 1.8 percent higher at midday.
Thailand's SET index was 1.1 percent higher.
	   Japan's financial markets were closed for a national holiday.
	   Market participants said Wall Street's 1.9-percent rally Monday
_ the second straight session of gains _ has injected some
excitement into the battered Asian markets.
	   Speculation of an imminent interest rate cuts in the United
States also buoyed market sentiment, they said.
	   But there was no noteworthy market news in the region, and most
of the rallies were technical rebound from hefty falls in recent
trading days.
	   In South Korea, the Kospi index closed down 1.3 percent as
foreign investors wary of the region's stability pulled out. Taiwan
stocks closed little changed, with the key Weighted Stock Price
Index slipping 2.21 points to 6,857.96.
	   Indonesia's key index fell 0.6 percent by midday on concern the
government would soon impose capital controls. Malaysia's Composite
Index was 0.4 percent lower as investors, noting the government has
not injected funds to lift the market, fled.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times pierced through the important
900-level to 911.39 at the midday break. The last time the index
was above 900 points was on Aug. 27, after which it gradually
descended to a new year-low of 800.27 on Sept. 4.
	   Dealers said the city-state, a heavy exporter of electronics,
took advantage of new indications the global electronic sector
remains relatively isolated from the effects of the worldwide
economic downturn.
	   U.S.-based Intel Corp. announced recently third-quarter earnings
will be higher than expectations.
	   In Manila, the stock index closed higher for the second straight
session, after falling to a seven-year low last Friday. But dealers
said it was mostly bargain hunting of oversold stocks.
	   In Hong Kong, Hang Seng continued Monday's 1.1 percent rise, as
domestic interest rates eased from Monday's steep levels, which
rose on reports that the de facto central bank was ready to change
its exchange rate with banks from 7.75 Hong Kong dollar to the U.S.
dollar to the weaker 7.8.
	   The authority later retracted the report, and interest rates
fell.

Australia in for tough road, says Samoan winger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Western Samoan winger Va'aiga Tuigamala
predicts Australia will face three extremely physical encounters in
the four-nation rugby union World Cup qualifying tournament.
	   Tuigamala arrived in Sydney on Tuesday as part of the Samoan
squad tipped to provide the strongest opposition to Australia in
the tournament starting Friday at Parramatta Stadium.
	   Fiji and Tonga complete the lineup from which the top three
teams automatically advance to next year's World Cup with the
fourth entering a secondary playoff.
	   Western Samoa, a quarter-finalist at the 1991 and 1995 World
Cups, lost its only two previous tests to Australia, the last being
a 73-3 hiding in Sydney four years ago.
	   The current squad contains former New Zealand All Black backs
Tuigamala and Stephen Bachop, backrowers Pat Lam and Junior
Paramore and winger Brian Lima.
	   Western Samoa takes on Tonga and Australia faces Fiji in
Friday's opening round of matches.
	   ``I think if you look through reputations I would definitely say
out of the three islands Samoa was the better on paper, but I think
Australia will find all the games will be quite physical and that's
something we're looking forward to as well,'' Tuigamala said.
	   Dubbed ``Inga The Winger'' during his 19 block-busting tests for
New Zealand before a four-year stint in rugby league, Tuigamala
returned to union in 1996.
	   ``I didn't really think I was going to come back to rugby union
on a serious basis because I was quite happy to play rugby league
and finish my career there and I was quite happy with what I was
achieving at Wigan,'' he said of his English rugby league
experience.
	   ``So when Samoa asked me two years ago if I'd consider making
myself available, I jumped at the opportunity, because chances like
this you just can't afford to not recognize and I'm very grateful
to Samoa.''
	   Former Australian under-21 prop Fosi Pala'amo was Tuesday named
in the team for Friday night while some of the big names such as
Tuigamala and Paramore were not named in the starting side and
presumably being kept fresh for the later matches.
	   The team for Friday: Mike Umaga, Afato So'oalo, George Leaupepe,
Terry Fanolua, Brian Lima, Stephen Bachop, Steven So'oilao, Pat Lam
(captain), Kalolo Toleafoa, Sene Ta'ala, Lama Tone, Opeta Palepoi,
Fosi Pala'amo, Trevor Leota, Kepi Faiva'ai. (djp)

Bodies of drowned Swiss tourists recovered in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A police search party on Tuesday
recovered the bodies of the two Swiss tourists who are believed to
have drowned when their canoe capsized in strong river currents.
	   Three other Swiss travelers, the boat operator and his assistant
swam to safety after the accident on Sunday, said Wenceslaus Dana,
police chief in Sri Aman, on the island of Borneo.
	   The Swiss Embassy confirmed the identities of the dead as
Heinrich Enzmann, 58, and Hans Wahlen, 54. Their bodies were taken
to the local hospital for autopsies, and were to be flown home on
Wednesday.
	   The travelers were in a tour group traveling by canoe to a
remote village in the state of Sarawak, according to a report from
the national news agency, Bernama.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more color; prime minister's villa said looted;
rally scheduled for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, in the wake of armed
clashes on Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted. And it urged armed
Berisha supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party
headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks were parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   Police were negotiating with the armed Berisha supporters,
trying to convince them to hand over at least their heavy weapons,
said the statement.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday near the building
remained closed. Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also
cleaned out Nano's villa, in Tirana's government residential
district, on Monday.
	   Dozens of vans sped through downtown Tirana Tuesday carrying
armed police, some wearing stocking masks.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The government has restored rail and
road links between Bangladesh's major port and the rest of the
country to prepare for the arrival and distribution of aid to
nearly 35 million people hit by the worst floods in two decades, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Flood waters are receding after killing more than 900 people and
devastating crops in this impoverished nation.
	   The World Food Program said Tuesday that a ship carrying 15,000
tons of wheat was expected to reach Chittagong port Friday. It was
to be the first delivery of food donated in response to an
emergency appeal from Bangladesh, the U.N. agency said. Chittagong
has been cut off from the rest of the country for a week.
	   The government will deploy the military and navy at Chittagong
and Khulna ports later this week to ensure speedy movement of
relief supplies, the government official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Bangladeshi government has issued an international appeal
for relief worth dlrs 880 million, including dlrs 112 million in
food.

Greenpeace gives mixed report on green Games effort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers need to
improve their game on some environmental issues or risk
embarrassment at the 2000 Games, environment watchdog Greenpeace
said Tuesday.
	   Releasing its first environment report card on the Games _ which
start in two years _ Greenpeace Olympics campaigner Michael Bland
said the organizers' performance had been a mixed bag.
	   Ratings ranged from an A+ for the use of solar power in the
Olympic Village and environmental building design to an F for the
use of environmentally-damaging refrigerants and the failure to
begin toxic soil removal at parts of the major Olympic site of
Homebush Bay.
	   Bland said Olympic organizers were breaking their own rules _ a
claim denied by Olympics Minister Michael Knight _ by using
ozone-depleting gases in refrigeration and cooling systems in
venues.
	   Environmental guidelines said the refrigerants should not be
used.
	   ``They need to pull their socks up,'' Bland said. ``We've got
two years before the Olympics start and there are some serious
problems that need to be addressed. They've done well in some
areas, but they need constant attention, constant supervision.
	   ``If they don't put more effort into cleaning up Homebush Bay,
fixing up the problem of refrigeration and tend to some of the
detail then all the good effort so far could be lost.''
	   Knight deflected the criticism, saying Greenpeace had only found
three relevant areas of complaint.
	   ``They raised some 27 issues and out of the 27 they only
attacked us on five and two had nothing to do with Olympic
construction program,'' Knight said.
	   ``Three out of 27 is pretty sensational from a group that should
be pretty harsh critics.''
	   Knight said that by Greenpeace's own admission, Sydney was
running the most environmentally friendly games in history.
	   ``Part of (their) job is to always raise the bar and push new
environmental agendas,'' he said. ``Some of the things they want we
can do, some of the things they want are not possible.''
	   Knight said state Ports Minister Kim Yeadon was looking at
options for Homebush Bay, including removal of dioxins from
underneath sediment at the site, but he did not wish to preempt
Yeadon on the issue. (djp)

Games reserve returns positive test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian weightlifter Duncan Van
Rooyen, who narrowly missed selection for the Commonwealth Games
team, has blamed recreational drug use for a positive test to a
banned anabolic agent last month.
	   Van Rooyen admitted his positive test Tuesday but his
explanation was disputed by Australian games team doctor Brian
Sando.
	   Van Rooyen tested positive to Clenbuterol, an anabolic agent
which has medicinal use for asthma sufferers, but claimed it must
have followed an incident where he took a recreational drug at a
party.
	   ``I don't think that's right,'' Sando said. ``There wouldn't be
any reason, advantage or effect for anyone to put Clenbuterol in
recreational drugs.''
	   Van Rooyen missed out on the Games at the selection trials in
July and returned a negative result to a test at that time. He
tested positive after the national championships in August and said
he had taken the unnamed recreational drug in between events.
	   ``While at a gathering during this period I was offered some
recreational drugs which I foolishly accepted, this is the only
possible explanation for my positive test result,'' Van Rooyen told
Australian Associated Press.
	   There was no indication that recreational drugs were found in
the sample.

Thai department store chain defaults on dlrs 200 million in loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One of Thailand's largest department
store chains has defaulted on loans worth about dlrs 200 million,
the Stock Exchange of Thailand said Tuesday.
	   Robinson Department Store Co. missed a series of payments on
foreign debentures and currency-swap agreements, according to
information released by the SET.
	   The SET said Robinson, which is controlled by Thailand's
unlisted Central Retail Corp., informed authorities late last week
that so far this year it has missed interest payments on three
foreign-denominated debenture issues and a currency swap agreement.
	   Robinson also missed interest payments in July on 1 billion baht
(dlrs 249 million) worth of debentures, according to an official at
the Thai Bond Dealing Center.
	   In a letter to the Thai Bond Dealing Center, the company said it
was in the process of debt restructuring. The letter didn't say
when the company would resume interest payments, the official said.

Israel eases closure of West Bank, Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel eased its closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip slightly on Tuesday, allowing 7,000 Palestinian workers
and 3,000 business people to enter Israel.
	   However, Israel's borders will remain sealed to most of the more
than 2.5 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, including tens of
thousands of workers with jobs in Israel.
	   The closure was imposed last Thursday to prevent possible
attacks by the Islamic militant group Hamas in Israel. Hamas has
threatened to avenge the deaths of two top fugitives who were
killed by Israeli troops last week. Since 1994, Hamas has killed
scores of Israelis in suicide bombings.
	   Entry of trucks from the Palestinian areas has been resumed, but
they are subjected to long delays due to security checks.
	   The 7,000 workers permitted to return to their jobs Tuesday are
part of a new Israeli program to allow certain Palestinian
employees to continue entering Israeli even during security alerts.
	   The workers must be aged 28 or over and married and must have
worked in Israel for at least two years. Their employers must be
able to transport them to and from the border checkpoints, and to
accommodate them overnight near the work site should the need
arise.
	   Each employer must also appoint a security officer responsible
for bringing the workers to a safe place to protect them from
attacks by Israeli ultranationalists in the event of a Hamas
attack, said Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the government's chief
policy adviser on Palestinian affairs.
	   The closures cause great economic hardship in the Palestinian
areas, where unemployment is high. It also harms Israeli employers
who are dependent on Palestinian labor.

Asian countries balk at implementing free trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUANTAN, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim countries struggling to
recover from the region's economic turmoil declared support Tuesday
for the principle of trade liberalization, but balked at committing
to details.
	   As senior officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group finished a three-day meeting to hammer out specifics, much
work remained to be done before APEC leaders meet in November to
sign an ambitious trade pact.
	   ``We're all for liberalization,'' said Andrew Hsia, head of
Taiwan's delegation. ``All the economies are committed, but we're
all so diverse. We're all asking for maximum flexibility in certain
sectors, especially in fishing and forestry.''
	   Most of the crisis-wracked Asian countries in APEC have
expressed the same reservations, by hedging their endorsement for
the Early Voluntary Sector Liberalization pact, or EVSL, aimed at
opening up nine key industries by next year.
	   During the last APEC meeting in northern Borneo in June, Japan
stone-walled against liberalizing fisheries and forestry, the
sectors it sees as most vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   Since then, other member countries have joined the refrain of
more flexibility in the open-trading deal that has been
enthusiastically pushed by the United States and New Zealand.
	   Russian delegate Andrei Denisov said that the economic and
currency crises plaguing Russia would make it difficult for its
wobbly economy to be immediately exposed to unfettered trade among
APEC countries.
	   Liberalization should be carried out ``in an optimal, reasonable
way'' that will not ruin local businesses vulnerable to foreign
competition, Denisov said.
	   ``We're ready to participate in all nine sectors, partially and
conditionally, on the basis of volunteerism,'' Wang Yusheng, head
of the Chinese delegation, said Monday.
	   Nevertheless, the United States has expressed its unwavering
support for the EVSL plan.
	   ``This November when I meet with leaders of the Asian economies
at the APEC meeting, we will move forward to further open markets
in Asia,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a speech to the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
	   Once completed, the plan will lift trade barriers in the areas
of environmental products and services, energy, fisheries,
forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical products and
telecommunications.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join in November.

Police arrest suspected mobster on 30-most dangerous list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ A suspected mobster who figures on a list
of Italy's 30-most dangerous people was arrested during a police
raid at dawn Tuesday.
	   Mariano Tullio Troia, 65, allegedly ordered a series of murders,
including that of Salvo Lima, a Sicilian politician with close
links to former premier Giulio Andreotti who is on trial in Palermo
on charges of Mafia association.
	   According to the Italian news agency ANSA, Mafia turncoats have
told investigators that Troia used to meet frequently with the
now-jailed ``boss of bosses'', Salvatore ``Toto'' Riina, to discuss
the Mafia's agenda and decide the fate of intrusive police officers
or prosecutors.
	   Police captured Troia at about 5:30 a.m. after bursting into the
apartment in the Palermo suburb where he was staying. Troia, who
had been a fugitive for six years, did not put up resistance when
he was arrested, news reports said.

U.N. human rights chief ends visit claiming success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chinese comment, Beijing pledging to
sign human rights treaty in October, Robinson urging Jiang to meet
Dalai Lama, another dissident protests &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo BEJ101

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson declared
Tuesday that her groundbreaking visit to China succeeded in raising
awareness of civil liberties but acknowledged that she ``can't work
miracles.''
	   Ending the first official mission by a U.N. human rights high
commissioner to China, Robinson said she raised specific cases of
political prisoners with her hosts and conveyed a message to the
Chinese public that ``human rights is not just a matter for the
government.''
	   ``Human rights is not just words, it's content. It's specifics.
It matters to people,'' she said.
	   Robinson said she achieved her goal of beginning to work with
the Chinese on ways to improve human rights protection, but
acknowledged that ``even with all the goodwill in the world, I
can't work miracles.''
	   Apparently pleased with her careful approach, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Robinson had started a good working
relationship and that Chinese officials responded ``very
positively'' to her suggestions.
	   ``Her visit this time is crowned with success,'' Zhu told
reporters.
	   One of China's most prominent dissidents, however, said Robinson
failed to promote human rights and noted that authorities continued
to detain and harass citizens during her 10-day stay.
	   Xu Wenli criticized Robinson for not vehemently protesting the
Sept. 5 arrest of leading Chinese journalist Shi Binhai nor the
treatment given to Chu Hailan, who police dragged away moments
before she tried to hand Robinson a letter last Wednesday.
	   ``Her attitude was much too polite, too flexible,'' Xu said.
``She's a high-level U.N. official. She should have made a much
stronger, more principled stand.''
	   Robinson conceded the Chinese government restricted her
activities, particularly in Tibet, and prevented her from meeting
dissidents.
	   ``The visit was a first for the authorities and they were quite
concerned about what would happen,'' Robinson said. ``It was not
easy.''
	   But Robinson insisted she championed Chu's case, saying she
``wasn't going to let that one go by without ensuring she was
released.'' She added that all cases brought to her attention would
be pursued.
	   At her urging, Chinese leaders told her they would sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights next month.
They had announced six months ago their intentions to sign the
treaty, considered a basic guarantor of human rights.
	   At a meeting Monday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin made no
response, Robinson said, to her urging that he meet with the Dalai
Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.
	   Robinson's presence brought an outpouring of appeals from
dissidents demanding the release of political prisoners and a curb
on police powers, particularly the authority to send people to
labor camps for up to four years without trial.
	   A dissident based in the central city of Wuhan urged Robinson to
demand that authorities investigate the deaths of 10 people who
died while in official custody in Xinzhou, a nearby county in
central Hubei province.
	   Xinzhou county officials claimed the prisoners had all committed
suicide, but in several cases, the bodies of those who died were
cremated without permission from their families, preventing
autopsies, Qin Yongmin said in a statement faxed to foreign news
media. County police and prosecutors denied the allegations.
	   As Robinson was leaving China, eight dissidents vowed to go on a
symbolic 72-hour fast starting Wednesday to demand the release of
jailed labor rights campaigner Zhang Shanguang, New York-based
Human Rights in China reported.
	   In an open letter, the dissidents argued that Zhang's attempt to
set up an association to protect the rights of laid-off workers was
not a crime.

Fairly strong earthquake shakes northern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.1 shook northern Japan on Tuesday, but police said
there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The Central Meteorological agency said the quake hit at 4:24
p.m. (0724GMT) in Sendai, 302 kilometers (189 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, shaking houses and toppling vases.
	   The agency placed the epicenter of the quake roughly 10
kilometers (6 miles) underground near Sendai.
	   Hiroshi Hoshi of the Miyagi prefectural police in Sendai said so
far there were no reports of injuries or damage.

House fire sparked by matches kill four children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Four Bahraini children ages 1 to 6 who
were left locked up home alone were killed by a fire apparently
started as the youngsters played with matches, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   The blaze started as the parents took a young son to a health
clinic for a vaccination, the English-language Bahrain Tribune
reported. Sayyed Jaffer Sayyed Salman and his wife returned to find
the house in flames and firemen trying to rescue the children.
	   The fire was Monday in Jannusan village, some 10 kilometers (6
miles) southwest of the capital Manama. The fire gutted the house,
and the English-language Gulf Daily News reported the locked metal
doors of the house hampered the rescue.
	   Initial investigation by the Interior Ministry indicated that
the fire was caused by careless use of matches, the papers added.
	   Firefighters managed to bring out only 6-year-old Zahra alive,
but she died later of burns and smoke inhalation, the papers quoted
witnesses as saying. The other victims were a 3-year-old girl and
boys ages 2 and 1.
	   Their Moroccan-born mother, identified as 34-year-old Najma
al-Helali, was hospitalized for shock, the Tribune and other
dailies said.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more color; prime minister's villa said looted;
rally scheduled for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence a day
after an attempted coup, the Albanian government on Tuesday banned
an opposition rally and ordered rebels to turn in their weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, after armed clashes on
Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted. And it urged armed
Berisha supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party
headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off unrest
reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in 1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks were parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   Police were negotiating with the armed Berisha supporters,
trying to convince them to hand over at least their heavy weapons,
said the statement.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday near the building
remained closed. Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also
cleaned out Nano's villa, in Tirana's government residential
district, on Monday.
	   Dozens of vans sped through downtown Tirana Tuesday carrying
armed police, some wearing stocking masks.

Malaysia to freeze trading of its stocks in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 3rd graf that Singapore planned for trading in
Malaysian stocks to end Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Trading of all Malaysian stocks on
Singapore's over-the-counter market will be frozen at the end of
trading Tuesday, Malaysia's stock exchange announced.
	   ``No transactions or transfers whatsoever will be allowed in
respect of the accounts,'' the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange said in
a statement.
	   Singapore authorities had suspended trading in Malaysian stocks
on Sept. 4, in response to plunging share value after Malaysian
restrictions were imposed. Singapore then re-opened the trading for
seven days, from Sept. 9-15, to allow local investors to transfer
their holdings into U.S. dollars or to accounts in Malaysia.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Singapore Stock
Exchange to the Malaysian statement.
	   Malaysia had previously said it would no longer allow trading of
its stocks in Singapore, where they make up about 90 percent of the
republic's over-the-counter market.
	   Stock exchanges of the two countries had not agreed on how the
Malaysian securities were to be transferred to a central depository
in Kuala Lumpur, but the Singapore exchange said it was working on
the arrangements.
	   In the meantime, the value of the stocks in Singapore dived, and
some investors lost hundreds of thousands of Singapore dollars
before Singapore authorities suspended the trading of
over-the-counter Malaysian stocks on Sept. 4.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange statement said that all
Malaysian shares held in the accounts of brokers would no longer be
valid until a final agreement is reached on how the shares will be
transferred.
	   The Malaysian authorities are bringing all trading of Malaysian
securities onshore as a way of closing any loopholes resulting from
the Sept. 1 introduction of sweeping capital controls.
	   Those curbs prohibited offshore trading of the Malaysian
currency, effectively pegging the ringgit at 3.80 to the U.S.
dollar.

With name alone, letter finds right person
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KELOWNA, British Columbia (AP) _ Christopher Berry got a letter
this week from his mother in Blackpool, England.
	   Nothing unusual about that.
	   Except the envelope had only this printed on it: To Mr.
Christopher Berry.
	   No street address, no city, province or country. And certainly
not a postal code.
	   Bucking overwhelming odds, the letter made it through both the
British and Canadian mail-sorting systems to its final destination
in just one week. It was mailed Sept. 3 and arrived in Berry's
mailbox Sept. 10.
	   ``It's incredible it got here, isn't it?'' said Berry, a chef.
``I don't know how it got here, but it did.''
	   Berry's mother, who is 61, suffers from dementia and is very
forgetful, he says. Sometimes she forgets to put the full name and
address on the envelope.
	   A local Canada Post official couldn't explain how the letter
found its way to Berry. But Berry's wife, Kelly, has a theory. She
said Christopher's mother writes chatty letters three or four times
a week and always tapes the envelope shut distinctively.
	   Perhaps by some wild series of coincidences, sorters in
Blackpool and London recognized the envelope and knew to route the
letter to the international pile, then to Canada, she said.
	   Canada Post sorters must also have recognized it and sent it to
Kelowna, where a letter carrier delivered it to the Berry home.
	   ``I know it sounds like a weird and wonderful long shot, but it
must have been the only way it got here,'' she said.

Taiwanese urged to exercise caution when visiting Macau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The government on Tuesday urged Taiwanese
to be on guard when they visit Macau because of gang violence in
the Portuguese enclave.
	   Casinos and nightclubs in Macau are largely controlled by gangs
and Taiwanese should avoid getting involved in any gang disputes
when visiting those places, the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   Travelers were advised to stay in hotels after midnight because
that is when most killings and bomb explosions were reported, it
said.
	   ``People should avoid borrowing from loan sharks there,'' it
said. ``These groups often resort to violent means, such as torture
or murder, on those who fail to pay back their debts.''
	   ``Watch your purse and passport carefully, especially when you
are in the airport, casinos, elevators or back alleys,'' the
statement added.
	   Macau is a Portuguese-controled tourist and gambling spot at the
tip of south China. It reverts to Chinese rule next year.
	   The recent spate of violence in the territory is linked to gang
wars over gambling profits that have been been shrinking because of
Asia's economic slump.

Iranian leader orders military, top officials on full alert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
Tuesday amid heightened tension with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The action came a day after Khamenei warned that the actions of
Afghanistan's Taliban militia were leading to a regional crisis and
urged Muslim countries to intercede.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday, the agency said.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the fundamentalist Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   On Monday, the Revolutionary Guard, Iran's elite fighting force,
announced in a statement its complete readiness to take action act
and said it was awaiting orders from Khamenei, who is also
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Remains of seven of the nine Iranians killed in Afghanistan
arrived Monday in Tehran.
	   Also Monday, Khamenei said that unless Pakistan stops supporting
the Taliban and persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to
the country's civil war, the entire region will be in danger.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, is
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran, alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban, has urged a government
be formed of all Aghan factions.

Australian official promises: no jail time for positive tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seeking to defuse a conflict with the
IOC, Australian Olympic officials promised Tuesday that athletes
would not go to jail if they test positive for drugs during the
2000 Sydney Games.
	   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, gave
the assurance after IOC officials expressed opposition Monday to
his proposals for possible criminal sanctions for drug cheats.
	   The International Olympic Committee insisted that only
traffickers and dealers should be prosecuted, while athletes should
be sanctioned by sports bodies alone.
	   ``At no time have I proposed that athletes who test positive for
drugs should go to jail,'' Coates said. ``The only time an athlete
would ever find themselves in prison is if they had a commercial or
traffickable amount of drugs.''
	   Coates denied that his proposals, announced last month in
Australia, called for two-year jail terms for athletes caught using
steroids.
	   He said he was pushing for Australian laws to be changed so that
penalties for ``hard sports drugs'' were as strict as those for
narcotics.
	   Possession or personal use of individual doses of
performance-enhancing drugs could result in criminal action, but
only in fines, not jail, Coates said.
	   During the Sydney Olympics, any athlete testing positive for
drugs would be subjected to existing IOC rules, including
disqualification from the games.
	   However, an Olympic athlete involved in supplying or selling
drugs to others could face criminal prosecution.
	   ``If there are international athletes, coaches or other
officials who are in possession of drugs in a commercial quantity
or traffickable amount then they ought be subject to these stricter
laws,'' Coates said.
	   The Australian official said he was not encouraging police raids
on the Olympic athletes' village.
	   ``I would prefer to have a situation where the different teams
and their management would do the policing,'' Coates said. ``I
don't want to have a situation where the police are coming into the
village going through the rooms.
	   ``But I don't see there should be any objection to customs
officers being able to intercept the illegal entry of drugs into
our country. If everybody knows those are the rules, then they know
what the penalty is going to be.''
	   Coates cited the case of a Chinese swimming coach who was
stopped by customs while entering Australia for the world swimming
championships earlier this year.
	   The coach's luggage was searched and found to contain vials of
banned human growth hormone. The coach was deported.
	   Under Coates' proposals, the Chinese coach would be arrested and
charged with trafficking and face a possible life sentence.
	   Coates refuted a suggestion Monday by IOC executive board member
Jacques Rogge that international sports organizations would refuse
to stage events in Australia if athletes could face jail for doping
offenses.
	   ``I don't think it's going to cost us,'' Coates said. ``A number
of people could say the reverse: we are selecting a country that is
doing everything possible to make it a clean event.''
	   Rogge said Tuesday he was happy with Coates' clarification that
jail penalties would apply only to traffickers.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada said board members were
eager to hear Coates' explanation.
	   ``The first impression conveyed to us (in the media) suggested a
rather scorched-earth policy which I'm sure he did not have in mind
and I hope he didn't,'' Pound said.
	   ``I, for one, do not want to see sports competitions run by the
police and i don't want to see athletes who were selected for
doping control led away by police.''
	   On a related matter, Coates said he is urging the Australian
government to add two popular performance-enhancing drugs _ EPO and
DHEA _ to its list of prohibited substances.
	   EPO, an endurance-boosting hormone, was the drug at the center
of the doping scandals which marred this summer's Tour de France.
DHEA is an anobolic steroid.
	   Coates said an unidentified triathlete was stopped by customs
officers at the Perth airport in February with EPO, but was let go
without penalty.
	   Coates said he was alarmed by a recent study showing 2 percent
of the general population in Australia uses steroids for
non-medical reasons.
	   In a bid to head off doping scandals at the Sydney Games, the
AOC plans to force any Australian athlete who commits a drug
offense to repay any Olympic grants and return all sponsorship
revenues.

French prime minister to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's visit to
China next week will highlight the two countries' warm ties, a
Chinese government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   China and France have made ``remarkable achievements in friendly
and mutually beneficial cooperation,'' and Jospin's visit is
``another important event in bilateral relations,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a routine briefing.
	   Jospin will visit China Sept. 24-26 with stops in Beijing and
Shanghai. He also plans to go to Hong Kong.
	   ``We are confident that his visit will help further growth in
the comprehensive partnership between our two countries,'' Zhu
said.
	   Although relations were strained in the early 1990s over French
weapons sales to rival Taiwan, China has courted France to raise
Chinese influence in Europe.
	   The two countries have been promoting trade and economic ties.
Last year bilateral trade amounted to about 59 billion francs (dlrs
10 billion).

<TEXT>
	   AL-FANAR, Lebanon (AP) _ Francois Ghattas, who kept Associated
Press communications systems working for AP offices and subscribers
through war and peace in the Middle East for more than three
decades, died early Tuesday. He was 65.
	   Ghattas died in his sleep of a heart attack at his home in
Al-Fanar, a suburb in the mountains above Beirut, his family said.
	   He retired from the AP in Nicosia, Cyprus, in 1994 and returned
to his native Lebanon, where his son, Sam F. Ghattas, is the AP's
Beirut correspondent.
	   Renowned for his wizardry in keeping communications lines to the
world open during aerial bombardments and militia street fighting
around the AP's Beirut office during 15 years of civil war, Ghattas
also traveled widely throughout the Middle East to install and
maintain equipment for AP subscribers.
	   When fighting disrupted shipments of vital communications gear
to Beirut, Ghattas would make his own, creating complicated
circuitry from diagrams that seemed to exist only in his mind.
	   When Israel's 1982 siege of Beirut cut off electrical power to
the city's central telephone exchange, Ghattas reversed the circuit
flow between the AP bureau and the telephone exchange in order to
feed the AP's generator power to the exchange and keep AP news
flowing over this communications lifeline to the world.
	   Ghattas was born in Mashghara, in southern Lebanon's lower Bekaa
Valley, and came to Beirut as a young man. A self-taught
communications technician, he worked for several organizations
starting in the 1950s, including AP and United Press International.
He became a full-time AP staffer in 1982.
	   He was transferred to the AP's Nicosia office in 1986.
	   Funeral services are to be conducted Thursday in Jdeideh near
Beirut, with burial in Mashghara.
	   Survivors include Ghattas' wife Nawal; three sons, Elie, Sam and
Tony, and five grandchildren.

Bosnia moves closer to membership of European body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The elections held in Bosnia over the
weekend have taken the country a step closer to membership of the
Council of Europe, the European body's chief observer said Monday.
	   Danish deputy Hanne Severinsen said the presidential,
legislative and local elections were an ``important milestone'' on
the way to Bosnia being allowed to join the 40-nation organization
that promotes democracy and human rights.
	   In a statement released at its headquarters in Strasbourg,
France, the council said it would specify conditions that the
Bosnian authorities must fulfill to gain membership. No timetable
was set for Bosnia's accession, the council said.
	   Bosnia applied to join the Council of Europe in April, 1995.
	   Severinsen headed a 14-member delegation of deputies from the
Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly which monitored the
elections held Saturday and Sunday.
	   She said that despite improvements, serious problems remained,
notably that several voters registers were ``incomplete,
inaccurate, or had not been delivered at all.''

Myanmar military arrests 81 more opposition party members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Determined to crush opponents of military
rule, Myanmar's government has arrested 81 more members of the
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi political party, the party
said Tuesday.
	   The government, meanwhile, strongly denied reports that 17
officers had been arrested for planning to open a dialogue with Suu
Kyi and her colleagues, something military leaders have refused to
do.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, said the new
arrests started Monday, pushing the total number of government
opponents rounded up since May to at least 783, including 196
elected members of parliament.
	   The sweep is the largest crackdown against democracy activists
since the early 1990s. The military has ruled Myanmar, also known
as Burma, since 1962.
	   Most of the arrests have taken place during the last two weeks
as the military tried to foil the NLD's attempt to convene the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the
military, despite promising to hand over power to the winners
before the polls, refused to honor the result.
	   Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since the latest wave of
arrests began two weeks ago. Troops have reportedly been stationed
near her home and the Yangon office of her party.
	   Reports have circulated in Yangon and Bangkok that 17 senior
officers have been arrested for planning to meet with Suu Kyi.
	   ``It is absolutely groundless,'' said a spokesman for the
government on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The spokesman said the report was part of a disinformation
campaign by the NLD to make people believe the military is about to
split and support the party.
	   In the 1990 election, districts populated heavily by military
families voted overwhelmingly for the NLD.
	   Commentaries in state-run newspapers this week have threatened
to deport Suu Kyi and arrest her party's vice chairman Tin Oo, a
former defense minister and Buddhist monk, for allegedly sowing
discord in the military.
	   The NLD statement on Tuesday said: ``The authorities have been
detaining members of the NLD who have not committed any offense or
violated any law. We strongly condemn these unlawful arrests and
call for the earliest unconditional release of the members.''
	   Members of parliament who represent some of the country's ethnic
groups have also been arrested.
	   The military government has denied arresting anybody. Instead,
it insists those under detention have merely been ``invited'' to
exchange their views on the convening of parliament.
	   The NLD said, however, that some party members were taken away
in handcuffs and had hoods put over their heads by the squads of
soldiers that picked them up.

Iranian leader orders military, top officials on full alert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
Tuesday amid heightened tension with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The action came a day after Khamenei warned that the actions of
Afghanistan's Taliban militia were leading to a regional crisis and
urged Muslim countries to intercede.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday, the agency said.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight Iranian diplomats
and a journalist last month.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   On Monday, the Revolutionary Guard, Iran's elite fighting force,
announced in a statement its readiness to take action and said it
was awaiting orders from Khamenei, who is also commander-in-chief
of the armed forces.
	   Remains of seven of the nine Iranians killed in Afghanistan
arrived Monday in Tehran.
	   Also Monday, Khamenei said that unless Pakistan stops supporting
the Taliban and persuades the militia's leaders to end the
country's civil war, the entire region will be in danger.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, is
believed to be supported by Pakistan. Pakistan denies this. Iran,
alleged to be backing the alliance fighting the Taliban, has urged
the formation of a government uniting all Afghan factions.

Allcock wins battle of unbeaten bowlers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The battle for medals on the green
narrowed Tuesday with Commonwealth No. 2 bowler Tony Allcock of
England scoring a 25-21 victory over previously unbeaten Jeremy
Henry of Northern Ireland.
	   In the women's section, defending champion Margaret Johnston of
Northern Ireland fell 25-14 to Anne Carrington of Zimbabwe in the
round-robin preliminaries.
	   In another men's Group A match in the lawn bowling competition
of the 16th Commonwealth Games, Australian Steve Glasson kept up
his winning streak, easily eliminating Neal Mollet of Guernsey
25-12.
	   Roy Garden of Zimbabwe bettered David le Marquand of Jersey
25-23, and Fijian C. Turagabeci edged past Papua New Guinea's Ila
Iamo 25-20.
	   Playing to empty stands at the Bukit Kiara lawns, Keith Turton
of Norfolk Islands found better lines than John Price of Wales,
beating him 25-19 in a Group B match.
	   Also in Group B, Scotsman Willie Wood easily overcame A. Kayesa
of Zambia 25-12 and Kevin Jones of Canada defeated Piut Matrais of
Brunei 25-11.
	   Allcock, unbeaten so far, and Glasson, who has won all three of
his outings, remain the favorites to win the singles gold.
	   In other women's singles matches, Julie Forrest of Scotland
defeated Vagi Bai of Papua New Guinea 25-15 and Lesly Hartwell of
South Africa scraped past Karina Horman of Jersey 25-24.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Trading of all Malaysian stocks on
Singapore's over-the-counter market will be frozen at the end of
trading Tuesday, Malaysia's stock exchange announced.
	   ``No transactions or transfers whatsoever will be allowed in
respect of the accounts,'' the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange said in
a statement.
	   Singapore authorities had suspended trading in Malaysian stocks
on Sept. 4, in response to plunging share value after Malaysian
restrictions were imposed. Singapore then re-opened the trading for
seven days, from Sept. 9-15, to allow local investors to transfer
their holdings into U.S. dollars or to accounts in Malaysia.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Singapore Stock
Exchange to the Malaysian statement.
	   Malaysia had previously said it would no longer allow trading of
its stocks in Singapore, where they make up about 90 percent of the
republic's over-the-counter market.
	   Stock exchanges of the two countries had not agreed on how the
Malaysian securities were to be transferred to a central depository
in Kuala Lumpur, but the Singapore exchange said it was working on
the arrangements.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie said Tuesday he
isn't considering implementing currency controls and would continue
to let the battered rupiah float against a basket of currencies.
	   Asked whether Indonesia was mulling controls, Habibie told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview: ``No, that's for sure, as long as
I'm here, no.''
	   The president also stressed that the Indonesian government
wouldn't act to set the level of the rupiah, whose freefall in
value has triggered Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The rupiah strengthened and broke through 11,000 to the U.S.
dollar on Tuesday amid persistent market speculation that the
country might implement some form of capital controls.
	   Neighboring Malaysia recently fixed the rate of the ringgit as
it too struggles with Asia's financial meltdown.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One of Thailand's largest department
store chains has defaulted on loans worth about dlrs 200 million,
the Stock Exchange of Thailand said Tuesday.
	   Robinson Department Store Co. missed a series of payments on
foreign debentures and currency-swap agreements, according to
information released by the SET.
	   The SET said Robinson, which is controlled by Thailand's
unlisted Central Retail Corp., informed authorities late last week
that so far this year it has missed interest payments on three
foreign-denominated debenture issues and a currency swap agreement.
	   Robinson also missed interest payments in July on 1 billion baht
(dlrs 249 million) worth of debentures, according to an official at
the Thai Bond Dealing Center.
	   In a letter to the Thai Bond Dealing Center, the company said it
was in the process of debt restructuring. The letter didn't say
when the company would resume interest payments, the official said.

	   KUANTAN, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific Rim countries struggling to
recover from the region's economic turmoil declared support Tuesday
for the principle of trade liberalization, but balked at committing
to details.
	   As senior officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group finished a three-day meeting to hammer out specifics, much
work remained to be done before APEC leaders meet in November to
sign an ambitious trade pact.
	   ``We're all for liberalization,'' said Andrew Hsia, head of
Taiwan's delegation. ``All the economies are committed, but we're
all so diverse. We're all asking for maximum flexibility in certain
sectors, especially in fishing and forestry.''
	   Most of the crisis-wracked Asian countries in APEC have
expressed the same reservations, by hedging their endorsement for
the Early Voluntary Sector Liberalization pact, aimed at opening up
nine key industries by next year.
	   During the last APEC meeting in northern Borneo in June, Japan
stone-walled against liberalizing fisheries and forestry, the
sectors it sees as most vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   Since then, other member countries have joined the refrain of
more flexibility in the open-trading deal that has been
enthusiastically pushed by the United States and New Zealand, in
particular.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines posted a trade
surplus for the second consecutive month in July, with exports
exceeding imports by dlrs 36 million, the government announced
Tuesday.
	   The surplus was a sharp turnaround from the dlrs 1.10 billion
deficit registered a year earlier. It followed a trade surplus of
dlrs 130 million in June, the country's first in nearly a decade.
	   For the first seven months of the year, the Philippines' trade
deficit narrowed to dlrs 1.43 billion from dlrs 6.72 billion a year
earlier, the National Statistics Office said.
	   While a trade surplus is usually welcome news, economists warn
that declining imports reflect a slowing of the Philippine economy
caused by the regional financial crisis. Many Philippine imports
are semi-finished components that are processed for re-export, or
capital goods used to build future production.
	   Electronics and components continued to top the list of imports
in July, accounting for dlrs 466.6 million or 19 percent, but
declined 13 percent from a year earlier.
	   Imports of other major categories also fell sharply, with
telecommunications equipment and electrical machinery falling 50
percent, and industrial machinery dropping 22 percent, the
statistics office said.

Report: Russian grain harvest will be a paltry 56 million tons

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Poor weather will slash Russia's grain harvest to
a paltry 56 million metric tons this year, it's lowest output in 40
years, the Agriculture Ministry forecast Tuesday.
	   A drought during the summer growing season, followed by a cold,
wet harvest season have been the main culprits, the ministry said.
In addition, Russia's economic crisis has ``aggravated the shortage
of machines, fuel and lubricants,'' the ministry added.
	   This years output is likely to be the lowest since Russia
harvested 54.9 million tons of grain in 1954, the ministry said in
a story carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   Agriculture officials had been predicting a poor harvest this
year, but just last month they said they expected 62 to 67 million
tons.
	   Russian officials have said previously that the country did not
foresee the need to import grain this year. It was not clear if the
latest forecast would change those plans.
	   Last year, Russia had an extremely good harvest of 88.5 million
tons last year.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Scores of Sunni Muslim militants set
fire to a Shiite Muslim mosque and three neighboring houses in the
latest violence between rival Islamic groups, police said Tuesday.
	   No one was injured.

of the Friends of the Prophet, attacked the Shiite mosque in Wah
Town, some 40 kilometers (24 miles) west of Islamabad on Monday
night, local police officials said.
	   The militants, shouted slogans against Shiites, surrounded the
mosque and set alight the gasoline they had splashed around its
perimeter, police said. Three houses were also set alight.
	   The mosque and the houses were partially destroyed in an attack
that came a day after four gunmen shot and killed a Sunni Muslim
leader and three of his companions on a highway outside Islamabad.
	   The Sipah-e-Sahaba vowed to avenge these killings and on Monday
protested in several cities. They shouted slogans against their
Shiite Muslim rivals and against Iran, whom they say is funding
their rivals.
	   On Tuesday police arrested roughly 200 supporters of
Sipah-e-Sahaba when they tried to demonstrate in Lahore _ the
capital of Punjab province.
	   Police chased and arrested the demonstrators as they tried to
gather near a mosque, witnesses said. Parts of Lahore are still
tense and the police has beefed up security arrangements, they
added.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in feuding
between the rival Islamic sects in Pakistan. While most Pakistanis
are Sunni Muslims, they generally live peacefully with their Shiite
brethren.
	   However extremist groups from both sects routinely clash.
	   Sunni groups blame Iran for helping the Shiite extremists, while
Shiite groups accuse Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant
organizations. Both countries deny the allegations.

Habibie rules out currency controls in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie said Tuesday he
is not considering currency controls and would continue to let the
battered rupiah float against a basket of currencies.
	   Asked whether Indonesia was mulling controls, Habibie told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview: ``No, that's for sure, as long as
I'm here, no.''
	   The president also stressed that the Indonesian government
wouldn't act to set the level of the rupiah, whose freefall in
value has triggered Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The rupiah strengthened and broke through 11,000 to the U.S.
dollar on Tuesday amid persistent market speculation that the
country might implement some form of capital controls.
	   Neighboring Malaysia recently fixed the rate of the ringgit as
it too struggles with Asia's financial meltdown.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of activists, some with
slogans painted on their bodies, marched and held rallies Tuesday
to oppose an accord that would allow U.S. troops to conduct war
exercises in the Philippines.
	   The protests in Manila and nearby provinces were held a day
before planned nationwide rallies marking the 1991 rejection by the
Philippine Senate of a treaty to extend the American military
presence in this former U.S. colony.
	   The protesters oppose the Visiting Forces Agreement, which was
signed early this year by U.S. and Philippine officials but still
must be ratified by the Philippine Senate.
	   The accord would allow large-scale U.S. and Philippine military
exercises and provide legal protections for U.S. soldiers on duty
in the country.
	   In the Makati financial district, about 300 demonstrators
marched toward the U.S. Embassy in Manila, snarling traffic. The
marchers were led by seven protesters with letters painted on their
bodies which together read ``Junk VFA.''
	   The demonstrators, belonging to the New Patriotic Alliance,
planned to hold a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy, which was
closed Tuesday ahead of the demonstration.
	   Another group, the Movement for National Democracy, demonstrated
at former U.S. military bases in Olongapo and Angeles cities, both
north of Manila.
	   Sonia Soto, a leader of the movement, said security guards at
the former Clark Air Base near Angeles forced them back with
truncheons when they tried to approach a gate to hang a notice
saying Americans were not welcome to return to the facility.
	   About 20 of 700 protesters were hurt in the melee, Soto said.
The former U.S. base has been converted into an industrial and
tourism center.
	   ``The pullout of American troops should be irreversible. We're
warning the public that the government is laying the ground for
their return,'' Soto said.
	   Critics say the pact would limit the Philippine government's
right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the
country, and would also promote prostitution and drag the
Philippines into conflicts between the United States and its
enemies.
	   President Joseph Estrada says the country needs the accord and a
close military alliance with the United States because of the
Philippines' poorly equipped armed forces.

German president meets President Kim

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ German President Roman Herzog on
Tuesday promised support for South Korea's efforts to bring
communist North Korea to peace talks, officials said.
	   Herzog met with President Kim Dae-jung on Tuesday, shortly after
he landed here on a five-day trip aimed at strengthening relations.
	   The two presidents reviewed the latest situation on the divided
Korean peninsula and discussed ways of expanding economic
cooperation, Kim's office said in a statement.
	   On Wednesday, Herzog was to address a forum where some 30 German
businessmen accompanying him will talk about trade and investment
opportunities with their South Korean counterparts.
	   With its economy in its worst slump in years, South Korea is
wooing foreign investors. German investment in South Korea totalled
dlrs 1.1 billion as of late last year.
	   Two-way trade reached dlrs 10.5 billion last year. Germany
exported dlrs 5.8 billion in machinery, electronic and chemical
products here, while South Korea sold Germany dlrs 4.7 billion in
semiconductors, cars and ships.
	   South and North Korea are still technically at war since their
1950-53 war ended without a peace treaty. The United States and
China are working to help the two Koreas negotiate a peace treaty.
	   Invited by President Kim, Herzog was visiting South Korea for
the first time. He leaves South Korea on Saturday after visiting a
BASF chemicals plant in the southern industrial city of Ulsan.

Romania officially broke UN trade embargo to Yugoslavia, says
</HEADLINE>
official

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's former spy chief has alleged
that the country officially broke a U.N. embargo by exporting
almost 50,000 tons of fuel to Yugoslavia, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Virgil Magureanu told a court Monday that that he informed then
President Ion Iliescu and Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu that the Solvent
company western city of Timisoara had exported millions of dollars
of gasoline and diesel to Yugoslavia.
	   Five top executives of the company are on currently trial
charged with smuggling and defrauding the state of 15 billion lei
(then worth millions of dollars), daily Evenimentul Zilei reported.
	   They claim orders to export the fuel came from the government.
	   Magureanu said that the Supreme Defense Council discussed
Solvent's activities in 1994-1995 and interior ministry officials
were sent to guard the pipes and wagons the fuel was contained in.
	   U.N sanctions against Yugoslavia lasted from 1992 to 1996 to
punish Belgrade for allegedly fomenting ethnic warfare in republics
of Croatia and Bosnia which seceded from the Yugoslav federation.
	   Romanians along the shores of the River Danube got rich
overnight as they exported gasoline to their Yugoslav neighbors.
But the government denied it had defied sanctions, claiming it had
lost huge amounts of trade.
	   Iliescu, a former communist, lost elections in 1996 and
reformists came to power, vowing to clean up corruption. Results
have been patchy.

Group appeals for detained Chinese reporter's release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with account from Hong Kong
rights group &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An international press freedom group called on
China's president Tuesday to release a detained Chinese journalist
who has championed the cause of political reform.
	   Shi Binhai's arrest shows ``the severe constraints on
journalists in China,'' the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists said in a letter to President Jiang Zemin.
	   State security agents took Shi from his home in Beijing on Sept.
5. They confiscated notebooks, name cards and other materials. His
family has been given no explanation for the arrest nor told where
Shi is being held.
	   According to an account a Hong Kong-based rights group said
Tuesday came from Shi's wife, Zhang Hong, seven agents were waiting
for Shi when he returned home. They separated the couple and after
an hour took Shi away, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement reported.
	   An editor with the China Economic Times, a reformist newspaper
with loose connections to China's State Council, the 36-year-old
Shi also helped compile the popular book ``Political China: Facing
the Era of Choosing a New Structure.''
	   The Committee to Protect Journalists said unidentified sources
in China were worried Shi's arrest was the result of his work on
the book. The collection of 39 essays by journalists, academics and
former officials addressed the need for changing China's political
structure.
	   The Information Center, however, doubted the book got Shi into
trouble and said another co-editor of the book had not been
approached by police. The Information Center said recent interviews
Shi conducted with ``some important and sensitive personnages'' may
have been the cause.
	   While a reporter for the Shanghai Law Monthly, Shi ran afoul of
the authorities by taking part in student-led democracy
demonstrations in 1989. Arrested in the nationwide crackdown, he
spent two years in prison and government-backed media reports in
Hong Kong branded him an ``agitator.''
	   The committee also noted that Shi's arrest came three days after
security agents detained a freelance producer for the U.S.
television network CBS. Natalie Liu was released after two days and
has since left China to rejoin her husband in the United States.
	   Considering the treatment given Shi and Liu, the committee drew
a bleak picture of the pressures Chinese journalists face.
	   ``With a government-controlled press and little access to due
process and the rule of law, reporters and editors routinely face
the threat of arbitrary arrest and detention as a consequence of
their work,'' the committee said.
	   The letter was the second appeal on Shi's behalf in two days.
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, or Reporters sans
frontieres, sent a letter of protest to Jiang on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and his new prime minister
met in the Kremlin on Tuesday to work on a strategy for dealing
with the country's economic crisis and filling the empty seats in
the Russian cabinet.
	   Russia's political crisis has eased since parliament confirmed
Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister last Friday. But the president
and the premier have yet to offer a detailed program to pull the
country out of its economic tailspin.
	   Primakov has pledged to continue economic reforms but said the
government must also offer social protection to citizens.
	   ``We cannot conduct reforms that affect the people adversely,''
Primakov said. ``If therapy drags out for decades, and no gleam of
light is seen, it is certainly not in the interests of the country,
not in the interests of the people.''
	   So far, Primakov has named two Soviet-era bureaucrats to top
economic positions. Yuri Maslyukov, the former head of Soviet
central planning agency, has been appointed first deputy premier in
charge of economic policy. Viktor Gerashchenko, who served as the
Soviet and Russian chief banker in 1989-1994 was appointed the
Central Bank chairman.
	   The appointments have raised concerns among liberal politicians
that the new government may reverse free-market reforms. However,
both men have served previously in the Yeltsin administration and
have not announced any plans to return to a Soviet-style command
economy.
	   Most Cabinet seats still remain vacant. Yeltsin was planning to
fill some posts Tuesday and all of them within the next few days,
Primakov told reporters after the Kremlin meeting.
	   Primakov said the government's top priority is to pay off wages
and pensions that are months overdue, and he has promised to ease
the burden of inflation to low-income Russians. He said the
government was preparing an emergency budget for the fourth
quarter.
	   However, he offered no immediate recipe how to achieve that,
raising concern that the government will meet its obligations by
simply printing new rubles, which will increase inflation.
Officials on Monday denied reports that the government had already
cranked up the money-printing presses to pay wages.
	   Also, Primakov has asked the International Monetary Fund to
begin talks on the release of the next installment of an existing
loan. However, the IMF wants to first make sure that Russia has
sound economic policies in place.
	   The IMF put together a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia in July, but the first installment was smaller than planned
and the second infusion of dlrs 4.3 billion is likely to be
delayed.
	   The IMF director in charge of Russia, John Odling Smee, was to
arrive in Moscow on Tuesday for talks with Russian officials.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's currency was trading in a band between 7.5
and 10 to the dollar on Tuesday.
	   It traded 8.5 on Monday, up from 11 on Friday and a record low
of about 20 to the dollar last week. The ruble stood at around 6 to
the dollar before the crisis.
	   Analysts said the Russian banks were trying to bring the dollar
down before they have to repay foreign investors on forward
contracts maturing today. Most predicted that the ruble would
plunge again later this week and warned that its fall would
accelerate if the government prints additional rubles to repay
wages.

French Interior Minister better but still can't talk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Five days after he emerged from a coma, French
Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement is getting better but he
still is unable to talk, one of his political allies said Tuesday.
	   Chevenement is improving at a ``better pace'' than expected and
has shown a great desire to communicate, Georges Sarre, acting
president of the Movement of Citizens, told France-2 television.
	   The 59-year-old Chevenement regained consciousness Thursday, a
week after suffering an allergic reaction to anesthesia during a
gall bladder operation.
	   Chevenement, a close ally of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, fell into a coma Sept. 2 following a heart attack during
the surgery.
	   Sarre, who is acting leader of the Movement of Citizens founded
by Chevenement, told France-2 that the Interior Minister still
cannot speak.
	   During his political career, Chevenement has held a number of
other ministry portfolios, including defense, industry, education.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Persian Gulf War
coalition against Iraq.

Libya asks Arab countries to ignore sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has urged Arab countries to ignore the
U.N. sanctions imposed on it six years ago because it has accepted
U.N. demands to hand over for trial two suspects in a passenger jet
bombing, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The Libyan plea came in a memorandum sent to the Arab League
asking the issue be discussed by a meeting of Arab foreign
ministers scheduled Wednesday and Thursday at the headquarters of
the 22-nation league in Cairo, MENA said.
	   In the memorandum, Libya reaffirmed its acceptance of a proposal
for a trial of the two Libyans in the Netherlands by Scottish
judges, the agency said. It added Libya also repeated its call for
certain guarantees for the suspects.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.
	   Libya's statement said that regional organizations, especially
the Organization of African Unity and the Arab League, should have
a major role as guarantors and witnesses in the trial of the two
suspects, MENA added.
	   The Organization of African Unity decided at its June summit to
no longer abide by the sanctions when travel was required for
humanitarian activities or official business. Several African
leaders have violated the sanctions since then.
	   The sanctions, which ban air travel to and from the country,
were imposed in 1992 to try to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
to surrender the two Libyans.
	   Libya claimed the two men could not get a fair trial in England
or the United States. In an effort to resolve the impasse,
Washington and London last month offered to accept a trial before a
Scottish tribunal in the Netherlands.
	   Gadhafi agreed to that in principle but has called for
negotiations with the two countries on the details of the trial and
the suspects' care once they have been transferred to Dutch
custody.

Hong Kong becomes more crowded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's population grew by 2.8 percent last
year, squeezing another 185,000 people into what is already one of
the most crowded places on earth, the government reported Tuesday.
	   About 6.687 million people were living in Hong Kong's 420 sq.
miles (1,092 sq. kilometers) _ much of it uninhabitable because of
hills - by the middle of 1998, compared to 6.525 million a year
ago, a statement said.
	   Immigrants accounted for 87 percent of the population growth, it
said.
	   Hong Kong receives 150 immigrants from mainland China daily.
After Hong Kong reverted back to Chinese rule in July, 1997,
children born in China to at least one Hong Kong parent are
entitled to live in the territory, but they must wait in line _
sometimes for more than a decade _ for a permit granted by the
mainland.

Australia beat India by 145 runs, coasts into semi-final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Captain Steve Waugh scored 100 not
out in an unbroken 171-run partnership with Tom Moody Tuesday to
overpower India and guide Australia into the semi-finals of the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Batting first after being put in to bat, Australia struggled in
the initial overs, losing five wickets for 84 runs by the 20th over
before Waugh and Moody took control to post 255 in 50 overs. India
ended with 110 for nine in 37.2 overs, giving Australia an
impressive 145-run victory.
	   India was unlucky when Moody survived a pad-bat catch appeal in
the 22nd over before he had scored. Television replays showed the
ball bounced off Moody's glove into the hands of the silly point
fielder. In the previous over, wicket-keeper M.S.K. Prasad dropped
a difficult catch from a thick inside edge of Moody's bat during
Anil Kumble's over.
	   But, after those hiccups Waugh and Moody, playing in sweltering
humid heat against a partisan pro-India crowd, steadily built the
innings. Moody made an unbeaten 76 in 103 balls. Waugh faced the
same number of deliveries and hit three fours and a six.
	   Waugh said he will be aiming for the gold medal now. ``A gold
medal ... means a lot as much as a one-day international,'' he
said.
	   Australia will now meet New Zealand in the semi-final. In the
other semi-final it will Sri Lanka against either Barbados or South
Africa, who also were playing Tuesday.
	   ``We didn't bowl too well ... 255 (runs) were too many on this
wicket,'' Indian captain Ajay Jadeja said.
	   India suffered early setbacks as Prasad, opening in place of
Abhay Khuresia who suffered from a heat stroke on the field, was
run out for one. The other opener, V.V. Laxman was the next to go,
looking to play across the line and giving a low catch to Waugh in
the gully off Moody.
	   All hopes now rested on Indian star Sachin Tendulkar who opened
confidently with a drive for three and a meat-of-the-bat pull for a
four. But in the 15th over, Tendulkar tried to play forward to a
superb Damien Fleming delivery that was leaving him and gave a
leading edge catch to keeper Adam Gilchrist. He made 11.
	   Tendulkar, who had scored six centuries in the last 12 innings
against Australia, will leave with a total score of 28 from three
matches in the Commonwealth Games where cricket is being featured
for the first time in a 16-nation competition. However, the games
are not recognized by the International Cricket Council and
Tendulkar's one-day record remains unblemished.
	   After a nominal defense by Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh, the
tailend was wiped out slowly but steadily.

U.S. official warns against currency controls in Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ There is hope for Asia in overcoming
its financial crisis, but currency controls would discourage
foreign investment and plunge the region into deeper distress, a
U.S. trade official said Tuesday.
	   Undersecretary for International Trade David Aaron said recovery
from the crisis will not be easy and will require a ``serious,
sustained commitment'' to trade liberalization and structural
reforms.
	   ``Countries must be careful in their actions,'' he said. ``At a
time when many nations throughout Asia are in need of capital to
help in the restructuring of their economies, measures that make
countries less attractive to foreign investors are likely to carry
a significant cost.''
	   Aaron praised Philippine President Joseph Estrada for taking a
``courageous'' stand in rejecting currency controls like those
imposed this month by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Aaron, who is leading a U.S. trade mission to the Philippines,
met with Estrada on Monday.
	   The Philippines is the third stop for the first high-level U.S.
trade mission to visit Asia since the start of the regional
financial crisis more than a year ago. The mission has traveled to
Malaysia and Singapore and next visits Thailand.
	   Aaron said the financial crisis was a ``classical case of boom
and bust'' in which many Asian countries had been living beyond
their means.
	   ``They were living on borrowed funds. They were living like they
were they were rich. They weren't really rich, they were sort of
rich, and they got heavily indebted,'' he said.
	   Countering some analysts, he said the crisis was not caused by
the failure of the international financial system.
	   ``This is in fact the failure of national policies to come to
grips with the requirements of the global economy,'' he said. ``The
global economy has been very, very good to Asia. The global economy
has made possible this remarkable miracle in Asia, but it does have
some requirements and suddenly the bill came due.''
	   He said the only road to recovery is globalization because the
alternatives _ exchange controls, import substitution and state
management _ do not work.
	   He said Asia countries must keep their borders to their
neighbors open as well, considering that before the crisis, 40
percent of Asia's trade was with Asia.
	   ``Asia will not recover without being able to trade with one
another,'' he said.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berisha comments, government spox urging Berisha
to leave Albania voluntarily; crowd forming in front of party
headquarters; trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, in the wake of armed
clashes on Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted. And it urged armed
Berisha supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party
headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He urged supporters to refrain from violence but announced that
the rally would go on, although not in Tirana's main square as
originally planned but in front of his party's headquarters.
	   And he announced a new rally for Wednesday unless Socialist
Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks were parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   A crowd of approximately 800 formed in front of the building
shortly after 11 a.m., apparently Berisha supporters heeding his
call to protest.
	   Police armored vehicles and concrete barriers blocked the road
between the building and Skanderbeg Square, the original rally
venue about 500 meters (yards) away. Police with rifles took up
position on the roof of the interior ministry building, also only a
few hundred meters (yards) away.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday near the building
remained closed. Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also
cleaned out Nano's villa, in Tirana's government residential
district, on Monday.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened arrest by the government, has called for the Socialist
government to resign, but insists he is not plotting a takeover .
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis in the
continent's poorest nation. Many fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday the Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would
try to arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
Blushi, the government spokesman, refused to confirm or deny that
statement, saying only that justice would be done, and it would be
best for Berisha to leave voluntarily.
	   But the 53-year-old Berisha said he would never leave Albania.
	   He told CNN late Monday that the building takeovers were simply
his supporters' reaction to the slaying of well-known opposition
legislator Azem Hajdari, gunned down along with a bodyguard
Saturday in front of party headquarters. Berisha blames his rival
Nano.
	   Dan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the U.S. and European
envoys had sent a signal that the Democratic Party had ``gone too
far.''
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.

Takanohana, Musashimaru suffer upsets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana and
Hawaii-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru suffered their first
upsets Tuesday, the third day of the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   Yokozuna Wakanohana remained undefeated at 3-0 along with
sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai and No. 11 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Ganyu.
	   Wrestling at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena, No. 1
maegashira Kaio grabbed Takanohana's belt and bulldozed him out for
his first victory against two defeats. Takanohana is 2-1.
	   No. 3 maegashira Asahiyutaka held off Musashimaru's driving
attempt at the ring's edge by turning around the ring and then
tossed him down, leaving both wrestlers at 2-1. Musashimaru's real
name is Fiamalu Penitani.
	   In the day's final bout, Wakanohana slapped komusubi (junior
champion second class) Dejima's face in the initial charge and
pulled him down, handing Dejima his first defeat against two
victories.
	   In other major bouts, yokozuna Akebono, or Chad Rowan, sent out
No. 1 maegashira Tochiazuma with his third thrust for his second
victory against one defeat. Tochiazuma is 0-3.

thrusts and pushed him out and Ganyu thrust out No. 13 maegashira
Asanosho. Minatofuji is 0-3 and Asanosho 2-1.
	   No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
attacked No. 4 maegashira Aogiyama with hand thrusts against the
throat, but Aogiyama fought off and pulled him down, leaving both
wrestlers at 1-2.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, suffered his first defeat against two victories when he
was pushed out by No. 8-ranked Daizen (1-2).
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was
thrown down by No. 2-ranked Mainoumi (2-1) for his second defeat
against one victory.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 49-ranked Yamato, or
American George Kalima, drove out No. 47-ranked Sekiyama and
remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez,
pushed out No. 8-ranked Daihisho and No. 20-ranked Wakaazuma sent
out No. 22-ranked Kimenryu. Both Hoshiandesu and Wakaazuma are 1-1.
	   No. 12-ranked Kaishinzan, or American Henry Armstrong Miller,
was driven out by No. 11-ranked Koubo for his first defeat against
one victory.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan (1-1), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, threw down No.
7-ranked Kotohino.
	   No. 33-ranked Azumakaze (0-2), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano
Kotinda, was driven out by No. 34-ranked Koutoyama.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Heat fells Indian player on the field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Commonwealth-Cricket &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Indian opener Amay Khuresia was
hospitalized after suffering a heat stroke Tuesday while fielding
in an elimination-round Commonwealth Games cricket match against
Australia.
	   Khuresia collapsed at the PKNS grounds in 32-degree Celsius (90
F) heat made more oppressive by the high humidity typical of
tropical Malaysia. He had a 39.5 C (103 F) fever, two degrees (4
degrees F) above normal, Indian physiotherapist Andrew Kokinos
said.
	   He said fever is normal in heat stroke cases.
	   Khuresia did not bat but stayed on the ground while India
struggled to match Australia's score of 255. But after it became
clear that India did not even have an outside chance, and an
emergency turn at the crease by Khuresia could not help, he was
moved to a hospital on a stretcher with a saline drip attached to
his body.
	   A promising youngster, he had scored a match winning 83 against
Canada in India's previous preliminary match.
	   ``We just kept him to see if there was a chance of winning,''
said Chitrak Mitra, the Indian manager.
	   Khuresia's condition is ``not life-threatening'' and the doctors
will decide if he must stay in the hospital overnight, Kokinos
said.

World Bank and Indonesia make new push on corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stung by allegations that millions of
dollars in aid funds were lost to graft, the World Bank and the
Indonesian government announced a new push to clean up corruption
Tuesday.
	   Development Planning Minister Hartarto told a news conference
that the government would protect those who blew the whistle on
corrupt practices within the bureaucracy.
	   The World Bank's representative in Indonesia, Dennis de Tray,
applauded a new willingness by Indonesia to attack the problem,
which flourished under former autocratic President Suharto.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in power and resigned in May after the
economic crisis triggered riots and protests.
	   Since then, new President B.J. Habibie, once a loyal ally of
Suharto, has promised to crack down on corruption.
	   The government is currently carrying out an investigation into
allegations involving Suharto himself, although the former leader
has denied any wrongdoing.
	   ``The new openness in which corruption is being discussed in
Indonesia gives us great hope for us jointly, and finally, coming
to grips with this problem and doing something about it,'' de Tray
said.
	   De Tray said corruption had added unnecessary high costs to
Indonesia's economy and had hurt the growing number of poor.
	   ``Corruption in Indonesia, as we all know, is endemic,
deep-seated and widespread. It will take the best effort of all of
us ... to be successful in our battle against corruption.''
	   Hartarto, who was also a senior minister in Suharto's
government, said many individuals had hesitated to come forward
with allegations of corruption because of fear of reprisals.
	   Private businesses also had stayed silent in fear they would
lose government contracts.
	   ``The government will protect those who come forward to report
corruption cases against retribution,'' Hartarto said adding that
the rights of those accused would also be guaranteed.
	   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Indonesian
officials were believed to have taken more than 20 percent of bank
project money allocated to the sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
	   De Tray acknowledged that corruption had been a problem for the
World Bank in Indonesia, but said the claim that 20 percent of aid
funds had been siphoned off was not based on hard facts or legal
evidence.
	   He said the World Bank and other groups would help Indonesia in
its anti-corruption efforts.

Canadian women shooters win second gold medal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Christina Ashcroft and
Sharon Bowes defended their Commonwealth title Tuesday, claiming a
second gold medal at the shooting meet at Langkawi island.
	   Ashcroft and Bowes took gold in the women's pairs sport rifle
three positions event with 1,133 points. On Monday, they won the
women's pairs air rifle event.
	   Val Martin and Donne Potgieter of South Africa won the silver
with 1,115 points and Scotland's Shirley McIntosh and Janis Thomson
won the bronze with 1,112 points.
	   In other events, Australian Annemarie Forder teamed with
Christine Trefry to win the women's air pistol pairs with a
combined score of 748.
	   They beat New Zealanders Tania Corrigan and Jocelyn Lees, who
scored 747 for the silver medal. Bronze went to Kamisah Abd Jalal
and Suriani Othman of Malaysia, who had 743 points.
	   In men's competition, Jaspal Rana and Ashok Pandit of India won
the gold in the pairs centre fire pistol with 1,154 points.
	   Canada's John Rochon and Metodi Igorov were second with 1,150
and Australians Bruce Quick and Michael Giustiniano scored 1,149
points for the bronze.
	   ``My plan was just to be confident and aggressive on the trigger
and to watch the sights and nothing else,'' Quick said. ``I guess I
didn't stick to the plan. Otherwise it would be a gold medal, not a
bronze.''
	   In men's pairs skeet shooting, Costas Stratis and Antonis
Nicolaides of Cyprus were the gold medal winners with 188 points.
Silver went to Andrew Austin and Drew Harvey of England, who had
one point less.
	   Canada's Douglas McCutcheon and Joe Trinci won the bronze with
186 points.

Water levels remain critical in many places, Rain abates in north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Meuse and other rivers in eastern
Belgium rose to critical levels Tuesday after two days of incessant
rain that caused flooding across the country.
	   Around the eastern city of Liege, reservoirs in the Ardennes
hills had to release excess waters, further swelling rivers below.
Several villages were flooded. In the north of the country, the
army had to plug several breaches in dikes.
	   Fresh rain Tuesday was exacerbating the problems around Liege,
but the rain abated around Antwerp, scene of the worst flooding on
Monday when the heaviest rainfall in decades flooded villages,
highways and railroads.
	   Heavy rain over the past two weeks turned into a nonstop
rainstorm Monday and fears are that downpours in several regions
could last through midweek.

Share prices close higher

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for the
second straight session Tuesday in moderate trading.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 71.61 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 7,733.47. On Monday,
the index had gained 83.38 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
711 million), up from Monday's 3.70 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 474 million).
	   Brokers said shares were boosted by a stronger Hong Kong dollar
and expectations of a possible cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   The Hong Kong dollar strengthened after the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority told banks on Monday that it will continue to convert
their U.S. dollar at the rate of 7.75 Hong Kong dollars for at
least six months.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.80 to the U.S. dollar, but
slight fluctuations in the link are permissible.
	   The Hong Kong market was also lifted by another rally Monday on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average finished 149.85
points _ or 1.9 percent _ higher at 7,945.35.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 60 Hong Kong
cents to 26.20, and Cheung Kong rose 40 cents to 33.60.
	   Banking shares were mixed. Hang Seng Bank rose 50 cents to
46.90, but HSBC Holdings fell 3.50 dollars to 147.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 90 cents to 38.00, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' rose 10 cents to 22.90.

Kenya Revises 97-98 Coffee Exports, Earnings Up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Kenya has revised up its 1997-98 coffee
exports to 70,000 metric tons from 40,000 tons, Paul Kivila, public
relations manager at the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK) told
Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Earlier forecasts had indicated that it would be 40,000 tons
because freak weather had cut output.
	   Kivila said that in spite of the fall in volume, Kenya would
earn about 16 billion to 18 billion Kenyan shillings (KES) from
coffee exports. The annual average is dlrs 18 billion. (KES60  &QC; 
US1)	   He said this export revenue would be achieved despite the
reduced size of the crop because of the good prices this season
(October to September).
	   ``Although we got a smaller crop this season, the value is
relatively good because we experienced good prices, which covered
the shortfall,'' he said.
	   ``Our export estimates for the season are 70,000 metric tons -
we can go beyond this figure or below it but it is our forecast,''
said Kivila, who could not divulge the cumulative export volume and
value for this soon-to-close season.
	   The official however said they expect the industry to recover
next season if the country is not hit by freak weather again.
Output/export volume during the next season is estimated at between
80,000 and 90,000 tons.
	   Annual average volume over the last couple of years has been
80,000 metric tons.
	   Coffee exports account for 25 percent of Kenya's annual export
revenue.
	   However, Kivila said the horticultural industry is threatening
to replace the coffee sector as the third biggest export earner in
Kenya. Tourism and tea are ranked as first and second highest
export earners respectively.
	   ``Coffee is the third highest export earner in Kenya. The
horticultural industry is however growing at a rapid speed and is
threatening to take over,'' he said.

Smoke from forest fires gather over Russia's eastern cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thick clouds of smoke from raging forest fires in
Russia's Far East are hanging over the region's largest city and
have disrupting airplane traffic, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Fires in the forests outside the city of Khabarovsk continue to
spread and are burning out of control in more than 90 separate
areas, up from 60 as recently as last week, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Smoke clouds have drifted over some small towns and continue to
disrupt flights in Khabarovsk, but no human settlements have been
threatened by the fires so far, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Since the spring, the blazes have consumed more than 400,000
hectares (988,000 acres) in the southeast region.
	   Regional officials say that it will take several days of rain or
the approaching winter to douse the fires.

Thai caddies protest against conversion of golf course into park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Caddies have staged a protest against a
plan by the Bangkok governor to turn a state-owned golf course into
a public park, a city official said Tuesday.
	   About 60 caddies from the State Railway of Thailand's golf
course gathered at City Hall Monday demanding Gov. Bhichit Rattakul
call off the plan, saying that the two parks already in the area
were enough.
	   The caddies had agreed in July to be hired by the city once the
State Railway of Thailand handed over the course, so city officials
aren't sure why they have changed their minds, said the spokesman
on condition of anonymity.
	   He said the caddies and the city have set Nov. 1 as a deadline
to come up with a compensation plan.
	   The deadline was set in early July during a standoff between
police and hundreds of caddies who blocked a railway station, slept
on the tracks and seized a train engine to protest the plan.
	   Thailand's unemployment is expected to double to 2 million
workers this year, or about 6 percent of the work force.

British inflation drops to 2.5 percent, hitting government target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation dropped to an annual rate of 2.5
percent last month, hitting the Labor Party government's target for
the first time since January, officials said Tuesday.
	   The underlying inflation rate in August was down from an annual
rate of 2.6 percent in July, 2.8 percent in June and 3.2 percent in
May, the Office of National Statistics reported.
	   Analysts said the trend underlined a slowdown in the economy and
could herald a drop in interest rates _ now at 7.5 percent _ which
business and labor union leaders have long demanded.
	   The Bank of England, seeking to clamp down on inflation, has
raised interest rates six times since Labor won power in May 1997.
This has strengthened the pound, making it tough for exporters to
sell competitively.
	   Interest rates last rose in June, and last week the Bank of
England decided on no change.
	   Ernesto Ramirez, international economist at Bankers Trust, said
the latest drop in inflation increased the chances of the Bank of
England cutting the interest rate in October.
	   ``Since it last raised rates, the international position has
worsened and there has been evidence of a much more broad-based
slowdown, so there should be further grounds for a cut,'' Ramirez
said. ``I think they will be cautious, but we could see rates come
down to 6 percent in 1999.''

Albanian government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berisha comments, government spox urging Berisha
to leave Albania voluntarily; crowd forming in front of party
headquarters; trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, after armed clashes on
Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television. The
statement also said a rally by Berisha's Democratic Party, planned
for 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) would not be permitted.
	   And it urged armed Berisha supporters holed up at downtown
Democratic Party headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He urged supporters to refrain from violence but said the rally
would go on. It would be moved to his party's headquarters from
Tirana's main square,
	   He also said there would be a rally on Wednesday unless
Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a day of
unrest reminiscent of anarchy that lasted for months in 1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of parliament, the state television and radio
building and Nano's office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks were parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   A crowd of approximately 800 formed in front of the building
shortly after 11 a.m., apparently Berisha supporters heeding his
call to protest.
	   Police armored vehicles and concrete barriers blocked the road
between the building and Skanderbeg Square, the original rally
venue about 500 meters (yards) away. Police with rifles took up
position on the roof of the interior ministry building, also only a
few hundred meters (yards) away.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday near the building
remained closed. Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also
cleaned out Nano's villa, in Tirana's government residential
district, on Monday.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened arrest by the government, has called for the Socialist
government to resign, but insists he is not plotting a takeover .
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to end the crisis in the continent's poorest nation. Many
fear the unrest could spread, further complicating the situation in
the neighboring Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday the Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would
try to arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
Blushi, the government spokesman, refused to confirm or deny that
statement, saying only that justice would be done, and it would be
best for Berisha to leave voluntarily.
	   But the 53-year-old Berisha said he would never leave Albania.
	   He told CNN late Monday that the building takeovers were simply
his supporters' reaction to the slaying of well-known opposition
legislator Azem Hajdari, gunned down along with a bodyguard
Saturday in front of party headquarters. Berisha blames his rival
Nano.
	   Dan Everts, chief of the Tirana office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the U.S. and European
envoys had sent a signal that the Democratic Party had ``gone too
far.''
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.

Philippine government considering suspension of peace talks with
</HEADLINE>
rebels &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official now saying no decision has been reached
in grafs 1-2; trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada is
considering a suspension of peace talks with the country's largest
Muslim rebel group because of a series of recent kidnappings, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican, said no final decision has
been made by the president.
	   Earlier in the day, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora had
announced that the talks had been suspended.
	   Zamora said recent kidnappings in the southern Philippines,
including that of an Italian priest, would be a distraction in
peace negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, but
added that the talks could resume after the abductions are solved.
	   The military has said it suspects Muslim rebels were involved in
the kidnappings. Zamora said the government is not blaming the
MILF.
	   The MILF is one of two Muslim rebel groups fighting the
government to establish an independent Islamic state in the
southern region of Mindanao. Although the rebels engage in on and
off talks with officials, they have continued sporadic attacks on
civilian and government targets.
	   Military officials have said active or former MILF guerrillas,
along with members of the Abu Sayyaf, another Muslim rebel group,
are among those suspected of staging three kidnappings in Mindanao
last week, including that of Italian priest Luciano Benedetti.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was kidnapped Sept. 8 from a
church in the remote village of Sibuco in Siraway, Zamboanga del
Norte province, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos were
later released unharmed in a mountainous area.
	   On the same day, three Chinese businessmen from Hong Kong were
seized and forced into a boat by armed men in Sitangkai on the
southernmost island province of Tawi-Tawi.
	   The following day, another group of kidnappers abducted an
80-year-old mother of a Taiwanese businessman, his wife, his
daughter and their maid in Guiwan, also in Zamboanga, police said.
	   While police and military troops continued efforts to rescue the
victims, a Filipino businessman was abducted early Tuesday in
Zamboanga city by suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels wearing police
uniforms.
	   Modesto Natividad, a rice mill owner, was forced into a boat by
his abductors in Manicahan village, about 26 kilometers (16 miles)
from Zamboanga city, and remains missing, police said.
	   MILF Vice Chairman Ghadzali Jaafar, interviewed over DZMM radio
in Manila, told Zamora he resented the talks' suspension and denied
that his group was behind the abductions.
	   Jaafar said the MILF has been investigating the abductions and
passing on information to authorities. Jaafar said he suspected
Benedetti's kidnapping was ordered by a wealthy owner of a logging
company at odds with local officials in Zamboanga del Norte.

Israel eases closure of West Bank, Gaza Strip

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel eased its closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip slightly on Tuesday, allowing 7,000 Palestinian workers
and 3,000 business people to enter Israel.
	   However, Israel's borders will remain sealed to most of the more
than 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, including
tens of thousands of workers with jobs in Israel.
	   The closure was imposed last Thursday to prevent possible
attacks by the Islamic militant group Hamas in Israel. Hamas has
threatened to avenge the deaths of two top fugitives who were
killed by Israeli troops last week. Since 1994, Hamas has killed
scores of Israelis in suicide bombings.
	   Entry of trucks from the Palestinian areas has been resumed, but
they are subjected to long delays due to security checks.
	   The 7,000 workers permitted to return to their jobs Tuesday are
part of a new Israeli program to allow certain Palestinian
employees to continue entering Israeli even during security alerts.
	   The workers must be aged 28 or over and married and must have
worked in Israel for at least two years. Their employers must be
able to transport them to and from the border checkpoints, and to
accommodate them overnight near the work site should the need
arise.
	   Each employer must also appoint a security officer responsible
for bringing the workers to a safe place to protect them from
attacks by Israeli ultranationalists in the event of a Hamas
attack, said Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the government's chief
policy adviser on Palestinian affairs.
	   The closures cause great economic hardship in the Palestinian
areas, where unemployment is high. It also harms Israeli employers
who are dependent on Palestinian labor.

Southern African leaders commend foreign governments for propping
</HEADLINE>
up Kabila &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Southern African leaders commended
the governments of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia for sending
military forces to save Congolese President Laurent Kabila from
overthrow.
	   The 14-nation Southern African Development Community late Monday
praised the three for sending troops, tanks and warplanes to defeat
``the illegal attempt by rebels and their allies to capture the
capital city Kinshasa and other strategic areas.''
	   The annual summit ended, however, with no progress towards
achieving its goals of a cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo.
	   In a rebuff to Kabila, the summit strongly called for talks that
will include the rebels, and for progress towards democracy.
	   ``The summit emphasized the need for all political actors in
Congo to commit themselves to orderly and peaceful transition to
multi-party democracy,'' a SADC communique said.
	   Kabila crushed hopes for an immediate end to his country's
6-week-old civil war by refusing to negotiate. He has repeatedly
accused Uganda and Rwanda of supporting Congolese rebels intent on
overthrowing his year-old government.
	   The two countries backed a rebellion that toppled late dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, and installed Kabila as president in May 1997.
	   The summit also condemned Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's
rebel UNITA, as ``a war criminal'' for failing to adhere to a peace
pact. It said UNITA has not fully demilitarized its armed forces,
nor has it fully participated in a government of national unity and
a national defense force.
	   The Congo rebels _ made up of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ have made it
clear they will not abide by any agreement they did not help to
negotiate.
	   The rebels say Kabila has failed to implement democratic
reforms, and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and fostering
ethnic divisiveness.
	   The rebellion was on the verge of toppling Kabila until Zambia,
Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened and easily drove rebels out of
western Congo.
	   Rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern Congo,
along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders, although their headquarters
came under attack for the first time Monday.

Impotent Britons still must wait for free Viagra, despite EU
</HEADLINE>
approval &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Impotency sufferers in Britain will not be able to
obtain the performance-enhancing drug Viagra free from the National
Health Service until further government scrutiny, despite the
drug's licensing Tuesday by the European Union.
	   Health Secretary Frank Dobson believes the price of Viagra,
which it is estimated would cost the government health service
between 50 million (dlrs 82.5 million) and 150 million pounds (dlrs
247.5 million) yearly, would first have to be lowered.
	   ``That money isn't there, so therefore we have to take the money
away from maternity services for women having babies or people who
are being treated for cancer or people who are being treated for
heart disease,'' Dobson told BBC Radio 4's Today program Tuesday.
	   ``Most people in this country don't think we should finance it
through the health service as a sort of recreational drug at the
expense of doing things which are more important,'' he said.
	   Dobson, who has been criticized by some doctors and impotence
sufferers for his decision, said he would issue guidelines for
obtaining Viagra through the NHS after more discussion, including
talks with the drug's U.S. manufacturer, Pfizer Inc.
	   Dobson suggested sufferers might be able to receive the drug
after consultation with a neurologist in ``specific clinical
circumstances'' or as part of infertility treatments.
	   Britons still could buy Viagra privately.

Malaysian police round up ousted Cabinet minister's colleagues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister said his personal secretary was detained Tuesday as part
of a mounting police crackdown on his colleagues.
	   ``They're gradually picking away people,'' said Anwar Ibrahim,
claiming a third of his close associates have been arrested and
coerced ``to admit certain things _ treason, selling government
secrets or whatever.''
	   Anwar was sacked as finance chief and deputy prime minister by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after clashing with his
mentor on economic policy.
	   Since then, Anwar has gone on a campaign calling for political
reform, attracting thousands of supporters to rallies and speeches
_ and angering the authorities.
	   Anwar said that police arrested Mohamad Ahmad, his former
private secretary at the Finance Ministry, early Tuesday morning
and he had not been heard from since.
	   ``Until now, no news,'' Anwar told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
	   Anwar also said that another private secretary, Azmin Ali, had
been notified Tuesday of his imminent arrest. Anwar's adopted
brother, Sukma Dermawan, was detained last week.
	   At a late-night rally outside his house Monday, Anwar said that
a close friend, Munawar Anees, was arrested under the country's
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment without
trial.
	   ``Is this a police state or not? What's happening to this
country?'' Anwar had shouted through a microphone to thousands of
supporters crammed into his backyard.
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged with any crime, he
has been accused of leaking state secrets, sedition, tampering with
police investigations and having sex with several women and a man.
	   Mahathir, who has been in power for 17 years, has not given
details about why he dismissed his deputy, saying only that Anwar
was immoral and unfit to lead.
	   On Tuesday, Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament
and Anwar's one-time chief antagonist, stopped by Anwar's house to
to inquire about the recent arrests.
	   Lim told reporters that Anwar's dismissal and the growing number
of his arrested associates raised ``grave concerns'' about the
country's handling of human rights.
	   ``It has raised a very grave question as to whether Mahathir has
become an investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury all in one,''
Lim said.
	   Lim's son, Lim Guan Eng, recently began serving an 18-month
prison term for writing a pamphlet that raised questions about the
country's judicial system.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES crowd growing, moving to square; color.
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered barricaded rebels to turn in their
weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, in the wake of armed
clashes on Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television.
	   But Berisha supporters defied the ban. About 3,000 people had
formed on the main Tirana square by noon, and the crowd size was
growing.
	   Many demonstrators flashed the two-fingered victory sign but the
crowd was quiet. Around the periphery of the square, dozens of
police cars were drawn up, lights flashing and sirens howling in a
show of presence.
	   The cars and several police vans close to the square were filled
with sub-machine-gun carrying officers, some wearing stocking
masks. Police, speaking through a loudspeaker mounted on a car,
exhorted passersby to keep moving.
	   In banning the rally, the Interior Ministry also urged Berisha
supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party headquarters to
lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He urged supporters to refrain from violence but announced that
the rally would go on. And he announced a new rally for Wednesday
unless Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks were parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   In an apparent concession to authorities, Democratic Party
leaders had said Tuesday's rally would be held not at the main
Skanderbeg Square but in front of their headquarters, and
approximately 800 people had formed in front of the building
shortly before noon.
	   The crowd then moved off toward the square, about 500 meters
(yards) away, joined by others, who passed police armored vehicles
and concrete barriers on the main road between the building and the
square.
	   Police with rifles took up position on the roof of the interior
ministry building, also only a few hundred meters (yards) away.

have recaptured the town of Kibumba about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
from the eastern city of Goma, state-controlled radio reported
Tuesday.
	   Goma, on the border with Rwanda, has served as the headquarters
for a rebel movement trying to oust Kabila since the start of
August.
	   ``The aggressors are fleeing their positions throughout the
area,'' Voice of the People radio said.
	   Government-allied troops took the town of Kibumba after
launching an earlier attempt to drive the rebels from Goma.
	   After a six-hour battle for Goma on Monday, the rebels were
still apparently in control of the lakeside town. They also still
held the city's airport and radio station _ primary targets of the
government force.
	   The push on Goma comes after a remarkable month of back and
forth fighting. Insurgent fighters drove all the way to Kinshasa at
the tail end of August, but were stopped on the capital's eastern
suburbs by Angolan and Zimbabwean soldiers fighting on behalf of
Kabila.
	   The tide in this 7-week-old war has turned and the government
now has the rebel side on the defensive and battling to hold on to
its stronghold positions in eastern Congo.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and former
members of Kabila's military _ said they wanted to topple the
government and accused Kabila of corruption, nepotism and
tribalism.
	   Kabila has repeatedly claimed the Congolese rebels are backed by
Rwanda and Uganda, which helped him oust dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
in May 1997. Both countries have denied the allegations, but
witnesses have seen Ugandan and Rwandan troops and weapons deep in
Congo.

Myanmar to US paper: bash Clinton, not our military government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military government told a
leading American newspaper on Tuesday that it should stop
demonizing its leaders and focus instead on President Clinton.
	   In a response to a Washington Post editorial that criticized the
government for arresting democracy activists and violating human
rights, the junta said the paper was trying to cover up America's
falling standards.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962.
	   ``While Americans are busy worrying about whether the President
can avoid impeachment or survive, unimpeached in an increasingly
untenable situation, the Post flies off on a tangent and devotes an
entire editorial column to denigrate Myanmar,'' the government said
in statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok.
	   ``This attempt to deflect attention from the growing crisis at
home makes a statement about how the U.S. is failing to live up to
the high standard expected of it,'' the government said.
	   In April 1997, President Clinton slapped economic and trade
sanctions on Myanmar for its repression of democracy activists and
alleged failure to curb heroin trafficking. Myanmar is the world's
second largest producer of opium, the raw material for heroin.
	   ``It is indeed odd that the Post should be seeking to take issue
with the Myanmar government at a time when the entire world is
focusing on the President's moment of reckoning. Surely, it is time
to stop demonizing the Myanmar Government and come to grips with
reality,'' the statement said.
	   Since May, Myanmar's military government has arrested 782
members of the National League for Democracy, the political party
of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   More than half the arrests have come during the past two weeks
as the military foiled an attempt by the NLD to convene the
parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly, but the
military refused to honor the result.
	   The current military leadership came to power in 1988 after
gunning down more than 3,000 protesters in a nationwide democracy
uprising.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin conferred with his new
prime minister in the Kremlin and began making appointments Tuesday
to a Cabinet that must deal with the country's economic crisis.
	   Russia's political crisis has eased since parliament confirmed
Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister last Friday. But the president
and the premier have yet to offer a detailed program to pull the
country out of its economic tailspin.
	   Primakov has pledged to continue economic reforms but said the
government must also offer social protection to citizens.
	   ``We cannot conduct reforms that affect the people adversely,''
Primakov said. ``If therapy drags out for decades, and no gleam of
light is seen, it is certainly not in the interests of the country,
not in the interests of the people.''
	   So far, Primakov has named two Soviet-era bureaucrats to top
economic positions. Yuri Maslyukov, the former head of Soviet
central planning agency, has been appointed first deputy premier in
charge of economic policy. Viktor Gerashchenko, who served as the
Soviet and Russian chief banker in 1989-1994 was appointed the
Central Bank chairman.
	   The appointments have raised concerns among liberal politicians
that the new government may reverse free-market reforms. However,
both men have served previously in the Yeltsin administration and
have not announced any plans to return to a Soviet-style command
economy.
	   Meanwhile, the Communist Party has distanced itself from the new
administration, saying it would be ``inexpedient'' to join the
cabinet. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that the
appointment of Maslyukov, a Communist, was a Kremlin initiative,
not the party's proposal.
	   Most Cabinet seats still remain vacant. Yeltsin was planning to
fill some posts Tuesday and all of them within the next few days,
Primakov told reporters after the Kremlin meeting.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our Home Is
Russia parliament faction, said on Tuesday he had accepted the post
of deputy prime minister in charge of financial issues. Shokhin
previously served in the cabinet as economics minister at the start
of Russia's free-market reforms.
	   Primakov said the government's top priority is to pay off wages
and pensions that are months overdue, and he has promised to ease
the burden of inflation to low-income Russians. He said the
government was preparing an emergency budget for the fourth
quarter.
	   However, he offered no immediate recipe how to achieve that,
raising concern that the government will meet its obligations by
simply printing new rubles, which will increase inflation.
Officials on Monday denied reports that the government had already
cranked up the money-printing presses to pay wages.
	   ``We will find the necessary solutions to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Primakov said after the meeting with Yeltsin.
	   Also, Primakov has asked the International Monetary Fund to
begin talks on the release of the next installment of an existing
loan. However, the IMF wants to first make sure that Russia has
sound economic policies in place.
	   The IMF put together a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia in July, but the first installment was smaller than planned
and the second infusion of dlrs 4.3 billion is likely to be
delayed.
	   The IMF director in charge of Russia, John Odling Smee, was to
arrive in Moscow on Tuesday for talks with Russian officials.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's currency, which has been gaining strength in
recent days, was trading in a band between 7.5 and 10 to the dollar
on Tuesday.
	   Analysts said Russian banks were trying to bring the dollar down
before they have to repay foreign investors on forward contracts
maturing today. Most predicted that the ruble would plunge again
later this week.

Asian countries balk at implementing free trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting over, U.S. says talks stalled
by Japan &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUANTAN, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan and other nations have stalled
progress on trade liberalization among Pacific Rim countries by
refusing to open forests and fisheries to foreign competition,
American delegates said Tuesday.
	   Senior officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group
finished a three-day meeting with no new trade pact for APEC
leaders to sign when they meet in November.
	   The U.S. delegation blamed Japan as the holdout, but other
countries also balked at committing to details, although they
declared their support for the idea of opening up nine key
industries by next year under the Early Voluntary Sector
Liberalization pact.
	   ``We're all for liberalization,'' said Andrew Hsia, head of
Taiwan's delegation. ``All the economies are committed, but we're
all so diverse. We're all asking for maximum flexibility in certain
sectors, especially in fishing and forestry.''
	   During the last APEC meeting in northern Borneo in June, Japan
stone-walled against liberalizing fisheries and forestry, the
sectors it sees as most vulnerable to foreign competition. Japanese
delegates held to that stance stance this week, saying it would not
make any concessions in those areas.
	   As the world's second largest economy, Japan has ``a
responsibility to make this succeed,'' Don Phillips, deputy head of
the U.S. delegation, said at the end of the meeting. ``They have to
work it out pragmatically rather than say they can't do anything.
It's really up to Japan.''
	   With nothing agreed upon by the senior officials, there remans a
lot of work to do by November. Phillips said, ``We are hopeful by
November we'll have something positive to announce.''
	   Once completed, the plan would lift trade barriers in
environmental products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry,
toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical products and
telecommunications.
	   Russian delegate Andrei Denisov said that the economic and
currency crises plaguing Russia would make it difficult for its
wobbly economy to be immediately exposed to unfettered trade among
APEC countries.
	   Liberalization should be carried out ``in an optimal, reasonable
way'' that will not ruin local businesses vulnerable to foreign
competition, Denisov said.
	   ``We're ready to participate in all nine sectors, partially and
conditionally, on the basis of volunteerism,'' Wang Yusheng, head
of the Chinese delegation, said Monday.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join in November.

Asian stock markets close mixed; Indonesian shares slump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS and UPDATES with closing figures for all markets

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the key index in Jakarta slumping 8.9 percent on speculation that
Indonesia plans to implement Malaysian-style currency controls.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 28.442 points,
closing at a new five-year low of 292.153.
	   Central bank Governor Sjahril Sabirin and President B.J. Habibie
both later denied the speculation, saying Indonesia isn't
considering implementing currency controls and would continue to
let the rupiah float.
	   Meanwhile, the rupiah was trading stronger at 10,850 to the U.S.
dollar in the afternoon.
	   Japan's financial markets were closed for a national holiday.
	   Philippine shares closed higher for the second straight session,
buoyed by bargain-hunting following Wall Street's overnight gains.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 39.64 points,
or 3.6 percent, to 1,140.40.
	   Singapore shares also closed sharply higher as the market
focuses on hopes that industrialized countries may be able to pull
Asia out of its doldrums, dealers said. The Straits Times Index
closed 2.8 percent, or 24.45 points, to 902.28.
	   Dealers said U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for an urgent
meeting of leading industrialized nations to devise a strategy to
encourage global growth has fueled expectations that Asia could
turn around quicker than expected.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for the second straight
session.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, rose 71.61 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at
7,733.47. On Monday, the index had gained 83.38 points.
	   Brokers said shares were boosted by a stronger Hong Kong dollar
and expectations of a possible cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   The Hong Kong market was also lifted by another rally Monday on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average finished 149.85
points _ or 1.9 percent _ higher at 7,945.35.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed sharply higher, with a
consecutive rise on Wall Street triggering buying across most
sectors. The All Ordinaries Index rose 44.1 points, or 1.8 percent,
to 2,554.3.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher, with
brokers saying the surge reflected stronger international financial
markets and improved investor confidence. The NZSE-40 Capital Index
rose 43.37 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,762.63.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower. The market's key
Weighted Stock Price Index slipped 2.21 points, or 0.03 percent, to
6,857.96.
	   SEOUL: Share prices lower on continued selling by foreign
investors because of the downgrading of four local banks' ratings
by Standard and Poor's. The Korea Composite stock Price Index fell
3.95 points, or 1.2 percent, to 310.29.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: The benchmark Composite Index, which tracks share
prices of 100 key stocks, fell 1.0 percent, or 4.16 points, to
389.08.
	   BANGKOK Thai share prices closed slightly lower. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index slipped 0.26 points, or 0.1 percent, to
211.08.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES crowd growing, moving to square; color.
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered rebels to turn in their weapons.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ warned of a tough response to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha, after armed clashes on
Monday between them and government security forces.
	   Police have been authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if
opposed, said the statement, read on state television.
	   But Berisha supporters defied the ban. About 3,000 people had
gathered in the main Tirana square by noon, (1000 GMT) and more
were arriving.
	   Many demonstrators flashed the two-fingered victory sign but the
crowd was mostly quiet. Around the square, stationary police cars
waited with flashing lights howling sirens.
	   The cars and several police vans close to the square were filled
with sub-machine gun carrying officers, some wearing stocking
masks. Police, speaking through a loudspeaker mounted on a car,
told people to move along.
	   In banning the rally, the Interior Ministry also urged Berisha
supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party headquarters to
lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   But Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli
Teta to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He urged supporters to refrain from violence but said the rally
would go on. And he promised a new rally for Wednesday unless
Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a day of
unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in 1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces wrested back from Berisha's men
control of parliament, the state television and radio building and
Nano's office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets as looters broke
into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city, firing in the
air.
	   Two of the tanks were parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters on Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. Nearby, about
half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns could be
seen.
	   In an apparent concession to authorities, Democratic Party
leaders had said Tuesday's rally would be held not at the main
Skanderbeg Square but in front of their headquarters, and
approximately 800 people had formed in front of the building
shortly before noon.
	   The crowd then moved off toward the square, about 500 meters
(yards) away, joined by others, who passed police armored vehicles
and concrete barriers on the main road between the building and the
square.
	   Police with rifles took up position on the roof of the interior
ministry building, also only a few hundred meters (yards) away.

Armed Congolese soldiers flee to Tanzania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Some 100 Congolege soldiers have
fled with their weapons to Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika to
escape rebel forces in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a
newspaper and an official said Tuesday.
	   Kigoma regional commissioner Ukiwaona Ditopile Mzuzuri said by
telephone the Congolese soldiers have been trickling into the lake
port of Kigoma, and Tanzanian authorities have not yet decided what
to do with them.
	   Three soldiers identified as Staff Sgts. Bomashi bin Bombule,
Mbenza Managa and Kiyakesidi Ankeka told the Daily News newspaper
of fierce fighting between government forces and rebels seeking to
oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Rebels still control most of the major towns in eastern Congo,
but there are growing reports of fighting in the area around
Kalemie, the major port on the Congolese side of the lake, 100
kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Kigoma.
	   The rebellion broke out Aug. 2.
	   The U.N. refugee agency said 258 civilians had also arrived in
Kigoma over the weekend, the Daily News reported Tuesday.
	   Jean Durieux, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said there were 4,648 Congolese refugees in Kigoma area,
some who arrived in late 1996 when Kabila began the eight-month
rebellion that ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Duriex said the refugee agency was not caring for the soldiers.
	   ``That is not our business because we strictly deal with
civilian refugees,'' Duriex said.
	   Kigoma, on the eastern shore the lake about 1,100 kilometers
(about 680 miles) northwest of Dar es Salaam, has shipping links
with eastern Congo.
	   The newspaper reported the soldiers as saying they were seeking
temporary refuge and planned to return home and continue fighting
in Moba, Baraka and Uvira ports on Congo's side of the lake.
	   Kabila claims Rwanda and Uganda are backing the current
rebellion, a charge both countries deny.

India slowly moving toward signing test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian officials are trying to build
national consensus they say they must have before pledging to the
world not to repeat nuclear weapons tests.
	   The process is likely to be slow, even though Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said last week his government was not
only ready to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but was
already as good as adhering to the pact known as the CTBT.
	   India needs no more tests after its series of explosions deep
under its western deserts in May, Vajpayee said.
	   The blasts prompted answering tests from neighbor and rival
Pakistan, with whom India has fought three conventional wars. The
United States and other countries, fearing nuclear war could one
day break out in this volatile region, imposed economic sanctions
on both countries and demanded they sign the CTBT unconditionally
	   But given India's years of strong opposition to CTBT, the
government must now tread very carefully if it wants to change
direction without sparking public outcry.
	   For years, demonizing the CTBT seemed to be the one policy on
which the country's many and combative political parties could
agree. The ban was denounced as doing too little to encourage
disarmament while denying most of the world the chance to catch up
with the nuclear know-how Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States had developed over decades of testing.
	   Several parties, particularly those on the left, continue to
deride the CTBT even as Vajpayee's conservative Bharatiya Janata
Party prepares to sign it.
	   ``India's decision not to sign the CTBT rests on a national
consensus .... Any revision of that must also be based on a
national consensus,'' The Pioneer newspaper said in an editorial
Monday. ``This means that the terms of a final settlement have to
be discussed threadbare and nationwide before they are ratified.''
	   Jaswant Singh, Vajpayee's chief defense and foreign affairs
adviser, laid out the government's position in an article titled
``Against Nuclear Apartheid'' in this month's issue of the
US-published magazine Foreign Affairs.
	   He decried the division of the world into nuclear haves and
have-nots, then declared that India, thanks to its tests, was now
as much a have as Britain, China, France, Russia or the United
States.
	   As a nuclear power, India can now also brush aside the
restraints imposed by the CTBT, its government argues. Such
reasoning appeals to Indian pride, but angers those who supported
the treaty when few other Indians did.
	   ``India is not joining the CTBT out of some deep commitment to
joining the forces of disarmament, but because it sees that as the
only way of legitimizing what it has done,'' said Achin Vanaik of
the Movement in India for Nuclear Disarmament.
	   But whatever its reasons for doing so, Vanaik said, signing the
CTBT will subject India to international checks to ensure it moves
no closer to developing a nuclear arsenal.
	   Political observer K. Subrahmanyan, writing in the Times of
India Monday, said India must get something in return for making
such a sacrifice: access to nuclear technology it can use for its
energy programs, but has been denied because the material also can
be used for weapons programs.
	   Singh, in ongoing nuclear talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott, may be trying to strike such a bargain. But
publicly Washington has taken a hard line, making clear the best
India can hope for is an end to economic sanctions.
	   President Bill Clinton's trip this year to India and Pakistan
was postponed indefinitely after the May tests, and U.S. officials
said as recently as early September that New Delhi and Islamabad
had made too little progress on nuclear issues to justify putting
the visit back on Clinton's schedule.
	   When it was first proposed early this year, Clinton's trip was
seen as a sign of improving relations long strained by nuclear
differences and other issues. No U.S. president has visited India
in two decades, since Jimmy Carter.

Cannibal recipe revived to provide new preservation technique
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A recipe once used to prepare human flesh by
Pacific Island cannibals is being revived to preserve fruit in an
effort to expand the region's processed food industry, researchers
said Tuesday.
	   British food scientist Richard Beyer, director of the University
of the South Pacific's Institute of Applied Science, said the
recipe is one of a number of preservation methods the university is
working on.
	   If marketed properly, Beyer also expects it to be popular with
tourists as a humorous product.
	   ``There's a fortune in it,'' Beyer predicted Tuesday. ``It
doesn't matter what is in it because nobody is going to eat it. The
tourists are just going to buy it for their mother-in-law.''
	   The institute is working in collaboration with Associate
Professor Sakaris of Australia's University of Queensland, who
Beyer said had stumbled onto a traditional recipe believed to be
used in the semi-preservation of human flesh.
	   It would be made of a fruit base, using techniques handed down
by cannibal tribes of the Pacific for generations, but now thought
lost.
	   Until the 1860's, the Fiji Islands were notorious for
cannibalism. Large numbers of prisoners taken in tribal wars were
cooked and eaten in massive feasts.

Boldon, Fredericks, Komen, Mutola favored for titles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Now it's time for the rest of the
Commonwealth to fight back.
	   Powered by its dominant swimmers, Australia has won 60 percent
of the gold medals so far at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Now some of the biggest names in athletics are setting
themselves up for gold medal glory.
	   And they're not Australian.
	   Ato Boldon of Trinidad, Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and
Obadele Thompson of Barbados are the three main contenders for gold
in the biggest event, the men's 100 meters, and Boldon says the
world record is in danger.
	   Kenya's Daniel Komen, the world 5,000 meters champion, runs the
1,500 and Canada's Michael Smith is gunning for his third decathlon
title in a row.
	   Okkert Brits, the only Commonwealth competitor to clear 6.00
meters, is slated to go in the pole vault for South Africa and
former world record holder and European champion Steve Backley goes
in the javelin for England.
	   Maria Mutola of Mozambique, former world champion and three-time
world titlist indoors, is favored to win the women's 800 meters and
Kenya's world 10,000 meter champion Sally Barsosio goes in the
5,000.
	   Olympic champion and world silver medalist Deon Hemmings is
aiming for a 400m hurdles gold for Jamaica and Ashia Hansen,
England's indoor world indoor record holder for the triple jump,
will compete even though she hasn't fully recovered from a leg
injury.
	   The field will include several more European champions in
100-meter star Darren Campbell of England, Scotland's 200m titlist
Doug Walker and Iwan Thomas, who will run the 400 for Wales. Denise
Lewis, the Olympic bronze and world silver medalist, defends the
heptathlon title for England.
	   The field would have been even stronger but Colin Jackson, world
record holder for the 110 meters hurdles, has pulled out of the
Welsh team and England's Jonathan Edwards, world record holder for
the triple jump has withdrawn injured.
	   Canada's world and Olympic titlist and world record holder
Donovan Bailey said long ago he wouldn't compete and is sidelined
anyway because of an Achilles tendon injury.
	   The Australians have hit injury problems too.
	   Cathy Freeman, world 400m champion and Olympic silver medalist,
is out with foot trouble and Tim Forsyth may be unable to defend
his high jump title because of an ankle injury.
	   The Nigerians won three golds, four silvers and four bronzes at
the last Games in Victoria, British Columbia. But their country has
been expelled from the Commonwealth because of human rights
violations and their absence here also has weakened the field and
will make Boldon's 100m task a little easier.
	   Hours after jetting in from his training camp in Los Angeles,
Boldon, who is world champion for 200 meters, said the hot humid
conditions, allied to a friendly track, were ideal for a world
record attempt.
	   The Trinidadian, who has twice run 9.86 this season, said he
could eventually lower Bailey's mark of 9.84 to something really
spectacular.
	   ``I think I could run in the vicinity of 9.80 or even better,''
he said. ``To break the world record you need humidity, heat, a
fast track and a wind that's either positive or not in my face.
	   ``So far, here I see everything falling into line. I feel
ready.''
	   Fredericks, who flew into Kuala Lumpur Tuesday after competing
in the World Cup at a much cooler Johannesburg, has been listed to
run in Wednesday's 100 heats although his appearance here has been
in doubt.
	   The Namibian, twice a runner up at the Olympics, was upset with
his country's Prime Minister, Hage Geingob, who said that boxer
Harry Simon, a newly crowned world champion, had overtaken the
sprinter as the nation's No. 1 sportsman because he had a title.
	   Thompson comes into the meet with the second fastest 100m time
of the year, a 9.87 run in Johannesburg on Friday although it was
helped by being at altitude.
	   Campbell's preparations have been hampered by injury and
Canada's main hopes lie with Glenroy Gilbert, owner of two world
and one Olympic gold medals in relays but with a best of 10.10.

IOC sets meeting with sports federations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The IOC will meet with leaders of
international sports federations this month to seek their
endorsement for a proposed Olympic agency to lead the worldwide
fight against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   IOC director general Francois Carrard said Tuesday the meeting
with Olympic summer sports federations would take place in
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Oct. 27.
	   ``We certainly aim at getting on board the entire Olympic
movement,'' Carrard said. ``We have received preliminary very
strong encouragement from all the major players. We are quite
optimistic there is a general will to proceed.''
	   The IOC announced last month, at an emergency meeting in
Lausanne, that it planned to set up a special agency to coordinate
drug-testing programs around the world.
	   Carrard said the IOC hopes to get final approval for the project
during the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping conference in Lausanne.
	   The summit was called in the wake of this summer's drug scandals
at the Tour de France, where riders and team officials were
implicated in cases of systematic doping.
	   Planning for the February conference has been the main topic of
discussions at the IOC executive board meetings in Seoul.
	   Carrard said the four IOC vice presidents were close to
finalizing the makeup of their working groups on the main themes of
the conference: protection of athletes, political and legal issues,
ethics and prevention, and financial questions.
	   Vice president Dick Pound of Canada, in charge of the financial
issues, said the IOC planned to finance the drug agency through
Olympic television rights fees and sponsorship revenues.
	   Pound said the IOC would also ask national Olympic committees,
international federations, sponsors, governments and pharmaceutical
companies to contribute.
	   Carrard said the IOC would open consultations in November with
governments on getting their assistance in fighting drug use in
sports. The governments of Australia and the United States, hosts
of the next two Olympics, would be among those consulted.

20,000 farmers gather for anti-government rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Some 20,000 farmers rallied in Seoul
on Tuesday to protest rising interest rates on their huge debt and
demand that the government help shore up prices of farm products.
	   It was the first major protest by farmers since financial
turmoil engulfed South Korea late last year, driving up interest
rates and forcing tens of thousands of businesses and households
into bankruptcy.
	   ``Guarantee our livelihood!'' elderly farmers chanted during the
rally in a Seoul park. They also waved small red flags and wore
headbands carrying similar messages.
	   Traffic backed up for blocks as 400 buses parked near the rally
point in southern Seoul and unloaded farmers, some of whom unfurled
large banners criticizing the government's agricultural policy.
	   Brief scuffles erupted when police tried to block student
activists from joining the farmers. But no serious injuries were
reported.
	   About 10,000 police stood guard to prevent violence.
	   South Korean farmers owed an estimated 30 trillion won (dlrs 22
billion) in bank loans, about half of which comes due by the end of
next year.
	   In the 1980s and early 1990s, farmers took out cheap loans under
government programs aimed at restructuring South Korea's outdated
farm industry ahead of the World Trade Organization's 1994 free
trade pact.
	   Many farmers used the loans to buy machinery and lend plots to
mass-produce farm products recommended by the government. But the
new policy has often led to oversupply and steep price falls.
	   On Tuesday, farmers demanded a two-year delay in debt repayment
and up to 3-percent cuts in interest rates.
	   ``If the government does not deal with this problem quickly, the
whole farm industry will collapse,'' said a statement from
Tuesday's protesters.
	   About 6 million of the country's 44 million people are involved
in farm-related industries.

Netanyahu to Arafat: `It's decision time'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Netanyahu, Palestinian
negotiators; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Saying ``it's decision time,'' Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told the Palestinians on Tuesday they would have
to commit to a relentless campaign against Islamic militants if
they want Israel to hand over more West Bank land.
	   Once such guarantees are given, a deal on a troop pullback can
be struck quickly, Netanyahu told reporters.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, blamed Israel for lack of progress,
saying Netanyahu has yet to accept a U.S. compromise plan for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and a
blueprint for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians accepted the proposal several months ago.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross has been trying for the past week to
narrow the gaps between the two sides. However, he has made no
apparent progress and it appeared increasingly likely he would
return to Washington empty-handed by the end of the week.
	   The Palestinians demanded that Ross publicly blame Israel for
the failure of his mission.
	   ``Mr. Ross is still continuing his efforts to get an Israeli
`yes' on the American initiative, but if he can't, then at least he
must ... clarify what happened during his visit and that Israel is
responsible for the deadlock,'' said the chief Palestinian
negotiator, Saeb Erekat.
	   Israel has said the scope of withdrawal was no longer an issue,
pointing to its offer to hand over 10 percent of the land in full.
The remaining 3 percent would be declared a nature reserve, with
land use restrictions for the Palestinians and Israel retaining
control over security.
	   The Palestinians have denied they have accepted the offer and
said it the size of the pullback was still the key item on the
agenda.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday that security was the main issue.
	   ``Mr. Arafat has to take a decision,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
Does he want an agreement? ... If he wants an agreement, he'll get
one, quickly. But he also has to understand that that agreement
enables the Palestinian Authority to fight their terrorists, not
merely in words but in deeds.''
	   ``So this is decision time,'' Netanyahu added.
	   On Tuesday, Ross planned talks with mid-level Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators, U.S. officials said.
	   On Wednesday, he was to brief Jordanian leaders in Amman and on
Thursday, he was to hold another round of talks with Netanyahu and
Arafat.
	   In other developments Tuesday:
	   __ Israel eased its closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
allowing 7,000 Palestinian workers and 3,000 business people to
enter Israel. Israel had sealed its borders pre-emptively last week
after the Islamic militant group Hamas threatened to carry out
attacks in Israel in response to the killing of two top Hamas
fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   __ In the West Bank village of Zattara, an Israeli motorist
opened fire on Palestinian teen-agers stoning his car, and injured
a 15-year-old boy, villagers said. The army confirmed there was a
shooting and said it was investigating the incident.

13 international maritime commanders meet in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Maritime commanders from 13 nations met
Tuesday in Bahrain to enhance naval cooperation among the world's
countries.
	   The main sponsor of the meeting is the United States, and U.S.
Vice Adm. Charles Moore, commander of the Navy's 5th Fleet based in
Bahrain, said the meeting would help fulfill the mission of
maintaining stability in the Middle East.
	   ``This conference will give us an opportunity to meet together
face to face and deepen relations as nations and improve ability to
operate together,'' said Moore, who took over command of the 5th
fleet in July.
	   Speaking on behalf of Bahrain's naval forces, Lt. Co. Yousuf
Malallah told the opening ceremony of the 26th Maritime Commanders
Conference that ``strong, crucial maritime ties should not only be
maintained but also strengthened.
	   ``We feel that we should have more and advanced (joint)
exercises to gain more knowledge to defend this region,'' said
Malallah.
	   The one-day conference was held behind closed doors after the
opening ceremony. It was attended by all the Gulf Cooperation
Council countries, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates. Others attending were the United States,
England, France, Italy, Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands.
	   Bahrain hosted the same conference just after the 1990 Iraqi
invasion of the Gulf emirate of Kuwait. Approximately 22 nations
took part then, and many of those joined the U.S.-led coalition
forces to liberate Kuwait in the subsequent Gulf War.

Grobbelaar applies as Zimbabwe hunts for new soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe goal keeper Bruce Grobbelaar is
in the running to take over as Zimbabwe's national soccer coach,
soccer officials said Tuesday.
	   Grobbelaar, the former Liverpool and Southampton goal minder
cleared of match-fixing charges in Britain last year, is among five
candidates for the post, said Vincent Pamire, deputy head of the
Zimbabwe Football Association.
	   Grobbelaar arrived in Harare Monday for an interview, Pamire
said.
	   Other applicants are former South African national soccer coach
Clive Barker, Nigerian Stephen Keshi, Laszlo Zvalai of Holland and
Miloslav Bjelica, now living in Switzerland.
	   Grobbelaar has acted as national coach in the past but never
struck a deal to take up the post permanently.
	   The last coach, Roy Barreto, also a Zimbabwean, was fired by the
sport's governing body earlier this month. Zimbabwe was knocked out
of the Castle Cup, a regional competition, after losing 1-2 to
Angola.
	   Pamire said ZIFA would soon announce the appointment ``of
someone who is tried and tested who will coach the team up to the
2000 African Cup of Nations finals.''
	   Zimbabwe is scheduled to host the finals of that continent-wide
tournament that South Africa won in 1996 under Barker.

Canada's Wohlberg, Australia's Wilson win cycling golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadian cyclist Eric Wohlberg won
the men's 42-kilometer time trial at the Commonwealth Games Tuesday
after Australia's Stuart O'Grady crashed on a curve and lost more
than two minutes.
	   But another Australian, Anna Wilson, made up for a disastrous
finish in an earlier race by winning the women's 28-kilometer time
trial, one minute ahead of Canada's Linda Jackson.
	   O'Grady skidded into a barrier about two-thirds of the way
through the race, got up, changed bicycles and set off again with
blood running down his left arm and leg.
	   His time of 53 minutes, 30 seconds still was good enough for a
silver medal.
	   Wohlberg was 25 seconds faster in 53:05. South African David
George took the bronze in 53:56.
	   Wohlberg, 33, who became a professional after taking up cycling
at age 24 as part of his conditioning for skiing, already had won a
bronze medal Sunday in the men's road race.
	   ``I always make sure I back off during those curves because
you're going to lose a lot more time if you fall,'' he said.
	   O'Grady had the best time for the first 14-kilometer lap _ 16:50
to 17:45 for Wohlberg.
	   But on a second-lap curve, he said, ``I virtually got all the
way around the corner and then at the last minute the tire went
from under me.
	   ``Obviously, when you come off at 60 km an hour, not wearing a
lot of clothes, you've always got a lot of bruises and a lot of
skin off,'' he added.
	   ``I think I would have been 2 1/2 minutes faster if I didn't
have the crash and it's pretty unfortunate,'' O'Grady said.
	   In the women's race, Wilson won in 37:34. She also had been in
position to sprint to victory in Sunday's 92-kilometer road race,
but her left foot slipped off the pedal. Canada's Lyne Bessette won
the gold, and Wilson had to settle for the bronze.
	   This time, she made no mistake. Racing against the clock, she
averaged 44.44 kph for the first half of the race and then picked
up the pace in the second, averaging 44.72 kph for the whole race.
Jackson, meanwhile, slipped from 44.25 kph in the first half to
43.56 kph for the full distance.
	   ``It was the hardest I have dug and the most I have hurt in a
time trial,'' said Wilson.
	   ``It's awesome _ I'm still getting cramps from all the
smiling,'' she added. ``I was really, really, nervous this morning,
sick with nerves, and I really badly wanted to have a great ride
and put Sunday behind me.''
	   Jackson finished second in 38:34, five seconds ahead of
Australian Kathy Watt, who had been set back 29 seconds at the
start by a broken strap on her shoe. Watt's fiance, Carey Hall,
scrambled to apply masking tape to keep her foot from slipping.
	   Jackson said her own start was confused as a result. Suddenly,
the starter was giving her the countdown. ``He said, `You can go
now. The clock is running,''' she said.
	   Jackson had feared she might have to miss Tuesday's race because
of strained abdominal and inner thigh muscles suffered in practice
here last week.
	   She rode in pain in Sunday's race, but after two sessions a day
of physical therapy, ``there was a lot of improvement,'' she said.
``I felt a lot better.''
	   In Wohlberg's race, the Canadian team was fined 100 Swiss francs
(dlrs 71) for failing to keep 10 meters away from him during the
race.
	   Wohlberg said the team car pulled alongside him just long enough
to deliver the message ``dig deep,'' and then dropped back.
	   ``It didn't give me any kind of advantage over anyone else,'' he
said, but he suspected officials were afraid he could draft behind
the car.

Report: Britain, China support Hong Kong's market intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new comments thruout

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Britain and China firmly support the Hong Kong
government's recent intervention in the financial markets to defend
its currency link, a news report quoted their diplomats as saying.
	   Alan Paul, British team leader of the Joint Liaison Group, said
Britain ``firmly supports the resolute and determination of the
Hong Kong authorities to defend the Hong Kong dollar peg,'' to the
U.S. dollar, Radio Hong Kong reported Tuesday.
	   ``We highly value this policy as a vital contribution to the
region and to global financial stability. It is also undoubtedly in
the best interest of Hong Kong,'' he said.
	   Wang Guisheng, the mainland Chinese leader, also reiterated
China's support for the move, but added the mainland would not
intervene in Hong Kong's decisions, the radio report said.
	   He added China's decision not to devalue its currency, the yuan,
also has helped Hong Kong survive repeated attacks on its currency
peg, the radio said.
	   The working group, which was set up to handle details of the
transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in July 1997 from Britain to
China, is meeting in the territory for two days.
	   Last month, the Hong Kong government took on currency and stock
speculators, ultimately intervening and changing market rules to
close the door on what it called market manipulation.
	   Hong Kong officials say the intervention was aimed at protecting
the 14-year-old currency peg, which has come under attacks by
speculators since October.
	   Paul also said the transfer of sovereignty has been smooth, the
report said.
	   As stated in the Sino-British agreement on the handover terms,
Hong Kong has ``in all important respects been allowed to exercise
a high degree of autonomy agreed to it,'' Paul said.
	   ``This is reassuring and encouraging to us because this is the
key to Hong Kong's continuing success,'' he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One man burned himself to death, exasperated that
he hadn't been paid in two years. Another unpaid man beat to death
the shop owner who owed him his money. And an angry mob of workers
took their bosses hostage Tuesday to demand overdue salaries.
	   Millions of Russians have been receiving their salaries months
late, if at all, during the country's financial crisis. Most have
managed to scrape by, and while there have been demonstrations and
strikes, there's been virtually no unrest despite the severity of
the problem.
	   But several separate incidents around the country showed how
frustrated and angry some unpaid workers have become.
	   In the southern city of Krasnodar, locksmith Vladimir Rybalko
had already opened the window of his upper-floor apartment and was
about to jump out Sunday when his wife managed to stop him. He
later doused his clothes with gasoline and set himself on fire. He
died in the hospital.
	   ``They pushed me to the limit, I can't bear it any longer. They
haven't been paying me for two years,'' he wrote in a letter, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   In the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, a 38-year-old freight
handler beat a woman store owner to death with a metal rod after
she said there was no money to pay him on time.
	   The man also badly injured the woman's assistant, who remained
hospitalized, ITAR-Tass said Tuesday. It didn't say when the attack
took place.
	   And in the Far Eastern city of Vladivostok, workers at a power
plant met with company managers Tuesday and then kept the managers
locked in the room, saying they would be released only when back
wages were paid.
	   Russia's new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has pledged to make
payment of wage and pension arrears a top priority of new cabinet.
But President Boris Yeltsin has been making that promise for years,
and his government has been unable to deliver.
	   The government's current wage and pension debts amounts to some
36 billion rubles (about dlrs 4 billion), the business daily
Kommersant said on Tuesday. Many private companies are also late in
paying wages.

Russia's premier requests postponement of CIS meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has asked for a
postponement of a meeting with his counterparts from the former
Soviet republics, saying he needed more time to prepare, an
official said Tuesday.
	   The meeting of prime ministers of the Commonwealth of
Independent States was scheduled for Sept. 24-25 in Ukraine's Black
Sea resort of Yalta, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Primakov said he was too busy selecting ministers for his
new Cabinet, and also needed more time to develop his position on
reforming the CIS, said the executive secretary of the alliance,
Boris Berezovsky.
	   Primakov met Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday and
Cabinet appointments were expected soon.
	   Berezovsky told Interfax that CIS officials were divided on
whether to postpone the prime ministers' meeting.
	   Since its creation in the wake of Soviet collapse, the alliance
uniting 12 former Soviet republics _ all except the Baltics _ have
approved hundreds of resolutions but implemented only a handful.
	   Closer cooperation has been hampered by persistent economic
crises and widespread concern that Russia might try to use its
dominant position in the alliance to recreate the Soviet empire.

China agrees to preliminary talks on meeting with Taiwan envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a move warmly greeted in Taipei, China
said Tuesday it will host Taiwan's top negotiator next month and
agreed to preliminary talks on an agenda for the watershed visit.
	   Koo Chen-fun will visit Beijing and Shanghai on Oct. 14-19, and
may hold a news conference and meet with Taiwanese investors as
requested, China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits said in a letter.
	   And in a breakthrough for Taiwan, China agreed for lower level
officials of the two sides to meet beforehand over the details of
Koo's visit. China had earlier snubbed Taiwan's requests for such
talks, fueling speculation here that it intended Koo's visit to be
merely a courtesy call.
	   Premier Vincent Siew praised the letter as a ``friendly
response.''
	   ``I hope this meeting will point the two sides' dialogue in the
right direction and lend it substantive significance,'' Siew told
the legislature.
	   Those remarks were echoed by Chang King-yuh, the cabinet's top
official for China policy, who said the letter expressed
``pragmatic amity.''
	   Koo is chairman of Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange
Foundation, which is responsible for contacts with China. Taiwan
hopes his trip will pave the way for a resumption of talks between
the foundation and ARATS that China angrily broke off in 1995 over
Taiwan's efforts to raise its international profile.
	   The letter seemingly defies naysayers here who speculate that
China is seeking to sideline the SEF in favor of groups considered
more amenable to its goal of returning Taiwan to Beijing's rule.
	   China this week is hosting a delegation led by Liang Su-jung,
former speaker of Taiwan's legislature and head of the private
Association for the Promotion of Peaceful Unification.
	   But while China agreed to a preparatory visit by foundation
Secretary General Shi Hwei-yow in late September or early October,
it said preliminary talks should be downgraded to the vice
secretary general level.
	   Taiwan wants such preliminary talks to be used to set issues for
discussion in meetings between Koo and Chinese officials, but it
remained unclear what China expected from the talks.
	   Koo's visit will mark his first meeting with ARATS Chairman Wang
Daohan since 1993 talks in Singapore that marked the first formal
contacts between the sides in over 40 years. China and Taiwan split
politically in 1949 when Mao Tse-tung's Communists drove the
Nationalists out of China.
	   China wants Taiwan to agreed to discuss political issues
relating to reunification. But Taiwan advocates picking up talks
where they left off on practical matters such as resolution of
fishing disputes.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered rebels to turn in their weapons. A
statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and order
_ warned of a tough response to any resistance from supporters of
former President Sali Berisha, after armed clashes on Monday
between them and government security forces. Police have been
authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed, said the
statement, read on state television. But Berisha supporters defied
the ban. About 3,000 people had gathered in the main Tirana square
by noon (1000 GMT) and more were arriving. (ALBANIA-UNREST)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's Protestant
and Catholic politicians broke hopeful new ground Monday as they
debated how to govern this long-divided land together, in
cooperation with the neighboring Irish Republic. ``A new politics
has begun,'' Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the new legislative
Assembly, declared to its debating chamber of Irish Catholics on
the left and British Protestants on the right. ``We have to move
from criticism to construction, from making demands to making
choices, from claiming rights to taking responsibility for our own
lives,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the major representative of
the north's Catholics, the Social Democratic and Labor Party.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Republicans in the House of Representatives
are seeking speedy release of President Bill Clinton's videotaped
grand jury testimony, officials said Monday. Meanwhile, the two top
Democrats in Congress urged the White House to abandon a defense
against Kenneth Starr's evidence based on legal technicalities.
Several Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there had been talk of releasing Clinton's testimony later
this week in the next batch of material to be made public from
independent counsel Starr's voluminous report.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
Tuesday amid heightened tension with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The action came a day after
Khamenei warned that the actions of Afghanistan's Taliban militia
were leading to a regional crisis and urged Muslim countries to
intercede. ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the
country, including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy,
timely and decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior
political and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday, the agency said.
(IRAN-AFGHANISTAN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Saying ``it's decision time,'' Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told Palestinians on Tuesday they would have to
commit to a relentless campaign against Islamic militants if they
want Israel to hand over more West Bank land. Once such guarantees
are given, a deal on a troop pullback can be struck quickly,
Netanyahu told reporters. The Palestinians, in turn, say Israel is
responsible for the lack of progress, saying Netanyahu has yet to
accept a U.S. compromise plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against Islamic militants. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal several months ago. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

Italy calls on Albania to bring killers to justice; no plans to
</HEADLINE>
evacuate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's foreign minister on Tuesday called on the
Albanian government to bring to justice the killers of an
opposition leader whose death sparked the unrest in the Balkan
country.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini also told an emergency session of
the Senate foreign affairs committee that Italy had no plans now to
evacuate its citizens from Albania. He said there were signs that
situation in Albania, which has many ties with Italy, were
improving.
	   He told lawmakers that the Albanian crisis was a ``test'' for
Italy because of the ``many Italian businessmen who have invested
their savings in Albania,'' because of the ``thousands of Albanian
refugees in Italy,'' and because of the ``delicacy'' of the
situation in the troubled Balkan nation.
	   The last outbreak of violence in Albania, in 1997, sent
thousands of refugees fleeing across the Adriatic to Italy.
	   Italy also led a multinational military force deployed to
protect aid shipments to Albania in the wake of the 1997 uprising.
	   Dini said the only sure way to restore peace in Albania was to
bring to justice the killers of a popular opposition leader whose
death helped ignite the crisis. He warned that Italy's support is
``strictly conditioned on conduct inspired by moderation and
respect for the law, by both the government and the Albanian
opposition.''
	   In another sign of Italy's concern, Premier Romano Prodi spent
Sunday and Monday on the telephone with Albanian leaders,
pressuring them to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.
	   Prodi's office said his message was blunt: Continued
international support, he said, depends on ``the cessation of every
act of violence, by every side, and on the stability of the
country's institutions.''

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with demonstration ending without incident.
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday ordered
barricaded rebels to turn in their weapons and warned of a tough
response to any resistance.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ told supporters that police have been authorized to ``shoot
without warning'' if opposed.
	   Despite a government ban, supporters of former President Sali
Berisha held a rally in the main Tirana square. The protest ended
peacefully, but tensions remained high in the wake of armed clashes
on Monday between Berisha backers and government security forces.
	   About 3,000 people participated in the protest. Many flashed the
two-fingered victory sign, but the crowd was generally quiet as
Berisha coupled demands for the resignation of Prime Minister Fatos
Nano, his Socialist rival, with exhortations that the demonstrators
remain peaceful.
	   Around the periphery of the square, dozens of police cars were
drawn up, lights flashing and sirens howling in a show of presence.
	   The cars and several police vans close to the square were filled
with sub-machine-gun carrying officers, some wearing stocking
masks. Police, speaking through a loudspeaker mounted on a car,
exhorted passersby to keep moving.
	   In banning the rally, the Interior Ministry also urged Berisha
supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party headquarters to
lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party do distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   Speaking to reporters before the demonstration began, he
announced a new rally for Wednesday unless Nano resigned.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks remained parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters after the rally on Tuesday, apparently now in rebel
hands. Nearby, about half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with
submachine guns could be seen, along with about 150 unarmed Berisha
backers.
	   In an apparent concession to authorities, Democratic Party
leaders had said Tuesday's rally would be held not at the main
Skanderbeg Square but in front of their headquarters, and
approximately 800 people had formed in front of the building
shortly before noon.
	   The crowd then moved off toward the square, about 500 meters
(yards) away, joined by others, who passed police armored vehicles
and concrete barriers on the main road between the building and the
square.
	   Police with rifles took up position on the roof of the interior
ministry building, also only a few hundred meters (yards) away.

Prison changes locks after videotape shows keys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ The high-security prison in this
northern England city plans to change all its door locks as a
precaution after the discovery that a videotape made to initiate
new inmates included close-ups of prison keys.
	   Officials at Her Majesty's Prison Manchester, better known as
Strangeways, said they feared the videotape could be paused,
details of the keys noted and replicas made to aid in prisoners'
escape.
	   The film was made to be viewed by new prisoners, and copies were
distributed to community groups. One sequence shows a chaplain
doing his rounds and features a close-up of his bunch of keys.
	   ``The mistake has only recently come to light,'' the prison said
in a statement. ``The prison has not experienced any related
security problems since.''
	   Strangeways became Britain's most notorious prison after inmates
went on a rampage during a 25-day rooftop siege in 1990.

Israel's population nears 6 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of the Jewish New Year, Israel's
population had reached 5.98 million, up 2 percent from last year,
the Central Bureau of Statistics announced Tuesday.
	   When the state was formed in 1948, it had 806,000 residents.
Immigration has fueled much of Israel's population growth, with
some 2.7 million people arriving in the nation's 50-year history.
	   In 1997, 66,000 immigrants came, including 83 percent from the
former Soviet Union.
	   Jews made up 79.4 percent of the population, Muslims 14.8
percent, Christians 2.1 percent and other faiths 3.7 percent.
	   Life expectancy for women was 79.9 years and 76.3 years for men.

Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the key index in Jakarta slumping 8.9 percent on speculation that
Indonesia plans to implement Malaysian-style currency controls. The
Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 28.442 points,
closing at a new five-year low of 292.153. Central bank Governor
Sjahril Sabirin and President B.J. Habibie both later denied the
speculation, saying Indonesia isn't considering implementing
currency controls and would continue to let the rupiah float.
Meanwhile, the rupiah was trading stronger at 10,850 to the U.S.
dollar in the afternoon. Japan's financial markets were closed for
a national holiday. Philippine shares closed higher for the second
straight session, buoyed by bargain-hunting following Wall Street's
overnight gains. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose
39.64 points, or 3.6 percent, to 1,140.40.(ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin conferred with his new
prime minister in the Kremlin and began making appointments Tuesday
to a Cabinet that must deal with the country's economic crisis.
Russia's political crisis has eased since parliament confirmed
Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister last Friday. But the president
and the premier have yet to offer a detailed program to pull the
country out of its economic tailspin. Primakov has pledged to
continue economic reforms but said the government must also offer
social protection to citizens. ``We cannot conduct reforms that
affect the people adversely,'' Primakov said. ``If therapy drags
out for decades, and no gleam of light is seen, it is certainly not
in the interests of the country, not in the interests of the
people.'' (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Britain and China firmly support the Hong Kong
government's recent intervention in the financial markets to defend
its currency link, a news report quoted their diplomats as saying.
Alan Paul, British team leader of the Joint Liaison Group, said
Britain ``firmly supports the resolute and determination of the
Hong Kong authorities to defend the Hong Kong dollar peg,'' to the
U.S. dollar, Radio Hong Kong reported Tuesday. ``We highly value
this policy as a vital contribution to the region and to global
financial stability. It is also undoubtedly in the best interest of
Hong Kong,'' he said. Wang Guisheng, the mainland Chinese leader,
also reiterated China's support for the move, but added the
mainland would not intervene in Hong Kong's decisions, the radio
report said. (HONG KONG-BRITAIN-CHINA)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stung by allegations that millions of
dollars in aid funds were lost to graft, the World Bank and the
Indonesian government announced a new push to clean up corruption
Tuesday. Development Planning Minister Hartarto told a news
conference that the government would protect those who blew the
whistle on corrupt practices within the bureaucracy. The World
Bank's representative in Indonesia, Dennis de Tray, applauded a new
willingness by Indonesia to attack the problem, which flourished
under former autocratic President Suharto. Suharto ended 32 years
in power and resigned in May after the economic crisis triggered
riots and protests. (INDONESIA-CORRUPTION)
	   KUANTAN, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan and other nations have stalled
progress on trade liberalization among Pacific Rim countries by
refusing to open forests and fisheries to foreign competition,
American delegates said Tuesday. Senior officials of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group finished a three-day
meeting with no new trade pact for APEC leaders to sign when they
meet in November. The U.S. delegation blamed Japan as the holdout,
but other countries also balked at committing to details, although
they declared their support for the idea of opening up nine key
industries by next year under the Early Voluntary Sector
Liberalization pact. ``We're all for liberalization,'' said Andrew
Hsia, head of Taiwan's delegation. ``All the economies are
committed, but we're all so diverse. We're all asking for maximum
flexibility in certain sectors, especially in fishing and
forestry.'' (MALAYSIA-APEC)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday banned an
opposition rally and ordered rebels to turn in their weapons. A
statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and order
_ warned of a tough response to any resistance from supporters of
former President Sali Berisha, after armed clashes on Monday
between them and government security forces. Police have been
authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed, said the
statement, read on state television. But Berisha supporters defied
the ban. About 3,000 people had gathered in the main Tirana square
by noon, (1000 GMT) and more were arriving. (ALBANIA-UNREST)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's Protestant
and Roman Catholic politicians broke hopeful new ground Monday as
they debated how to govern this long-divided land together, in
cooperation with the neighboring Irish Republic. ``A new politics
has begun,'' Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the new legislative
Assembly, declared to its debating chamber of Irish Catholics on
the left and British Protestants on the right. ``We have to move
from criticism to construction, from making demands to making
choices, from claiming rights to taking responsibility for our own
lives,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the major representative of
the north's Catholics, the Social Democratic and Labor Party.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Republicans in the House of Representatives
are seeking speedy release of President Bill Clinton's videotaped
grand jury testimony, officials said Monday. Meanwhile, the two top
Democrats in Congress urged the White House to abandon a defense
against Kenneth Starr's evidence based on legal technicalities.
Several Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there had been talk of releasing Clinton's testimony later
this week in the next batch of material to be made public from
independent counsel Starr's voluminous report.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
Tuesday amid heightened tension with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The action came a day after
Khamenei warned that the actions of Afghanistan's Taliban militia
were leading to a regional crisis and urged Muslim countries to
intercede. ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the
country, including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy,
timely and decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior
political and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday, the agency said.
(IRAN-AFGHANISTAN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Saying ``it's decision time,'' Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told Palestinians on Tuesday they would have to
commit to a relentless campaign against Islamic militants if they
want Israel to hand over more West Bank land. Once such guarantees
are given, a deal on a troop pullback can be struck quickly,
Netanyahu told reporters. The Palestinians, in turn, say Israel is
responsible for the lack of progress, saying Netanyahu has yet to
accept a U.S. compromise plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against Islamic militants. The Palestinians accepted the
proposal several months ago. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

Australian won gold after father's death

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian swimmer Sarah Ryan won
a Commonwealth Games gold medal unaware that her father had died.
	   Ryan, 21, took her place in the 4x100m freestyle relay team that
set a Commonwealth record Monday night, and was then told about her
father's death.
	   Australian team media manager Ian Hanson said Ryan left Kuala
Lumpur for Australia on Tuesday.
	   ``She raced without knowing,'' Hanson said. ``She was told after
she'd enjoyed the celebrations by team psychologist Clark Perry.''
	   Hanson said Ryan's father died of multiple sclerosis.
	   ``I spoke to her this afternoon before she flew out and she was
worried people might think she was deserting the team,'' Hanson
said. ``But she went with everyone's blessing.''

Belfast Assembly debates bitter legacy of Omagh car bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ United in horror but divided by
politics, the Protestants and Catholics of Northern Ireland's new
legislature on Tuesday debated the bitter legacy of last month's
car-bomb slaughter by IRA dissidents.
	   In often raw and personal exchanges, several Protestant speakers
accused the members from the Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein
party across the chamber of complicity with those who committed
Northern Ireland's deadliest atrocity in its three-decade conflict.
	   The Aug. 15 attack on Omagh claimed 29 lives _ 16 Catholics, 11
Protestants, and two Spanish tourists. Most of the dead were women
and children.
	   The dissidents, the so-called Real IRA, tried to destroy their
former colleagues' July 1997 truce, but called a ``complete
cessation'' last week in response to public fury over the Omagh
attack.
	   ``There are those in this chamber who know who these people are.
And they should be sharing such knowledge with the authorities,''
said Derek Hussey, a member of the Ulster Unionists, the north's
major British Protestant party, gesturing to the Sinn Fein benches.
	   He quoted Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams' recent pledge that
violence should be ```done with and gone.' And I ask the simple
question: Is it?''
	   During his turn to speak, Sinn Fein Vice President Pat Doherty
didn't respond to any of the verbal attacks, but emphasized that
the slaughter in Omagh placed ``a great responsibility on us to
sustain the peace process and to bring it to fruition.''
	   ``We must make Omagh the last atrocity,'' said Doherty, whose
brother remains in an Irish prison for helping commit several
deadly IRA bomb attacks in England in the 1970s. ``We must put all
of that behind us. We can all as politicians recriminate. We all
have memories of suffering, and of loss, and of indignities.''
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the 28-member bloc of
Protestants opposed to April's compromise accord, said the Omagh
attack underscored the need for the IRA to disarm.
	   He noted that the detonator used in the Omagh attack most likely
came from an IRA arms dump. The IRA smuggled thousands of mining
detonators from Arizona to Ireland in the early 1990s.
	   Addressing the Sinn Fein benches, Paisley said he saw no
``repentance'' in the party member's words or deeds.

Cyprus, Greece sign agreement on recovering stolen antiquities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus and Greece signed an agreement on
recovering stolen antiquities Tuesday, and Greece's culture
minister urged the European Union to do more to prevent looting of
cultural heritage in the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus.
	   Evangelos Venizelos made the comment after signing a pact
calling for cooperation in tracing and recovering hundreds of
Byzantine church icons and other cultural treasures looted from
northern Cyprus following the 1974 Turkish invasion.
	   ``The reaction of the EU is not what is expected from ... the
verbal declarations which give great emphasis to the protection of
the European cultural tradition and heritage,'' said Venizelos,
whose country is a member of the EU.
	   ``The United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization and
the Council of Europe have always displayed greater interest than
the EU in this respect,'' he added.
	   Cyprus has repeatedly accused Turkish authorities of doing
little to prevent the looting and destruction of the island's
9,000-year-old cultural heritage, particularly Hellenistic sites
and Christian churches and monasteries.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot south and a
Turkish-occupied north since the 1974 invasion, which followed a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Turkey maintained it was protecting the Turkish-Cypriot
minority. A self-declared Turkish Cypriot republic in the north is
recognized only by Turkey.
	   Cypriot Culture Minister Lycourgos Kappas said scores of
churches in the north, many more than 500 years old, have been
stripped of their icons and other treasures and transformed into
mosques, nightclubs, stables and storehouses.
	   The Turkish Cypriot authorities blame the looting on
professional smugglers. But Venizelos said the Turkish government
was responsible as the occupying power.

Soldiers, pensioners gather harvest in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ILYINSKOE, Russia (AP) _ In a vast field, sun-burned soldiers in
mismatched uniforms and crooked caps kneel shoulder-to-shoulder
with pensioners, tugging carrots from the dry earth.
	   ``We have to provide for ourselves because the government's not
going to do it,'' said Lt. Dmitry Bui, watching his men. ``But we
eat well in the army, better than in the rest of the country.''
	   Soldiers and pensioners have long helped bring in Russia's fall
harvest, but with financial crisis now boosting prices on even the
most basic goods, the ritual has taken on greater urgency this
autumn.
	   Among those who have suffered most due to the government's cash
crunch, the soldiers and the elderly share a lot of common ground.
On this day they are meeting in the carrot and potato fields of a
crumbling collective farm outside Moscow called ``Lenin's Ray of
Light.''
	   ``I would be lying down resting now if I were at home,'' said
62-year-old Lidiya Korshunova, a former cook, exhausted from six
hours of stooping over and pulling up carrots. ``We don't care so
much for ourselves, we really do it for our children.''
	   Adding to the anxiety, this year's crop is expected to be much
worse than normal. Government leaders say the grain harvest will be
the smallest in 40 years, and the potato crop is also way down.
	   The pensioners, mostly women, are allowed a bag full of the crop
they gather as the day's payment. After their shift, they help each
other hoist their backpacks, and trudge home in lines.
	   Though hoisting potatoes isn't the best training, Lt. Bui at
least tries to maintain some semblance of discipline among his
conscripts.
	   ``Everyone to me. Quickly, quickly,'' he barked. ``Four of you
take the potatoes to the truck. I want six of you gathering any
remaining big ones. Let's go. Show some initiative.''
	   Sluggishly, the privates break formation and toss potatoes into
plastic boxes. In their agreement with the farm, they take home 10
percent of what they gather during a 10-hour workday.
	   ``We do it for ourselves, for our table,'' said 21-year-old Pvt.
Alexei Zaitsev, groggy after waking up from a nap in a field where
his lieutenant couldn't see him. ``But it's a big job, so we get
big breaks.''

IOC to send envoy to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
will send an envoy to North Korea this week to promote sports
exchanges between the two Koreas, officials said Tuesday.
	   Thomas Bach, a member of the IOC's Executive Board, planned to
visit Pyongyang, the reclusive communist state's capital, on Friday
through Sunday.
	   ``We will ... discuss a possible, IOC-sponsored sporting event
between two Koreas,'' Bach said, adding that details have yet to be
worked out.
	   Bach will be accompanied by three officials from the German auto
giant Daimler Benz, which will donate a bus and uniforms and shoes
for North Korean athletes.
	   Bach spoke in Seoul where he attended an IOC executive board
meeting.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war since an armistice,
rather than a peace treaty, ended their 1950-53 conflict. Their
border is sealed, with no mail or other direct means of
communication.
	   In the early 1990s, the Koreas formed single soccer and table

	   ROME (AP) _ Three U.S. astronauts who were on the space shuttle
Discovery's last flight met Monday with the prime minister and
officials of the Italian Space Agency on Monday.
	   The Discovery carried an experimental device, called an Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer, manufactured by the agency on its June 2-12
flight.
	   Mission commander Charlie Precourt, pilot Dominic Gorie and
science specialist Janet Kavandi met Monday with Pope John Paul II
at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills outside
Rome.

Death toll rises in Algerian massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The death toll in a weekend massacre in
a village in Algeria rose to 37, with a newspaper Thursday
reporting the attackers used incendiary bombs, Kalashnikov rifles
and knives.
	   Citing witnesses, the La Tribune newspaper said the village of
Ain Sbaa about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Algiers was
beset upon by attackers who dragged their victims into the streets.
	   The attack took place Sunday in the worst incident of a surge in
violence since President Liamine Zeroual announced Friday he would
step down and call early presidential elections.
	   Algerian security forces had said Monday that 27 people died in
the attack on Ain Sbaa, which is near the town of Ain Defla.
	   La Tribune said a family of 13 had been killed in the attack.
	   The attackers broke down the doors and pulled people from their
houses before killing them, the newspaper said.
	   The region around Ain Defla reportedly has become one of the
areas where the anti-government Armed Islamic Group is most active.
	   Zeroual, the outgoing president, has been unable to end an
Islamic insurgency that erupted in 1992 when the military-backed
government canceled parliamentary elections an Islamic party was
set to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in violence since then.

EU authorizes sale of Viagra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details; ADDS byline
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Tuesday
authorized the sale of the anti-impotence drug Viagra throughout
the 15-nation EU.
	   The drug was approved at the regular weekly meeting of the EU's
executive Commission in Strasbourg, France, Tuesday following the
advise of a panel of European medical experts.
	   ``In principle the company concerned has, from tomorrow, the
right to circulate the product in all member states,'' said Jochen
Kubosch, health spokesman for the European Commission.
	   However, individual EU governments are free to decide whether to
make the drug available free or at subsidized low prices through
their government health programs. For the moment at least, most
impotent Europeans will have to pay the full price to obtain the
drug privately.
	   Under the EU's authorization, Viagra will only be available on
doctor's prescription and may not be supplied to patients under 18
or taken by women.
	   Viagra's manufacturer, the New York-based pharmaceutical company
Pfizer Inc, will have to include a leaflet in all packets
explaining that the blue, diamond-shaped pills should not be used
by adult males with severe heart or liver problems or patients
taking drugs containing nitrates. The leaflet says nobody should
take Viagra more than once a day.
	   Britain's Health Secretary Frank Dobson told doctors they should
not prescribe the drug free because of fears the cost would strain
the National Health Service's finances.
	   Allowing impotent Britons to receive the drug free would cost
the NHS between 50 million pounds (dlrs 82.5 million) and 150
million pounds (dlrs 247.5 million) yearly, Dobson estimated.
	   ``That money isn't there, so therefore we have to take the money
away from maternity services for women having babies or people who
are being treated for cancer or people who are being treated for
heart disease,'' Dobson told BBC radio Tuesday.
	   In Germany, where Viagra will go on sale Oct. 1, Health Minister
Horst Seehofer has also said he's against it being paid for by
public health insurance.
	   Portugal's Health Ministry took a similar line, the drug will be
available on doctor's prescription, but the state will not offset
the cost tot the patient.

Tory leader says British leaders should stay out of U.S. politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Opposition leader William Hague on Tuesday warned
against too uncritical support of Bill Clinton, a swipe at Prime
Minister Tony Blair's reaffirmation that he considered the U.S.
president a ``good friend and ally.''
	   Hague said British politicians should stay out of American
domestic politics.
	   ``After all, if we had a great crisis going on in the British
government, we wouldn't thank an American congressman for
commenting on it, so I think we should bear that in mind,'' the
Conservative Party leader told ITV's ``This Morning'' program.
	   On the specifics of the White House scandal involving former
intern Monica Lewinsky, Hague said: ``It's sad for us all to see
the government of what is really our closest friend and ally, the
United States, in such a crisis as it seems to have been in the
past few weeks.''
	   But, he stressed, ``I don't think it ... is particularly
relevant for British politicians to get involved in the pros or
cons of it.''
	   On Monday, Blair had issued a statement in the wake of
independent investigator Kenneth Starr's report on the Lewinsky
affair, saying the prime minister was not a ``fairweather friend''
and would not ``dump people because some report appears on the
Internet.''

Polish-Portuguese parliamentary group to help exchange experience

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Portugal is offering its experience
negotiating entrance to the European Union to Polish lawmakers,
Poland's parliament speaker said Tuesday after meeting with
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio.
	   Lawmakers from both countries plan to form a parliamentary group
this month to exchange experience in building democracy and on
European integration, speaker Maciej Plazynski announced.
	   `It would be worthwhile to know how Portugal negotiated European
Union membership,'' Plazynski said.
	   Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary opened EU
membership negotiations in March.
	   Sampaio, who is on a four-day visit to Poland, advised officials
to ``roll up your sleeves, work with determination and pay no
attention to remarks that you don't meet all the EU requirements
yet.''
	   It took Portugal eight years of negotiations to join the Union.
``Now we have a very good situation in economy and we meet all the
criteria of the monetary union,'' he said.

Long-time AP technician Francois Ghattas dies at 65
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AL-FANAR, Lebanon (AP) _ Francois Ghattas, who kept
communications systems working for Associated Press offices and
subscribers through war and peace in the Middle East for more than
three decades, died Tuesday. He was 65.
	   Ghattas died in his sleep of a heart attack at his home in
Al-Fanar, a suburb in the mountains above Beirut, his family said.
	   He retired from the AP in Nicosia, Cyprus, in 1994 and returned
to his native Lebanon, where his son, Sam F. Ghattas, is the AP's
Beirut correspondent.
	   Renowned for his wizardry in keeping communications lines to the
world open during aerial bombardments and militia street fighting
around the AP's Beirut office during 15 years of civil war, Ghattas
also traveled widely throughout the Middle East to install and
maintain equipment for AP subscribers.
	   When fighting disrupted shipments of vital communications gear
to Beirut, Ghattas would make his own, creating complicated
circuitry from diagrams that seemed to exist only in his mind.
	   When Israel's 1982 siege of Beirut cut off electrical power to
the city's central telephone exchange, Ghattas reversed the circuit
flow between the AP bureau and the telephone exchange in order to
feed the AP's generator power to the exchange and keep AP news
flowing over this communications lifeline to the world.
	   Ghattas was born in Mashghara, in southern Lebanon's lower Bekaa
Valley, and came to Beirut as a young man. A self-taught
communications technician, he worked for several organizations
starting in the 1950s, including AP and United Press International.
He became a full-time AP staffer in 1982.
	   He transferred to the AP's Nicosia office in 1986.
	   Funeral services were to be conducted Thursday in Jdeideh, near
Beirut, with burial in Mashghara.
	   Survivors include Ghattas' wife Nawal; three sons, Elie, Sam and
Tony, and five grandchildren.

Government bans rally, calls on rebels to hand over arms

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Trying to squelch new violence after a
day of rioting and gunfire, the government on Tuesday ordered
barricaded rebels to turn in their weapons and warned of a tough
response to any resistance.
	   A statement by the Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and
order _ told supporters that police have been authorized to ``shoot
without warning'' if opposed.
	   Despite a government ban, supporters of former President Sali
Berisha held a rally in the main Tirana square. The protest ended
peacefully, but tensions remained high in the wake of armed clashes
on Monday between Berisha backers and government security forces.
	   Police reported overnight shootouts between gunmen and border
guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They said the attackers,
from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra, wounded three people.
They also said that an armed group had set up a checkpoint just
south of Gjirokastra.
	   In Tirana, about 3,000 people participated in the protest. Many
flashed the two-fingered victory sign, but the crowd was generally
quiet as Berisha coupled demands for the resignation of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, his Socialist rival, with exhortations that
the demonstrators remain peaceful.
	   Around the periphery of the square, dozens of police cars were
drawn up, lights flashing and sirens howling in a show of presence.
	   The cars and several police vans close to the square were filled
with sub-machine-gun carrying officers, some wearing stocking
masks. Police, speaking through a loudspeaker mounted on a car,
exhorted passersby to keep moving.
	   In banning the rally, the Interior Ministry also urged Berisha
supporters holed up at downtown Democratic Party headquarters to
lay down their arms.
	   ``We call on the Democratic Party to distance itself from those
individuals,'' the statement said. ``Otherwise, it will bear
responsibility for subsequent developments.''
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.'' He announced a new rally for
Wednesday unless Nano resigned.
	   The Monday protest _ prompted by the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha ally and fellow lawmaker _ touched off a wild day
of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that lasted for months in
1997.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded when government forces launched a counterattack and swiftly
regained control of seized key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets, crowds of
looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the city,
firing in the air.
	   Two of the tanks remained parked in front of Democratic Party
headquarters after the rally on Tuesday, apparently now in rebel
hands. Nearby, about half a dozen Berisha supporters armed with
submachine guns could be seen, along with about 150 unarmed Berisha
backers.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened arrest by the government, has called for the Socialist
government to resign, but insists he is not plotting a takeover .
	   Diplomats from the United States and European countries were
seeking to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis in the
continent's poorest nation. Many fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Monday the Interior Ministry advised foreign diplomats they would
try to arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
Government spokesman Ben Blushi refused to confirm or deny that
statement, saying only that justice would be done, and it would be
best for Berisha to leave voluntarily.
	   But the 53-year-old Berisha said he would never leave Albania.
	   He told CNN late Monday that the building takeovers were simply
his supporters' reaction to the slaying of well-known opposition
legislator Azem Hajdari, gunned down along with a bodyguard
Saturday in front of party headquarters. Berisha blames his rival
Nano.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia. However,
his policies became increasingly authoritarian.

As water subsides, farmers begin counting cost of Dutch flood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Flooding that wreaked havoc across
large parts of the Netherlands Monday was subsiding Tuesday as
farmers and home owners began counting the cost of the high waters.
	   Damage to crops in the Delfland agricultural region south of The
Hague was expected to run into tens of millions of guilders (dlrs)
following the heaviest rainfall for decades.
	   Although more rain was forecast, regions hardest hit said they
should be able to cope now the water was retreating.
	   ``We are still on alert,'' said Elly Hollestelle of the
municipality of Roosendaal close to the Belgian border, ``but the
level in waterways has drooped by 20 centimeters (eight inches) so
if more rain falls we can cope this time.''
	   Roosendaal's center was sealed off Monday as knee-deep water
coursed through the streets. Other towns followed suit as drainage
canals and pumping stations were swamped by the worst rainfall in
living memory.
	   Crops growing in glass houses in Delfland region were
extensively damaged despite the efforts of 200 Dutch soldiers who
were deployed late Monday to build emergency dikes and help pump
water out of flooded fields and glass houses.
	   In the southern coastal region of Zeeland flood waters left
potato and onion fields submerged and swept at least a dozen cattle
into swollen rivers.
	   Agriculture Minister Hayo Apotheker was visiting the affected
regions Tuesday as part of a delegation aiming to calculate the
extent of the damage. The government did not immediately announce
plans to compensate farmers and households.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World 400-meter swimming champion
Ian Thorpe and fellow Australian Grant Hackett recorded the second
and third fastest times ever Tuesday in claiming the Commonwealth
Games gold and silver medals.
	   Australia's pool party raged for a fourth night. It swept all
five gold medals on offer, lifting its total to 17 from 20 races so
far in the games. But Susie O'Neill was unable to tie Michael
Wenden's all-time gold medal record.
	   Of the 12 individual medals available Tuesday, Australia gave up
just two _ one bronze each to England and Canada.
	   Thorpe, 15, kicked off the rout by leading an Australian sweep
in the 400-meter event in 3 minutes, 44.35 seconds. World silver
medalist Hackett was second in 3:44.88 and Daniel Kowalski third in
3:48.91.
	   The top two were both surprised to get near compatriot Kieren
Perkins' world mark of 3:43.80, set at the 1994 Rome world
championships. Both beat the former second best time of 3:45.00 set
by Russian Evgeni Sadovyi in winning the 1992 Olympic gold medal.
	   Thorpe's magnificent victory from the front came after he missed
the 200-meter freestyle world record by just .01 seconds earlier in
the meet.
	   ``It wasn't quite as close as my 200 but who's complaining,''
said Thorpe, who also claimed a relay gold Tuesday and had four for
the meet. ``It's much faster than I expected to go at these
championships so I'm happy with that.''
	   Thorpe came from a long way behind to beat Hackett at the world
championships in Perth in January but decided to alter his plan at
this meet.
	   ``I decided to go out faster tonight than I normally do,''
Thorpe said. ``I've realized I can't hold back in the first 200 and
try to come over the top of these guys on the international
scene.''
	   Hackett bemoaned the fact he didn't feel exhausted at the end of
the race, saying, ``I probably should have gone out harder.''
	   ``It doesn't hurt me as much as it should. Maybe I've learned
something from that race.''
	   He said he expected the world record to come under threat the
next time the pair meet.
	   In the women's 100-meter butterfly, O'Neill was beaten into
second by Petria Thomas, who set the Commonwealth record with a
bronze at the Perth world championships.
	   O'Neill's placing gave her four gold and two silver medals from
her six events so far. She has eight Commonwealth golds in all but
can still beat Wenden's record of nine with victories in the
200-meter butterfly and 4x100-meter medley relay Wednesday.
	   ``Obviously I wanted to win but I didn't,'' said O'Neill,
exhausted after a long program. ``That's the way it goes.''
	   Thomas continued to work out from under O'Neill's imposing
shadow with a victory in 59.42 seconds. O'Neill clocked 59.61 while
Australian Kathryn Godfrey was third in one minute, 0.14 seconds.
	   ``It can't believe it, it was awesome,'' Thomas said.
	   Simon Cowley scored a breaststroke double when he added
Tuesday's 200-meter title to the earlier 100-meter gold medal.
Cowley finished in 2:13.13, edging compatriot Ryan Mitchell
(2:13.20), who led by almost two seconds at the 150-meter mark.
	   ``I knew I had to swim the best 50 meters I've ever swum,'' said
Cowley. ``I was only ever ahead at the finish but that's where you
want to be.''
	   It took until the third race for another nation to claim a
medal, when England's Adam Whitehead got the bronze behind Cowley.
	   World championship silver medalist Helen Denman gave the
Australians their fourth gold with a win over former world champion
Samantha Riley in the 100-meter breaststroke. Riley won the
200-meter event earlier in the meet. Canada's Lauren van Oosten
claimed the bronze.
	   With 10 of 12 individual medals in the bag, Australia's men's
4x100-meter freestyle relay team of Michael Klim, Ashley Callus,
Chris Fydler and Thorpe wrapped up a ruthless session.

Wholesale cost of coffee down to lowest level in nearly two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fresh selling this week on European and U.S.
markets has pushed the average wholesale cost of coffee as measured
by the International Coffee Organization down to its lowest level
for nearly two years.
	   Calculations made Tuesday by the intergovernmental agency put
its latest daily market indicator price at dlrs 0.9322 a pound,
against dlrs 0.9543 previously, which had been the lowest level
since Jan. 7, 1997.
	   Traders said coffee was coming under selling pressure because of
the prospect of growing oversupply, thanks mainly to the bumper
crop now being harvested in Brazil.
	   The country is the world's biggest supplier of coffee,
accounting for around a third of global production.
	   Also putting a lid on the market, analysts say, are the signs of
better production in Colombia and Central America this season than
first forecast.

Cambodian capital calm after agreement on steps to end crisis

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ending a string of bloody
anti-government protests, opposition supporters on Tuesday heeded
their leaders' calls not to demonstrate after Cambodia's rival
political parties agreed on steps to end the country's political
crisis.
	   The capital was quiet after more than a week of daily marches by
thousands of people accusing strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party of using fraud to win parliamentary elections held on July
26.
	   The pro-democracy protests, which also demanded Hun Sen's
ouster, were harshly put down by well-armed riot police. At least
four people were killed and dozens injured.
	   On Tuesday, even the street by the U.S. Embassy _ the unofficial
gathering point for anti-government protesters _ was nearly empty.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, appealed to demonstrators on Monday to call off more
protests after the ruling party and its two main rivals reached a
tension-easing agreement.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak called the calm after
weeks of unrest reassuring.
	   ``It is good for the atmosphere of upcoming talks and
negotiations between party leaders,'' he said.
	   The pact agreed on Monday calls for the cessation of
demonstrations, a summit meeting of party leaders hosted by King
Sihanouk, and the convening of the National Assembly as scheduled
on Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of seats in the National Assembly
in the July polls, but not the two-thirds necessary to form a new
government on its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which won the remainder of the seats _ had
threatened to boycott the assembly if their complaints about
election fraud were not investigated.
	   Hun Sen-appointed election bodies dismissed more than 800
election complaints submitted by the opposition, which is now
asking for just two issues to be seriously looked at.
	   Ranariddh is scheduled to travel Wednesday to the northwestern
province of Siem Reap for consultations with his father, King
Sihanouk. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since before
the elections.
	   The text of a letter from informal mediator Thai Deputy Foreign
Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra to Chea Sim, president of Hun Sen's
party, indicates that the three-party agreement may be conditional
on assurances by the government of ``the safety, freedom of
movement and freedom from arrest and detention of all parties.''
	   The government has banned several dozen opposition figures from
leaving the country, despite constitutional guarantees of freedom
of movement.
	   FUNCINPEC has complained it is difficult for them to negotiate
with the government when the travel ban puts them in the position
of ``hostages.''
	   The excuse for imposing the ban was the suspected involvement of
opposition figures in a Sept. 7 grenade attack on Hun Sen's home.
He was not there and no one was hurt.
	   The opposition's demand that two election complaints be dealt
with is a potential roadblock to implementing the agreement.
	   Another is uncertainty whether the opposition parties can
actually control anti-government street protests. Sentiment against
Hun Sen runs deep in the capital, and has been intensified by
police brutality.
	   Security forces, many toting assault rifles as well as standard
riot gear, on Monday arrested at least 22 protesters _ including an
American and a German tourist _ for inciting ``civil unrest,''
Khieu Sopheak said.
	   The two foreigners, whose involvement was apparently limited to
taking part in marches, are expected to be deported.

Children suffering in Kosovo, but not used to fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Children are suffering the most from the conflict
in Kosovo, but at least there are no signs they are being drafted
into the fighting, a U.N. envoy said Tuesday.
	   An estimated 60 percent of the people displaced from their homes
and shivering in appalling conditions on mountain slopes and in
forests are children, said Olara Otunnu.
	   ``They are truly on the edge of survival,'' Otunnu said upon his
return from a three day trip to Yugoslavia and its troubled Kosovo
province. Otunnu, a national of the Ivory Coast, is the U.N.
special representative for children in armed conflict.
	   Echoing warnings of international aid agencies about a looming
humanitarian tragedy, Otunnu said children had started to die of
diseases like diarrhea and dysentery.
	   About 300,000 people have been forced out of their homes by the
fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian separatists. An
estimated 50,000 of these are trying to survive in the open.
	   Otunnu appealed to the international community to send more aid
for much needed shelter, food and medicines. He also called for a
bigger international presence on the ground to give ethnic
Albanians confidence to return to their homes _ or what's left of
them _ without fearing Serb reprisals.
	   Despite massive and indiscriminate destruction by Serb
authorities, Otunnu said there was no real alternative to people
going back to their home villages.
	   In contrast to many other conflicts in Africa and Asia, Otunnu
said he was encouraged by the fact that there was no sign of
children being used as fighters by either Serb forces or ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   There were only two reported cases of children under the age of
18 carrying guns, he said. This did not, however, rule out the
possibility of minors carrying out support roles like gun-running
or reconnaissance.
	   The U.N. envoy said he was also encouraged by the fact that the
use of land-mines was isolated to the borders with Macedonia and
Albania.
	   ``We must be vigilant to ensure that this conflict does not go
the way of others, with the use of children as combatants and the
massive use of land mines,'' he said.

Indonesia applies for international status for national park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A remote slice of western New Guinea
with a tropical glacier atop of Southeast Asia's tallest peak,
sweltering rainforests and near impenetrable swamps has been
nominated for United Nations' protection.
	   Indonesia's People Welfare Minister Haryono Suyono on Tuesday
officially applied to UNESCO for the Lorentz National Park to be
declared a world heritage site.
	   The Worldwide Fund for Nature, which has long campaigned to
safeguard the 2.5 million-hectare (6.2 million-acre) park, said it
contained 70 percent of bird and mammal species in the province of
Irian Jaya, the Indonesian-governed half of New Guinea.
	   Its species include tree kangaroos and two types of egg-laying
mammals, or monotremes. It also is home to six major groups of
indigenous tribespeople, many of whom still follow relatively
traditional lifestyles.
	   ``The Lorentz National Park is Southeast Asia's most outstanding
natural treasure house,'' the fund said in a statement.
	   The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization grants world heritage status to sites regarded as
natural and cultural wonders of global importance and that need not
only national, but international, protection.
	   The park includes Puncak Jaya, a 5,039-meter (16,532-foot)
mountain, that is crowned by a one of only three glaciers found in
the tropics.
	   Several temples and other national parks in Indonesia have
already been granted world heritage status.

Singapore's information technology industry to slow down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis is likely to cause an
acute slowdown this year in Singapore's information technology
industry, a cornerstone of the country's economy, an official
survey said Tuesday.
	   The IT industry is expected to grow by 9 percent his year, a
significant drop from the last year's growth of 32.3 percent, the
National Computer Board said.
	   IT sales grew to 11.95 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 7
billion) in 1997, making up more than 10 percent of Singapore's
gross domestic product.
	   With Singapore serving as an IT hub for Southeast Asia, the
industry's growth has been led largely by the export market, which
made it very susceptible to the regional economic crisis.
	   The survey, which was conducted in August, said the hardest hit
sector is the sale of hardware products, estimated at 4.1 percent
growth this year, down from last year's 32.3 percent.
	   But software sales are expected to remain strong at 30 percent
growth this year, compared to 30.7 percent last year.
	   IT services, including mobile phones and Internet service
providers, will retain a relatively steady growth of 22.4 percent
this year, compared to 33.8 percent growth in 1997.
	   IT will continue to generate about 2,000 jobs a year in
Singapore in the next two years, the survey said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate on Tuesday ordered a former
game warden to stand trial Sept. 29 for the murder of British
tourist Julie Ward a decade ago.
	   ``There is sufficient evidence to charge the accused for
murder,'' said Magistrate Uniter Kidullah. She said Simon ole
Makallah and others not before the court was charged with murdering
Ward between Sept. 6 and 13, 1988 in the Maasai Mara National
Reserve.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found in the world-famous game reserve. At the time of his arrest,
Makallah was an assistant director of the Kenya Wildlife Service.
	   Makallah read a statement to the court for nearly one hour in
which he said did not kill Julie Ward and accused the woman's
father, John Ward, of manipulating the evidence which led to his
arrest on trumped-up charges.
	   ``The anguish these allegations have made on me is unbearable''
he said. ``In Kenya history of criminal procedures, this will be
the first instance where an interested party has participated in
producing the evidence.''
	   Six years ago after a court found two game wardens innocent of
charges they murdered Ward, and the judge called the investigation
flawed, her father became actively involved in the search for his
daughter's slayers.
	   Makallah said it is regrettable that Ward, a hotelier from Bury
St. Edmunds, was using the death of her daughter to make money and
for publicity.
	   He said he had been investigated by Scotland Yard and the Kenyan
police who had clearly exonerated him of the murder.
	   ``At last, I now know I have an opportunity to prove my
innocence and put my accusers to rest once and for all,'' he said.
	   Makallah said the mere fact that his search team found the body
has been seized on to link him with the murder.
	   ``I have no reason and neither did not have any motive to kill
an innocent visitor in the park,'' he said.
	   Kenyan officials first claimed Julie Ward had been attacked and
killed by wild animals.
	   The day after Makallah's arrest, Attorney General Amos Wako,
flanked by Ward, told a news conference there was sufficient
circumstantial evidence to arraign Makallah and hold a second
trial.
	   ``I hope as I languish in prison time will not be allowed to
stand still,'' said Makallah, ``My innocence is my strength. My
innocence is my defense and Kenyan justice which I therefore I will
have faith in,'' he said.
	   Ward has carried on a 10-year campaign to bring his daughter's
killers to justice.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A regional court in the eastern city of
Lublin fined a student 3,000 zloty (dlrs 857) for disseminating
fascist propaganda.
	   The defendant, identified only as 25-year-old Krzysztof R.,
mailed and used messengers to hand out pamphlets across Poland that
included excerpts of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, Benito Mussolini's
writings and the mailing addresses of foreign neo-Nazi
organizations.
	   Poland, occupied by the Nazis for five years following the Sept.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   The Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and order _ warned
Tuesday it would respond with force to any resistance from
supporters of former President Sali Berisha after clashes Sunday
and Monday.
	   Police were authorized to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed,
the ministry said on state television.
	   About 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied in the main Tirana
square, despite a ban by the Interior Ministry. The protest ended
peacefully, but tensions in the capital remained high.
	   Many protesters flashed the two-fingered victory sign as Berisha
coupled demands for the resignation of Prime Minister Fatos Nano
with exhortations that the demonstrators remain peaceful.
	   The weekend assassination of a popular Berisha ally and fellow
lawmaker touched off two days of unrest reminiscent of the
nationwide anarchy that lasted for months in 1997 and sent refugees
flooding into Italy, Greece and other European countries.
	   U.S. and European diplomats were seeking to negotiate a peaceful
end to the crisis. Many fear the unrest could spread, further
complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   On Tueday, dozens of police cars surrounded the protesters in
Tirana's central Skanderbeg Square, lights flashing and sirens
howling. The cars and several police vans were filled with officers
carrying submachine guns and wearing stocking masks.
	   Sharpshooters took up positions on the roof of the nearby
Interior Ministry building.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   The Interior Ministry also urged Berisha supporters holed up at
downtown Democratic Party headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He announced a new rally for Wednesday unless Nano resigned.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded Monday when government forces launched a counterattack and
swiftly regained control of key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Nano's office.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of the riots that swept Albania
last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which
cost many people their entire savings.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets Monday, crowds
of looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the
city, firing in the air.
	   One tank was parked Tuesday in front of Democratic Party
headquarters, apparently in rebel hands. About a half dozen Berisha
supporters armed with submachine guns were nearby.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday remained closed.
Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also cleaned out
Nano's villa in Tirana on Monday.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened with arrest by the government, has called for the
Socialist government to resign but insists he is not plotting a
takeover.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry told foreign diplomats Monday it would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha said he would never leave Albania. Berisha was
Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades under Stalinist
Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his policies became
increasingly authoritarian.
	   He said the building takeovers Monday were simply his
supporters' reaction to the slaying of opposition legislator Azem
Hajdari, who was gunned down along with a bodyguard Saturday in
front of party headquarters. Berisha blames Nano.

Cambodian capital calm after agreement on steps to end crisis

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ending a string of anti-government
protests, opposition supporters on Tuesday heeded their leaders'
calls not to demonstrate after Cambodia's rival political parties
agreed on steps to end the country's political crisis.
	   The capital was quiet after more than a week of daily marches by
thousands of people accusing strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party of using fraud to win parliamentary elections held on July
26.
	   The pro-democracy protests, which also demanded Hun Sen's
ouster, were harshly put down by well-armed riot police. At least
four people were killed and dozens injured.
	   On Tuesday, even the street by the U.S. Embassy _ the unofficial
gathering point for anti-government protesters _ was nearly empty.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, appealed to demonstrators on Monday to call off more
protests after the ruling party and its two main rivals reached a
tension-easing agreement.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak called the calm after
weeks of unrest reassuring.
	   ``It is good for the atmosphere of upcoming talks and
negotiations between party leaders,'' he said.
	   The pact agreed on Monday calls for the cessation of
demonstrations, a summit meeting of party leaders hosted by King
Sihanouk, and the convening of the National Assembly as scheduled
on Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of seats in the National Assembly
in the July polls, but not the two-thirds necessary to form a new
government on its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which won the remainder of the seats _ had
threatened to boycott the assembly if their complaints about
election fraud were not investigated.
	   Hun Sen-appointed election bodies dismissed more than 800
election complaints submitted by the opposition, which is now
asking for just two issues to be seriously looked at.
	   Ranariddh is scheduled to travel Wednesday to the northwestern
province of Siem Reap for consultations with his father, King
Sihanouk. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since before
the elections.
	   The text of a letter from informal mediator Thai Deputy Foreign
Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra to Chea Sim, president of Hun Sen's
party, indicates that the three-party agreement may be conditional
on assurances by the government of ``the safety, freedom of
movement and freedom from arrest and detention of all parties.''
	   The government has banned several dozen opposition figures from
leaving the country, despite constitutional guarantees of freedom
of movement.
	   FUNCINPEC has complained it is difficult for them to negotiate
with the government when the travel ban puts them in the position
of ``hostages.''
	   The excuse for imposing the ban was the suspected involvement of
opposition figures in a Sept. 7 grenade attack on Hun Sen's home.
He was not there and no one was hurt.
	   The opposition's demand that two election complaints be dealt
with is a potential roadblock to implementing the agreement.
	   Another is uncertainty whether the opposition parties can
actually control anti-government street protests. Sentiment against
Hun Sen runs deep in the capital, and has been intensified by
police brutality.
	   Security forces, many toting assault rifles as well as standard
riot gear, on Monday arrested at least 22 protesters _ including an
American and a German tourist _ for inciting ``civil unrest,''
Khieu Sopheak said.
	   The two foreigners, whose involvement was apparently limited to
taking part in marches, are expected to be deported.

Oft-ailing Czech leader faces challenging U.S. visit

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ On the mend after months of
life-threatening medical problems, President Vaclav Havel began a
challenging five-day trip to the United States on Tuesday that will
test his fragile health.
	   Havel is certain to face questions on the visit about his new
Cabinet's wavering support for letting controversial broadcasts to
Iraq by Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty begin. The
program is funded by the U.S. government.
	   A doctor and nurse will accompany Havel to help him cope with a
busy agenda. But doctors say the 61-year-old president's condition
is good and the trip should pose no danger, even though Havel has
been hospitalized five times since 1996, when he lost part of his
lung to cancer.
	   Last month, the president developed pneumonia following surgery
in which doctors closed a colostomy performed on him in April after
he ruptured his colon while vacationing in the Austrian Alps.
	   Havel was reported in critical condition and doctors had to
perform a tracheotomy to help him breathe.
	   During his visit, Havel is scheduled to meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and other officials.
	   One prominent U.S.-Czech issue to discuss is the RFE/RL
broadcasts, which the radio plans to start by the end of September.
	   Last month, the newly elected Social Democratic government,
worried by potential terrorist risks for the Czech Republic, agreed
to allow broadcasts to Iran but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   It said an approval to the broadcast would be considered only if
the U.S. government made an official request. The United States
made the request last week.
	   Havel spokesman Ladislav Spacek said he expects no problems.
	   ``There's no dramatic controversy,'' Spacek said in a telephone
interview Monday, indicating he doesn't expect the Cabinet to try
to halt the broadcasts.

Australia beats India by 145 runs, coasts into semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, semifinal lineup; EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Captain Steve Waugh scored 100 not
out in an unbroken 171-run partnership with Tom Moody Tuesday to
overpower India and guide Australia into the semifinals of the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Batting first after being sent in by India, Australia struggled
in the initial overs, losing five wickets for 84 runs by the 20th
over before Waugh and Moody took control, lifting the total to 255
in 50 overs. India ended with 110 for nine in 37.2 overs, giving
Australia an impressive 145-run victory.
	   In other matches, South Africa defeated Barbados by four wickets
to set up the first semifinal clash on Wednesday with Sri Lanka,
which had qualified earlier.
	   Also Tuesday, New Zealand defeated Pakistan by 81 runs and will
meet Australia in the second semifinal on Thursday.
	   India was unlucky when Moody survived a pad-bat catch appeal in
the 22nd over before he had scored. Television replays showed the
ball bounced off Moody's glove into the hands of the silly point
fielder. In the previous over, wicket-keeper M.S.K. Prasad dropped
a difficult catch from a thick inside edge of Moody's bat during
Anil Kumble's over.
	   India also was forced to bat with nine players after opener Amay
Khuresia collapsed from heat stroke in the sweltering humid heat
and was hospitalized.
	   Indian manager K. Srikkanth said such misfortunes are part of
the game.
	   ``We were beaten fair and square. There are no excuses,'' he
said.
	   After the early hiccups, Waugh and Moody, playing against a
partisan pro-India crowd, steadily built the innings. Moody made an
unbeaten 76 in 103 balls. Waugh faced the same number of deliveries
and hit three fours and a six.
	   Waugh said he will be aiming for the gold medal now. ``A gold
medal ... means a lot, as much as a one-day international,'' he
said.
	   Srikkanth slammed his bowlers _ for squandering the early
advantage of five wickets _ and batsmen for ``lack of
application.''
	   Prasad, opening in place of Khuresia, was run out for one in the
third over. The other opener, V.V. Laxman, was the next to go,
looking to play across the line and giving a low catch to Waugh in
the gully off Moody.
	   All hopes now rested on Indian star Sachin Tendulkar, who opened
confidently with a drive for three and a meat-of-the-bat pull for a
four. But in the 15th over, Tendulkar tried to play forward to a
superb Damien Fleming delivery that was leaving him, and gave a
leading edge catch to keeper Adam Gilchrist. He made 11.
	   Tendulkar, who had scored six centuries in the last 12 innings
against Australia, will return home with a total score of 28 from
three matches in the Commonwealth Games, where cricket is being
featured for the first time. However, the 16-nation competition
here is not recognized by the International Cricket Council and
Tendulkar's one-day record remains unblemished.
	   After a nominal defense by Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh, the
tailend was wiped out slowly but steadily.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government announced Tuesday that it plans
to build a 64 billion Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 8.2 billion)
railway that will be the largest project in the territory after the
newly opened airport.
	   The 30.5-kilometer (18.9-mile) long, electrified railway will
link urban Kowloon peninsula with the New Territories bordering
China.
	   The double-track railway will be the territory's largest project
since the completion in July of the U.S. dlrs 20.1 billion Chek Lap
Kok airport.
	   Work on the railway will begin in the next few months and will
create about 13,000 jobs in the next few years, said secretary for
transport Nicholas Ng.
	   The railway will serve more than 500,000 passengers daily when
it is completed in 2011.

Russia's Central Bank chairman says he favors printing new rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Central Bank head saying he favors
increasing Russia's money supply. &QL;

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new Central Bank chairman said Tuesday
that he favored printing more rubles to pay off back wages, a risky
move that economists fear could unleash hyperinflation.
	   Viktor Gerashchenko said the Central Bank would not start adding
to the money supply until the bank's new board of directors is in
place and can consider such a move. Parliament plans a confirmation
vote on the board members Wednesday.
	   Gerashchenko made clear he supports an increased money supply
once the new team is in place, but gave few details.
	   ``We can't do without that,'' Gerashchenko told reporters when
asked about boosting the money supply, Interfax reported.
	   He did not say if the increase in the money supply would be
underpinned by the Central Bank's hard currency reserves. If the
bank simply prints money that is not backed by assets, this would
erode the value of the ruble and even lead to hyperinflation.
	   Gerashchenko, who served as the Soviet and then Russian top
banker in 1989-1994, has been broadly criticized in Russia and the
West for inflationary policies during his previous tenure.
	   After years of ruinous inflation this decade, Russia had been
bringing prices under control. Inflation was down to 11 percent
last year and was expected to be in single digits this year, until
the economic crisis hit with full force last month.
	   Inflation leapt to 15 percent in August, and was 36 percent for
the first week of September. Economists have warned that if the
government begins printing large sums of money to pay off its debts
_ as it did during the early 1990s _ sky-high inflation is likely
to follow.
	   New Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has said the new
government's top priority will be paying the millions of workers
and pensioners who are owed back wages.
	   But Primakov, who conferred with President Boris Yeltsin at the
Kremlin on Tuesday, has yet to say how the government will raise
money to meet its obligations.
	   ``We will find the necessary solutions to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Primakov told reporters Tuesday, without
elaboration.
	   Liberal politicians have expressed concern that the new Cabinet
will rely on outdated methods such as printing money and tightening
administrative controls to undo free-market reforms.
	   Primakov and other government officials, however, pledged to
continue reforms and promised to walk a tightrope between paying
wages and maintaining control over the money supply.
	   Officials on Monday denied reports that the government had
already cranked up the money-printing presses to pay wages.
	   Liberals have said that the appointment of Soviet-era
bureaucrats to top economic posts will bring back Communist
influences in government policies.
	   But the Communist Party has distanced itself from the new
administration, saying it would be ``inexpedient'' to join the
cabinet. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that the
appointment of Communists was a Kremlin initiative, not the party's
proposal.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the head of the pro-government, centrist Our
Home Is Russia parliament faction, said on Tuesday he had accepted
the post of deputy prime minister in charge of financial issues.
Shokhin previously served in the cabinet as economics minister at
the start of Russia's free-market reforms.
	   Shokhin said the government might print some new rubles, but
pledged to keep it under strict checks to prevent fueling
inflation.
	   Plans to print new rubles are certain to complicate Russia's
talks with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF wants to first
make sure that Russia has sound economic policies in place before
releasing the next installment of an existing loan.
	   The IMF put together a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia in July, but the first installment was smaller than planned
and the second infusion of dlrs 4.3 billion is likely to be
delayed.
	   The IMF director in charge of Russia, John Odling Smee, was to
arrive in Moscow on Tuesday for talks with Russian officials.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's currency, which has been gaining strength in

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The death toll in a weekend massacre in
a village in Algeria rose to 37, with a newspaper Tuesday reporting
the attackers used incendiary bombs, Kalashnikov rifles and knives.
	   Citing witnesses, the La Tribune newspaper said the village of
Ain Sbaa about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Algiers was
beset upon by attackers who dragged their victims into the streets.
	   The attack early Monday came days after President Liamine
Zeroual announced Friday he would step down and call early
presidential elections. It was the worst reported massacre in
months in Algeria.

Iraq says Syrians can enter country without visa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new sign of warming ties, Iraq has
decided to allow Syrian nationals to visit the country without
visas, a Baghdad weekly reported Tuesday.
	   Al-Ittihad said the decision by Baghdad was taken in light of
``developing bilateral ties and the growth in trade exchange.'' It
said the Syrians will also be exempt from entry fees.
	   The weekly gave no figure on the number of Syrians entering Iraq
since the border between the two countries reopened last year. It
also did not say whether Iraqis will be treated similarly by the
Syrian authorities.
	   The countries, ruled by rival factions of the Arab Baath
Socialist party, long had chilly relations, and Syria supported
Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Recently, however, there's been a warming of ties.
	   Baghdad shops now brim with Syrian goods, mainly foodstuffs,
clothes and household utensils. Most commercials on Iraq television
now promote Syrian industries. Early this month Syria reopened its
trade center in Baghdad after a gap of nearly 18 years.
	   An Iraqi trade center is expected to open soon in the Syrian
capital, Damascus. The countries agreed on Aug. 20 to restart a
pipeline for Iraqi crude that was shut for 16 years.

Police probe forged bank notes at Lisbon world's fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Police said Tuesday they were
investigating a report that staff at the Lisbon world's fair forged
Portuguese bank notes on a sophisticated photocopier and used the
counterfeit currency to bilk foreigners at the event.
	   Employees at the world's fair head office alerted police after
finding a color photocopy of bank notes on one side of a sheet of
paper, daily 24 Horas reported Tuesday.
	   The world's fair board said in a written statement issued after
the newspaper published its report that the case was discovered in
July.
	   ``However, as far as we know, this is a situation which _
although it is of a very serious nature _ appears to have been
small-scale and therefore does not justify any alarm,'' the
statement said.
	   The sophisticated digital photocopier apparently had been used
during the night to replicate the bank notes, the paper said. Only
world's fair staff are authorized to enter the building.
	   The notes were probably used as payment in restaurants and bars
at the fair where foreign workers would be less familiar with the
Portuguese currency, according to the paper.
	   A police spokesman said an investigation was underway but could
provide no details.
	   The fair, known as Expo 98, opened May 22 and closes Sept. 30.

Eleven people charged in Duesseldorf airport fire that killed 17
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ State prosecutors announced charges
of negligent arson against 11 people Tuesday in connection with a
1996 fire that killed 17 travelers at Germany's busiest charter
airport.
	   The defendants are architects, engineers, welders who designed,
built and helped maintain the Rhein-Ruhr Airport as well as airport
firefighters responsible for safety measures, chief prosecutor
Manfred Classen said at a news conference. They face up to five
years in prison if found guilty.
	   Officials hope to start the trial by early next year.
	   The April 1996 fire spread from an area outside the main
terminal where welders were at work via ceiling cable ducts into
the arrivals hall. Most of the deaths were caused by poisonous
clouds of smoke produced by the burning cables.
	   Officials charge that the construction company doing the welding
failed to take safety measures to prevent the cables from igniting.
	   But investigators at the time also blamed the design of the
airport for the use of polystyrene panels in constructing the
airport ceiling because they hid the cabling and presented a latent
danger.
	   These are the first criminal charges filed in the deadly fire.
However, a state court ordered both the airport and the
construction company to reimburse insurance companies for damages
they paid out.
	   The court said the airport had to pay because the terminal's
insulation was flammable.

Malaysian police round up ousted Cabinet minister's colleagues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar's comments about Queen Elizabeth grafs
11-12 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister said his personal secretary was detained Tuesday as part
of a mounting police crackdown on his colleagues.
	   ``They're gradually picking away people,'' said Anwar Ibrahim,
claiming a third of his close associates have been arrested and
coerced ``to admit certain things _ treason, selling government
secrets or whatever.''
	   Anwar was sacked as finance chief and deputy prime minister by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after clashing with his
mentor on economic policy.
	   Since then, Anwar has gone on a campaign calling for political
reform, attracting thousands of supporters to rallies and speeches
_ and angering the authorities.
	   Anwar said that police arrested Mohamad Ahmad, his former
private secretary at the Finance Ministry, early Tuesday morning
and he had not been heard from since.
	   ``Until now, no news,'' Anwar told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
	   Anwar also said that another private secretary, Azmin Ali, had
been notified Tuesday of his imminent arrest. Anwar's adopted
brother, Sukma Dermawan, was detained last week.
	   At a late-night rally outside his house Monday, Anwar said that
a close friend, Munawar Anees, was arrested under the country's
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment without
trial.
	   ``Is this a police state or not? What's happening to this
country?'' Anwar had shouted through a microphone to thousands of
supporters crammed into his backyard.
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged with any crime, he
has been accused of leaking state secrets, sedition, tampering with
police investigations and having sex with several women and a man.
	   The government has not taken action against him personally, he
said, because it is preoccupied with the Commonwealth Games and the
arrival of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II on Sept. 21.
	   ``I believe their timing will be perfect,'' he said of his own
expected arrest. ``They will wait until her majesty, the queen,
leaves.''
	   Mahathir, who has been in power for 17 years, has not given
details about why he dismissed his deputy, saying only that Anwar
was immoral and unfit to lead.
	   On Tuesday, Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament
and Anwar's one-time chief antagonist, stopped by Anwar's house to
to inquire about the recent arrests.
	   Lim told reporters that Anwar's dismissal and the growing number
of his arrested associates raised ``grave concerns'' about the
country's handling of human rights.
	   ``It has raised a very grave question as to whether Mahathir has
become an investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury all in one,''
Lim said.
	   Lim's son, Lim Guan Eng, recently began serving an 18-month
prison term for writing a pamphlet that raised questions about the
country's judicial system.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security personnel blocked two
anti-government street marches in the capital Tuesday as discontent
festered against the crisis-burdened government.
	   Troops scuffled and pushed back Muslim students when they tried
to converge on President B.J. Habibie's palace.
	   The group, numbering only about 30, were angry that several
jailed Islamic leaders were not among 100 political prisoners
released by Habibie after he replaced former autocratic leader
President Suharto in May.
	   They called for the release of Habib Hussein Al-Habsyi, an aging
Muslim leader who was sentenced for life in 1990 for allegedly
masterminding the bombings of a church and a bus in East Java and
the Buddhist temple of Borobudur in Central Java.
	   There were no injuries or arrests.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state. Nevertheless
Suharto's regime often cracked down on Islamic leaders who opposed
or criticized it.
	   In other parts of the capital, about 150 students from a
Christian university were blocked from marching on Parliament. They
yelled anti-government slogans after they walked from their campus
to a neighboring college.
	   Another group of students held a rally outside the parliament
building before going to the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, where
Muslim leader Amien Rais was holding dialogue with relatives of the
victims of military actions.
	   Rais expressed support to the students' rejection of the
military's role in the country's political affairs.
	   Protests against Habibie and his government have mounted in
recent days along with outbreaks of rioting and looting.
	   The worst economic crisis in 30 years has resulted in soaring
prices, mass unemployment, food shortages and growing poverty.
	   Meanwhile, Medan, about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northwest
of Jakarta, was calm Tuesday, after a day of rioting and looting.
	   Police in the city arrested 33 people Monday after violence
erupted during a strike by public transport drivers upset over
rising prices.
	   Riots were also reported from Palopo and Luwu, two neighboring
towns in South Sulawesi, about 1,250 kilometers (780 miles)
northeast of Jakarta.
	   Two people were killed and 118 houses were damaged after a mass
brawl broke out Saturday between two rival gangs.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper reported that police shot a third man
to death when a mob looted a rice warehouse in Bondowoso, 765
kilometers (480 miles) east of Jakarta, on Sunday.

Ukrainian authorities detain diggers of ancient graves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU)
detained a group of Crimeans on suspicion of conducting illegal
archaeological digs and selling the finds on the underground
market, officials said Tuesday.
	   The diggers were seized over the weekend in an area known as
Baklynsky grave site, near the village of Skalyste in the
Bakhchysarai region of Crimea, SBU's Crimean department said in a
statement.
	   Agents found numerous objects of significant cultural and
historic value among personal belongings and in hiding places
allegedly arranged by the suspects, who set up a camp base near the
8th century graves, said the statement, cited by the Interfax news
agency.
	   The grave robbers' finds included well-preserved jugs, cups,
rare glass goblets and silver and bronze jewelry decorated with
semi-precious stones. authorities said.
	   Authorities launched a criminal case against the group, whose
membership was not immediately clear, on suspicion of harming and
destroying historical and architectural monuments. The charges
carry a two-year prison term.
	   Another group of diggers that infiltrated the same site was
scared away by SBU agents, the statement said. SBU also noted that
grave-diggers on the Black Sea peninsula were well organized, with
some groups carrying out the actual digs, others supplying them
with instruments and food and separate groups engaged in illegal
sales of the finds.

U.N. human rights chief ends visit claiming success

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson ended an
unprecedented 10-day mission to China on Tuesday claiming success
in raising awareness among both Chinese leaders and the public.
	   Both Robinson and her Chinese hosts said they were pleased with
the outcome of the visit, the first official mission by a U.N. high
commissioner for human rights to China.
	   Robinson said she achieved her goal of beginning to work with
the Chinese on ways to improve human rights protection, but added
that ``even with all the goodwill in the world, I can't work
miracles.''
	   Robinson said she raised specific cases of political prisoners
with her hosts and urged them to fulfill international commitments
on improving protection of civil liberties.
	   Mindful of China's sensitivity over international criticism of
its human rights record, Robinson said she concentrated on laying
the groundwork for future cooperation with the U.N. Human Rights
Commission.
	   Beijing apparently was pleased with her careful approach.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Robinson had started a
good working relationship and that Chinese officials responded
``very positively'' to her suggestions.
	   ``Her visit this time is crowned with success,'' Zhu told
reporters.
	   Noting that authorities continued to detain and harass citizens
during her 10-day stay, a prominent dissident said Robinson's visit
had failed to promote human rights.
	   Xu Wenli criticized Robinson for not vehemently protesting the
Sept. 5 arrest of leading Chinese journalist Shi Binhai nor the
treatment given to Chu Hailan, whom police dragged away moments
before she tried to hand Robinson a letter last Wednesday.
	   ``Her attitude was much too polite, too flexible,'' Xu said.
``She's a high-level U.N. official. She should have made a much
stronger, more principled stand.''
	   Robinson conceded the Chinese government restricted her
activities, particularly in Tibet, and prevented her from meeting
dissidents.
	   ``The visit was a first for the authorities and they were quite
concerned about what would happen,'' Robinson said. ``It was not
easy.''
	   But Robinson insisted she championed Chu's case, saying she
``wasn't going to let that one go by without ensuring she was
released.'' She added that all cases brought to her attention would
be pursued.
	   At her urging, Chinese leaders told her they would sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights next month.
They had announced six months ago their intentions to sign the
treaty, considered a basic guarantor of human rights.
	   At a meeting Monday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin made no
response, Robinson said, to her urging that he meet with the Dalai
Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.
	   Robinson's presence triggered an outpouring of appeals from
dissidents demanding the release of political prisoners and a curb
on police powers, particularly the authority to send people to
labor camps for up to four years without trial.
	   A dissident based in the central city of Wuhan urged Robinson to
demand that authorities investigate the deaths of 10 people who
died while in official custody in Xinzhou, a nearby county in
central Hubei province.
	   Xinzhou county officials claimed the prisoners had all committed
suicide, but in several cases, the bodies of those who died were
cremated without permission from their families, preventing
autopsies, Qin Yongmin said in a statement faxed to foreign news
media. County police and prosecutors denied the allegations.
	   As Robinson was leaving China, eight dissidents vowed to go on a
symbolic 72-hour fast starting Wednesday to demand the release of
jailed labor rights campaigner Zhang Shanguang, New York-based
Human Rights in China reported.
	   In an open letter, the dissidents argued that Zhang's attempt to
set up an association to protect the rights of laid-off workers was
not a crime.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Striking ice cream vendors, protesting a
freeze on their income, returned to work Tuesday after ice cream
makers promised to discuss their grievances.
	   At least 100 vendors blockaded a main street in downtown Harare
with their brightly painted pushcarts and bicycle-mounted trolleys
on Monday and were demanding higher pay, said Dairbiord, the
biggest producer of dairy products.
	   The company said in a statement the strikers were not employed
by ice cream makers but were paid a 14 percent commission on goods
sold on the streets and in parks and playgrounds.
	   The vendors wanted their commission raised and the issue was
being discussed.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka
Anyaoku said Tuesday he was adjourning mediation between the ruling
party and the opposition in Zanzibar to give the island government
time to consider his proposals.
	   Anyaouku said in a statement sent to news organizations in
Tanzania that he had been informed the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
party had appointed a seven-member committee to discuss the
proposals.
	   The statement was sent from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where
Anyaoku is attending the Commonwealth Games.
	   The opposition Civic United Front party, which has refused to
recognize President Salim Amour's government saying it came to be
through fraudulent elections in October 1995, accepted the
proposals in August.
	   The proposals have not been made public.
	   ``Once the party (CCM) has completed its deliberations I will
consider _ in consultations with all concerned _ the next steps to
be taken,'' Anyaoku said.
	   Though federated to mainland Tanzania, the Indian Ocean islands
of Pemba and Zanzibar are semi-autonomous and have their own
president, government and legislature.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Nigerian transit passenger at Entebbe
international airport was arrested after he was found to have
swallowed pellets of undetermined drugs, police said Tuesday.
	   Police detained Mbanugo Chukwuka, 35, Sept. 9 after noticing he
was behaving suspiciously, said Johnson Ayela. Later his stool was
checked and 50 pellets were found in it, Ayela said.
	   Ayela, who displayed the pellets at a news conference, said
Chukwuka was en route from New Delhi to an undisclosed destination
when he was arrested.
	   Ayela said Entebbe has become a major transit route for drug
traffickers from Asia to Europe and North America.
	   He said 38 foreigners and 12 Ugandan's are detained as suspected
drug traffickers.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Three South African
institutions on Tuesday signed cooperation agreements with
Britain's official export credit agency, the Export Credits
Guarantee Department, to provide export and investment finance for
joint projects on the continent.
	   The agreements, signed between ECGD, the Development Bank of
Southern Africa, the Industrial Development Corp. and Credit
Guarantee Insurance Corp., would create a partnership between the
four institutions to finance projects, fund capital goods exports
into Africa and insure investments.
	   The agreements were concluded in Johannesburg as part of the
British-South Africa Partnership Week, during the visit of British
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Peter Mandelson.

	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Nearly half the population of Malawi
live on less than a single U.S. dollar a day, according to a U.N.
report.
	   The U.N. Human Development Index said living conditions in the
impoverished southeast African country of 12 million people
deteriorated in the past year, leaving 48 percent of the people
``below expected levels of life expectancy, literacy, employment
and income.''
	   The report, available in Blantyre on Monday, said statistical
research showed that about 5.7 million people ``survive on a daily
income of less than dlrs 1'' (41 Malawi kwacha).
	   General economic decline and the impact on health care and
resources of the worsening AIDS pandemic contributed to the decline
in living conditions, the United Nations said.
	   Because of such conditions, Malawi's life expectancy of 60 years
was declining, with four people in every 10 dying before the age of
40 in 1997.
	   Malawi gained independence from Britain in 1964. A brutal
30-year dictatorship making the nation one of Africa's poorest
ended with the first democratic elections in 1994.

Nicol of Scotland and Power of Canada to play for squash gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland cruised into the squash final at the Commonwealth Games
Tuesday, easily dismantling Paul Johnson of England.
	   Nicol, who won 9-2, 9-3, 9-1, will play for the gold Wednesday
against No. 3 Jonathan Power of Canada, who earlier dispatched Alex
Gough of Wales in three straight games.
	   The women's final on the same day will be an all-Australian
affair between the best players in the world. Sara Fitz-Gerald and
Michelle Martin won comfortably against their semifinal opponents.
	   Nicol and world No. 8 Johnson traded serves for almost five
minutes before the Scottish star scored in the opening of the first
game. He broke away again at 2-2 and looked at ease thereafter,
playing virtually error-free squash.
	   In a tight match six weeks ago in Hong Kong, Johnson had six
match balls against the 25-year-old Nicol but failed to convert and
lost.
	   Nicol, this year's British Open champion, broke the decade-long
dominance in squash of Jansher Khan of Pakistan. Khan decided not
to compete in the Commonwealth Games.
	   In the other men's semifinal, Power fended off a late rally from
Gough in the last game to win 9-4, 9-2, 9-4. Down 5-0 in the third,
Gough won three points and seemed to be gaining momentum but then
he faded after a seesaw battle.
	   In women's matches, No. 1 Fitz-Gerald beat England's Cassie
Jackman 9-2, 9-0, 9-2, while No. 2 Martin ousted another
Englishwoman, Sue Wright, 9-7, 9-1, 9-2.
	   Fitz-Gerald has recently lost to Martin, so the final is
expected to be a close contest.
	   ``I've got to go into it with nothing to lose. I'm coming off
the loss,'' Fitz-Gerald said. ``I might be No. 1 but it's equal for
both of us, we're chasing gold.''

EU authorizes sale of Viagra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Tuesday
authorized the sale of the anti-impotence drug Viagra in its 15
member countries, but several governments have already said they
won't offset the cost.
	   The drug was approved Tuesday at the regular weekly meeting of
the EU's executive Commission in Strasbourg, France.
	   Britain, France and Portugal have said they will not make the
blue, diamond-shaped pills available free or at subsidized prices
through their national health programs, meaning that patients will
have to pay the full price to obtain the drug privately.
	   Under the EU's authorization, Viagra will only be available on
doctor's prescription and may not be supplied to patients under 18
or to women.
	   The manufacturer, New York-based Pfizer Inc., is required to
include a warning for patients with severe heart or liver problems,
and recommend against taking Viagra more than once a day.
	   Britain's Health Secretary Frank Dobson said the National Health
Service would not provide the drug free since it would cost 50
million pounds (dlrs 82.5 million) to 50 million pounds (dlrs 247.5
million) yearly.
	   ``That money isn't there, so therefore we have to take the money
away from maternity services for women having babies or people who
are being treated for cancer or people who are being treated for
heart disease,'' Dobson told BBC radio Tuesday.

Belfast Assembly debates bitter legacy of Omagh car bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Grafs 7-9 UPDATES with debate ends, ADDS background on
Assembly &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ United in horror but divided by
politics, the Protestants and Catholics of Northern Ireland's new
legislature on Tuesday debated the bitter legacy of last month's
car-bomb slaughter by Irish Republican Army dissidents.
	   In often raw and personal speeches, several Protestant speakers
accused members from the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party across the
chamber of complicity with those who committed Northern Ireland's
deadliest atrocity in its three-decade conflict.
	   The Aug. 15 attack on Omagh claimed 29 lives _ 16 Catholics, 11
Protestants, and two Spanish tourists. Most of the dead were women
and children.
	   The dissidents, the so-called Real IRA, tried to destroy their
former colleagues' July 1997 truce, but called a ``complete
cessation'' last week in response to public fury over the Omagh
attack.
	   ``There are those in this chamber who know who these people are.
And they should be sharing such knowledge with the authorities,''
said Derek Hussey, a member of the Ulster Unionists, the north's
major British Protestant party, gesturing to the Sinn Fein benches.
	   He quoted Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams' recent pledge that
violence should be ```done with and gone.' And I ask the simple
question: Is it?''
	   Hussey was the first of 20 speakers from eight parties who
debated inside Stormont Parliament Building what lessons should be
drawn from Omagh.
	   After three hours, the 108-member Assembly _ the central plank
of April's agreement on how Catholics and Protestants should govern
Northern Ireland together _ closed for the day with its next
meeting uncertain.
	   Its first crucial task will be to approve a new multi-party
administration for the British-ruled province, but that
controversial step is unlikely to be taken before November.

WHO: HIV infection likely to rise with other sexually transmitted
</HEADLINE>
diseases &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ HIV infections are likely to rise in
the Western Pacific unless countries in the region fight the spread
of other sexually transmitted diseases, the World Health
Organization said Tuesday.
	   The regional WHO body estimates that more than 35 million new
cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis occur yearly in the
region _ 2 percent to 5 percent among the sexually active
population and from 20 percent to 40 percent among ``commercial sex
workers.''
	   WHO regional chief Dr. S.T. Han said nearly 85,000 HIV
infections and over 15,500 new AIDS cases were found in the region
during a one-year period ending in May.
	   But Han estimates that the actual number of cases is nearer to
700,000 HIV infections and 40,000 AIDS due to underreporting and
underdiagnosis.
	   If left at its present rate, WHO projects that by 2000, the
number of HIV infections in the region will exceed 1.5 million and
the number of AIDS cases will reach 50,000 per year.
	   Han urged governments to improve and expand health education
programs to combat the spread of STDs and AIDS.
	   In a report, WHO said prostitutes and their clients need to be
targeted in the prevention and treatment of STDs.
	   Han said efforts toward wider support for STD education and
improved access to care and treatment of those infected are
underway in Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Briefing packages have
also been prepared and are being distributed to school teachers in
China.
	   In Cambodia, a campaign has been launched for 100 percent condom
use.
	   Han said the total number of HIV infections in the region has
been increasing each year, but the growth is moderate compared to
other parts of the world.
	   An increase of HIV cases among heterosexuals has been found in
Cambodia and Papua New Guinea and among injecting drug users in
China and Vietnam.
	   He said low levels of transmisison have been observed in Japan,
the Pacific island countries, the Philippines and South Korea. The
number of HIV infections in Australia and New Zealand have declined
while Malaysia's epidemic has stabilized, he added.
	   He said technical reviews and national policies have been
undertaken to safeguard blood supplies in the Philippines and
Malaysia.

Nurse convicted in Saudi murder returns to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with investigation by disciplinary body

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British nurse convicted in Saudi Arabia of
murdering an Australian colleague has returned to work, prompting
an investigation by a nursing discliplinary body.
	   Deborah Parry, 40, is working at Holy Cross Hospital in Surrey,
southeast of London, said her brother-in-law, Jonathan Ashbee.
	   The nursing body, the United Kingdom Central Council, has
launched an investigation into Parry's fitness to work, but ``hit a
brick wall'' because the Saudi authorities were unable to provide
any confirmation of the murder conviction, spokesman John Knape
said Tuesday.
	   Parry, with Scottish nurse Lucille McLauchlan, was convicted in
Saudi Arabia in the December 1996 murder of Yvonne Gilford, who was
stabbed, suffocated and beaten in her room at a Saudi hospital
where all three women worked.
	   Saudi King Fahd freed the two nurses May 20 in an act of
clemency.
	   Parry and McLauchlan said their confessions to the murder were
extracted by brutal treatment from Saudi authorities, and they
later retracted them.
	   The two nurses faced beheading until Gilford's brother, Frank,
waived the death penalty in return for dlrs 1 million, a right
given to him under Saudi law.
	   Ashebee said Parry previously worked at the Surrey hospital in
1982 and received a warm reception from the many friends she had
there.
	   ``She has two ambitions at the moment _ to clear her name and to
return to nursing,'' he said.
	   The nursing council, which received three complaints about
Parry's being back on the job, is investigating the case ``as a
matter of urgency,'' Knape said.
	   ``Our disciplinary system means that we need one of two things _
either evidence of her murder conviction or evidence which backs up
the charge,'' he said. ``So far, we have not been able to secure
either of those things from the Saudi authorities.''
	   Knape said the agency was seeking legal advice on how it could
proceed without such Saudi evidence.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A United States official on Tuesday did
not rule out some form of international support in helping end
Albania's turmoil but said the country needed to sort out the
problem on its own.
	   ``The situation we face in Albania has to be resolved by the
Albanians,'' said Richard Shifter, a U.S. assistant secretary of
state, alluding to Monday's anti-government riots in Tirana and
continuing tensions in Albania.
	   Shifter heads the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative, a
U.S.-backed 11-nation organization formed to help increase foreign
investment in the Balkans.
	   He talked to reporters after discussing construction of new
international roads and border crossings meant to improve trade in
the region.

S.African rugby experiments with TV referee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Rugby Union will experiment with
television replays to help with controversial calls in big games,
the sport's governing body said Tuesday.
	   In co-operation with local sports channel Supersport, the South
African Rugby Football Union said a fourth official will use
replays during an under-21 provincial game on Saturday between
Golden Lions and Western Province in Johannesburg.
	   The technology will be used in nine other games in the same
tournament during September and October and, if successful, could
be extended to the Super 12 competition between regional teams from
South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
	   SARFU's chief referee, Freek Burger, said the decision to have a
pilot project in South Africa was made at a conference of rugby
broadcasters from the big three Southern Hemisphere rugby-playing
nations.
	   Burger, who will referee the first game using the technology,
said using television replays could eliminate many of the
controversial close decisions in the sport.
	   ``Having followed the debate on the issue for some time, I began
looking at footage from matches in which there had been some very
close decisions,'' he said ``I was amazed at how many there were
and also how they could have been avoided with the use of
television.''
	   At first the television cameras will be placed to focus on
goal-area action, such as the scoring of tries, as well as
touchline and corner post decisions.
	   South Africa pioneered the ``third umpire'' in cricket, and
television replays are now used widely in international matches to
decide on borderline run-outs and stumpings in test matches and
limited-overs internationals.
	   However, the use of the technology has attracted criticism and
in August the International Cricket Council ruled that it was not
yet ready to extend its role in the sport.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Cara Honeychurch,
already a double gold medalist, rolled a perfect game and averaged
255.9 as she led qualifying Tuesday for the Commonwealth Games
women's singles tenpin bowling final.
	   Honeychurch rolled her 300 in the eighth of her 10 games. Her
low game in the 2,559-point series was a 227.
	   The Asian champion had scored a 298 Monday in an eight-game
series of 1,960, averaging 245, when she and Australian partner won
the mixed doubles gold. Honeychurch also was a member of the gold
medalist women's doubles pair with Maxine Nable.
	   Canada's Jane Amlinger was second in qualifying with 2,376.
Malaysia's Lai Kin Ngoh, who also rolled a 300 game, was third with
2,373 and Nable fourth with 2,226.
	   In men's qualifying, doubles gold medalist Kenny Ang of Malaysia
led with 2,305 _ an average of 230.5 with a high game of 270.
	   Canada's William Rowe had a 300 game in a series of 2,277, and
Australian Francis Ryan was third with 2,244. Richard Hood of
England stood fourth with 2,231 and South African Guy Caminsky
followed with 2,183.
	   Sixteen men and 16 women compete for the singles gold medals

Ruble begins new slide against dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble strengthened briefly on Tuesday morning,
as banks pushed the dollar down before repaying foreign investors,
and then swung down again.
	   The rate was as high as 7.5 to a dollar before dropping to 10 to
a dollar at mid-day.
	   Russian commercial banks appeared to have been pushing the ruble
higher in recent sessions to reduce their losses on months-old
contracts for selling dollars to foreign investors.
	   Because the rate was agreed upon months ago, when the ruble was
relatively stable at around 6 to a dollar, it would be very
unfavorable to Russian banks to sell dollars when the ruble is
weak. But as the contracts expired Tuesday, the ruble was expected
to resume its slide.
	   The ruble could also weaken further if the government decides to
go ahead with plans to print more money to pay off overdue wages.
New Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko said Tuesday that
printing money was inevitable.
	   Traders expected the dollar to strengthen an additional two
rubles Wednesday, said Sergei Babayan, of Troika-Dialog Bank.
	   The ruble had fallen to 20 to a dollar last week, following its
devaluation by the Russian government in mid-August and a later
decision by the Central Bank to let the currency float freely. It
was recovering during the past few days.

China treasures relations with Ireland, Jiang tells Ahern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China and Ireland have expanded political and
economic ties in nearly 20 years of diplomatic relations, and China
is eager to improve ties further, President Jiang Zemin told
visiting Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on Tuesday.
	   ``China treasures its long-term, stable and friendly cooperative
relations with Ireland,'' Jiang said according to the state-run
Xinhua News Agency.
	   China wants to join Ireland in making their bilateral relations
better than ever, Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying.
	   China and Ireland have expanded exchanges of official visits,
increased cooperation in political and economic arenas and improved
mutual understanding and friendship despite differences in history,
culture and ideology, Xinhua said.
	   Ahern arrived Monday with a delegation of about 30 Irish
business people for a five-day visit.
	   He is the first Irish prime minister to visit China since the
two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979.

Australia cleans up in medal count at Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest medal count, ADDS that Australia doesn't
dominate every sport. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Australians like to call it a
warmup for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. So far, they have
reaped the lion's share of gold at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Once again, Australia is surging ahead of 69 other competing
nations, most of them former British colonies. It has 28 gold
medals, compared to eight for Canada and five for England.
	   All but sweeping the medals in swimming, Australia has also
dominated cycling, shooting and field hockey. Its medal tally is
likely to soar in the remaining week of the games, which are held
every four years.
	   ``The last thing we want to do is turn the games into Australia
against Australia,'' said a bashful team spokesman Ian Hanson.
	   It may be too late. One joke making the rounds Tuesday described
the event in the Malaysian capital as the ``Australian National
Games.''
	   Australia is doing so well partly because it is gearing up _
with funds and training _ for the 2000 Olympics on home turf.
Champion swimmer Susie O'Neill, who has won four golds and two
silvers in Kuala Lumpur, plans to delay her retirement so she can
race.
	   Up-and-coming Australian athletes are rushing to prepare for the
most prestigious sporting event in the world in their nation's
largest city, with more than 3 million residents.
	   ``There's a whole host of youngsters who want to be part of
that. Sydney is certainly playing a major role,'' Hanson said.
	   Every day, recorded renditions of the national anthem of
Australia blare from speakers as victorious athletes in green and
yellow windbreakers step up to the podium in fields or stadiums.
	   Australia also dominated the 1994 Commonwealth Games in
Victoria, Canada, with 87 gold medals, more than twice as many as
the host nation, which placed second. This time around, everybody
expects Australia to pick up lots more gold until the games wrap
up.
	   ``It might get a bit grating toward the end,'' said Martin Bell,
a Scottish long-distance walker. ``We'll just do our best to try to
stop them.''
	   Australia doesn't win across the board. Canada dominates
sychronized swimming. Some big names in track and field are gunning
for Commonwealth medals, and they're not Australian.
	   A low point of Australian sports came at the 1976 Olympics Games
in Montreal, where the team won only one bronze in swimming and a
few other minor medals.
	   Since then, Australia has founded a national sports institute
that has hired world-class talent. Russian swimming coach Gennadi
Touretski joined the Australian team in 1992.
	   Australian sports got another boost Sunday, when tennis star
Patrick Rafter beat Mark Philippoussis in the first meeting between
two Australians in the U.S. Open final since 1970.

Teen-age gang suspected in east German anti-foreigner attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ A teen-age gang is suspected of attacking
a 31-year-old man from Mozambique with knives and baseball bats,
the latest in a rising number of assaults on foreigners in Germany.
	   Prosecutors said Tuesday that charges would be filed this month
against the gang's ringleader; the others are to be charged later.
Names were not released for the suspects or the African victim, who
suffered serious eye injuries.
	   Prosecutors said anti-foreigner sentiment was the motive for the
attack in Halle, a city in the former communist East Germany where
neo-Nazi and xenophobic violence has increased since German
reunification in 1990.
	   The Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which
monitors extremist groups, recorded 790 right-wing attacks last
year _ 27 percent more than in 1996 and the first increase in four
years.
	   Most of the attacks involved young men beating up foreigners,
whom skinheads and neo-Nazis accuse of stealing jobs from Germans
or of milking the welfare state. Unemployment in the east is more
than 17 percent, almost twice the national average.

Serb official: Albania unrest further threatens Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official in Kosovo
said Tuesday Serbia was ``very worried'' about the unrest in
neighboring Albania and warned the stability of the whole region
could be at stake.
	   Veljko Odalovic, a senior state official in Serbia's volatile
southern province, accused opposition leaders in Albania of
supporting Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels and said a change of
government there would further threaten already explosive Kosovo.
	   He spoke a day after a day of shooting, looting and other
violence between Albania's government security forces and
supporters of former President Sali Berisha.
	   ``Any clashes in our immediate neighborhood are a reason for our
grave concern, especially if it is Albania and if a legally elected
government is threatened in such a way,'' Odalovic told Associated
Press Television.
	   ``Violent methods cannot bring any good ... especially if we
here know that the other (opposition) side has supported
separatism, and terrorists,'' said Odalovic referring to the rebel
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army in Kosovo.
	   ``Supporters of (former President) Sali Berisha have had their
base in the part of Albania from where most weapons and most misery
came to our country,'' he said.
	   In the past months of their rebellion against the Serb rule in
predominantly ethnic Albanian Kosovo, the KLA has smuggled in
weapons and men from northern Albania, their unofficial base.
	   Odalovic said many KLA fighters have crossed into Albania
following their defeat in much of Kosovo.

Parliament bans increase in payments for communal services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament on
Tuesday overrode a presidential veto and confirmed its earlier ban
on a price hike for utilities and public transportation fees.
	   Parliament has adopted a law that charges for so-called
``communal services'' must not be changed in spite of the
government's plan to increase them. President Leonid Kuchma vetoed
the law.
	   But on Tuesday, 317 deputies in Ukraine's 450-seat Verkhovna
Rada voted to override that veto, Interfax news agency said.
	   Ukrainians currently pay only 80 percent of the total cost of
communal services, which include apartment fees and payments for
gas, water and heating.
	   The government earlier planned to cancel all state subsidies for
the communal sector by the end of the year at the urging of the
International Monetary Fund.
	   But lawmakers insisted that any further raise in communal
payments would only increase the population's mounting debt.
	   Ukrainians owed their government nearly 2.9 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.1 billion) for communal services as of July, and about half of
all debtors have not paid their bills for more than two months,
according to government statistics.

Fiat unveils a new Maserati sports car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MODENA, Italy (AP) _ Fiat unveiled a new Maserati coupe on
Tuesday aimed at reviving the famous sports car after two decades
of slow death.
	   The four-seater will sell for 149.5 million lire (dlrs 89,628).
It won't be available in the United States, where a third of the
world's sports cars are sold, before 2001.
	   Fiat acquired Maserati in 1993 and invested heavily to relaunch
the sports car. Maserati's chief executive, Paolo Marinsek, said he
expected Maserati to start posting a profit after the start of U.S.
sales.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yasunori Watanabe scored two tries and Japan routed
Argentina 44-29 in a friendly test match Tuesday, a preparation
game for the Japanese heading into the final round of Asian
regional qualifying for next year's World Cup.
	   Playing before a crowd of 20,000 at Prince Chichibu Memorial
Rugby Ground, Kensuke Iwabuchi kicked two goals as Japan jumped out
to a 26-12 lead at halftime, going ahead on Daisuke Ohata's try off
a final pass from Yukio Motoki in the 20th minute to erase a 7-6
advantage by the Pumas.
	   Igunacio Corleto and Frederico Todeschini pushed over tries for
Argentina, which qualified as the first of three nations from the
Americas zone last month.
	   The final round of Asian qualifying is scheduled for Oct. 24-31
in Singapore with Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The
tournament winner advances automatically to next year's 20-nation
finals in Wales Oct. 1-Nov. 6, with the runner-up getting a second
chance in a repechage tournament.

Russian official: North Korea's launch may have been a satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian experts are still not sure if North Korea
launched a ballistic missile on Aug. 31, or a satellite as it
claimed, an official said Tuesday.
	   The object did not emit any signals, and its weight of only 13
kilograms (28.6 pounds) complicated identification, said a senior
expert with Russia's Space Agency, Gennady Khromov, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Meanwhile, an analyst at the Moscow office of the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace called for improving ties with North Korea to
prevent unexpected actions on its part, Interfax reported.
	   ``A number of countries, including Russia, the United States,
Japan and China, have found themselves in a zone controlled by
missiles launched by a half-starved nation,'' Alexander Pikayev, an
analyst at Carnegie's weapons nonproliferation program, was quoted
as saying.

More than 1,300 Karen cross into Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ About a thousand Karen villagers have
fled to Thailand after Myanmar troops on an offensive against
separatists threatened to burn their hamlets, the refugees said
Tuesday.
	   The latest mass of refugees followed 300 Karen villagers who had
already taken shelter from the soldiers on the Thai bank of the
Moei River, which runs between the two countries.
	   The Thai army in Tak province, 370 kilometers (230 miles)
northwest of Bangkok, have allowed aid workers to tend to the
refugees.
	   Karen villagers who live in Thailand said their counterparts
from Myanmar told them the Myanmar troops had demanded three
villages pay 20,000 baht (dlrs 487) a month or they would be forced
to serve as porters carrying food and ammunition for the soldiers.
	   Other refugees have said that those who are too exhausted, sick
or old to carry their loads are beaten or shot by Myanmar troops.
	   The troops said that if the villagers did not comply they would
burn the villages down, the refugees said, adding that soldiers had
already torched one of the three villages.
	   There are more than 100,000 Karen and other refugees living in
Thailand, having fled repeated offensives by the military of
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Karen guerrilla groups have been fighting for autonomy from the
government in Yangon since 1948.
	   Refugees and international human rights groups have said that
Myanmar soldiers routinely raid Karen villages, extorting money and
food, torturing, raping and killing and forcing villagers to carry
supplies for troops or serve as human mine sweepers.

Brussels quickly getting too small for its international
</HEADLINE>
institutions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Belgian capital is finding it
increasingly difficult to shoehorn all international institutions
within its limited confines and will have trouble making room for
new European Union and NATO members, officials said Tuesday.
	   Jos Chabert, the economic and external relations minister of the
Brussels region, said the Belgian capital was negotiating with the
EU's executive Commission where the next expansion of EU office
space should be.
	   As the 15-nation EU is expected to absorb half a dozen nations
within the next six years, Brussels wants the EU to use new offices
in the impoverished neighborhoods around the Nord and Midi train
stations, while the EU prefers a leafier area.
	   Both sides agree that the administrative center around Schuman
in uptown Brussels cannot be expanded further. The EU's Council,
Commission and Parliament are already headquartered there.
	   The EU bureaucracy is currently spread over 66 office blocks in
Brussels and wants to centralize its administration in 30 buildings
at most.
	   NATO, which is expected to add three new nations to the current
16 over the next few years, will expand its headquarters in Evere,
in the northern part of Brussels, Chabert said.
	   Other problems caused by the expansion of international
institutions include increasing traffic and property price hikes.
	   International institutions, which further include the West
European Union, Benelux and Eurocontrol headquarters, are a major
employer in Brussels, accounting for 62,000 jobs, an increase of
7,000 over 1994.
	   ``About 13 percent of Brussels regional product is directly or
indirectly related to the presence of the European and
international institutions,'' Chabert said.
	   Brussels has 950,000 inhabitants of which 30 percent are
foreigners.

Workers strike at U.N. Palestinian agency across Middle East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMM-101

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Thousands of employees of the U.N. agency
for Palestinian refugees staged a one-day strike Tuesday, closing
schools and clinics in Jordan and across the Middle East.
	   Some 6,100 employees walked out of the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency in Jordan, forcing the closure of the 198 schools and 24
health clinics that serve the 1.5 million registered Palestinian
refugees.
	   ``It's sad to see that 140,000 Palestinian children in Jordan
are losing one day of education today,'' Gunnar Lofberg, the
Jordanian director of the UNRWA.
	   ``What about the sudden cases of illness, can they wait one
day?'' Lofberg asked The Associated Press.
	   The workers are demanding pay raises and other benefits which
they say have been delayed for years by the agency's tight
finances.
	   UNRWA has faced increasing difficulties in recent years as donor
nations tend to give money for famines and disasters rather than to
relieve the continuing plight of Palestinians refugees.
	   UNRWA's management has repeatedly warned during the past 18
months that its growing budget shortfall was forcing it to
implement austerity cuts. UNRWA Commissioner-General Peter Hansen
said in March that donor nations had given the agency only dlrs 237
million to meet a budget this year of dlrs 314 million.
	   The agency provides education, health and relief services to
some 3.5 million refugees. It was set up in 1948 after some 700,000
Palestinians were displaced by the creation of the state of Israel.
More refugees fled to its camps after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
	   Lofberg said it was ``virtually impossible'' to heed the call
for across-the-board pay increases for UNRWA's 22,000 staff across
the Middle East. But he was still optimistic.
	   ``I believe the issue can be resolved,'' he said.
	   Tuesday's strike comes before a scheduled meeting between
employee representatives and UNRWA's executive, which is based in
Gaza City in the Gaza Strip, on Sept. 23.
	   On Tuesday, some 5,000 UNRWA workers were reported to be on
strike and about 1,000 attended a rally outside the the agency's
head office in Gaza City.
	   The demonstrators bore placards reading: ``We want UNRWA to
increase our salaries'' and ``We ask UNRWA to stop temporary
contracts and to give employees official contracts.''
	   However, UNRWA's staff at health clinics and in the ambulance
service in the Gaza Strip did report for work. UNRWA's workers also
struck in the smaller Palestinian camps in the West Bank.
	   In Lebanon, UNRWA's schools, clinics and aid offices shut down
as the strike was widely observed among the agency's 2,400 Lebanese
employees.
	   In the southern port of Sidon, the base of the largest refugee
operation in Lebanon, some 200 UNRWA workers gathered outside the
agency's offices holding banners that read: ``No to hunger, no to
death. We want our rights. We want to live.''
	   The Sidon union of UNRWA workers issued a statement accusing
management of freezing wages for the past three years ``in a bid to
force workers to resign and appoint new employees without health
insurance and pension.''
	   ``This contradicts human rights,'' the statement said.
	   In Syrian, the strike closed 110 schools, giving a holiday to
65,000 pupils.
	   In Jordan, the head of the UNRWA employees union, Hussein
Yaqoub, said Tuesday's action was a warning strike.
	   ``We hope that our administration will heed to our demands,'' he
said. ``If not, then there are plans for an indefinite strike
starting on Sept. 28.''

Children suffering in Kosovo, but not used to fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Children are suffering the most from the conflict
in Kosovo, but at least there are no signs they are being drafted
into the fighting, a U.N. envoy said Tuesday.
	   An estimated 60 percent of the people displaced from their homes
and shivering in appalling conditions on mountain slopes and in
forests are children, said Olara Otunnu.
	   ``They are truly on the edge of survival,'' Otunnu said upon his
return from a three day trip to Yugoslavia and its troubled Kosovo
province. Otunnu, of the Ivory Coast, is the U.N. special
representative for children in armed conflict.
	   Echoing warnings of international aid agencies about a looming
humanitarian tragedy, Otunnu said children had started to die of
diarrhea, dysentery and other diseases.
	   About 300,000 people have been forced out of their homes by the
fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian separatists. An
estimated 50,000 of these are trying to survive in the open.
	   Otunnu appealed to the international community to send more aid
for much needed shelter, food and medicines. He also called for a
bigger international presence in Kosovo to give ethnic Albanians
confidence to return to their homes _ or what's left of them _
without fearing Serb reprisals.
	   In contrast to many other conflicts in Africa and Asia, Otunnu
said he was encouraged by that there was no sign that Serb forces
or ethnic Albanian rebels were using children as fighters.
	   There were only two reported cases of children under the age of
18 carrying guns, he said. This did not, however, rule out the
possibility of minors carrying out support roles like gun-running
or reconnaissance.
	   The U.N. envoy said he was also encouraged that the use of
land-mines was isolated to the borders with Macedonia and Albania.

Gap between Kohl and challenger narrows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With less than two weeks before
federal elections, the gap between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party
and the opposition Social Democrats was narrowing, according to a
poll released Tuesday.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats gained 2 points, or 38 percent
support, in the poll by the Forsa Institute, the first to gauge
voter sentiment after elections Sunday in Bavaria state boosted the
chancellor's sagging campaign.
	   Front-runner Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats lost 1 point
since last Saturday, for 41 percent support.
	   The poll of 1,004 citizens has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percent.
	   Kohl has been playing catchup in the polls since the spring,
when Schroeder was named the Social Democrats' candidate. The
victory by Kohl's Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union, was
widely viewed as boon for the incumbent, who has governed in Bonn
with the CSU for 16 years.
	   The poll also tested the candidate's personal popularity. Kohl's
rose 1 point, to 25 percent, from the previous Saturday, while
Schroeder's dropped 2 points, to 39 percent.
	   One-third of those asked favored neither candidate.
	   The Free Democrats, the third party in Kohl's coalition, had 5
percent, which would be just enough to win seats in parliament in
the Sept. 27 election. The liberal Greens _ a likely coalition
partner for the Social Democrats _ were up a point, to 7 percent.

Iranian leader orders military, top officials on full alert
</HEADLINE>

details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
Tuesday amid heightened tension with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The action came a day after Khamenei warned that the actions of
Afghanistan's Taliban militia were leading to a regional crisis and
urged Muslim countries to intercede.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei, who is
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, told the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday, the agency said.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the fundamentalist Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Later Tuesday, thousands of Iranians staged a march in Qom,
south of Tehran, to condemn the killing of the diplomats, Iranian
television reported.
	   The demonstrators ``declared their hatred of the Taliban and
their foreign supporters, especially Pakistan and America ... and
expressed their readiness to implement the instructions issued by
the commander-in-chief of the armed forces,'' the broadcast said.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to the border
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   On Monday, the Revolutionary Guard, Iran's elite fighting force,
announced in a statement its complete readiness to take action act
and said it was awaiting orders from Khamenei, who is also
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Remains of seven of the nine Iranians killed in Afghanistan
arrived Monday in Tehran.
	   Meanwhile, Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh was
quoted as saying Tuesday that the search for the bodies of the two
other Iranians was continuing.
	   He said that two dead bodies that the Taliban ``intended to
return to Iran as Iranian diplomats were not identified positively
by the team of Iranian physicians and they were not transferred to
Iran.''
	   On Monday Khamenei said that unless Pakistan stops supporting
the Taliban and persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to
the country's civil war, the entire region will be in danger.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, is
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran, alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban, has urged a government
be formed of all Afghan factions.

Russian foreign minister to meet with EU delegation Thursday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior diplomats from Austria, Britain and Germany
will meet with Russia's new foreign minister Thursday to discuss
the European Union's response to Russia's financial crisis, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   The foreign ministers from the ``troika'' will meet with Igor
Ivanov, appointed to fill the vacancy left when former Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov became prime minister last week.
	   The Interfax news agency said the meetings would focus on
Russia's financial problems, even though EU leaders have stressed
that they will not give financial aid until the country makes
serious efforts at economic reform.
	   Next week, Ivanov will deliver a speech to the United Nations
General Assembly in New York, where he also wants to meet with U.S.
leaders over the situation in Russia.
	   Ivanov, 52, is a former ambassador to Spain who had served as
Primakov's top deputy since 1993. He has said he plans to make no
changes to Russia's foreign policy.

rate, China on Tuesday vowed to strengthen its fight against black
market dealings in the yuan.
	   An official with China's State Administration of Foreign
Exchange said stronger punishment will accompany new regulations
that require more scrutiny of those trading the Chinese currency.
	   China allows the yuan to be converted only for international
trade. That policy has protected the yuan from the speculative
attacks that have forced many other Asian currencies to devalue
since July last year.
	   The new rules are aimed at halting a resurgence in illegal
dealings in foreign exchange that have ``exerted a negative impact
on China's foreign exchange balance,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   ``Our determination is firm to fight against the illegal
activities such as breaches of exchange regulations or purchasing
foreign exchange with forged documents,'' said the spokesman,
according to Xinhua.
	   The crackdown comes amid currency market turmoil in Asia and
wavering confidence within China that the government will be able
to stand by its pledge not to devalue the yuan.
	   The State Administration of Foreign Exchange spokesman said
China is ``confident and capable'' of maintaining a stable yuan
exchange rate despite global market turmoil and a weak Japanese
yen, Xinhua reported.
	   Devaluing the yuan would neither increase exports nor boost
economic growth and ``would most likely have a negative effect,''
the spokesman added.
	   The purpose of devaluation would be to make China's exports
cheaper and more competitive. But China's export industries rely
heavily on imported raw materials that would become more expensive
with a devaluation of the Chinese currency.
	   Devaluation also could drive away foreign investors, spark
inflation and increase the debt burden of Chinese enterprises.
	   Such reasoning hasn't stopped some speculators from selling down
the yuan and other regional currencies _ such as the Hong Kong
dollar, which might be hurt from a dip in the Chinese unit's value.
	   On Tuesday, a Dow Jones survey of four black-market currency
traders in Shanghai showed the dollar now fetches around 8.91 yuan,
or 8 percent more than the official rate.
	   The dollar rose to 9.20 on the black market in mid-August, when
speculators attacked the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar.
Confidence in the stability of the yuan is closely linked to
confidence in the Hong Kong dollar.
	   But yuan-dollar rates subsequently stabilized at between 8.82
and 8.84 to the dollar, where they remained until last week when
new anti-black market measures were announced. The clampdown has
increased skittish demand for dollars, say traders.
	   ``People are scared. I know of three people who were arrested
yesterday. Most of us are only dealing with regular customers
now,'' one street trader told the Dow Jones News Service.

Muscovites worry about ending up like the rest of Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the shadow of Russia's economic decline, Moscow
has stood out as a beacon of abundance, the very symbol of reform
with its gleaming new buildings, fancy restaurants and casinos.
	   The financial hurricane that has swept away savings and whipped
up prices leaves Muscovites wondering whether the bubble of plenty
that has grown since economic reforms began in 1992 has burst.
	   ``Things have gotten much better compared to the stagnation
under (Soviet leader Leonid) Brezhnev.'' said Vsevelod Vorobyev, an
engineer in the Moscow metro. ``We only hope we'll get through the
crisis, and things will improve even more.''
	   Advocates of economic reform reject the complaints of many
Russians that reform has not worked. The problem, they counter, is
that most of Russia has not seen any real reform because of
hard-line officials, incompetence and corruption.
	   Moscow is the one place where the benefits of economic reform
have been widely apparent.
	   Moscow salaries are 65 percent above the national average and
three times as high as in cities in the poverty stricken
agricultural ``Red Belt'' in central Russia or aging industrial
cities in the north.
	   Even though prices are higher than in many places in Russia,
everything is available _ even jobs, while in most parts of the
country unemployment is growing. And most Muscovites get their
salaries on time in a country where people often go without their
salary or pension for months.
	   Russia's banking and financial resources are concentrated in
Moscow. Most foreign investment flows through the capital, and many
Russian companies have their headquarters in the capital, bringing
in valuable tax revenue.
	   As the crisis deepens, however, there are signs of cracks in
Moscow's economic boom and fears that things could get very bad.
	   ``The ones who will be losing now are the ones who gained,''
said former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who ushered Russia's
economic reforms by lifting price controls in January 1992.
	   For Russians, Moscow has always been another world, a place of
power and possibility that represented the great escape from the
isolation of the provinces and the promise of a more prosperous
life.
	   In Soviet times, people used to say obtaining a coveted Moscow
residency permit, or ``propiska,'' was like having been made a
member of the nobility. People concluded fake marriage with
Muscovites or endured years in shabby workers' dormitories outside
the city in hopes of getting a ``propiska.''
	   So many people want to live in Moscow that even today in a free
Russia, the city government has a registration system designed to
keep down the number of people legally allowed to live there. As
far as enforcement goes, police can ask to see anyone's documents
at any time _ and often do.
	   At the branch of the troubled Most Bank branch on stylish
Tverskaya street, people have waited every day to fill out forms
transferring their savings to the state savings bank.
	   The foreign furniture stores that sprouted all over the city to
decorate the apartments of the newly wealthy are largely empty. So
are auto dealerships, and even travel agencies have reported a
downturn in business.
	   ``There is a danger Moscow could end up looking like the rest of
the country,'' said Tigran Sarkasyan, an Armenian businessmen who
has lived in Moscow for five years. ``But I hope not.''
	   In some neighborhoods, Moscow is more rundown than when the
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and deep pockets of poverty remain,
especially in working class neighborhoods in southeastern Moscow.
	   Tens of thousands of refugees have flocked to the city, fleeing
unrest in parts of Russia and other former Soviet republics. The
growing disparities in wealth are shocking to many Russians _ even
those who support a free market.
	   Old ladies battling to survive sell toilet paper on the street
next to exclusive stores where a pair of men's shoes costs five
times more than the average monthly pension.
	   ``Many buildings have been restored, but frankly some of it is
over the top,'' said Vorobyev, the metro engineer. ``Look at
this,'' he said pointing to a new underground mall next to the
Kremlin, ``It's a bit artificial.

Australians sweep again in pool; India crushed at cricket; cyclist
</HEADLINE>
Wilson makes up for blunder &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with swim finals, later events
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Call them the sweepmeisters.
	   Australia wons all five golds in the pool for the second time in
the 16th Commonwealth Games Tuesday, scooping all three medals in
two of the races.
	   After four days of swimming, Don Talbot's team has won 17 out of
20 golds with lots more to come.
	   Ian Thorpe won two golds to take his tally to four and he and
Grant Hackett recorded the second and third fastest times ever for
400 meters.
	   Michael Klim moved up to three golds and the only negative was
that Susie O'Neill remained stuck on four. Beaten by countrywoman
Petria Thomas in the 100 butterfly, she remains on eight titles
from four Games, one short of Mike Wenden's swim record of nine.
	   It was a dream day for the Australians, who also crushed India
at cricket, guaranteed a squash gold medal with two women in the
final and won golds at cycling and shooting.
	   Thorpe led home Hackett and Daniel Kowalski in the 400 meters
freestyle in 3 minutes 44.35 seconds, a time only beaten by
countryman and world record holder Kieren Perkins. Hackett was only
.53 behind in the third fastest time ever.
	   Thomas led the next sweep in the butterfly final, edging O'Neill
and Kate Godfrey while Simon Cowley and Ryan Mitchell made it an
Aussie 1-2 in the men's 200 breaststroke. England's Adam Whitehead
foiled a third sweep by winning the bronze.
	   Helen Denman edged former world record holder Samantha Riley in
the women's 100 breaststroke ahead of Canada's Lauren Van Oosten
and then Klim and Thorpe teamed up with Ashley Callum and Chris
Fydler for the fifth Aussie triumph of the night in the 4x100
freestyle relay.
	   Steve Waugh scored an unbeaten 100 and shared in an unbroken
sixth wicket stand of 171 with Tom Moody as the Australian cricket
team overwhelmed India by 145 runs to reach the semifinal and
eliminate Sachin Tendulkar's team.
	   Put in to bat, the Australians were in trouble at 84 for five
before Moody joined his captain and the Australians wound up with
255 for five.
	   It was far too big a total for the Indians who were bowled out
for 110. Tendulkar, who has scored six centuries in his last 12
innings against Australia, managed only 11 runs and left with 28
from three innings.
	   Another blow for India was that opener Amay Khuresia collapsed
from heat stroke while fielding in the sweltering humid heat, was
taken off to hospital and was unable to bat.
	   In the semifinal, Australia will meet New Zealand, who scored
215 for eight and then bowled Pakistan out for 134 to win by 81
runs.
	   Boosted by 71 from Jacques Kallis, South Africa scored a
four-wicket victory over Barbados with 10 balls to spare even
though Sherwin Campbell and Philo Wallace, both West Indian test
openers, put on 120 for the first wicket in the island's score of
254 for six.
	   The South Africans will meet Sri Lanka, who had already
qualified Monday.
	   Anna Wilson, the Australian cyclist whose foot slipped out of
the pedal in the long road race with the finish line in sight on
Sunday, triumphed in the 28-kilometer time trial, winning by a
minute to capture the gold medal.
	   ``It was the hardest I have dug and the most I have hurt in a
time trial,'' said Wilson, adding that the victory more than made
up for Sunday's disaster when she finished third.
	   Canada's Linda Jackson finished second in 38:34, five seconds
ahead of another Australian, Kathy Watt, the Olympic road race
champion and owner of four Commonwealth Games gold medals.
	   Canada's Eric Wohlberg won the men's 42 kilometer road race
ahead of Stuart O'Grady, who lost his chance when he spun and came
off his bike. The Australian needed a lengthy stop to replace a
damaged wheel and resumed with blood oozing from gashes to his
elbow and knee.
	   Another Canadian triumph came in the synchronized swimming with
Jacinthe Taillon and Kasia Kulesza winning the duet gold medal to
maintain their country's perfect Commonwealth Games record in the
event since it entered the schedule in 1986.
	   Top seed Sara Fitz-Gerald downed England's Cassie Jackson in
three straight and one-sided games in the squash semifinal and will
meet fellow Australian and No. 2 seed Michelle Martin for the gold
medal Wednesday.
	   Martin overpowered another English player, Sue Wright, also in
straight games.
	   Scotland's Peter Nicol, the world's No. 1 player, outclassed
England's Paul Johnson 9-2, 9-3, 9-1 to reach the men's final where
he will meet Canada's Jonathan Power, who downed Alex Gough of
Wales in three straight games.
	   Australia won gold in the women's pairs air pistol, which was
won by Annemarie Forder and Christine Trefry, whose triumph was her
second here and fifth in two Commonwealth Games.
	   New Zealand's Tania Corrigan and Jocelyn Lees gained the silver
and Malaysia's Kamisah And Jalal and Suriani Othman the bronze.
	   Canada's Christina Ashcroft and Sheron Bowes triumphed in the
pairs smallbore rifle with South Africa's Val Martin and Donne
Potgeiter taking silver and Scotland's Shirley McIntosh and Janis
Thomson capturing the bronze,

Iranian leader orders military, top officials on full alert
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with demonstration reported in Qom, other
details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
Tuesday amid heightened tension with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The action came a day after Khamenei warned that the actions of
Afghanistan's Taliban militia were leading to a regional crisis and
urged Muslim countries to intercede.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei, who is
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, told the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday, the agency said.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the fundamentalist Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Later Tuesday, thousands of Iranians staged a march in Qom,
south of Tehran, to condemn the killing of the diplomats, Iranian
television reported.
	   The demonstrators ``declared their hatred of the Taliban and
their foreign supporters, especially Pakistan and America ... and
expressed their readiness to implement the instructions issued by
the commander-in-chief of the armed forces,'' the broadcast said.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to the border
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   On Monday, the Revolutionary Guard, Iran's elite fighting force,
announced in a statement its complete readiness to take action act
and said it was awaiting orders from Khamenei, who is also
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Remains of seven of the nine Iranians killed in Afghanistan
arrived Monday in Tehran.
	   Meanwhile, Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh was
quoted as saying Tuesday that the search for the bodies of the two
other Iranians was continuing.
	   He said that two dead bodies that the Taliban ``intended to
return to Iran as Iranian diplomats were not identified positively
by the team of Iranian physicians and they were not transferred to
Iran.''
	   On Monday Khamenei said that unless Pakistan stops supporting
the Taliban and persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to
the country's civil war, the entire region will be in danger.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, is
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran, alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban, has urged a government
be formed of all Afghan factions.

Blair announces plan to improve blighted neighborhoods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday unveiled a
wide-ranging 800 million pound (dlrs 1.3 billion) program to
``bridge the gap between the poorest neighborhoods and the rest of
Britain.''
	   The New Deal for Communities will initially target 17 areas,
including four London boroughs, and attempt to ``improve job
prospects, bring together investment in buildings and in people,
and improve neighborhood management and the delivery of local
services,'' Blair said.
	   The 12 million pound (dlrs 20 million) first phase will involve
sending teams into neighborhoods to help form partnerships of
residents, community organizations, local authorities and
businesses. Those groups will then identify issues needing the most
attention.
	   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott touted the strategy as
``flexible and local.''
	   ``We want them to work together in partnership to analyze the
problems facing their own communities, to agree what needs to be
done, and to plan how to deliver lasting change for local people,''
he said.
	   During the first half of next year, partnerships will get
funding to turn approved proposals into detailed plans for
long-term improvement of their neighborhoods. Successful
partnerships would then get funding for up to 10 years.
	   ``The aim is that these should become showcases, models of what
can be achieved,'' Blair said.
	   Tuesday's announcement coincided with the release of a report by
the government's Social Exclusion Unit that paints a bleak picture
of the country's poorest communities and criticizes the
government's past approaches to urban renewal.
	   ``It pulls no punches,'' Blair said. ``It shows that for too
long governments have simply ignored the needs of many communities.
When they have acted, the policies haven't worked. Too much has
been spent on picking up the pieces, rather than building
successful communities or preventing problems from arising in the
first place.''

Severe flooding hits northern Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Severe flooding in northern Croatia
caused rivers to burst their banks Tuesday, closing down factories
and forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes.
	   Rain has been falling persistently since Saturday, causing water
levels to rise above one meter (yard) in the northern part of
Croatia.
	   Firemen and troops were mobilized to provide assistance to the
affected areas, encompassing an area spanning some 1000 square
kilometers (625 miles).
	   More than a dozen factories and farms were devastated by the
floods, with preliminary estimates of damages at over dlrs 10
million. No injuries were reported.
	   According to the state meteorological institute, the rainfall
since Saturday is equal to the average amount that usually falls in
the month of September.
	   Weather forecasters predicted a lull in the rain in the coming
days, with later chances of sporadic showers.

Sudanese rebels attack government garrison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels said Tuesday they attacked
a government garrison and killed 40 enemy troops in retaliation for
the bombardments of a hospital and camp in rebel-held territory.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said it attacked on Monday an
army garrison at Mile 38 south of Juba, capturing tanks, mortars
and light weapons. Juba, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of
Khartoum, is one of the government's most important posts in
southern Sudan.
	   Government troops retreated to Mile 34, SPLA spokesman John Luk
Jok said.
	   The SPLA said it also attacked garrisons at Liria and Torit,
both east of Juba.
	   ``This renewed escalation of the military situation has been
provoked by the indiscriminate bombing by the Sudan government of
civilian targets in SPLA-controlled areas,'' the spokesman said.
	   A Sudanese government warplane last week bombed the largest
refugee camp in rebel-held territory, killing two people, Norwegian
People's Aid said.
	   On Sunday, the government dropped a dozen bombs around a
hospital in Yei, killing one person and wounding 22, the aid group
said.
	   The bombings violate the government's Aug. 3 announcement of a
unilateral cease-fire in southern Sudan, which was intended to
promote the flow of aid to hundreds of thousands of hungry Sudanese
displaced by fighting between rebels and government forces.
	   The SPLA has fought a 15-year war for greater autonomy in the
south from the Arab, Muslim-dominated government in the north.
About 1.5 million people have died in fighting and famines in Sudan
since 1983.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In its first budget since the May
general election, the Dutch government Tuesday pledged to keep
fighting unemployment and wage growth despite record drops in
joblessness.
	   The second-term coalition government also will spend 2.7 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.4 billion) in 1999 on projects including cutting
health service waiting lists, employing more police and reducing
class sizes in education.
	   The much-praised Dutch ``Polder Model'' under which government,
employers and unions cooperate to control wage growth will be kept
in place to prevent it becoming a victim of its own success, the
government announced.
	   ``Measures must be taken to prevent shortages in the labor
market from driving up negotiated wage rates,'' the budget
mandated.
	   Registered unemployment in this nation of 15 million has dropped
by a record average of 9,000 per month for the last year creating a
scarcity of staff in some sectors.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok rebuilt his left-to-right, three-party
ruling coalition in August following the May general election and
pledged to continue the cautious economic policies of his first
four-year administration.
	   In 1999, the government will spend about 4.5 billion guilders
(dlrs 2.4 billion) reducing taxes, but Kok's priority in 1998 and
1999 will be cutting the budget deficit which is seen at about 1.3
percent of gross domestic product in both years.
	   Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said that 75 percent of any tax
windfalls would be pumped into reduction of the deficit with the
remaining 25 percent going toward cutting taxes.
	   The growth of the Dutch economy, which has been booming in
recent years, will likely slow down to up three percent in 1999
from an expansion of four percent this year, Zalm told parliament.
	   The budget presentation followed the traditional Prince's Day
celebrations in The Hague during which Queen Beatrix rode in a
horse-drawn carriage to the 13th century Knights' Hall in Dutch
parliament for the state opening of Parliament.

BlueWave edge Fighters 5-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chris B. Donnels and Troy Neel hit home runs in the
four-run fifth inning as the Orix BlueWave edged the Pacific
League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 5-4 at Kobe on Tuesday.
	   Donnels, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has three homers and
Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, has 22 homers.
	   In the ninth, Atsushi Kataoka and Nigel Wilson each smashed a
home run for the Fighters.
	   Kataoka has 16 homers and Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland
Indians, has 30 homers and leads the league.
	   The Fighters are still .0009 percentage points ahead of the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks who beat the Seibu Lions 4-3 at Seibu Stadium
and moved into second place.
	   The Lions are only a half game behind the Fighters.
	   In the eighth inning, Nobuhiko Matsunaka singled home two runs
for the Hawks.
	   At Osaka Dome, the Chiba Lotte Marines rapped out 17 hits,
including a three-run home run by Julio Franco, and trounced the
Kintetsu Buffaloes 13-5. Franco, formerly with the Milwaukee
Brewers, has 18 homers.
	   In the Central League, Robert Rose smashed a two-run home run in
the four-run seventh as the front-running Yokohama BayStars beat
the Yomiuri Giants 10-2 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, has 16 homers.
	   The BayStars are 3 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who beat the Yakult Swallows 5-2 in a game that was called
after the top of the ninth inning because of torrential rains from
typhoon Stelle.
	   Takeshi Yamasaki hit a tie-breaking three-run home run in the
seventh for the Dragons. Yamasaki has 25 homers.
	   At Koshien Stadium, the Hanshin Tigers scored seven runs in the
second inning and went on to beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 9-6.

Death toll rises in Algerian massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 7th graf with description of village. Deletes
reference to weekend massacre. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The death toll in a massacre in a
village in Algeria rose to 37, with a newspaper Tuesday reporting
the attackers used incendiary bombs, Kalashnikov rifles and knives.
	   Citing witnesses, the La Tribune newspaper said the village of
Ain Sbaa about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Algiers was
beset upon by attackers who dragged their victims into the streets.
	   The attack early Monday came days after President Liamine
Zeroual announced Friday he would step down and call early
presidential elections. It was the worst reported massacre in
months in Algeria.
	   Algerian security forces had said Monday that 27 people died in
the attack on Ain Sbaa, which is near the town of Ain Defla.
	   La Tribune said a family of 13 had been killed in the attack.
	   The attackers broke down the doors and pulled people from their
houses before killing them, the newspaper said.
	   The tiny village consisted of small dwellings and was completely
surrounded by a fence. It was under constant surveillance by a
guardian, who was among the first killed.
	   The region around Ain Defla reportedly has become one of the
areas where the anti-government Armed Islamic Group is most active.
	   Zeroual, the outgoing president, has been unable to end an
Islamic insurgency that erupted in 1992 when the military-backed
government canceled parliamentary elections an Islamic party was
set to win.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in violence since then.

49ers Rout Redskins 45-10
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LANDOVER, Maryland (AP) _ Steve Young threw three touchdowns
passes to three receivers and ran for another score Monday night,
leading the the San Francisco 49ers to a 45-10 rout over the
Washington Redskins in the American National Football League.
	   It was the worst home loss for the Redskins since a 45-0 defeat
to Philadelphia in 1948 and the worst loss in coach Norv Turner's
five-year tenure.
	   The Redskins (0-2) have given up 76 points in two games.
	   Picking apart one of the best secondaries in the league, Young
completed 21 of 32 passes for 303 yards, giving him six TD passes
and 666 yards after two weeks _ his best two-game start ever. The
49ers (2-0), who have scored 74 points in the two games, might have
run up more had they not committed nine penalties, including a
couple of false starts that killed an early drive.
	   On three consecutive drives in the first half, Young hit Terrell
Owens over the middle for a 20-yard score, Irv Smith on the
sideline for a 16-yard strike _ set up by a 57-yard completion to
Jerry Rice _ and rank in behind center Chris Dalman on a 3-yard
score.
	   In the second half, Young connected with Marc Edwards for a
2-yard TD. Garrison Hearst, who had 138 yards on 22 carries for his
second consecutive 100-yard game, added a 5-yard TD run in the
fourth quarter. Chuck Levy also weaved 21 yards for a score.

Ross starts slowly but makes semifinals as three Canadians advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Three Canadians made it to the
semifinals of the Commonwealth Games boxing competition Tuesday
although favored light-heavyweight Troy Amos Ross had a hard time
ousting India's Gurcharan Singh.
	   An Olympic quarterfinalist in Atlanta two years ago, Ross was
caught in a tight, closely-fought contest with Gurcharan for the
first four rounds but scored well in the final stages for an 11-7
points verdict.
	   By contrast, bantamweight Andrew Kooner overwhelmed Joshua Veiko
of Namibia 20-9 while Mark O'Donnell scored a 13-9 points victory
over Mark Alexander of Barbados.
	   Two more Canadians will aim to make the semifinals at the
heaviest weights Wednesday. Mark Simmons takes on Ghana's Charles
Quartey at heavyweight and super-heavyweight Patrice Heureux meets
Australia's Justin Whitehead.
	   Kenya, which had four boxers ousted on the opening two days,
continued its improvement with Samuel Odindo beating Steven
Donaldson of Wales 15-9 on points.

Kosovo militants worried about Albanian turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian militants are
worried about the turmoil in neighboring Albania, but have not
taken part in the riots, their spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Adem Demaci, the spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation army
fighting for secession from Serbia, said: ``We are not indifferent
to what is happening in Albania.''
	   But ``the KLA is not involved in Albania's crisis,'' Demaci told
reporters.
	   Following a string of recent defeats against Serbian forces,
many KLA fighters are believed to have crossed from Kosovo into
northern Albania, under control of Albania's opposition leader Sali
Berisha.
	   Supporters of Berisha on Monday seized government buildings in
the Albanian capital Tirana, demanding the government resign. Hours
later, government forces launched a counterattack, killing at least
three Berisha supporters and wounding 14 others.
	   Demaci, who is the KLA's political leader, urged Albania's
president Rexhep Mejdani to form a ``non-party, expert government
and make sure that the police and the military are beyond any
party's influence.''
	   Demaci also claimed that the KLA is ``reorganizing itself under
constant strikes by Serbian forces'' and that the Serbian regime
``cannot militarily win a war against the Albanians.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqi dinar has lost about 15 per cent
of its value against the U.S. dollar since Iraq's Aug. 5 decision
to suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons monitors, Baghdad traders
said Tuesday.
	   Early in August the dollar hovered at about 1,600 dinars. On
Tuesday it was worth 1,880 dinars.
	   Traders blamed the dinar's fall on mounting tension between Iraq
and the United Nations. The plunge has caused most goods in Baghdad
to become more expensive.
	   The government's decision to stop cooperating with arms
inspectors led directly to the U.N. Security Council's vote last
week to suspend reviews of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The vote means that the Baghdad
government has little chance of meeting its goal of having
sanctions lifted by early next year.
	   Before the sanctions were imposed, one dinar was worth one
dollar on the black market. The official rate was dlrs 3 for a
dinar.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ There will be more than 15,000 new
engineers in Jordan by the year 2005 and many will be unemployed,
said a report issued Tuesday.
	   The state-owned Royal Scientific Society said that already 3,000
of Jordan's 40,000 engineers were unemployed.
	   The report said it had arrived at its prediction about 2005 from
the number of engineering students and from the current
difficulties that engineers experienced in finding work.
	   It said electrical engineers were likely to have the hardest
time finding a job.
	   The work situation for engineers was exacerbated during the
1990-91 Gulf crisis, when 320,000 Jordanians _ the bulk of them
engineers and doctors _ were dismissed from their jobs in the Gulf
region because of Jordan's tilt toward Iraq over its invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ More passengers are flying with the
national carrier, Royal Jordanian, because of its cheap fares, the
airline said Tuesday.
	   Royal Jordanian issued a statement saying it flew more than
800,000 passengers between January and August _ an increase of 20
percent over the same period in 1997.
	   It attributed the increase to its ``unmatched fares'' and its
improved punctuality on flight times.

EU authorizes sale of Viagra

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pfizer comment, Viagra to be in 50 nations by
yearend &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Tuesday
authorized the sale of the anti-impotence drug Viagra throughout
the 15-nation EU and the drug is expected to be available in 50
nations by year's end, officials said.
	   The drug was approved by the EU's executive Commission Tuesday
following the advise of a panel of European medical experts.
	   ``In principle the company concerned has, from tomorrow, the
right to circulate the product in all member states,'' said Jochen
Kubosch, health spokesman for the European Commission. Viagra is
produced by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc.
	   ``We are extremely pleased by the approval of this important
medical advance,'' said Pfizer Chief Executive William Steere.
	   Pfizer said the EU approval brought to 38 the number of
countries in which Viagra has been cleared. Steere hoped a dozen
more countries will approve the drug in the remaining months of
1998.
	   Individual EU governments are now free to decide whether to make
the drug available at the full price or at subsidized low prices
through their government health programs.
	   Under the EU's authorization, Viagra will only be available on
doctor's prescription and may not be supplied to patients under 18
or taken by women.
	   Pfizer will have to include a leaflet in all packets explaining
that the blue, diamond-shaped pills should not be used by those
with severe heart or liver problems or patients taking drugs
containing nitrates. The leaflet says nobody should take Viagra
more than once a day.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jose Antonio Camacho signed as Spain's new
coach Tuesday with a mission to turn around the flailing fortunes
of the national soccer team.
	   ``I am starting from zero'' said Camacho, 43, who played for the
Spanish squad 81 times. ``This is a new stage both for me and the
players,''
	   Camacho, who has coached Spanish sides Espanyol and Sevilla,
replaces Javier Clemente whose resignation last week was prompted
by a disappointing World Cup performance and a recent 3-2 loss to
lowly Cyprus in a European Championship qualifier.
	   The federation offered the job first to Luis Aragones at the
weekend who turned it down on the grounds that he would have to
work with Clemente's support team, rather than bring in his own.
	   Offered the same deal on Sunday, Camacho took the initiative. He
made a counterproposal to the Federation and set a 24-hour deadline
for a reply.
	   Having been assured he will be able to pick his own staff
Camacho signed the two-year contract reportedly worth 120 million
pesetas (dlrs 816,000).
	   Already thinking about Spain's next game _ a friendly against
Russia on Sep 23 _ Camacho said he would reveal his first lineup on
Friday.
	   As a regular on Real Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989,
Camacho won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies. After
retiring as a player he coached first-division teams Espanyol and
Sevilla.
	   He only lasted three weeks in his last job, resigning in July as
coach of Real Madrid in a contractual dispute. He had yet to attend
his first training session with the players.
	   ``I hope to have continuity at the national team,'' Camacho
said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said the government's patience was running out and it would not
``wait endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of the
headquarters of his rival, Sali Berisha.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha, a former president, and
his follower. Nano also said he was willing to consider ``in
principle'' any formula for resolving the crisis, presumably
including his own resignation as the opposition has demanded.
	   But Nano first insisted that Berisha's followers surrender their
weapons. ``There is no time,'' Nano added.

Beckenbauer assails soccer leaders, doesn't rule out top job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Franz Beckenbauer has added his mighty
voice to the chorus of critics urging widespread changes at the top
of German soccer and has not ruled taking the chief job himself.
	   ``The German soccer federation (DFB) is very static, it takes
care of the administration but has no responsibility. It's an
amateur federation and it will always remain so,'' Beckenbauer said
in a Bavarian television interview Tuesday.
	   Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, vice president of Bayern Munich, the club
of which Beckenbauer is the chairman, has proposed a widespread
reform of the DFB, with Beckenbauer to become its president.
	   ``The ideas of Rummenigge are very good. The need (for reforms)
is great,'' said Beckenbauer, a former star who still retains great
influence in German soccer.
	   Egidius Braun, the 73-year-old DFB president, has come under
growing fire in recent days for his handling of the search for a
new national team coach after the resignation of Berti Vogts last
week.
	   Braun promised the job to former international Paul Breitner,
only to withdraw the offer after reading a newspaper interview in
which Breitner urges the resignation of the entire DFB leadership.
	   The coaching job eventually went to Erich Ribbeck, who had been
out of the profession since April 1996.
	   Braun has said he intends to run again at the DFB congress Oct.
24.

	   Following two days of rioting, the Interior Ministry on Tuesday
banned demonstrations by Berisha's Democratic Party, angry over the
assassination last week of a popular party figure, Azem Hajdari.
	   Despite the ban, about 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied in
the main Tirana square. The protest ended peacefully, but tensions
in the capital remained high.
	   Many protesters flashed the two-fingered victory sign as Berisha
coupled demands for Nano's resignation with exhortations that the
demonstrators remain peaceful.
	   Dozens of police cars surrounded the protesters on central
Skanderbeg Square, lights flashing and sirens howling. The cars and
several police vans were filled with officers carrying submachine
guns and wearing stocking masks.
	   Berisha, meanwhile, remained defiant. The 53-year-old heart
surgeon warned Interior Minister Perikli Teta to rescind a
shoot-without-warning order or ``bear all responsibility for the
consequences.''
	   He announced a new rally for Wednesday unless Nano resigned.
	   The weekend assassination of Hajdari, a former student leader
who helped bring down Albania's Communist government, touched off a
wave of unrest reminiscent of the nationwide anarchy that lasted
for months in 1997 and sent refugees flooding into Italy, Greece
and other European countries.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   U.S. and European diplomats were seeking to negotiate a peaceful
end to the crisis. Many fear the unrest could spread, further
complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   President Rexhap Meidani was also trying to mediate a
settlement. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Meidani raised the possibility of Nano's resignation during a
meeting with the prime minister late Monday.
	   But Nano refused to step down until Berisha surrendered his
weapons and the government regained control of the city, the
sources said.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Shifter said the United States was prepared to help Albania recover
from the turmoil but that the crisis must be resolved ``by the
Albanians'' themselves.
	   But the unrest has raised grave concerns among countries nearby.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned that
the stability of the entire southern Balkans was at stake. He noted
that Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels,
who operate from sanctuaries in Berisha's stronghold of northern
Albania.
	   ``Any clashes in our immediate neighborhood are a reason for our
grave concern, especially if it is Albania and if a legally elected
government is threatened in such a way,'' Odalovic said.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded Monday when government forces launched a counterattack and
swiftly regained control of key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Nano's office.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of the riots that swept Albania
last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which
cost many people their life's savings.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets Monday, crowds
of looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the
city, firing in the air.
	   One tank was parked in front of Democratic Party headquarters
Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. About a half dozen Berisha
supporters armed with submachine guns were nearby.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday remained closed.
Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also cleaned out
Nano's villa in Tirana on Monday.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened with arrest by the government, has called for the
Socialist government to resign but insists he is not plotting a
takeover.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry told foreign diplomats Monday it would try to
arrest Berisha today unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha said he would never leave Albania. Berisha was
Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades under Stalinist
Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his policies became
increasingly authoritarian.
	   He said the building takeovers Monday were simply his
supporters' reaction to the slaying of Hajdari.

Gilbert steps out of the shadow of Bailey, Surin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For someone living in the shadow
of Canadian sprint stars Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin, Glenroy
Gilbert is happy to show off his gold medals from two World
Championships and an Olympics.
	   It doesn't matter that they're all from relays.
	   A comparative veteran at age 30, he knows he played a major part
in winning the titles at the 1995 and '97 Worlds and the '96
Olympics in Atlanta.
	   And he believes that Bailey and Surin will be smiling Thursday
if their team-mate takes the Commonwealth Games gold medal from
under the noses of Ato Boldon and Frankie Fredericks.
	   ``There's a little pressure on me, of course,'' Gilbert said.
``When these guys are around everyone it looking at them to do
great things. I think for us it's going to be a little tough.
	   ``But I'm not that concerned about it. I am going to do the best
I can in the 100 and the relay. It's probably in the relay where
the country looks to the team to do well because of our successes
over the last few years,'' Gilbert said
	   ``We have some tough opposition from Ghana and the British teams
but we're mighty glad the Nigerians aren't here.''
	   Nigeria has some of the top sprinters in the world but the
nation doesn't have a team here because it was expelled from the
Commonwealth in 1995.
	   Gilbert expects to run the second leg in the relay and believes
that Surin, who ran 9.89 to beat Bailey in the Canadian
championship, will be at the games to take part in the relay.
	   Other squad members will be Trevino Betty, O'Brian Gibbons, Brad
McQuaig and Mike Nikolini.

Russian gold production falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian gold production fell to 59.4 tons during
the first eight months of 1998 from 66.4 million tons during the
same period of 1997, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the
Ministry of Economics.
	   The ministry's Department of Precious Metals and Gemstones said
it expected production to fall this year because of disruptions to
output in the Yakutia and Chukotka regions.
	   Interfax reported that two reactors at the Kolyma nuclear power
plant, which serves Chukotka, had been stopped, while production in
Yakutia has suffered from summer flooding.
	   The ministry said the country's economic crisis has also
prevented output reaching the market, with producers hanging on to
gold rather than selling it for devalued rubles, while banks that
had signed contracts to buy gold have been unable to honor them.
	   Russia produced 123 tons of gold in 1997.

Singapore founder rejects criticism by Malaysia

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's senior statesman on Tuesday
dismissed Malaysian criticism that his newly published memoir is
biased and defamatory, calling the book ``an objective account'' of
his country's history.
	   Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's ``The Singapore Story'' details
relations between Singapore and Malaysia in the 1960s and depicts
Malaysian leaders of the time as corrupt and morally lax.
	   Lee, who served as prime minister from 1959 until 1990, told
journalists Tuesday he did not mean to upset Malaysia, but he stood
by his accounts.
	   The book, which comes out Wednesday, describes how Singapore and
Malaysia merged in 1963 after independence from Britain, but
separated in 1965 when the larger Malaysia kicked Singapore out of
the union.
	   ``It will be unfortunate if the book sours our relations,'' said
Lee, 75. ``But I have an obligation to my people ... to give an
objective account of why and how Singapore sought merger with
Malaysia but in two years was asked to leave Malaysia.''
	   The book comes as tension is rising between the two neighbors.
The countries are now feuding over the location of a railroad
border post, competition between the two nations' ports, trading of
Malaysian stocks and currency in Singapore and Singapore's purchase
of Malaysian water.
	   Excerpts of the book were published on Sunday, and Malaysian
leaders immediately accused Lee of inciting racism, poisoning
relations between the two countries, and defaming dead men who
cannot defend themselves.
	   But Lee said that his accounts of the brief Singapore-Malaysia
union and its failure are supported by reports of British, American
and Australian diplomats based in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur at the
time.
	   Lee said the timing was coincidental. He said he started writing
in 1995, the year British Archives made important historical
documents available, and that the publication has been planned for
this fall.
	   Lee recalled the two countries have had their ups and downs and
said the current rift ``is not irreparable.''
	   Lee, who in the past had repeatedly said his biggest political
regret is the failure of the merger with Malaysia, now said the
breakup was for the better.
	   ``If things have been different, we might have achieved all this
throughout Malaysia,'' Lee said, referring to Singapore's
prosperity. ``But it was not to be. Had we not left in 1965, there
would have been a lot of nastiness.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Floods in Belgium claimed their first
victim Tuesday when a woman drowned in her car. Rivers rose to
critical levels forcing the evacuation of hundreds more people.
	   After two days of near incessant rains over much of Belgium, the
skies cleared briefly Tuesday, allowing relief services a few hours
to bring people into safety. More rain was expected Tuesday night.
	   In northern Belgium, a woman died when her car skidded into a
ditch alongside a road. Relief workers were too late on the scene
to save the victim.
	   Around the eastern city of Liege, reservoirs in the Ardennes
hills had to release excess waters, further swelling rivers below.
Several villages were flooded.
	   ``If it will rain more, then we will be in trouble,'' said
Malmedy mayor Robert Denis.
	   In the north of the country, the army had to plug several
breaches in dikes. In northeastern Sint Truiden, drinking water was
infected, forcing authorities to bar people from using tap water.
	   While fresh rain exacerbated the problems around Liege, the rain
abated around Antwerp, scene of the worst flooding on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A typhoon packing winds up to 108 kilometers (65
miles) per hour was over the Pacific Ocean and moving toward Tokyo,
trigging heavy rains in central Japan, the meteorological agency
said Tuesday.
	   Typhoon Stelle, the season's fifth typhoon, was located about
350 kilometers (210 miles) off cape Omaezaki, 150 kilometers (90
miles) southwest of Tokyo, at 9 p.m. (1200GMT) Tuesday.
	   The agency said the typhoon was moving north at 35 kilometers
(21 miles) per hour and was expected to hit the Tokyo area at 6
a.m. Wednesday (2100GMT Tuesday).
	   The national police agency said there were no reports of damage
caused by Stelle so far.
	   National broadcaster NHK reported domestic airlines are planning
to cancel at least 17 flights from Haneda Airport in Tokyo on
Wednesday morning.
	   The season's fourth typhoon, Rex, lingered over the Pacific
south of the main Japanese island of Honshu in late August,
bringing record rainfalls in central Japan, killing 16 people and
injured 46 others.

Unseeded Romanian Ion Moldovan advances to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - Seventh-seeded Mariano Puerta of
Argentina was upset Tuesday by hard-hitting Romanian Ion Moldovan
in the first round of the dlrs 350,000 Romanian Open.
	   Moldovan, ranked only No. 331 by the ATP, beat the Argentine
6-4, 6-4.
	   The Romanian broke back to level at 3-3 in the first set and
used his powerful serve and strong forehands to win the set.
	   Puerta, ranked No. 61, won the first three games of the second
set but Moldovan fought back, broke serve twice and clinched the
match to advance to the second round of the clay-court tournament.
	   In a match that was suspended by rain Monday and resumed
Tuesday, Germany's Oliver Gross was forced to retire when he
slipped and fell on the wet clay, allowing Spain's Alex Calatrava
to go through. The two had split the first two sets and the score
was 1-1 in the third when Gross retired.
	   Heavy rain also suspended the match between Romanian Adrian
Voinea and Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica and between Spaniard
Galo Blanco and Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia.
	   In completed matches Tuesday, Jacobo Diaz of Spain defeated
Germany's Bernd Karbacher, 6-1, 6-3, while Emilio Alvarez of Spian
beat Nikos Rovas of Greece 6-3, 6-2.

Aging Dutch friars launch recruiting drive with advertising
</HEADLINE>
campaign

<TEXT>
	   TILBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Wanted: Young men with a calling.
Job requirements: Celibacy, compassion and charity. Salary: None.
	   A Dutch order of Roman Catholic friars this week launched a
nationwide recruitment drive to attract new brothers as old age
takes its toll on their ranks.
	   ``We are looking for people (male) with a heart who have the
courage to become a friar,'' proclaimed a newspaper advertisement
that ran in national and regional newspapers on Saturday.
	   ``We have a pile of disadvantages to report,'' the advertisement
continued. ``You get no salary, no promotion, and you may not
marry.''
	   Undeterred, ``dozens'' of interested applicants contacted the
friars this week, campaign leader Frans van Pinxteren said
Wednesday.
	   ``There is no-one so far who has said `I want to be a friar,'
but there are people who are very seriously interested,'' Van
Pinxteren added.
	   When Van Pinxteren, 63, joined the Friars of Tilburg 45 years
ago, the order had 1,100 members. That number has dwindled to 175,
mainly 70-somethings based in this southern Dutch city.
	   The order performs voluntary education and health care work in
the Netherlands and runs schools in developing countries.
	   For those not prepared to take up monastery life, there are
other options.
	   ``People don't have to become friars,'' Van Pinxteren said. ``We
have a group of sympathizers who help us. They live at home, some
are married and have paid jobs. Some are women.''

Italian priest shot dead in northern Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three men dressed in military uniforms
shot and killed an Italian Roman Catholic priest in an apparent
robbery attempt at a mission in central Kenya, a spokesman for the
Consolata Fathers said Tuesday.
	   Liboli Angelo said Father Andeni Luigi, 62, of Brescia, Italy,
was shot Monday night at the mission at Archer's Post, 250
kilometers north of Nairobi.
	   Angelo said the priest and Kenyan deacon William Otieno were on
the verandah of the mission when the men approached and ordered
them to lie down.
	   ``The deacon obeyed immediately,'' Angelo said, but added that
Luigi apparently asked the men what they wanted.
	   Otieno ran when the men went for the priest, but he turned back
when he heard three gunshots, Angelo said.
	   Luigi was shot in the stomach and arms. Nuns at the mission
administered first aid, then drove the priest to the nearest
hospital in Wamba, 70 kilometers north. But he died en route.
	   Since 1964, Luigi had worked at various mission posts in central
and northern Kenya for all but six-year stint in Italy.
	   In recent years, the area around Archer's Post has become the
scene of violent clashes between the pastoralist Samburu people and
Kenyan Somalis, mainly over grazing land and access to water.
	   Until the beginning of the 1990s, the clashes involved spears,
knives and a few shotguns. But the increasing availability of
semi-automatic assault weapons because of civil conflicts in
neighboring Sudan and Somalia has turned the traditional clashes
into deadly battles.
	   Armed robbery is also on the increase, and the targets are
tourists who visit the game reserves in the area as well as the
missionaries.
	   After bandits attacked a vehicle belonging to Wamba Hospital in
June, the Bishop of Marsabit threatened to close the hospital if
security was not restored.
	   The Consolata Fathers have been in Samburu District since 1952,
11 years before Kenya became an independent nation. The Italian
missions are often the only source of education and medical
services for the people of the region.

Westwood, Clarke, Montgomerie still in chase for No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke
both surpassed the dlrs 1 million mark on the European tour this
season despite mixed success at last weekend's British Masters.
	   Westwood still leads the tour moneylist with 614,464 pounds
(dlrs 1,032,300) after the British Masters but Darren Clarke and
five-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie are closing in.
	   Montgomerie won the British Masters with a 7-under-par total 281
on the par-72 Forest of Arden course, taking the 125,000-pound
(dlrs 210,000) winners' check to get back into the chase. He is in
No. 3 place with 580,017 (dlrs 974,429) after winning his first
tournament since the Volvo PGA at Surrey on May 25.
	   Westwood finished in equal-12th at the British Masters with a
2-under-par 286, while Clarke slumped after leading the tournament
at the halfway mark to finish equal-19th at 1-under. He dropped
five shots over the last two rounds.
	   Clarke has been on the verge of overtaking Westwood for the last
four tournaments but has still yet to breach the gap and remains
8,397 pounds (dlrs 14,107) behind in second place with 606,067
(dlrs 1,098,193).
	   The European top 10 remained unchanged after the British
Masters.
	   Sweden's Patrik Sjoland is still No. 4 with 442,187 pounds (dlrs
742,874), Denmark's Thomas Bjorn is No. 5 with 420,218 pounds (dlrs
705,996) and Ernie Els, World No. 3, is No. 6 in Europe with
386,759 pound (dlrs 635,832).

Japanese defense chief apologizes for procurement scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's defense chief apologized on Tuesday for his
agency's role in a scandal involving allegations that military
officials helped a company that overcharged the government, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   ``As Defense Agency director general, I am not allowed to make
any excuse,'' Defense Agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga was quoted by
Kyodo News agency as telling reporters.
	   Nukaga, who held a news conference in Naha, Okinawa, declined to
say what steps he would take, the report said. Defense officials
were unavailable for comment on Tuesday, a national holiday in
Japan.
	   The apology came a day after investigators raided the agency's
headquarters the second time, this time looking for evidence that
officials destroyed documents ahead of the first raid.
	   The search was part of an inquiry that has resulted so far in
the arrests of two senior defense officials and seven executives of
computer-maker NEC Corp. and an affiliate.
	   The probe has revolved around allegations that defense officials
conspired with NEC affiliate Toyo Communication Equipment Co. to
allow the company to keep part of profits it made by overcharging
the government for supplies.
	   Defense officials allegedly helped the company in exchange for
securing jobs for retiring agency officials.
	   The central figure in the case, Kenichi Ueno, deputy director of
procurement, was arrested Sept. 3 for allegedly conspiring with
others to reduce Toyo's reimbursement to the government by nearly
nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 12.8 million).

	   MODENA, Italy (AP) _ Fiat unveiled a new Maserati coupe on
Tuesday aimed at reviving the famous sports car after two decades
of slow death.
	   The four-seater, which can reach a maximum speed of 280 kph (174
mph), will sell for 149.5 million lire (dlrs 89,628).
	   The 3200 GT Coupe has a sleek but classic look reminiscent of
Maserati's 1970s models, and is available in a range of colors.
However, it won't be available in the United States, where a third
of the world's sports cars are sold, before 2001.
	   Fiat acquired Maserati in 1993 and invested heavily to relaunch
the sports car. Maserati's chief executive, Paolo Marinsek, said he
expected Maserati to start posting a profit after the start of U.S.
sales.
	   Maserati hasn't sold cars in the United States since 1990 when
quality problems under its old ownership prompted Chrysler Corp. to
stop selling the car. Maserati's glory days in the United States
culminated in Indy 500 victories in 1939 and 1940.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   Opposition figures, angry over the assassination last week of a
popular opposition party figure, touched off a wave of unrest
reminiscent of the nationwide anarchy that lasted for months in
1997 and sent refugees flooding into Italy, Greece and other
European countries.
	   In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said the government's patience was running out and it would not
``wait endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of the
headquarters of his rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha and his Democratic Party
followers. Nano also said he was willing to consider ``in
principle'' any resolution to the crisis, presumably including his
own resignation _ as the opposition has demanded _ but insisted the
opposition first surrender any weapons.
	   ``There is no time,'' Nano said.
	   Berisha exhorted demonstrators to remain peaceful, but defiantly
announced a Wednesday rally unless Nano resigned. Protesters waved
the two-fingered victory sign.
	   The weekend assassination of Azem Hajdari, a former student
leader who helped bring down Albania's Communist government set off
two days of riots. Police said at least three Berisha supporters
were killed and 14 wounded Monday when government forces launched a
counterattack and swiftly regained control of key facilities:
Parliament, the state television and radio building and Nano's
office.
	   Despite Tuesday's ban on demonstrations, about 3,000 of
Berisha's supporters rallied peacefully in the main Tirana square.
	   Berisha, a 53-year-old heart surgeon, warned Interior Minister
Perikli Teta to rescind a shoot-without-warning order or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   A tank was parked in front of Democratic Party headquarters
Tuesday, apparently taken over by opposition forces during riots
the day before. About a half dozen Berisha supporters armed with
submachine guns were nearby.
	   Dozens of police cars surrounded the protesters on central
Skanderbeg Square, lights flashing and sirens howling. The cars and
several police vans were filled with officers carrying submachine
guns and wearing stocking masks.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   U.S. and European diplomats were seeking to negotiate a peaceful
end to the crisis. Many fear the unrest could spread, further
complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   President Rexhap Meidani was also trying to mediate a
settlement. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Meidani raised the possibility of Nano's resignation during a
meeting with the prime minister late Monday.
	   But Nano refused to step down until Berisha surrendered his
weapons and the government regained control of the city, the
sources said.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned that
the stability of the entire southern Balkans was at stake. He noted
that Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels,
who operate from sanctuaries in Berisha's stronghold of northern
Albania.
	   ``Any clashes in our immediate neighborhood are a reason for our
grave concern, especially if it is Albania and if a legally elected
government is threatened in such a way,'' Odalovic said.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened with arrest by the government, has urged the Socialist
government to resign but insists he is not plotting a takeover.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry told foreign diplomats Monday it would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha said he would never leave Albania. Berisha was
Albania's first noncommunist leader after decades under Stalinist
Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his policies became
increasingly authoritarian.
	   He said the building takeovers Monday were simply his
supporters' reaction to the slaying of Hajdari.

EU authorizes sale of Viagra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pfizer comment, Viagra to be in 50 nations by
yearend. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Tuesday
authorized the sale of the anti-impotence drug Viagra throughout
the 15-nation EU and the drug is expected to be available in 50
nations by year's end, officials said.
	   The drug was approved by the EU's executive Commission Tuesday
following the advise of a panel of European medical experts.
	   ``In principle the company concerned has, from tomorrow, the
right to circulate the product in all member states,'' said Jochen
Kubosch, health spokesman for the European Commission. Viagra is
produced by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc.
	   ``We are extremely pleased by the approval of this important
medical advance,'' said Pfizer Chief Executive William Steere.
	   Pfizer said the EU approval brought to 38 the number of
countries in which Viagra has been cleared. Steere hoped a dozen
more countries will approve the drug in the remaining months of
1998.
	   Individual EU governments are now free to decide whether to make
the drug available at the full price or at subsidized low prices
through their government health programs.
	   Under the EU's authorization, Viagra will only be available on
doctor's prescription and may not be supplied to patients under 18
or taken by women.
	   Pfizer will have to include a leaflet in all packets explaining
that the blue, diamond-shaped pills should not be used by those
with severe heart or liver problems or patients taking drugs
containing nitrates. The leaflet says nobody should take Viagra
more than once a day.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Bjarne Riis, Tour de France winner in 1996,
has extended his contract with the Deutsche Telekom team for
another year, through the end of 1999, Telekom said Tuesday.
	   Riis, a 34-year-old Dane, will remain the team's captain,
although Telekom's top riders in 1999 will be Jan Ullrich and Erik
Zabel, Telekom team chief Walter Godefroot said.
	   Ullrich won the Tour de France last year and finished second to
Marco Pantani in this year's race. Zabel won the top sprinter's
green jersey.

University threatens '' holy'' war if Pakistan signs nuclear
</HEADLINE>
treaty &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An influential religious university
in Pakistan threatened Tuesday to launch a jihad, or holy war,
against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government if it signs the
global nuclear test ban treaty.
	   The Dar-ul-Aloom Haqqania University issued the Islamic decree
warning that ``all Muslims were bound to struggle against and
resist those willing to support the treaty.''
	   The university, which has an enrollment of about 2,500 students,
educated many of the religious fighters in the Taliban militia, who
have imposed a harsh form of Islamic law in most of Afghanistan.
	   Tuesday's decree comes as Sharif tries to gauge public support
for the signing of the nuclear test ban treaty, a requirement to
end international sanctions imposed on Pakistan and neighboring
India after they conducted nuclear tests in May.
	   Pakistan, which had barely dlrs 1 billion in foreign exchange
when sanctions were imposed, has been crippled. India, which had
foreign reserves of dlrs 26 billion, has weathered the sanctions
better.
	   Pakistan's government issued no immediate response to the
decree.
	   The religious decree, or fatwa, warned the government that
signing the test ban treaty would be a ``suicidal step.''
	   The fatwa said that it would leave Pakistan at a military
disadvantage against often hostile India, against whom it has
fought three wars in the past 51 years.
	   ``It will make Pakistan defenseless against India and Israel ...
both countries are head and shoulders above in conventional arms,
which could only be countered with nuclear capability,'' the decree
said.
	   Both houses of Parliament are currently debating the treaty.
	   On Tuesday, the opposition stormed out of Parliament saying the
government already had decided to sign the treaty. Sharif's
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddiq Kanju said ``no secret
decision'' has been made.
	   However, the government reportedly is prepared to sign the
treaty if sanctions are lifted and Pakistan is recognized as a
nuclear power.
	   The decree warned the government against joining the treaty.
	   ``No such agreement was allowed under the injunctions of Islam
which (will) put limits on arming an Islamic state or which could
have a negative bearing on the preparations for holy war against
the forces inimical to Islam,'' it said.

Kuwait sends 15 tons of humanitarian aid to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A cargo plane carrying 15 tons of relief
supplies for flood victims arrived Tuesday from Kuwait, the first
such aid sent by the emirate since Sudan's backing for Iraq in the
Gulf War.
	   A Kuwaiti statement said the supplies included medicines, baby
formula, tents and blankets. It noted the aid was ordered sent by
the Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, as ``part of the
Kuwaiti people's standing by the Sudanese people.''
	   Relations between the two countries were strained when Sudan
backed Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but they have been
warming of late.
	   Earlier this year, Kuwait gave permission for a Sudanese
diplomat to work in the Sudanese Embassy in Kuwait. Last month,
Kuwait restored postal services with Sudan.
	   The African country is suffering some of its worst flooding in
years along the River Nile. The floods have caused 40 billion
Sudanese pounds (dlrs 19 million) to homes and farms.

Eritreans treat Ethiopians well despite conflict, EU says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Despite a border dispute, Eritreans have
been fair to Ethiopians living in their country, and have not
forced them to leave, a European Union report said.
	   Ethiopians in Eritrea ``are treated mostly in no way other than
before the conflict,'' the memo released Monday said. The report,
dated July 29, was not intended for public release, but was posted
on the Internet, the EU said.
	   A border border dispute between the two countries erupted into
armed clashes in June. Each side has accused the other of
trespassing.
	   Attempts by U.S. and African leaders to broker peace have
failed, though fighting has subsided with the rainy season.
	   EU heads of mission in Asmara in July investigated the Ethiopian
government's allegation its citizens had been mistreated by
Eritrea. They found no evidence of ``mass deportations, arbitrary
arrests or anything else regarding Ethiopians,'' the report said.
	   On the streets of Asmara, some Ethiopians complain of personal
hardships, including being fired from their jobs and losing their
homes as a result of the conflict.
	   Some fear an escalation of the war and thousands of Ethiopians
have registered to return home. Since Aug. 10, the Red Cross has
escorted home 2,000 Ethiopians who wanted to be repatriated.
	   The U.N. human rights agency has accused Ethiopia of violatating
international human rights principles by carrying out the
deportations. The Eritrean government says more than 20,000 of its
citizens have been deported from Ethiopia since May, including
prominent businessmen, diplomats and U.N. employees.
	   At the beginning of the conflict, about 550,000 Eritreans were
living in Ethiopia, and about 100,000 Ethiopians were in Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa countries had been deteriorating since last year.

Nationalists hope for gains in first Bosnia election results

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International organizers of
last weekend's Bosnian election announced Tuesday they were not
ready to release results as rival groups issued contradictory
statements claiming success.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, gave
voters a choice between hard-line ethnic leaders from the war era
and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan that halted
the fighting.
	   Voters cast ballots Saturday and Sunday, and international
officials called it a success because of the absence of violence.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
supervised the election, had said first returns could be released
Tuesday evening. But OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said later that
no returns would be announced as scheduled.
	   There was no explanation for the delay and no indication when
returns would be made public. But some international sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said early returns showed a
stronger-than-expected showing by radical nationalists.
	   The sources said it was too early to make a definitive judgemet
since OSCE has yet to count hundreds of thousands of absentee
ballots _ mostly those of refugees voting for their pre-war
hometowns. Absentee returns could swing the election, they said.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Voters cast ballots for a three-member presidency _ one from
each ethnic group _ along with a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity and region. The Serb republic also voted
for the president of their entity.
	   Hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress since the end of the war. Still, situation has
improved since 1995 with nationalists gradually losing the power
through the 1996 national elections and 1997 local ballot.
	   Many experts had expected this general trend to continue.
	   But Western diplomats, who spoke under the condition of
anonymity, said the initial results show hard-line nationalist
parties doing better than expected.
	   Much attention has focused on the race for the presidency of the
Bosnian Serb entity. The current president and a Western favorite,
Biljana Plavsic, is trailing the candidate of Serb hard-line
parties, Nikola Poplasen, the sources said.
	   Plavsic was elected the president of Republika Srpska in 1996,
while she was still a hard-liner and a member of the ruling Serb
Democratic Party.
	   Later, she split from the Serb hard-liners and led the Serb
entity into the economic and political reforms.
	   Western officials fear Poplasen would use the considerable
powers of the office to reinforce his hard-liners.
	   According to the sources, another Western favorite Kresimir
Zubak was also faring poorly. Zubak has recently split from the
Bosnian Croat hard-liners and formed a new, more moderate.
	   Initial results show the clear victory of the Croat hard-line
candidate, Ante Jelavic, which indicates that most of the Croats in
Bosnia are controlled by the Croat hard-liners and their protegee,
Croatian president, Franjo Tudjman.
	   Yet, even Zubak said before the ballot that he would be
satisfied with anything more than 20 percent of the Bosnian Croat
votes.
	   In the Muslim-dominated areas of Bosnia, a victory by the leader
of the ruling Muslim SDA party and current chairman of the joint
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, was never doubted.
	   Yet sources said intial results show that two main Social
Democrat opposition parties are running neck-and-neck in races for
the federal parliament and some regional assemblies.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.

Eritreans treat Ethiopians well despite conflict, EU says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Despite a border dispute, Eritreans have
been fair to Ethiopians living in their country, and have not
forced them to leave, a European Union report said.
	   Ethiopians in Eritrea ``are treated mostly in no way other than
before the conflict,'' the memo released Monday said. The report,
dated July 29, was not intended for public release, but was posted
on the Internet, the EU said.
	   A border border dispute between the two countries erupted into
armed clashes in June. Each side has accused the other of
trespassing.
	   Attempts by U.S. and African leaders to broker peace have
failed, though fighting has subsided with the rainy season.
	   EU heads of mission in Asmara in July investigated the Ethiopian
government's allegation its citizens had been mistreated by
Eritrea. They found no evidence of ``mass deportations, arbitrary
arrests or anything else regarding Ethiopians,'' the report said.
	   On the streets of Asmara, some Ethiopians complain of personal
hardships, including being fired from their jobs and losing their
homes as a result of the conflict.
	   Some fear an escalation of the war and thousands of Ethiopians
have registered to return home. Since Aug. 10, the Red Cross has
escorted home 2,000 Ethiopians who wanted to be repatriated.
	   The U.N. human rights agency has accused Ethiopia of violatating
international human rights principles by carrying out the
deportations. The Eritrean government says more than 20,000 of its
citizens have been deported from Ethiopia since May, including
prominent businessmen, diplomats and U.N. employees.
	   At the beginning of the conflict, about 550,000 Eritreans were
living in Ethiopia, and about 100,000 Ethiopians were in Eritrea.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa countries had been deteriorating since last year.

Bulgaria's neglected Turks fleeing adopted homeland after

centuries &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLAZISHTE, Bulgaria (AP) _ A few chickens roam the nearly empty
streets of this once-lively mountain village. Stray dogs slink
behind deserted houses with broken windows.
	   An eerie silence hangs over Blazishte and dozens of other
virtual ghost towns in the Kardzhali region, a Turkish minority
stronghold about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Bulgaria's
capital, Sofia. Most of the ethnic Turks who have populated the
area for centuries are deserting it for Turkey, suddenly unable to
survive in one of the poorest parts of one of Europe's poorest
countries.
	   Djemine Ramadan, 88, lives alone in a dilapidated house she once
helped build, her daughter and four sons now gone.
	   Asked what she does during her lonely days, she looked down the
lifeless road and said: ``I'm waiting for somebody to come back.''
	   Bulgaria's economic misery of the 1990s makes a return to more
prosperous times unlikely any time soon.
	   Turks who once endured fierce discrimination in this Balkan
country have recovered their rights in the post-communist era. But
now they are fleeing in huge numbers due to grinding poverty that
has shut down employers, emptied villages and left many remaining
families on the verge of starvation.
	   The average income for the region is barely half the nationwide
average of dlrs 100 (leva 180,000) a month, and unemployment tops
50 percent. Without income or hope, some 200,000 people have moved
to Turkey in the last six years, legally or otherwise.
	   ``The main motive to emigrate to Turkey is the hope for a better
life,'' says Adil Naim, a municipal employee for the town of Djebel
whose parents and sister already have gone south.
	   Naim, 42, worked as a schoolteacher until last year. But his
school was closed down because there were not enough children left.
	   ``Every year schools have to be closed. There are five or six
children in a class,'' he says sadly.
	   The population of the Djebel district alone has shrunk from
32,000 in 1989, when Bulgaria dumped communism for democracy, to
less than 7,000.
	   Many have headed to cities in western Turkey, a predominantly
Muslim country. Turkish media reported that a third of the 1.5
million residents in the city of Bursa came from Bulgaria.
	   ``The Bulgarian Turks integrate easily in their new homeland.
They speak the language and have generally a better education than
the local residents,'' says Naim.
	   Despite the departures, Turks still comprise Bulgaria's biggest
minority, with roughly 10 percent of the country's 8.5 million
population, and the cash-strapped government has been criticized
for neglecting them.
	   Bulgaria, a mainly Slavic Orthodox country, suffered harsh
Turkish domination from the late 14th to the late 19th century. But
it is Bulgaria's Turks who have been the victims of oppression in
recent years.
	   Under Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, ethnic Turks in Bulgaria
were forced to change their names and deprived of the rights to use
their language, religion and customs.
	   After Zhivkov opened Bulgaria's borders in the summer of 1989,
Europe saw its biggest exodus in 40 years when 320,000 Turks fled
to Turkey, itself a world crossroads for immigrants trying to make
their way to more prosperous countries in Western Europe.
	   Ethnic Turks' status and freedom improved with the collapse of
communism. Legislation was enacted restoring their names, and they
are again free to practice Islam and speak Turkish in public.
	   But Bulgaria's economic hardships have hit them worst of all.
	   ``The situation is hopeless,'' says Djebel Mayor Bahri Yumer.
``There is no government strategy for recovering this crisis-shaken
region.''
	   Tobacco growing has for decades been one of the few
opportunities to earn a living in the backward Kardzhali region.
But even that industry has broken down, due to shrunken demand for
Bulgarian-made cigarettes that were popular in the former Soviet
Union.
	   Hundreds of Djebel-area families are on the verge of starvation
because of the failure of the recently privatized tobacco company
to pay them for their crops as promised.
	   Yashar Ali, who runs a small tobacco plant outside Djebel, has
been waiting a year for the tobacco money, which he needs to
smuggle his 6-year-old grandson to Turkey to be reunited with his
parents.
	   Smugglers charge dlrs 1,500 in U.S. bills to get a person
through the border, usually hidden in car trunks or bus luggage
compartments. Despite the whopping price and the reported deaths of
eight children on the perilous trip, they are in great demand.
	   ``The most lucrative job nowadays is the channelmen's,'' Adil
says of the smugglers. ``This illegal business is flourishing and
it looks like the government doesn't care much.
	   ``Probably this is a plan to solve the problems in the region,''
he says bitterly.

Netanyahu urges united front against armed fundamentalist nations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Citing Israel's successful test of the Arrow-2
anti-missile missile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged other
nations Tuesday to work with the Jewish state against renegade
powers developing non-conventional weaponry.
	   ``We need all threatened nations to act against fundamentalism
together. It's cooperation that is both natural and justified and
also essential,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Netanyahu stressed that while Israel may be a more likely target
of ballistic missiles, specifically from Iran, it was the entire
world that was threatened from what he described as,
``impoverished, backward, fanatic regimes.''
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Monday that other
countries had expressed interest in joining a regional security
plan that would make use of the Arrow missile capabilities.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky, said however, that it was
too early to discuss the selling or sharing of the Arrow technology
with other countries.
	   Monday, Israel announced that its Arrow-2 anti-missile missile
successfully destroyed a simulated target in the first
comprehensive test of its systems.
	   The Arrow-2 is intended as a defense against ballistic missiles
possessed by Iran, Iraq and other potential enemies such as Syria
or Libya. It is being developed jointly with the United States, and
can be integrated into American missile defense systems.
	   Netanyahu said that he expects the Arrow-2 to be operational by
mid-1999.
	   Netanyahu said his cabinet has approved the implementation of a
ten year program geared towards finding strategic answers to new
security problems. He noted that next year's state budget will
include a 700 million shekel (dlrs 182 million) increase in defense
spending, in part to deal with the new missile threat.
	   Netanyahu also said that he had sent word to newly appointed
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that he hoped Russia would
now work to curb the flow of weapons technology to Iran.
	   Israeli officials believe that Iran is racing forward in its
nuclear program and will be ready next year to fully test a
prototype of its Shihab 3 missile, which is capable of reaching
Israel.

Italy calls on Albania to bring killers to justice; no plans to
</HEADLINE>
evacuate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	    &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with Dini saying evacuation plans ready
but no immediate plans to evacuate; number of Italians in Albania,
leader of Italian industrialists appealing for Tirana to take
action.
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian military aircraft and ships were readied for
possible evacuation of Italian citizens from Albania's latest
violence, but no immediate exodus was planned, Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Tuesday.
	   Dini, briefing an emergency joint session of the foreign affairs
committee of the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies, called on
the Albanian government to bring to justice the killers of an
opposition leader whose death sparked the unrest in the Balkan
country.
	   He told lawmakers that the Albanian crisis was a ``test'' for
Italy because of the ``many Italian businessmen who have invested
their savings in Albania,'' because of the ``thousands of Albanian
refugees in Italy'' and because of the ``delicacy'' of the
situation in the troubled Balkan nation.
	   The last outbreak of violence in Albania, in 1997, sent
thousands of refugees fleeing across the Adriatic to Italy. Rome
sent most of them back when Albania calmed down.
	   Italian naval vessels kept up their regular patrol of the
Adriatic on the lookout for illegal immigrants, but no boatloads of
Albanians were spotted.
	   Italy also led a multinational military force deployed to
protect aid shipments to Albania in the wake of the 1997 uprising.
	   Dini said the only sure way to restore peace in Albania was to
bring to justice the killers of a popular opposition leader whose
death helped ignite the crisis. He warned that Italy's support is
``strictly conditioned on conduct inspired by moderation and
respect for the law, by both the government and the Albanian
opposition.''
	   Premier Romano Prodi has told the Albanians that continued
international support depends on ``the cessation of every act of
violence, by every side, and on the stability of the country's
institutions.''
	   About 2,000 Italians are in Albania. Rome has encouraged Italian
investment there as a way to develop jobs there to encourage
Albanians to stay at home instead of fleeing to search for black
market work in Italy.
	   The leader of Italy's lobby of industrialists, Confindustria,
expressed concern that the Italian business community in Albania
was running a big risk in the current violence. ``I hope that the
(Albanian) government is able to intervene more quickly than it has
in the past,'' said the group's president, Giorgio Fossa.
	   Italy and Germany on Tuesday recommended sending an
international police force to Albania to help stablize the nation.

Hundreds of economic crimes exposed in Ukraine's coal industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Law enforcement agencies have uncovered as
many as 617 economic crimes involving dozens of managers in the
country's ailing coal industry, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry
said Tuesday.
	   The report was especially worrisome because of the overall
situation in the coal industry, plagued by chronic non-payment of
wages, miners' strikes, inefficient management and deadly accidents
frequently caused by outdated equipment and disregard for safety
rules.
	   The crimes exposed so far this year included 316 thefts,
including 171 large-scale thefts, as well as 105 cases of
bribe-taking, 46 cases of hiding hard-currency profits, 23 cases of
mishandling budgetary funds and three illegally received credits,
the ministry said.
	   There are 661 people, including 111 managers at various levels,
facing criminal proceedings in the cases, the ministry said,
according to the Interfax news agency.

American University announces archaeology reference project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The American University in Cairo announced
Tuesday that it was designing a major, computerized reference of
4,000 archaeological sites in Egypt.
	   Professor Kent Weeks told a news conference that the
university-sponsored Egyptian Archaeological Database Project aimed
at producing a CD-ROM for use by professional archaeologists and
conservationists as well as schoolchildren.
	   He said it would be the ``world's largest gazetteer'' of ancient
Egypt and added: ``This is a project we hope to have ready in time
for the millennium.''
	   Weeks, a professor of archaeology at AUC, is best known for his
discovery in 1995 of a massive mausoleum in the Valley of the Kings
near Luxor in southern Egypt.
	   The tomb, the largest in Egypt with at least 150 rooms, is
believed to have been the burial site for most of Pharaoh Ramses II
sons. Ramses, who ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C., is known to
have had dozens of wives and some 100 acknowledged children, about
half of them sons.
	   Weeks said the new CD-ROM would cover 500,000 years of
archaeology in Egypt, from prehistoric times through the pharaonic
dynasties and into the Greek, Roman and early Christian eras.
	   He estimated there would be some 4,000 sites described in
detail, including places like Giza on the outskirts of Cairo where
there are thousands of temples, tombs and other monuments.
	   Several prototype examples from the database were displayed,
including one showing how the pyramids and temples of Giza looked
4,500 years ago.
	   Another example let the viewer virtually fly over the Nile River
to get an aerial view of the Valley of the Kings, then enter the
tomb of Ramses I to look at the painted drawings on the walls.
	   An archaeologist will be able to get a detailed description of
excavations at the site, pottery and other items found,
conservation efforts and a bibliography, Weeks said.
	   A child, on the other hand, could click on the image of Osiris
and find out that he was the god of the afterlife and get
directions to other tombs decorated with his likeness.
	   At the news conference, the Mobil Foundation and the American
oil giant's Egyptian subsidiary announced they were donating dlrs
234,000 for development of the CD-ROM.
	   Weeks said the CD-ROM would be sold on a not-or-profit basis,
with proceeds going to pay for translations _ initially into Arabic
for Egyptian antiquities authorities and students _ as well as for
updating the data.

Netanyahu and Uzbek president meet to discuss expanding ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that increasing levels of cooperation between Israel and Uzbekistan
were signs of a ``natural friendship'' between the countries.
	   Netanyahu and visiting Uzbek President Islam Karimov signed a
series of agreements to develop trade and economic ties, avoid
double taxation and share agricultural technologies.
	   Karimov's three-day visit was described by Israeli foreign
ministry officials as a goodwill gesture at a time when Israel and
Uzbekistan are developing trade and technological ties.
	   ``The most important part of our cooperation is economic. We are
very impressed by the Israeli technologies we have seen,'' Karimov
said at a joint news conference with Netanyahu.
	   Karimov said that although the two had discussed common threats
such as fundamentalism, the nations had signed no agreements on the
subject.
	   Netanyahu, however, said the countries had a similar world view.
	   ``We see so much eye-to-eye, the difficulties and challenges in
achieving peace and security in our world today,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Karimov also met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday
in the West Bank city of Ramallah and voiced his support for the
Palestinian cause.
	   ``Though we live far from Palestine, we support the struggle of
the Palestinian people and we support the Palestinian Authority,''
Karimov said.
	   Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim former Soviet republic in
Central Asia, is willing to help move ahead the struggling peace
talks between the Jewish state and the Palestinian people, Karimov
added.

U.N. body with too much cash cuts patent fees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. agency responsible for protecting
copyrights and patents has a problem that other international
organizations would dearly like to share.
	   It has too much cash.
	   Anxious to wipe out a budget surplus of 16 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 11 million), the World Intellectual Property Organization on
Tuesday approved plans to cut the costs of registering patents by
up to 15 percent with effect from next January. The move follows a
10 percent cut last year.
	   WIPO's annual assembly also agreed to spend extra funds on new
projects like a study into the controversial issue of biotechnology
and patents, and seminars on the impact of the Internet on
copyrights.
	   Laurent Manderieux, spokesman for the agency, said WIPO was
alone among U.N. organizations in having such a budget surplus.
Most international agencies face continual financial shortfalls.
	   WIPO has been under pressure from the United States and other
Western countries to use its surplus to lower fees so that more
inventors worldwide can apply for patents. The Western group also
has been urging the agency to spend the money on improving respect
for the international patent system in developing countries.
	   The boom in registrations in patents is largely responsible for
WIPO's windfall. The number of new registrations rose 15 percent in
1997 to 54,000 _ earning WIPO about 100 million Swiss francs (dlrs
71 million).
	   For the first six months of this year, 34,000 applications were
lodged at WIPO's Geneva base _ a hefty 27 percent rise over
January-June 1997, Manderieux said.
	   Companies or individuals registering patents are covered by the
so-called International Patent Cooperation Union. This offers them
protection in the 98 signatory countries for between 20 and 30
months.
	   The cost of registering a patent varies depending on the length
of the request. Most range from 20-50 pages and cost the owner on
average 2,000 to 3,000 francs (dlrs 1,400 - dlrs 2,142) in fees.
	   With effect from next January, the initial filing fee will be
1,500 francs (dlrs 1,071), down from dlrs 1,650 francs (dlrs
1,178). Companies or people submitting the application
electronically rather than on paper will get a further discount,
said Manderieux.
	   The assembly also approved the expansion of WIPO's headquarters
to the tune of around 95 million francs (dlrs 68 million).
	   The assembly also fixed a budget of 400 million francs (dlrs 286
million) for the 1999-2000 two-year period, up from 300 million
francs (dlrs 214 million) for the current biennium.
	   WIPO groups some 170 countries. Kamil Idris of Sudan took over
as director-general late last year.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Gunmen who kidnapped the ethnic Greek
governor of Gjirokastra in southern Albania released him Tuesday
after pressure from Greece, foreign ministry sources said.
	   Gjirokastra governor Jani Dako, a member of the 150,000-strong
Greek community in southern Albania, was kidnapped along with his
nephew late Monday by gunmen demanding a ransom of 25 million
drachmas (about dlrs 86,000).
	   Both were freed following intense pressure from Greece after the
Athens' consul in Gjirokastra was ordered to mediate for their
release, a senior foreign ministry source said on condition of
anonymity. No ransom was paid.
	   Dako, who suffered slight injuries, was to be transported to a
hospital in the northern Greek town of Ioannina, about 45
kilometers (28 miles) south of the border, the source said.
	   Greece boosted military patrols along the border with Albania,
and border guards were placed on alert, while Albanian police
reported overnight shootouts between gunmen and Albanian border
guards at the Kakavia crossing near Ioannina.
	   Albanian police said the attackers from Gjirokastra wounded
three people, adding that an armed group had set up a checkpoint
just south of the Albanian city.
	   Two of the injured were transported by helicopter for treatment
to a Ioannina hospital, local media reported.
	   But despite the tension, there was no direct evidence to suggest
an imminent wave of refugees heading to Greece, government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   ``This could mean the situation has overcome its critical
stage,'' he noted.
	   More than 200 Greek combat troops stationed north of Tirana to
assist the Albanian armed forces' restructuring efforts were also
placed on alert when tension mounted in the capital Monday.
	   Protests were prompted by the weekend assassination of a popular
ally and fellow lawmaker of opposition leader Sali Berisha, and
touched off a wild day of unrest reminiscent of the anarchy that
lasted for months in 1997.
	   The Greek troops are ``ensuring stability and security for other
representations and international organizations, as we have been
asked to do since (Monday) afternoon,'' said Greek Defense Minister
Akis Tsochadzopoulos.
	   But Berisha lambasted the troops' presence, insisting their sole
role was to prop up the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
	   ``Ideological flirts are anti-Albanian,'' Berisha said. ``I call
on the Greek Prime Minister and the Greek President to stop
Greece's intervention into Albanian internal affairs.''
	   Reppas retorted that ``Greece and the Premier are not involved
in any way in Albania's domestic issues.''

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said the government's patience was running out and it would not
``wait endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of the
headquarters of his rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha and his followers, and
said he was willing to consider ``in principle'' any formula for
resolving the crisis, presumably including his own resignation, as
the opposition has demanded.
	   The Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and order _ warned
Tuesday it would respond with force to any resistance from Berisha
supporters after clashes Sunday and Monday. Police were authorized
to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed, the ministry said on state
television.
	   About 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied in the main Tirana
square, despite a ban by the Interior Ministry. The protest ended
peacefully, but tensions in the capital remained high.
	   Many protesters flashed the two-fingered victory sign as Berisha
coupled demands for Nano's resignation with exhortations that the
demonstrators remain peaceful.
	   Dozens of police cars surrounded the protesters on Skanderbeg
Square, lights flashing and sirens howling. The cars and several
police vans were filled with officers carrying submachine guns and
wearing stocking masks.
	   The weekend assassination of a popular Berisha ally touched off
two days of unrest reminiscent of the nationwide anarchy that
lasted for months in 1997 and sent refugees flooding into Italy,
Greece and other European countries.
	   U.S. and European diplomats were seeking to negotiate a peaceful
end to the crisis. Many fear the unrest could spread, further
complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned
Tuesday that the stability of the southern Balkans was at stake.
Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   Foreign ministers of Italy and Germany recommended Tuesday that
an international police force be sent to Albania and urged the
European Union to increase aid to the country.
	   An international police mission, in addition to backing up
Albanian security forces, could help stem the flow of weapons over
the Albanian border into Kosovo and the flow of refugees coming the
other way, the two ministers said in a statement released in Bonn,
Germany.
	   But Berisha remained defiant. He warned Interior Minister
Perikli Teta to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear
all responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He announced a new rally for Wednesday unless Nano resigned.
	   ``Now it's up to the Albanian political parties and the Albanian
people to defend the values of democracy,'' Berisha told reporters
in his party stronghold. ``I'm sure that people don't want
violence. But a worse thing is dictatorship.''
	   Asked if he expected a peaceful solution, Berisha said ``I have
demonstrated I am a believer of peace. This is a difficult time.
This is a very cruel man (Nano) and he's working and willing to
plunge Albania into bloodshed.''
	   President Rexhap Meidani was trying to mediate a settlement, and
government sources said he raised the possibility of Nano's
resignation during a meeting with him late Monday.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded Monday when government forces launched a counterattack and
swiftly regained control of key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Nano's office.
	   But a source at the military hospital told The Associated Press
on Tuesday that 50 people had been hospitalized there with wounds,
including protesters and police.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of the riots that swept Albania
last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which
cost many people their life's savings.
	   At least four tanks rumbled through the streets Monday, crowds
of looters broke into stores and gangs of armed men roamed the
city, firing in the air.
	   One tank was parked in front of Democratic Party headquarters
Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. About a half dozen Berisha
supporters armed with submachine guns were nearby.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday remained closed.
Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also cleaned out
Nano's villa in Tirana on Monday.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his
policies became increasingly authoritarian.

Polish foreign minister arrives in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
who arrived here Tuesday, was expected to discuss economic
cooperation and border policies in a series of meetings with
Ukrainian officials.
	   Ukraine wants a favorable climate for its citizens traveling to
Poland and is concerned that visa requirements would be toughened
if Poland is accepted into the European Union.
	   The future visa regime ``must be most favorable for Ukrainian
citizens crossing the Polish border,'' Ukraine's ambassador to
Poland, Petro Sardachuk, said Tuesday.
	   Ukraine and Poland have signed agreements on visa-free movement
and on readmission of illegal migrants. But Poland already has
restricted the entry for Russians and Belarusians out of concern
that it is becoming a transit point for illegal migration to the
West.
	   Polish officials say Warsaw will introduce visas for its eastern
neighbors if the EU demands that as a condition for Poland's
membership.
	   Geremek was scheduled to meet separately with Ukraine's
President Leonid Kuchma and Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk late
Tuesday and to hold economic talks with Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko on Wednesday.
	   Trade turnover between the two countries amounted to dlrs 1.7
billion in 1997 and grew by 12 percent in the first half of 1998
against the same period last year, according to Sardachuk. Polish
exports to Ukraine, however, account for two-thirds of that
turnover.

EU authorizes sale of Viagra in 15 nations

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union authorized sales of
Viagra Tuesday and the manufacturer of the anti-impotency drug said
it would be available in most of the 15 EU nations by mid-October.
	   However, several EU nations said they would not subsidize the
drug through government health programs, meaning most impotent
Europeans will have to pay the full price for the blue,
diamond-shaped pills.
	   Each pill is expected to cost the local currency equivalent of
dlrs 6 to 8, said Vic Micati, executive vice-president of Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals, the New York-based company that makes Viagra.
	   The drug was approved by the EU's 20-member executive Commission
acting on the advice of a panel of European medical experts.
	   ``In principle the company concerned has, from tomorrow, the
right to circulate the product in all member states,'' said Jochen
Kubosch, health spokesman for the EU Commission.
	   Viagra will only be available on doctor's prescription and may
not be supplied to patients under 18 or taken by women.
	   Pfizer will have to include a leaflet in all packets explaining
that Viagra should not be used by those with severe heart or liver
problems or patients taking drugs containing nitrates. The leaflet
says nobody should take Viagra more than once a day.
	   Micati told a news conference Viagra could be available in some
EU nations within the next 10 days. Britain, Sweden and the
Netherlands are expected to be the first to get the drug.
	   In should be in pharmacies in most other EU nations by
mid-October, but bureaucratic procedures mean Greeks and Belgians
may have to wait another couple of months.
	   EU governments are now pondering whether to make the drug
available free of charge or at subsidized low prices through state
health programs. Most won't for the moment, fearing a sudden rush
to get hold of the drug could strain health service finances.
	   Britain's Health Secretary Frank Dobson told doctors they should
not prescribe the drug free. He estimated that would cost the
National Health Service between 50 million pounds (dlrs 82.5
million) and 150 million pounds (dlrs 247.5 million) yearly.
	   ``Most people in this country don't think we should finance it
through the health service as a sort of recreational drug at the
expense of doing things which are more important,'' Dobson told BBC
radio.
	   Micati said Pfizer was talking with authorities in all EU
nations in an effort to persuade them to offset the costs of
patients' Viagra purchases.
	   ``We have the view that erectile dysfunction is a serious and
now an easily treatable disorder,'' he said. ``We think
reimbursement is very appropriate.''
	   Pfizer said the EU approval brought to 38 the number of
countries in which Viagra has been cleared. The company hopes a
dozen more countries will approve the drug in the remaining months
of 1998.
	   In the five biggest EU nations _ Germany, France, Britain, Italy
and Spain _ Pfizer estimates there are 15 million impotence
sufferers among men aged between 40 and 70.
	   Since Viagra was authorized for sale in the United States in
March, more than 4 million American men have been been prescribed
the drug, said Joe Feczko, Pfizer's Medical Director.

American University announces archaeology reference project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The temples of Giza, the tombs of pharoahs,
and aerial views of the Nile are some of the 4,000 archaeological
sites in Egypt included in a computerized reference tool being
designed by the American University in Cairo, it announced Tuesday.
	   Professor Kent Weeks told a news conference that the
university-sponsored Egyptian Archaeological Database Project aimed
at producing a CD-ROM for use by professional archaeologists and
conservationists as well as schoolchildren.
	   He said it would be the ``world's largest gazetteer'' of ancient
Egypt and added: ``This is a project we hope to have ready in time
for the millennium.''
	   Weeks, a professor of archaeology at AUC, is best known for his
discovery in 1995 of a massive mausoleum in the Valley of the Kings
near Luxor in southern Egypt.
	   The tomb, the largest in Egypt with at least 150 rooms, is
believed to have been the burial site for most of Pharaoh Ramses II
sons. Ramses, who ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C., is known to
have had dozens of wives and some 100 acknowledged children, about
half of them sons.
	   Weeks said the new CD-ROM would cover 500,000 years of
archaeology in Egypt, from prehistoric times through the pharaonic
dynasties and into the Greek, Roman and early Christian eras.
	   He estimated there would be some 4,000 sites described in
detail, including places like Giza on the outskirts of Cairo where
there are thousands of temples, tombs and other monuments.
	   Several prototype examples from the database were displayed,
including one showing how the pyramids and temples of Giza looked
4,500 years ago.
	   Another example let the viewer virtually fly over the Nile River
to get an aerial view of the Valley of the Kings, then enter the
tomb of Ramses I to look at the painted drawings on the walls.
	   An archaeologist will be able to get a detailed description of
excavations at the site, pottery and other items found,
conservation efforts and a bibliography, Weeks said.
	   A child, on the other hand, could click on the image of Osiris
and find out that he was the god of the afterlife and get
directions to other tombs decorated with his likeness.
	   At the news conference, the Mobil Foundation and the American
oil giant's Egyptian subsidiary announced they were donating dlrs
234,000 for development of the CD-ROM.
	   Weeks said the CD-ROM would be sold on a not-or-profit basis,
with proceeds going to pay for translations _ initially into Arabic
for Egyptian antiquities authorities and students _ as well as for
updating the data.

Security Council meeting to extend Angola deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council on Tuesday proposed
calling on the Angolan government to reconsider its decision to
suspend participation of the former rebel group UNITA in the
government.
	   A draft resolution, which the council expected to adopt later
Tuesday, came after Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos told
the council that the government had broken dialogue with UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi for his failure to honor a 1994 peace accord.
	   The government, however, has decided to recognize a group of
UNITA leaders who have split with Savimbi, called the UNITA
Renovation Committee, said a letter to the council from dos Santos.
	   ``I request that you not hesitate to support the positions of
the Angolan government and those of the UNITA Renovation Committee,
for this is the only way to give the peace process a new thrust,
capable of leading it to its conclusions,'' dos Santos wrote.
	   The draft resolution makes no mention of the committee, though
it does take note of dos Santos' letter. The goal of the resolution
is to extend the mandate of the U.N. observer mission in the
southwestern African nation through Oct. 15. The mandate was to
expire Tuesday.
	   Angola's peace process has crumbled, with a resurgence in
fighting. Tensions mounted after the government said it was
severing all contact with Savimbi.
	   UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975. A
U.N.-mediated 1994 accord, called the Lusaka Protocol, ended the
fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA has resisted
implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand over four key
territories and demobilize its troops.

Monaco beats Lodz 3-1 in UEFA Cup

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Favored Monaco struggled before half-time,
but scored three second-half goals and beat LKS Lodz 3-1 (0-1) in
their UEFA Cup first round, first leg match Tuesday.
	   Lodz took the lead in the 10th minute when striker Piotr Matys
pushed the ball with his heel into the net from five meters out.
	   After repeated attacks in the first half, which were turned back
by the Lodz defense, Monaco equalized in the 59th minute when Lodz
defender Witold Bendkowski turned a powerful shot by Ludovic Giuly
into his own goal.
	   David Trezeguet made it 2-1 from a penalty kick in the 69th,
while Croatia's international striker Robert Spehar scored from 10
meters out in the 84th minute.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said the government's patience was running out and it would not
``wait endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of the
headquarters of his rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha and his followers, and
said he was willing to consider ``in principle'' any formula for
resolving the crisis, presumably including his own resignation, as
the opposition has demanded.
	   But first, Nano added, Berisha must hand over the weapons.
Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been
completed for ``an abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if
necessary.

Ecuador's president unveils austerity package, devalues currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ President Jamil Mahuad has announced an
emergency package to mend Ecuador's tattered economy, devaluing its
currency and ending subsidies on electricity and gas.
	   In a nationally televised address Monday night, Mahuad, who took
power on Aug. 10, promised to shelter Ecuador's poor from the
austerity measures and stave off social unrest by giving each poor
family the equivalent of dlrs 16.4 a month.
	   The sucre fell by nearly 10 percent on Monday after the
government shifted the band within which the sucre is allowed to
trade downwards by 15 percent. In March, Ecuador's Central Bank had
devalued the sucre by 7.5 percent. The sucre has fallen nearly 39
percent this year.
	   The currency devaluation came two weeks after neighboring
Colombia devalued its currency.
	   Although Ecuador has one of Latin America's smallest economies,
the measure sparked fears of additional devaluations in the region.
	   Mahuad said he would eliminate state subsidies on electricity,
natural gas and oil, which collectively cost Ecuador more than dlrs
500 million a year.
	   He also said he will trim Ecuador's bloated public service,
improve tax collection and cut the number of government vehicles by
30 percent.
	   The spending reduction is aimed at reducing annual inflation
that exceeds 40 percent, one of Latin America's highest inflation
rates.
	   Impoverished Ecuador has been hit hard by slumping world oil
prices and the Asian economic crisis, since Asian countries are
among the main purchasers of its three principal exports _ oil,
bananas and shrimp.
	   ``Throughout 1998, Ecuador's economy has been accumulating
macroeconomic imbalances,'' said Central Bank President Luis Jacome
after the measures were announced.
	   Ecuador's exports fell sharply in the first half of 1998 and its
budget deficit has grown to dlrs 1.4 billion, or 7 percent of its
gross domestic product, the government said.
	   Some state employees have not been paid since July and the
government has said it will be only able to service 10 percent of
its debt.

	   BLAZISHTE, Bulgaria (AP) _ A few chickens roam the nearly empty
streets of this once-lively mountain village. Stray dogs slink
behind deserted houses with broken windows.
	   An eerie silence hangs over Blazishte and dozens of other
virtual ghost towns in the Kardzhali region, a Turkish minority
stronghold about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Bulgaria's
capital, Sofia. Most of the ethnic Turks who have populated the
area for centuries are deserting it for Turkey, suddenly unable to
survive in one of the poorest parts of one of Europe's poorest
countries.
	   Djemine Ramadan, 88, lives alone in a dilapidated house she once
helped build, her daughter and four sons now gone.
	   Asked what she does during her lonely days, she looked down the
lifeless road and said: ``I'm waiting for somebody to come back.''
	   Bulgaria's economic misery of the 1990s makes a return to more
prosperous times unlikely any time soon.
	   Turks who once endured fierce discrimination in this Balkan
country have recovered their rights in the post-communist era. But
now they are fleeing in huge numbers due to grinding poverty that
has shut down employers, emptied villages and left many remaining
families on the verge of starvation.
	   The average income for the region is barely half the nationwide
average of dlrs 100 (leva 180,000) a month, and unemployment tops
50 percent. Without income or hope, some 200,000 people have moved
to Turkey in the last six years, legally or otherwise.
	   ``The main motive to emigrate to Turkey is the hope for a better
life,'' says Adil Naim, a municipal employee for the town of Djebel
whose parents and sister already have gone south.
	   Naim, 42, worked as a schoolteacher until last year. But his
school was closed down because there were not enough children left.
	   ``Every year schools have to be closed. There are five or six
children in a class,'' he says sadly.
	   The population of the Djebel district alone has shrunk from
32,000 in 1989, when Bulgaria dumped communism for democracy, to
less than 7,000.
	   Many have headed to cities in western Turkey, a predominantly
Muslim country. Turkish media reported that a third of the 1.5
million residents in the city of Bursa came from Bulgaria.
	   ``The Bulgarian Turks integrate easily in their new homeland.
They speak the language and have generally a better education than
the local residents,'' says Naim.
	   Despite the departures, Turks still comprise Bulgaria's biggest
minority, with roughly 10 percent of the country's 8.5 million
population, and the cash-strapped government has been criticized
for neglecting them.
	   Bulgaria, a mainly Slavic Orthodox country, suffered harsh
Turkish domination from the late 14th to the late 19th century. But
it is Bulgaria's Turks who have been the victims of oppression in
recent years.
	   Under Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, ethnic Turks in Bulgaria
were forced to change their names and deprived of the rights to use
their language, religion and customs.
	   After Zhivkov opened Bulgaria's borders in the summer of 1989,
Europe saw its biggest exodus in 40 years when 320,000 Turks fled
to Turkey, itself a world crossroads for immigrants trying to make
their way to more prosperous countries in Western Europe.
	   Ethnic Turks' status and freedom improved with the collapse of
communism. Legislation was enacted restoring their names, and they
are again free to practice Islam and speak Turkish in public.
	   But Bulgaria's economic hardships have hit them worst of all.
	   ``The situation is hopeless,'' says Djebel Mayor Bahri Yumer.
``There is no government strategy for recovering this crisis-shaken
region.''
	   Tobacco growing has for decades been one of the few
opportunities to earn a living in the backward Kardzhali region.
But even that industry has broken down, due to shrunken demand for
Bulgarian-made cigarettes that were popular in the former Soviet
Union.
	   Hundreds of Djebel-area families are on the verge of starvation
because of the failure of the recently privatized tobacco company
to pay them for their crops as promised.
	   Yashar Ali, who runs a small tobacco plant outside Djebel, has
been waiting a year for the tobacco money, which he needs to
smuggle his 6-year-old grandson to Turkey to be reunited with his
parents.
	   Smugglers charge dlrs 1,500 in U.S. bills to get a person
through the border, usually hidden in car trunks or bus luggage
compartments. Despite the whopping price and the reported deaths of
eight children on the perilous trip, they are in great demand.
	   ``The most lucrative job nowadays is the channelmen's,'' Adil
says of the smugglers. ``This illegal business is flourishing and
it looks like the government doesn't care much.
	   ``Probably this is a plan to solve the problems in the region,''
he says bitterly.

Separatists gain parliamentary seat in Quebec by-election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHERBROOKE, Quebec (AP) _ Quebec separatists have scored a
symbolically important election victory, winning the Parliament
seat vacated by the man trying to lead anti-separatist forces to
power in an upcoming provincial campaign.
	   The by-election victory by the Bloc Quebecois on Monday could
encourage Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, to proceed
relative quickly with the provincial election.
	   That vote must be held by the fall of 1999, but Bouchard is
expected to call the election either this fall or next spring.
	   The by-election was for the Sherbrooke parliamentary seat held
since 1984 by Jean Charest, a popular anti-separatist who quit
federal politics last spring to lead the effort to unseat Bouchard
in the provincial vote.
	   The Bloc Quebecois candidate, Serge Cardin, received 16,157
votes, compared to 15,836 for Robert Pouliot of the anti-separatist
Liberal Party. A Progressive Conservative candidate received 2,295
votes.
	   With the Sherbrooke seat, the Bloc Quebecois now has 45 seats in
Parliament. The Liberals have 156, the Reform Party 58, the New
Democratic Party 21 and the Progressive Conservatives 19. There are
two independents.

Albanian government bans rally, calls on opponents to surrender

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   Opposition figures, angry over the assassination last week of a
popular opposition party figure, touched off a wave of unrest
reminiscent of the nationwide anarchy that lasted for months in
1997 and sent refugees flooding into Italy, Greece and other
European countries.
	   In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said the government's patience was running out and it would not
``wait endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of the
headquarters of his rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha and his Democratic Party
followers. Nano also said he was willing to consider ``in
principle'' any resolution to the crisis, presumably including his
own resignation _ as the opposition has demanded _ but insisted the
opposition first surrender any weapons.
	   ``There is no time,'' Nano said.
	   Berisha exhorted demonstrators to remain peaceful, but defiantly
announced a Wednesday rally unless Nano resigned. Protesters waved
the two-fingered victory sign.
	   The weekend assassination of Azem Hajdari, a former student
leader who helped bring down Albania's Communist government set off
two days of riots. Police said at least three Berisha supporters
were killed and 14 wounded Monday when government forces launched a
counterattack and swiftly regained control of key facilities:
Parliament, the state television and radio building and Nano's
office.
	   Despite Tuesday's ban on demonstrations, about 3,000 of
Berisha's supporters rallied peacefully in the main Tirana square.
	   Berisha, a 53-year-old heart surgeon, warned Interior Minister
Perikli Teta to rescind a shoot-without-warning order or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   A tank was parked in front of Democratic Party headquarters
Tuesday, apparently taken over by opposition forces during riots
the day before. About a half dozen Berisha supporters armed with
submachine guns were nearby.
	   Dozens of police cars surrounded the protesters on central
Skanderbeg Square, lights flashing and sirens howling. The cars and
several police vans were filled with officers carrying submachine
guns and wearing stocking masks.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   U.S. and European diplomats were seeking to negotiate a peaceful
end to the crisis. Many fear the unrest could spread, further
complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   President Rexhap Meidani was also trying to mediate a
settlement. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Meidani raised the possibility of Nano's resignation during a
meeting with the prime minister late Monday.
	   But Nano refused to step down until Berisha surrendered his
weapons and the government regained control of the city, the
sources said.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned that
the stability of the entire southern Balkans was at stake. He noted
that Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels,
who operate from sanctuaries in Berisha's stronghold of northern
Albania.
	   ``Any clashes in our immediate neighborhood are a reason for our
grave concern, especially if it is Albania and if a legally elected
government is threatened in such a way,'' Odalovic said.
	   Berisha, facing severe criticism from international leaders and
threatened with arrest by the government, has urged the Socialist
government to resign but insists he is not plotting a takeover.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry told foreign diplomats Monday it would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha said he would never leave Albania. Berisha was
Albania's first noncommunist leader after decades under Stalinist
Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his policies became
increasingly authoritarian.
	   He said the building takeovers Monday were simply his
supporters' reaction to the slaying of Hajdari.

Soldiers join protesters in Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Soldiers came to the aid of young
opposition party supporters Tuesday who took to the streets and
seized government vehicles, police said.
	   Police commissioner Bolutu Makoaba told South African Press
Assocation his officers were too scared to arrest protesters
because the soldiers were assisting them. Police stood back, and
did not interfere because of past tensions with the army.
	   Makoaba confirmed that government vehicles were seized by
protesting youths. He said there were no reports of injuries to
civil servants or damage to property, but a security guard outside
a local business was injured.
	   The defense chief was forced to step down last week by mutinous
officers, and his successor, Lt. Gen. Anthony Thibedi, appeared not
to be in control of the army, he said.
	   Opposition supporters have been protesting for weeks about
election results, charging fraud during the May elections.
	   Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million people located
within the borders of South Africa, has a history of political
upheaval and coups.

OSCE: no elections returns Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with OSCE withholds results, sources say
hard-liners doing better than expected &QL; 
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The international organizers
of Bosnia's election said Tuesday they were not ready to release
results.
	   The weekend election, the second in Bosnia for national leaders
since the devastating 3 1/2-year war in the former Yugoslav
republic, gave voters a choice between hard-line leaders from the
war era and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan that
halted the fighting.
	   Voters cast ballots Saturday and Sunday, and international
officials called the election a success because of the absence of
violence.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
supervised the election, had said first returns could be released
Tuesday. But OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said Tuesday no returns
would be announced as scheduled.
	   There was no explanation for the delay and no indication when
returns would be made public. Some international sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said early returns showed a
stronger-than-expected showing by hard-line nationalists.
	   The sources said the OSCE has yet to count hundreds of thousands
of absentee ballots _ mostly those of refugees voting for their
prewar hometowns. Absentee returns could swing the election.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two
entities, a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Voters cast ballots for a three-member presidency _ one Muslim,
one Serb, one Croat _ along with a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity and region. The Bosnian Serb republic
also voted for a separate president of their entity.
	   Much attention has focused on the race for the presidency of the
Bosnian Serb entity. The current president and a Western favorite,
Biljana Plavsic, is trailing the candidate of Serb hard-line
parties, Nikola Poplasen, the international sources said.
	   Plavsic was elected the president of Republika Srpska in 1996,
while she was still a hard-liner and a member of the ruling Serb
Democratic Party. Later, she split from the Serb hard-liners and
led the Serb entity into the economic and political reforms.
	   In the Muslim-dominated areas of Bosnia, a victory by the leader
of the current chairman of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic,
was virtually assured.

Anger, sympathy mix as Belfast Assembly debates Omagh's legacy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ In scenes of raw anger and
surprising sympathy, politicians in the new Belfast legislature
debated Tuesday what lessons they must draw from Northern Ireland's
deadliest car bombing.
	   Sam Foster of the major British Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, accused Sinn Fein leaders across the chamber of ``lying
through their teeth'' about their commitment to peace and hoped
that one day they would ``suffer the wrath of almighty God.''
	   But others, to scoffing from fellow Protestants, said they
understood the difficulties the Irish Republican Army-allied party
faces in dealing with the IRA dissidents responsible for
slaughtering 29 people one month ago in the Northern Ireland town
of Omagh.
	   Ulster Unionist member Michael McGimpsey said he expected the
IRA to disarm gradually as April's peace agreement envisions, but
that he would work with Sinn Fein toward achieving ``a situation
where we can live in peace, die in peace and rest in peace.''
	   ``I am prepared to be pragmatic, and see the difficulties that
the other side has on this matter,'' he said.
	   And John Gorman _ a World War II tank commander and one of the
Ulster Unionists' few Catholic members _ even complimented Sinn
Fein leader Gerry Adams for ``the leadership and discipline he has
exercised on Sinn Fein and its military adjunct, the IRA.''
	   Gorman appealed for Adams to get IRA members to collect the
remaining tons of Semtex plastic explosive that the outlawed group
smuggled to Ireland from Libya in the mid-1980s.
	   ``Gerry ... you brought the Semtex here. What about a big bang?
Get rid of it, as much as you can get hold of,'' Gorman said,
noting that Semtex had no ``defensive quality.'' Adams made no
reaction.
	   The Assembly debate came one year to the day after Sinn Fein was
permitted to enter multi-party negotiations following the IRA's
July 1997 truce, triggering an era of swift political change.
	   Public referendums in both parts of Ireland in May ratified the
eight-party agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed.
The election of the 108-member Assembly followed in June.
	   Assembly members are expected to approve a multi-party
administration for Northern Ireland in November _ if, crucially,
the disarmament debate can be overcome. Sinn Fein wants two posts,
but the Ulster Unionists say they'll veto Sinn Fein involvement if
the IRA doesn't start to disarm.
	   Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, the former IRA
commander assigned to work with a Canadian-led disarmament
commission on the matter, said it was ``understandable that people
have a difficulty with Sinn Fein and our assertion that we want a
fresh start.''
	   Addressing the Protestant benches, he added: ``You have a
suspicion that we're not for real. The people we represent are also
suspicious of you.''
	   A politician linked with a pro-British paramilitary group, the
Ulster Volunteer Force, sounded a note of understanding with the
leaders of Sinn Fein, whom the UVF plotted to kill before calling a
1994 truce.
	   Progressive Unionist politician David Ervine, once imprisoned
for possessing UVF weaponry, urged his fellow Protestants not to
make disarmament the issue on which peacemaking would rise or fall.
	   He noted that McGuinness, despite his clout within IRA-Sinn Fein
circles, has previously warned that he can't deliver IRA weaponry
without exacerbating the split within its ranks.
	   ``If Martin McGuinness can't deliver,'' Ervine asked, ``what
happens next?''

	   SILKEBORG, Denmark (AP) _ Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev
both scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over
Silkeborg Tuesday in a first round, first leg UEFA Cup match.
	   In the 63rd minute, Pierre Wome passed the ball to forward Totti
who shot past Danish goalie Peter Kjaer. Seven minutes later,
Roma's Russian midfielder Dmitri Alenichev zigzagged through
Silkeborg's defense before he calmly shot out of Kjaer's reach.
	   In the first half, Silkeborg pressured the Italians although
Wome had a goal disallowed. Silkeborg also had a goal, headed by
Bora Zivovic in the 83rd minute, disallowed because of a foul on
Roma's keeper.

Netanyahu urges united front against armed fundamentalist nations

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday
suggested sharing the technology of Israel's Arrow-2 missile with
other nations who are also under threat of being attacked by
fundamentalist states.
	   Citing Israel's successful test Monday of the Arrow-2
anti-missile missile, Netanyahu urged other nations to work with
the Jewish state against renegade powers developing
non-conventional weaponry.
	   ``We need all threatened nations to act against fundamentalism
together. It's cooperation that is both natural and justified and
also essential,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Netanyahu stressed that while Israel may be a more likely target
of ballistic missiles, specifically from Iran, it was the entire
world that was threatened from what he described as,
``impoverished, backward, fanatic regimes.''
	   ``This problem is not going to go away. It may even proliferate
before we can stop its expansion but we must give the peaceful
nations of the world the means to defend themselves...those means
can be made available. They require cooperation, determination, and
perseverance,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Monday that other
countries had expressed interest in joining a regional security
plan that would make use of the Arrow missile capabilities.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky, said however, that it was
too early to discuss the selling or sharing of the Arrow technology
with other countries.
	   But a senior aide to the prime minister who later spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that while Netanyahu had not thus far
explored the idea of information sharing with the U.S. or other
Western Countries, he felt that such cooperation would be
beneficial.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian opposition protesters defied a
ban and held a peaceful rally Tuesday, while the government ordered
armed opponents to turn in their weapons in an effort to squelch
new violence after two days of riots.
	   In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said the government's patience was running out and it would not
``wait endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of the
headquarters of his rival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha and his followers, and
said he was willing to consider ``in principle'' any formula for
resolving the crisis, presumably including his own resignation, as
the opposition has demanded.
	   The Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and order _ warned
Tuesday it would respond with force to any resistance from Berisha
supporters after clashes Sunday and Monday. Police were authorized
to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed, the ministry said on state
television.
	   The weekend assassination of a popular Berisha ally touched off
two days of unrest reminiscent of the nationwide anarchy that
lasted for months in 1997 and sent refugees flooding into Italy,
Greece and other European countries.
	   On Tuesday, about 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied
peacefully in the main Tirana square, despite a ban by the Interior
Ministry.
	   Many protesters flashed the two-fingered victory sign as Berisha
demanded Nano's resignation and exhorted demonstrators to remain
peaceful.
	   One tank was parked Tuesday in front of Berisha's Democratic
Party headquarters, apparently in opposition hands. About a half
dozen Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns were nearby.
	   Dozens of police cars surrounded the protesters on Skanderbeg
Square, lights flashing and sirens howling. The cars and several
police vans were filled with officers carrying submachine guns and
wearing stocking masks.
	   Sharpshooters took up positions on the roof of the nearby
Interior Ministry building.
	   U.S. and European diplomats were seeking to negotiate a peaceful
end to the crisis. Many fear the unrest could spread, further
complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned
Tuesday that the stability of the southern Balkans was at stake.
Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   Foreign ministers of Italy and Germany recommended Tuesday that
an international police force be sent to Albania and urged the
European Union to increase aid to the country.
	   The Interior Ministry also urged Berisha supporters holed up at
downtown Democratic Party headquarters to lay down their arms.
	   Berisha remained defiant, warning Interior Minister Perikli Teta
to rescind his shoot-without-warning orders or ``bear all
responsibility for the consequences.''
	   He announced a new rally for Wednesday unless Nano resigned.
	   ``Now it's up to the Albanian political parties and the Albanian
people to defend the values of democracy,'' Berisha told reporters
in his party stronghold. ``I'm sure that people don't want
violence. But a worse thing is dictatorship.''
	   President Rexhap Meidani was trying to mediate a settlement, and
government sources said he raised the possibility of Nano's
resignation during a meeting with him late Monday.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded Monday when government forces launched a counterattack and
swiftly regained control of key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Nano's office.
	   The unrest threatened a repeat of the riots that swept Albania
last year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which
cost many people their entire savings.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Interior Ministry told foreign diplomats Monday it would try to
arrest Berisha on Tuesday unless he left the country.
	   But Berisha said he would never leave Albania. Berisha was
Albania's first noncommunist leader after decades under Stalinist
Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his policies became
increasingly authoritarian.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila
have pushed to within 50 kilometers (30 miles) of the eastern city
of Goma, the base where rebels began a swift uprising against the
government seven weeks ago.
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio on Tuesday said
fighters loyal to Kabila and his allies were in control of the town
of Kibumba near Goma.
	   Goma, on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda, has served as the
headquarters for a rebel movement trying to oust Kabila since the
start of August.
	   ``The aggressors are fleeing their positions throughout the
area,'' the radio station said.
	   Government-allied troops took the town of Kibumba after an
earlier bid to drive the rebels from Goma failed.
	   After a six-hour battle for Goma on Monday, the rebels were
still apparently in control of the city on the edge of Lake Kivu.
They also still held the city's airport and radio station _ primary
targets of the government force.
	   The push on Goma comes after a remarkable month of back and
forth fighting. The insurgents battled to the edge of Kinshasa in
western Congo at the tail end of August, but were stopped on the
capital's eastern suburbs by Angolan and Zimbabwean soldiers
fighting on Kabila's behalf.
	   Leaders from southern African nations Tuesday commended Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia for sending military forces to save Kabila
from overthrow.
	   The 14-nation Southern African Development Community praised the
three countries for sending troops, tanks and warplanes to defeat
``the illegal attempt by rebels and their allies to capture the
capital city Kinshasa and other strategic areas.''
	   But efforts to find a peaceful end to the conflict failed during
the SADC annual summit held on the Indian Ocean island of
Mauritius.
	   In a rebuff to Kabila, the summit strongly called for
negotiations that will include the rebels, and for progress towards
democracy.
	   Kabila has repeatedly refused to meet face-to-face with the
rebels, insisting the movement is simply a front for a Rwandan and
Ugandan invasion of Congo.
	   ``The summit emphasized the need for all political actors in
Congo to commit themselves to orderly and peaceful transition to
multi-party democracy,'' a SADC communique said.
	   Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the rebel movement,
although it is widely believed they have sent arms and troops in
support of the insurgents.
	   Both countries helped Kabila last year during his rebel drive to
oust the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Relations between Kabila's
Congo and Rwanda and Uganda, however, have since soured over
regional and border security concerns.
	   The Congo rebels _ made up of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ have made it
clear they will not abide by any peace agreement unless they
participate in its creation.
	   The rebels say Kabila has failed to implement democratic
reforms, and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and fostering
ethnic divisions.
	   Rebels still control vast tracts of territory in eastern Congo,
along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders, although their headquarters
came under attack for the first time Monday.
	   The war's tide began to turn weeks ago and the government now
has the rebels on the defensive and battling to hold their
stronghold positions in eastern Congo.
	   At least 100 Congolese soldiers, however, have fled to nearby
Tanzania with their weapons to escape rebel forces, a newspaper in
the Tanzanian city of Dar Es Salaam reported.
	   The Congolese soldiers have been trickling into the lake port of
Kigoma, and Tanzanian authorities have not yet decided what to do
with them, Kigoma regional commissioner Ukiwaona Ditopile Mzuzuri
said by telephone.
	   The soldiers made their way across Lake Tanganyika separating
Tanzania and Congo to escape rebel attacks, he said.

Muslim radicals demonstrate against exiled author's secret return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Hundreds of Islamic radicals in
Bangladesh took to the streets Tuesday demanding death for novelist
Taslima Nasrin, who reportedly returned home after four years in
exile in Europe.
	   Nasrin fled Bangladesh in 1994 to escape death threats by
Islamic fundamentalists who accused her of blasphemy after a
newspaper quoted her as saying the Koran, the Islamic holy book,
should be rewritten.
	   Nasrin said she was misquoted, but does favor changes in the
Islamic laws to give more rights to women in Bangladesh, a Muslim
nation.
	   ``Hang the infidel to death!'' shouted more than 500 protesters
from the Islamic Constitution Movement as they marched through
central Dhaka, the capital.
	   Newspapers reported that Nasrin, 36, secretly flew into the
capital, Dhaka, on Monday from New York with her mother, who has
cancer.
	   The author's whereabouts are unknown.
	   A woman at Nasrin's Dhaka said that the author had returned
home.
	   ``Taslima's mother and father have returned from New York. But
she did not,'' said the woman in a telephone interview. The woman,
who refused to give her name, said she was a relative taking care
of the apartment.
	   Nasrin became well-known because of her novel, Lajja (Shame),
about Bangladeshi Muslims who attacked minority Hindus in
retaliation for a 1992 attack in India, in which Hindu zealots tore
down a mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya.
	   Under pressure of Islamic parties, the government of former
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, a woman, issued an arrest warrant on
charges of blasphemy. Dhaka's High Court granted Nasrin bail after
she surrendered.
	   She then went into hiding for and eventually fled to Stockholm,
Sweden.
	   Legally, Nasrin can still be tried on blasphemy charges. But no
hearing has taken place for the past two years since Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, also a woman, has taken office.

Kuwait sends 15 tons of humanitarian aid to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A cargo plane carrying 15 tons of relief
supplies for flood victims arrived Tuesday from Kuwait, the first
such aid sent by the emirate since Sudan's backing for Iraq in the
Gulf War.
	   A Kuwaiti statement said the supplies included medicines, baby
formula, tents and blankets. It noted the aid was ordered sent by
the Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, as ``part of the
Kuwaiti people's standing by the Sudanese people.''
	   Relations between the two countries were strained when Sudan
backed Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but they have been
warming of late.
	   Earlier this year, Kuwait gave permission for a Sudanese
diplomat to work in the Sudanese Embassy in Kuwait. Last month,
Kuwait restored postal services with Sudan.
	   The African country is suffering some of its worst flooding in
years along the River Nile. The floods have caused 40 billion
Sudanese pounds $19 million to homes and farms.

Indian minister defends refusal to allow dam commission to hold
</HEADLINE>
meet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A government minister in western India
said no outside agency can investigate the construction of a series
of dams on a river that has been riddled with controversy for
years.
	   The independent World Commission of Dams was hold a scheduled
hearing next week in the central Indian town of Bhopal, which may
have also focussed on the dams on the Narmada River.
	   It called off the meeting following protests by the Indian
government.
	   Environmentalists have opposed the dam, saying it will displace
hundreds of thousands of people and that cheaper techniques of
water harvesting are available.
	   In Gandhinagar, capital of Gujarat, Jaynarayan Vyas, minister
for Narmada Development and Major Irrigation Projects, said the
Sardar Sarovar Hydroelectric Dam is an internal matter of Gujarat.
	   ``No outside agency can come charging in to hold a public
hearing,'' he said in a telephone interview Monday.
	   The World Commission on Dams postponed its first hearing on
September 21-22 in Bhopal, India after officials of the Gujarat
state threatened to arrest its members, a WCD official said.
	   The commission was set up earlier this year by the World Bank
and the World Conservation Union to establish guidelines to halt
poorly conceived dam projects and support high quality ventures.
	   The Sardar Sarovar Project, being built over the Narmada River
that flows through Gujarat at its neighboring states, Madhya
Pradesh and Maharashtra, is the largest and the most expensive
multi-purpose project ever to be initiated in India.
	   It was planned to provide drinking water to 40 million people,
irrigate 4.4 million acres (1.8 million hectares) and to generate
1,450 megawatts of electricity.
	   But critics of the project say the reservoir will submerge more
than 90,000 acres (36,420 hectares) of land and displace at least
150,000 tribals.
	   Vyas called the world commission's visit to Gujarat a
``violation of diplomatic protocol.''
	   '' Can I write to the governor of Arkansas that I want to hold a
public hearing on the law and order situation there?'' he said in a
telephone interview.
	   Vyas had asked the Indian prime minister to stop the commission
from visiting Gujarat., saying the commission's visit was ``another
attempt to thwart the progress of the Narmada project.''
	   Federal officials did not comment.

Seiji Ozawa joins Rostropovich for Russian-Japanese celebration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seiji Ozawa joined up Tuesday with his ``senior
brother,'' the great Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, to kick
off a celebration of Russian-Japanese friendship.
	   The only problem, the conductor acknowledged, is that Russia and
Japan don't have much of a history as friends.
	   ``It has always been sad to think that relations between Russia
and Japan are not very close,'' Ozawa said at a news conference,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``There is much in common
in our cultures. That is why I responded to Slava's invitation.''
	   The invitation from Rostropovich, whose nickname is Slava, was
to lead the Japanese Philharmonic Orchestra in four days of
concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg. They began Tuesday night at
Moscow's Conservatory of Music.
	   ``I hope it will be a starting point for more profound relations
between our two countries,'' said Ozawa, the music director of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.
	   Relations between Russia and Japan have long been strained. The
countries have fought two wars in this century, and are still at
odds over Russia's World War II claim to the Kuril Islands off the
southern Japanese coast.
	   On the other hand, Ozawa enjoys warm relations with
Rostropovich, whom he referred to ``as my great senior brother.''
The cellist said he considers himself and Ozawa to be ``soldiers of
music.''
	   The concert series is called ``From Heart to Heart: Russia-Japan
Culture Bridge.''

Ecuador's president unveils austerity package, devalues currency

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador's president has announced a
package of emergency measures to mend the nation's tattered
economy, including a devaluation of the national currency.
	   The devaluation of the sucre, announced late Monday, comes
nearly two weeks after neighboring Colombia reduced the value of
its currency.
	   Although Ecuador has one of Latin America's smallest economies,
the measure sparked fears of additional devaluations in the region,
which has been battered by the global financial turmoil.
	   In a nationally televised address, President Jamil Mahuad, who
took power on Aug. 10, also announced an end to subsidies on
electricity and gas and promised to cut state spending.
	   ``This is the moment to act and prevent a catastrophe ... I have
to act responsibly to confront the crisis and I take full
responsibility for adopting these measures,'' he said.
	   The sucre fell by nearly 10 percent on Monday after the
government shifted the band within which the sucre is allowed to
trade downwards by 15 percent. In March, Ecuador's Central Bank had
devalued the sucre by 7.5 percent. The sucre has fallen nearly 39
percent this year. It stood at 6,139 to the dollar late Monday.
	   Mahuad said he would eliminate state subsidies on electricity,
natural gas and oil, which collectively cost Ecuador more than dlrs
313 million a year. He also said he will trim the bloated public
service rolls, improve tax collection and cut the number of
government vehicles by 30 percent.
	   He pledged to shelter Ecuador's poor from the austerity measures
and stave off social unrest by giving each poor family the
equivalent of dlrs 16.40 a month.
	   The spending reduction is aimed at reducing annual inflation
that exceeds 40 percent, one of the highest in Latin America.
	   Impoverished Ecuador has been hit hard by slumping world oil
prices and the Asian economic crisis. Asian countries are among the
main purchasers of its three principal exports _ oil, bananas and
shrimp.
	   ``Throughout 1998, Ecuador's economy has been accumulating
macroeconomic imbalances,'' said Central Bank President Luis Jacome
after the measures were announced.
	   Ecuador's exports fell sharply in the first half of 1998 and its
budget deficit has grown to dlrs 1.4 billion, or 7 percent of its
gross domestic product, the government said.

Inter Milan vs. Real Madrid; It even excites Ronaldo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Even Ronaldo is keyed up for this game.
	   It's Inter Milan vs. Real Madrid, probably the premier match of
12 Wednesday as the Champions League gets underway.
	   This is Europe's most important club competition with the
continent's best and richest team weighing in.
	   ``Certain games excite you and spice up the sport,'' said the
Brazilian superstar, who faced Real Madrid when he played in Spain
with Barcelona.
	   The 24-team field comes for 16 countries with Spain leading the
way with three teams _ Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao.
	   In the Group C matchup you have Inter Milan, the defending UEFA
Cup champions taking a step up to face Real Madrid, the winners of
this trophy last season _ a record seventh Champion Cup titles.
	   With so many teams in the field from leagues of varied strength,
not all of the first-rotation games are zingers. But several are:
	   _ Manchester United vs. Barcelona (Group D)
	   _ Croatia Zagreb vs. Ajax (Group A)
	   _ Juventus vs. Galatasaray (Group B)
	   Only the location of the Real Madrid vs. Inter games takes an
edge off. It's being played in the southern city of Seville in
66,000-seat Sanchez Pizjuan stadium, part of UEFA sanctions against
Real Madrid for crowd problems in last season's Champions Cup
semifinal in Madrid.
	   ``We're fired up for Real,'' said Inter's veteran goalkeeper
Gianluca Pagliuca. ``I have waited a long time to debut with style
in the Champions League. It's a shame the game is not in Madrid in
the legendary Bernabeu (stadium).''
	   The runners-up last year in Italy, Inter struggled with two late
goals to a 2-2 draw in last week's Italian season opener with newly
promoted Cagliari.
	   Inter's biggest problem is on defense with Taribo West and
Francesco Colonnese suspended for the game.
	   ``Real Madrid right now is playing with four strikers, all of
whom are talented,'' Inter coach Luigi Simoni said. ``We'll have to
be careful.''
	   Ronaldo, who has played just one game since his World Cup final
nightmare in July, will start up front with Ivan Zamarano and
Roberto Baggio.
	   Real Madrid is expected to have available Croatian midfielder
Robert Jarni _ injured in practice Monday _ who'll be feeding
forwards Raul Gonzalez and Predrag Mijatovic, to name just two.
Real is 2-0 in league play under new coach Guus Hiddink and still
finding its legs.
	   ``It (Inter) is one of the greatest teams in the world,'' said
Argentine midfielder Fernando Redondo. ``But like us, Inter isn't
in form yet because the season's just started.''
	   Inter is unbeaten in its last eight European cup matches and
Real Madrid has won six straight at home _ three by shutouts.
	   Manchester United and Barcelona both have injury problems. They
also are in the most difficult of the six, four-team group with
Bayern Munich and Danish side Brondby holding the other two places.
	   United is undefeated in its first four games in the English
league but this game is almost overshadowed by protests at home
against the proposed dlrs 1 billion purchase of the team by Rupert
Murdoch-owned BSkyB television.
	   Barca, with just one goal in its first two league games, enters
with injuries to at least six starting players and a terrible
record in England where it's won only once in the last 17 matches.
	   Among the injured are Albert Celades, Josep Guardiola, Emmanuel
Amunike, Winston Bogarde, Oscar Garcia, Miguel Nadal, Sergi Barjuan
and Giovanni.
	   Ajax enters its match at Croatia Zagreb without its top scorer
from last season, injured Georgian Shota. But top summer signee _
Georgian Georgi Kinkladze _ is healthy. Ajax may also see the
return of twin brothers Ronald and Frank de Boer, who have settled
a two-month dispute with the team.
	   For the Croatians, often-injured Robert Prosinecki is doubtful
with back problems. Coach Zlatko Kranjcar said the key is to be
watchful and patient.
	   ``We'll challenge them by applying pressure in their zone and
patiently wait for a chance to strike,'' he said.
	   Last but not least, Italian champions Juventus begin their quest
for a fourth straight place in the Champion Cup final, losing last
year to Real Madrid 1-0 on a goal in the 67th by Mijatovic.
	   Juventus, home to Turkish team Galatasaray, has 11 wins and one
draw in 12 homes games in this tournament. But the Italians have
injury woes with defender Mark Iuliano, Ciro Ferrara and Paolo
Montero missing. French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane suffered a
knee injury in Sunday's 4-3 win over Perugia but should play.
	   Galatasaray is healthy and challenged.
	   ``We have to beat a giant like Juventus to be included in the
big teams in Europe,'' said coach Fatih Terim.
	   In other games Wednesday:
	   Group A _ Porto (Portugal) vs. Olympiakos (Greece).
	   Group B _ Athletic Bilbao (Spain) vs. Rosenborg, Norway.
	   Group C _ Strum Graz (Austria) vs. Spartak Moscow (Russia).
	   Group D _ Brondby (Denmark) vs. Bayern Munich (Germany).
	   Group E _ Lens (France) vs. Arsenal (England); Panathinaikos
(Greece) vs. Dynamo Kiev (Ukraine).
	   Group F _ PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands) vs. HJK Helsinki
(Finland); Kaiserlautern (Germany) vs. Benfica (Portugal).

Ecuador's president unveils austerity package, devalues currency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS additional welfare expenditures in 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador's president has announced a
package of emergency measures to mend the nation's tattered
economy, including a devaluation of the national currency.
	   The devaluation of the sucre, announced late Monday, comes
nearly two weeks after neighboring Colombia reduced the value of
its currency.
	   Although Ecuador has one of Latin America's smallest economies,
the measure sparked fears of additional devaluations in the region,
which has been battered by the global financial turmoil.
	   In a nationally televised address, President Jamil Mahuad, who
took power on Aug. 10, also announced an end to subsidies on
electricity and gas and promised to cut state spending.
	   ``This is the moment to act and prevent a catastrophe ... I have
to act responsibly to confront the crisis and I take full
responsibility for adopting these measures,'' he said.
	   The sucre fell by nearly 10 percent on Monday after the
government shifted the band within which the sucre is allowed to
trade downwards by 15 percent. In March, Ecuador's Central Bank had
devalued the sucre by 7.5 percent. The sucre has fallen nearly 39
percent this year. It stood at 6,139 to the dollar late Monday.
	   Mahuad said he would eliminate state subsidies on electricity,
natural gas and oil, which collectively cost Ecuador more than dlrs
313 million a year. The welfare payments to the poor will cost dlrs
251 million.
	   He also said he will trim the bloated public service rolls,
improve tax collection and cut the number of government vehicles by
30 percent.
	   He pledged, 8th graf

Camacho named new Spanish national team coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jose Antonio Camacho was appointed Spain's
new national team coach on Tuesday, taking over a team reeling from
a first-round World Cup elimination and an embarrassing loss to
Cyprus.
	   ``I am starting from zero,'' said the 43-year-old Camacho, who
earned 81 caps for Spain. ``This is a new stage both for me and the
players.''
	   Camacho, who has coached Spanish sides RCD Espanyol and Sevilla,
replaces Javier Clemente, whose resignation last week came after
the World Cup debacle and an even more shocking 3-2 loss to Cyprus
in a European Championship qualifier on Sept. 5.
	   The Spanish federation first offered the job this past weekend
to Luis Aragones, who turned it down because he would have to work
with Clemente's support team rather than be allowed to bring in his
own.
	   Offered the same deal on Sunday, Camacho took the initiative. He
made a counterproposal to the federation and set a 24-hour deadline
for a reply.
	   Assured he would be able to pick his own staff, Camacho signed a
two-year contract reportedly worth 120 million pesetas (dlrs
816,000).
	   Already thinking about Spain's next game _ a friendly against
Russia on Sept. 23 _ Camacho said he would reveal his first lineup
on Friday.
	   As a regular for Real Madrid's first team from 1974-1989,
Camacho won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies. After
retiring as a player, he coached Espanyol and Sevilla in the
Primera Division.
	   He only lasted three weeks in his last job, resigning in July as
coach of Real Madrid in a contractual dispute. He had yet to attend
his first training session with the players.
	   ``I hope to have continuity at the national team,'' Camacho
said.

Ukrainian banks upset over government's debt conversion plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian banks criticized the government
Tuesday for ordering what they called mandatory conversion of
short-term treasury bills held by the banks into longer-term paper.
	   The order, issued last Friday, applied to all government bonds
held by Ukrainian banks, worth about 10 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.3
billion). The last of the bonds mature in August 1999 but under the
government's conversion plan, the bills can now be redeemed between
2001 and 2004.
	   ``Many banks drew funds to invest in treasury bills because they
thought such an investment was reliable and guaranteed by the
state,'' Yuliya Klymuk of Privat Bank, one of the country's
largest, told the Interfax news agency.
	   Some banks even complained that their bonds had already been
converted automatically without notification. They called the
government's decision ``unexpected'' and ``discourteous.''
	   The new conversion plan appeared after a number of banks, which
held a large portion of Ukrainian treasury bills, refused the
government's earlier proposal to voluntarily convert short-term
state debt into long-term bonds.
	   The move was one in a series of measures the government has
devised to prevent a financial crisis that started to slowly take
shape in Ukraine following the turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   Top government officials denied the banks' charges, saying the
conversion would be conducted on a voluntary basis.
	   An economic aide to President Leonid Kuchma, Valery Lytvytskiy,
said Tuesday the president has ordered the government and the
Central Bank to negotiate the debt restructuring plan with the
banks so that they would not suffer losses.
	   However, the government's de-facto default on its entire
outstanding debt held by domestic banks still leaves it with some
1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 524 million) in debt obligations to be
covered by the end of 1998, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
acknowledged.
	   Meanwhile, the cash-strapped government, facing a lack of
confidence on the part of foreign investors and unable to draw new
loans, is forced to pay off its current debt at the expense of
shrinking budget revenues. The Cabinet has been unable to meet
revenue targets because of economic stagnation and poor tax
collection.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency, under pressure from investors who
have become increasingly wary of the government's ability to pay
off its debt, has gone down sharply against the U.S. dollar since
the start of the Russian crisis. On Monday, it traded at 2.67 to
the dollar, down from 2.14 in mid-August.
	   In another sign of growing instability in the country's
financial market, the U.S. bond rating agency Moody's downgraded
Ukraine's credit rating last week, expressing fear that Ukraine may
fail to meet its debt obligations as early as next year.

Three-bank merger would create Norway's largest bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Three banks announced plans to merge Tuesday
and form Norway's largest bank.
	   The boards of directors approved the plan, official Anders
Bigseth of state-owned Postbanken told The Associated Press. Among
procedural steps that remain, the national Competition Authority
said it would review the proposal, as is required by law.
	   The labor union that represents many of the several thousand
employees at Christiana and Fokus banks expressed concern about the
possible loss of jobs.
	   Christiania is Norway's second largest bank, three times the
size of Postbanken, which is twice as large as Trondheim-based
Fokus Bank.
	   The new headquarters would be at Trondheim, Norway's third
largest city, located 550 kilometers (341 miles) north of Oslo.
	   The three banks have total assets of 300 billion kroner (46
billion dlrs) and 6,000 employees. Norway's largest bank today is
Den norske Bank.
	   The new bank would be headed by Tom Ruud, chief executive
officer at Christiana.
	   The proposed merger is consistent with a trend throughout Europe
and the United States. Last year, Finland's largest bank, Merita,
merged with Swedish Nordbanken to create MeritaNordbanken, the
second-largest bank in the Nordic region.
	   The government would have a controlling majority. In addition to
its 100 percent stake in Postbanken, it also has a 50.5 percent
ownership share of Christiania, which it bailed out in the late
1980s.

Ukrainian president to meet Yeltsin in Zavidovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Instead of welcoming Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to Ukraine, Ukrainian leader Leonid Kuchma will be
meeting him behind closed doors at a Russian presidential residence
outside Moscow, a spokesman for Kuchma said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin and Kuchma will confer at the Zavidovo residence on
Friday, said the spokesman, Oleksandr Maidannyk.
	   Separately, Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko will
be meeting with his newly appointed Russian counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov. A meeting between Kuchma and Primakov is planned for
Saturday.
	   The Yeltsin-Kuchma summit originally was scheduled to take place
in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday and Saturday. Kuchma
announced the change of plans last weekend, providing no
explanation.
	   Yeltsin has remained largely secluded during the economic and
political crisis that hit Russia in mid-August, raising fresh
concerns about his health and work ability. He also has canceled a
trip to a summit of several leaders from the former Soviet
republics in Kazakstan, citing domestic troubles.
	   Kuchma says his meeting with Yeltsin is to focus on a long-term
bilateral economic cooperation agreement the two presidents signed
earlier this year. The two also are expected to discuss the
consequences of Russia's crisis and its effect on Ukraine.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main economic partner, accounting for a
third of its exports and 40 percent of its total trade turnover.

Leader of group that attacked Israelis, U.S. diplomats dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The leader of an Arab nationalist group that
attacked Israeli and American diplomats in the mid-1980s died
Tuesday in prison, police officials said.
	   The officials said Mahmoud Noureddin Soleiman, 60, died in Torah
Prison of a brain fever caused by a severe flu. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Soleiman was serving a life sentence at hard labor for leading
Egypt's Revolution, which carried out at least four attacks between
1984 and 1987.
	   Two Israelis died in the shootings, and six Israelis and two
Americans were injured.
	   The trial of 15 members of the group _ which included the eldest
son of late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and his cousin _
started in late 1988 and lasted for 26 months.
	   The defendants were charged with murder, attempted murder and
forming a clandestine organization to kill people.
	   Nasser's son Khaled Abdel Nasser was acquitted for lack of
evidence.
	   His cousin, Dr. Gamal Shawki Abdel Nasser, received a six-month
suspended sentence for failing to report that he treated the
gunshot wound of a gunman injured by a U.S. diplomat, who returned
the attackers' fire.
	   After each attack, foreign news agencies in Cairo received
typewritten statements or telephone calls claiming responsibility
for Egypt's Revolution.
	   The statements expressed opposition to Egypt's 1979 peace treaty
with Israel, criticized the United States and professed pan-Arab
Nasserite ideology.
	   Khaled Abdel Nasser left Egypt six months before the indictment
was issued in February 1988, but he returned to join the other
defendants in the latest stages of the trial.

	   BLAZISHTE, Bulgaria (AP) _ A few chickens roam the nearly empty
streets of this once-lively mountain village. Stray dogs slink
behind deserted houses with broken windows.
	   An eerie silence hangs over Blazishte and dozens of other
virtual ghost towns in the Kardzhali region, a Turkish minority
stronghold about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Bulgaria's
capital, Sofia. Most of the ethnic Turks who have populated the
area for centuries are deserting it for Turkey, suddenly unable to
survive in one of the poorest parts of one of Europe's poorest
countries.
	   Djemine Ramadan, 88, lives alone in a dilapidated house she once
helped build, her daughter and four sons now gone. She didn't
emigrate with her children because she didn't want to leave her
home where she spent all her life.
	   Asked what she does during her lonely days, she looked down the
lifeless road and said: ``I'm waiting for somebody to come back.''
	   Bulgaria's economic misery of the 1990s makes a return to more
prosperous times unlikely any time soon.
	   Turks who once endured fierce discrimination in this Balkan
country have recovered their rights in the post-communist era. But
now they are fleeing in huge numbers due to grinding poverty that
has shut down employers, emptied villages and left many remaining
families on the verge of starvation.
	   The average income for the region is barely half the nationwide
average of dlrs 100 (leva 180,000) a month, and unemployment tops
50 percent. Without income or hope, some 200,000 people have moved
to Turkey in the last six years, legally or otherwise.
	   Turkey officially tightened visa regulations for Bulgaria's
ethnic Turks after 1990, but those who managed to arrive in Turkey
have been very well received, because of their good education and
qualifications.
	   The Turkish parliament has also passed a law facilitating the
reunion of families.
	   ``The main motive to emigrate to Turkey is the hope for a better
life,'' says Adil Naim, a municipal employee for the town of Djebel
whose parents and sister already have gone south.
	   Naim, 42, worked as a schoolteacher until last year. But his
school was closed down because there were not enough children left.
	   ``Every year schools have to be closed. There are five or six
children in a class,'' he says sadly.
	   The population of the Djebel district alone has shrunk from
32,000 in 1989, when Bulgaria dumped communism for democracy, to
less than 7,000.
	   Many have headed to cities in western Turkey, a predominantly
Muslim country. Turkish media reported that a third of the 1.5
million residents in the city of Bursa came from Bulgaria.
	   ``The Bulgarian Turks integrate easily in their new homeland.
They speak the language and have generally a better education than
the local residents,'' says Naim.
	   Despite the departures, Turks still comprise Bulgaria's biggest
minority, with roughly 10 percent of the country's 8.5 million
population, and the cash-strapped government has been criticized
for neglecting them.
	   Bulgaria, a mainly Slavic Orthodox country, suffered harsh
Turkish domination for many centuries. But it is Bulgaria's Turks
who have been the victims of oppression in recent years.
	   Under Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, ethnic Turks in Bulgaria
were forced to change their names and deprived of the rights to use
their language, religion and customs.
	   After Zhivkov opened Bulgaria's borders in the summer of 1989,
Europe saw its biggest exodus in 40 years when 320,000 Turks fled
to Turkey, itself a world crossroads for immigrants trying to make
their way to more prosperous countries in Western Europe.
	   Ethnic Turks' status and freedom improved with the collapse of
communism. Legislation was enacted restoring their names, and they
are again free to practice Islam and speak Turkish in public.
	   But Bulgaria's economic hardships have hit them worst of all.
	   ``The situation is hopeless,'' says Djebel Mayor Bahri Yumer.
``There is no government strategy for recovering this crisis-shaken
region.''
	   Tobacco growing has for decades been one of the few
opportunities to earn a living in the backward Kardzhali region.
But even that industry has broken down, due to shrunken demand for
Bulgarian-made cigarettes that were popular in the former Soviet
Union.
	   Hundreds of Djebel-area families are on the verge of starvation
because of the failure of the recently privatized tobacco company
to pay them for their crops as promised.
	   Yashar Ali, who runs a small tobacco plant outside Djebel, has
been trying to save enough money to smuggle his 6-year-old grandson
to Turkey to be reunited with his parents.
	   Smugglers charge dlrs 1,500 in U.S. bills to get a person
through the border, usually hidden in car trunks or bus luggage
compartments. Despite the whopping price and the reported deaths of
eight children on the perilous trip, they are in great demand.

Jimenez takes 10th leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAL, Andorra (AP) _ Jose Maria Jimenez of Spain won his second
leg of this year's Tour of Spain cycling race on Tuesday, taking
the 10th stage which ended in this tiny principality between Spain
and France.
	   Abraham Olano, a fellow Spaniard riding for Banesto, remained
first in the overall standings. But he showed signs of fatigue as
he fights to stay ahead of second-place Laurent Jalabert, a
Frenchman riding for ONCE-Deutsche bank. Third place is held by
Spaniard Fernando Escartin of Kelme-Costa Blanca.
	   Jimenez, who rides with Banesto, covered 199.3 kilometers (120
miles) from Vic in Barcelona province to the Andorran town of Pal
in 5 hours, 22 minutes, and 39 seconds.
	   Escartin finished 16 seconds behind him and Roberto Heras,
another Spaniard, riding for Kelme-Costa Blanca finished a minute
and 26 seconds behind Jimenez.
	   The leg was marked by a dramatic breakaway as eight riders built
up a lead of more than five minutes over the pack. But the cushion
evaporated as both sets of riders tackled two mountain passes late
in the course.
	   Tour of Spain racers had the day off on Monday. Wednesday's 11th
leg covers 186 kilometers (116 miles) from the Andorran border to
the Spanish town of Cerler and includes four mountain passes, one
at the finish line.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The mayor of Beirut on Tuesday named a
street in the capital for the son of the leader of the Hezbollah
guerrilla movement, who was killed last year in south Lebanon.
	   The street links the capital with its southern suburbs, which
are heavily populated by Shiite Muslims.
	   The announcement by Mayor Nicolas Saba came during a
commemoration marking the first anniversary of the death of Hadi
Nasrallah.
	   Nasrallah, 18, was killed in clashes with Israeli troops last
Sept. 13. He was the son of Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, leader of
Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God.
	   Hezbollah has led the fight to drive Israeli troops and their
militia allies from southern Lebanon. Israel created a self-styled
``security zone'' in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect against
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   ``This street carries the name of Hadi Hassan Nasrallah, but
also the names of all other martyrs who died fighting for the
dignity of Lebanon,'' Saba said in naming the street.
	   Nasrallah's body was returned during a swap between Israel and
Lebanon in June.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Thomas Johansson played well enough at
the U.S. Open, reaching the quarterfinals, to win the last spot on
Sweden's defending champion Davis Cup team, which hosts Spain in
less than two weeks.
	   Coach Carl-Axel Hageskog announced the team Tuesday. Jonas
Bjorkman, Magnus Larsson or Johansson will play singles, he said,
while Bjorkman and Niklas Kulti will play doubles.
	   ``Bjorkman, Larsson and Johansson have all shown excellent form
recently,'' he said. ``It will be decided by current form.''
	   The match will be played Sept. 25-27 on hard courts at a stadium
near downtown Stockholm.
	   Johansson, Bjorkman and Larsson all reached the quarterfinals of
the U.S. Open. Johansson, 23, lost to Mark Philippoussis in a
five-setter. The Australian went on to reach the finals.
	   Larsson lost to Spain's Carlos Moya, while Bjorkman was defeated
by eventual U.S. Open winner Patrick Rafter of Australia.

Police say Palestinian in attempted bombing acted alone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police said Tuesday a Palestinian
accused of an attempted bombing in Jerusalem two months ago acted
alone and not with the Islamic militant group Hamas, as they had
initially suspected.
	   Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki said that investigators had
almost finished questioning the suspect, 30-year-old Jalal Rummana,
who was severely burned July 19 when fire broke out in the van he
was driving, which contained flammable liquid and nails.
	   ``His statements confirmed that he acted alone and didn't act
with any cell,'' Yitzhaki told Israel radio.
	   Police said a major explosion was averted when passers-by put
out the fire in the van, which also contained bags of nails.
Suicide bombers sometimes use nails in their explosive mix to maim
as many people as possible.
	   At the time of the incident, Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani said Rummana had acted in concert with Hamas,
which has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994.
	   Palestinians, including the man's family, said he was
transporting fuel in connection with work for his construction
company in the West Bank. But they could not explain what he was
doing in Jerusalem that day.
	   Rummana served 20 months in an Israeli jail in the early 1990s
for membership in Hamas, but his family said he had left the group
four years ago. (lc-lk)

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Rain-swollen rivers forced the
evacuation of hundreds more people in Belgium on Tuesday, and a
woman drowned after her car skidded into a flooded ditch.
	   After two days of near-incessant rains over much of Belgium, the
skies cleared briefly Tuesday, allowing aid workers a few hours to
evacuate people to safety. More rain was expected Tuesday night.
	   In northern Belgium, a woman died when her car slid into a
roadside ditch. Relief workers were too late on the scene to save
her.
	   Around the eastern city of Liege, reservoirs in the Ardennes
hills had to release excess waters, further swelling rivers below
and flooding several villages.
	   In the north of the country, the army worked to plug several
breaches in dikes. In northeastern Sint Truiden, residents were
barred from using tap water polluted by the flooding.
	   In neighboring Netherlands, floodwaters receded Tuesday,
allowing farmers and homeowners to begin assessing the damage from
the heaviest rainfall in decades.
	   Damage to crops in the Delfland agricultural region south of The
Hague was expected to run into tens of millions of dollars
(hundreds of millions of francs).
	   Although more rain was forecast, officials in the hardest-hit
regions said they think they will be able to cope now that the
floodwaters were receding.
	   ``We are still on alert,'' said Elly Hollestelle of the
municipality of Roosendaal, close to the Belgian border. Knee-deep
water coursed through the city center Monday.
	   Crops growing in greenhouses in Delfland were extensively
damaged despite the efforts of 200 Dutch soldiers deployed to build
emergency dikes and help pump water out of flooded fields.
	   In the southern coastal region of Zeeland, flood waters left
potato and onion fields submerged and swept away at least a dozen
cattle.

 &UR; Environmentalists launch campaign for companies to adopt forestry
code &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Conference starts 0940 GMT Wednesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Promoting a message that saving the world's
forests is good for business, the World Wide Fund for Nature on
Wednesday launches a campaign to get more companies to register
under an international symbol which stipulates
environmentally-friendly practices.
	   The meeting to promote the Forest Stewardship Council, the
symbol of good practice, follows a recent stunning victory for
environmentalists in Canada where MacMillan Bloedel, a logging
company targeted by protesters for five years, announced in June it
will phase out all clear-cutting in British Columbia over five
years.
	   Earlier, several big American and European companies had
canceled or reduced orders because of MacMillan Bloedel's logging
practices, the fund said.
	   ``It is important to engage with people on an emotional level
about the (forestry) crisis,'' said World Wild Life Fund spokesman
Simon Forester. ``But at the same time you have to talk to their
pockets _ persuade businesses that it makes commercial sense as
well as being an environmental thing.''
	   Environmentalists argue that the Forest Stewardship Council,
founded in 1993 in Toronto, Canada, and with headquarters in
Oaxaca, southern Mexico, is gaining momentum after a slow start.
	   At present only 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) _ or
one percent _ of the world's depleting forests are run by companies
certificated by the council for good logging and other practices.
But the figure has doubled within the last eight months, and the
WWF's target is 25 million hectares (nearly 62 million acres) by
2001.
	   Among the delegates due to attend the London conference is the
head of AssiDoman, a giant forest company in Sweden whose entire
holdings are run under the council's guidelines which, among other
things, bar the practice of denuding an area with lean-cut logging.
	   ``As a result, we've increased our sales and attracted new
customers,'' AssiDoman President Lennart Ahlgren said in prepared
remarks released before the conference.
	   Underlining that consumer organizations, particularly big users
of paper and other wood-products, also register to buy only
products which meet environmental standards, representatives of the
New York City pension funds are registered to attend the
conference.
	   Public concern about forest loss and forest management has
overtaken recycling and use of chemicals, the World Wild Life Fund
maintains.

Police say Palestinian in attempted bombing acted alone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police said Tuesday a Palestinian
accused of an attempted bombing in Jerusalem two months ago acted
alone and not with the Islamic militant group Hamas, as they had
initially suspected.
	   Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki said that investigators had
almost finished questioning the suspect, 30-year-old Jalal Rummana,
who was severely burned July 19 when fire broke out in the van he
was driving, which contained flammable liquid and nails.
	   ``His statements confirmed that he acted alone and didn't act
with any cell,'' Yitzhaki told Israel radio.
	   Police said a major explosion was averted when passersby put out
the fire in the van, which also contained bags of nails. Suicide
bombers sometimes use nails in their explosive mix to maim as many
people as possible.
	   At the time of the incident, Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani said Rummana had acted in concert with Hamas,
which has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994.
	   Palestinians, including the man's family, said he was
transporting fuel in connection with work for his construction
company in the West Bank. But they could not explain what he was
doing in Jerusalem that day.
	   Rummana served 20 months in an Israeli jail in the early 1990s
for membership in Hamas, but his family said he had left the group
four years ago.

Israel further eases closure of West Bank, Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement another 3,000 workers to be allowed
in effective Wednesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel eased its closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, allowing 10,000 Palestinian laborers and business
people into Israel on Tuesday and promising to let in another 3,000
on Wednesday.
	   However, Israel's borders will remain sealed to most of the more
than 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, including
tens of thousands of workers with jobs in Israel.
	   Normally, about 60,000 Palestinians are allowed to enter Israel
daily, most of them for work. Closures cause enormous economic
hardship in the Palestinian areas, where unemployment is high.
	   Israel sealed off the Palestinian lands on Friday, citing
threats of terror attacks. The militant Islamic group Hamas has
threatened to avenge the deaths of two of its top members,
fugitives who were killed by Israeli troops in a raid on their
hideout on Thursday.
	   Entry of trucks carrying commercial cargo from the Palestinian
areas has resumed, but they are subject to long delays due to
security checks.
	   The 7,000 workers permitted to return to their jobs Tuesday come
under what is described as a new program to allow certain
Palestinian employees to come to work in Israel even during
security alerts.
	   Those workers must be aged 28 or over, married, and must have
worked in Israel for at least two years. Suicide bombers tend to be
young and single and have little steady employment history in
Israel.
	   Also, the selected workers' employers must be able to transport
them to and from the border checkpoints, and to accommodate them
overnight near their work site should the need arise.
	   Each employer must also appoint a security officer responsible
for bringing the workers to a safe place to protect them from
attacks by Israeli ultranationalists in the event of a Hamas
attack, said Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the government's chief
liaison on Palestinian affairs.
	   Of the additional 3,000 workers to be allowed in Thursday, 1,000
will be from the West Bank and 2,000 from the Gaza Strip. A greater
easing of the closure could come later, Dror said.

Former father-in-law of Princess Anne dies at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Maj. Peter Phillips, the former father-in-law of
Princess Anne, has died at age 78.
	   Phillips died Saturday at the Ilson House Nursing Home near
Tetbury in southwest England, a family spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   A keen horse rider, Phillips was thrust into the limelight in
1973 when his son, Mark, began a romance with Queen Elizabeth II's
only daughter.
	   Phillips was bombarded by the media for information about the
couple, and famously described his future daughter-in-law as ``a
great gel,'' or girl, shortly before the November 1973 wedding.
	   His son's marriage to the princess faltered, however, and the
couple divorced in 1992. They had two children, Peter, now 20, and
Zara, 17. The princess was remarried later that year to Capt.
Timothy Laurence.
	   Peter Phillips was born in middle England into a farming and
quarry-owning family. He served in World War II, and was awarded
the military cross for service in the Dragoon Guards in Italy.
	   After the war, Phillips ran his family's farm for about 10 years
before selling the property and moving to a 16th-century house in
Great Somerford in west England.
	   In 1957, he joined the Walls Meat Company, suppliers of sausages
to the royal family, and was purchasing director when he retired at
age 55, in 1975.
	   He suffered a stroke in 1990.
	   Phillips' funeral is scheduled for Friday in the village of
Great Somerford in western England.
	   In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Sarah
Staples.

High tech crime worries FBI chief

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Comparing modern computers to gangster
getaway cars, the director of the FBI warned Tuesday that criminals
are often as enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the possibilities
of high technology as legitimite businessmen.
	   Only they're more dangerous.
	   ``We've had cases where people using computer technology have
broken into our 911 (emergency) systems ... and have shut them down
for several hours,'' said Louis Freeh, the director of the U.S. law
enforcement agency.
	   ``This is really the beginning of what I think we will see
dramatically increase in the next few years: the use of high
technology to commit crimes,'' he told reporters.
	   Freeh visited Helsinki during a tour of European countries. He
met with Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen and officers of the National
Bureau of Investigation.
	   Along with white collar crime and violations of U.S. federal
statutes, the 11,000-agent Federal Bureau of Investigation these
days also is targeting terrorism, at home and abroad.
	   ``We've had instances in the United States where individuals
have manufactured ricin and have used varieties of anthrax,'' he
said. The illicit use of chemical or biological agents could
endanger thousands of lives, he said.
	   The growth of ``ad hoc terrorist groups'' that used the Internet
and modern telecommunications technology has made fighting crime
more difficult, he said.
	   ``Terrorism is a growing global problem ... and for that reason
international police cooperation and assistance really becomes
critical,'' Freeh said.
	   ``The use of the computer and the Internet is akin to the use in
the early 1930s of automobiles to commit crimes,'' he said. ``This
(automobiles) was a new technology that was quickly exploited by
bank robbers who found it easy to escape and elude the police by
crossing state borders.''

Russia's Central Bank chairman says he favors printing new rubles

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government showed some of its cards
Tuesday, proposing printing money to pay off back wages and
imposing some Soviet-style controls over the market _ but also
making a key appointment to enhance its reform credentials.
	   The head of the centrist Our Home Is Russia parliament faction,
Alexander Shokhin, was named deputy prime minister in charge of
financial issues. He said he expected another member of his faction
to be named to a Cabinet post later.
	   Russian liberals and media have been making doomsday predictions
that the new government, under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
will represent a retreat to Soviet-era economic policies.
	   Primakov has insisted that he is only trying to create a cabinet
that represents all the major political and economic factions,
including the Communist Party.
	   Aside from a few preliminary measures, Primakov has not
announced any economic program and appears to be seeking political
consensus rather than quick economic steps. He has asked to be
given up to a year before his policies were assessed.
	   Still, there have been indications that the government intends
to play a stronger role in the economy.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko on Tuesday called for
a return to the Soviet-era practice of requiring exporters to turn
in all of their hard-currency earnings to the government, in
exchange for rubles at a state-determined rate.
	   The measure ``is long overdue,'' Gerashchenko said. ``That
should have been done last year,'' he said.
	   New First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov _ a Communist
Party member who nevertheless has shown himself willing to work in
a reform-oriented government _ has also advocated the measure.
	   No one in the government has called for reviving Soviet-era
fundamentals such as fully nationalized industry, price controls or
ending the free flow of capital and the ruble's convertibility.
	   The Communist Party has distanced itself from the new
administration, saying it would be ``inexpedient'' to join the
cabinet. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the appointment of
Maslyukov, a former central planner, and Gerashchenko, a former
Soviet chief banker, was a Kremlin initiative, not the party's
proposal.
	   Boris Berezovsky, former deputy security chief and one of the
Russia's richest business moguls, said it was premature to predict
that the new government would adopt a leftist economic policy.
	   ``Any hasty answers to the question of whether the latest events
in Russia's political life are a red revanche are dangerous, above
all for Russia itself,'' Berezovsky said, according to Interfax.
	   President Boris Yeltsin assured his French counterpart Jacques
Chirac during a telephone conversation Tuesday that Russia ``will
not deviate from the course of economic reforms,'' Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Gerashchenko said he supported printing more money to pay off
many months' backlog of wages.
	   ``We can't do without that,'' he said.
	   However, he did not say if the increase in the money supply
would be underpinned by the Central Bank's hard currency reserves.
If the bank simply prints money that is not backed by assets, this
would erode the value of the ruble and could lead to
hyperinflation.
	   Gerashchenko, who served as the Soviet and then Russian top
banker in 1989-1994, has been broadly criticized in Russia and the
West for inflationary policies during his previous tenure.
	   But Primakov, Shokhin and other government officials insisted
that the measures would not overturn reforms and promised to walk a
tightrope between paying wages and maintaining control over the
money supply.
	   ``We will find the necessary solutions to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Primakov told reporters Tuesday. He did not
elaborate.
	   No decision on increasing the money supply will be made until
the Central Bank's new board of directors is in place, Gerashchenko
said. The board is scheduled to come up for a confirmation vote in
parliament Wednesday.
	   Plans to increase the money supply were also to have been
discussed at a meeting Tuesday between the International Monetary
Fund's top official for Russia, John Odling Smee, and Russian
government officials.
	   No details of the meeting were released, but the IMF is certain
to oppose printing money not backed by assets.
	   The IMF put together a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia in July, but the first installment was smaller than planned
and the second infusion of dlrs 4.3 billion is likely to be
delayed.
	   Russia's currency, which has been gaining strength in recent
days, was trading in a band between 7.5 and 10 to the dollar on
Tuesday.
	   Russian stock ended slightly lower in very thin trading, closing
at 62.03 points, down 2.89 percent from Monday.

Ex-Cabinet minister and Saudi associate on perjury charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Cabinet minister, Jonathan Aitken, and a
Saudi associate appeared in court Tuesday on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice in connection with a failed libel suit
against a newspaper.
	   Aitken, 56, and Said Mohammed Ayas, a former aide to the Saudi
royal family, were not asked to plead and the case was adjourned
until Oct. 19.
	   The political career of Aitken, who was a defense minister and
then treasury minister in the Conservative Party government of
ex-Prime Minister John Major, ended in public humiliation last year
when he abruptly dropped the libel suit against London's Guardian
newspaper.
	   The case centers on a mysterious weekend that Aitken spent at
the Ritz Hotel in Paris in 1993 when he was in charge of Britain's
arms deals.
	   The Guardian and Granada Television had alleged generally that
Aitken had undeclared links with Saudi arms dealers, and
specifically that the Ritz weekend was paid for by a Saudi
businessman _ and thus a breach of ethics for a government
minister.
	   Aitken testified that his wife, Lolicia, flew to Paris from
Switzerland, where she had taken their daughter Victoria to school,
and paid the Ritz bill in cash after he left.
	   The Guardian's lawyers produced airline and car rental records
showing Lolicia Aitken never went to Paris.

Ukrainian president to meet Yeltsin in Zavidovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Instead of welcoming Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to Ukraine, Ukrainian leader Leonid Kuchma will be
meeting him behind closed doors at a Russian presidential residence
outside Moscow, a spokesman for Kuchma said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin and Kuchma will confer at the Zavidovo residence on
Friday, said the spokesman, Oleksandr Maidannyk.
	   Separately, Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko will
be meeting with his newly appointed Russian counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov. A meeting between Kuchma and Primakov is planned for
Saturday.
	   The Yeltsin-Kuchma summit originally was scheduled to take place
in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Friday and Saturday. Kuchma
announced the change of plans last weekend, providing no
explanation.
	   Yeltsin has remained largely secluded during the economic and
political crisis that hit Russia in mid-August, raising fresh
concerns about his health and work ability. He also has canceled a
trip to a summit of several leaders from the former Soviet
republics in Kazakstan, citing domestic troubles.
	   Kuchma says his meeting with Yeltsin is to focus on a long-term
bilateral economic cooperation agreement the two presidents signed
earlier this year. The two also are expected to discuss the
consequences of Russia's crisis and its effect on Ukraine.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main economic partner, accounting for a
third of its exports and 40 percent of its total trade turnover.

Britain presses for flight moratorium over Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ British Defense Secretary George Robertson
on Tuesday urged all sides involved in the Cyprus dispute to
consider a moratorium of military flights over the island to avoid
tension-raising confrontations.
	   Turkish and Greek warplanes occasionally confront each other
over Cyprus, fueling tensions over Greek Cypriot plans to deploy
Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has threatened to prevent their deployment by force if
necessary, prompting Greece to warn that could mean war between the
two NATO partners.
	   ``We hope that they will look favorably to something that would
be to the advantage of everyone on the island,'' Robertson told
reporters after talks with Turkish officials.''We are willing to
help with the monitoring of that moratorium.''
	   Robertson said he would raise the issue during a visit to Athens
Wednesday.
	   Greece and Greek Cypriots have suggested they would call off the
deployment of the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles if Turkey agreed to
military reductions. Turkey has made clear however, it would will
not agree to any tradeoffs over the missiles issue.
	   The defense secretary on Tuesday also signed a deal with his
Turkish counterpart Ismet Sezgin increasing the scope of
cooperation between the two countries' defense industries.
	   Robertson made clear, however, that Turkey would be barred from
purchasing equipment that could potentially be used in its war
against Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in the southeast of
the country. Some 37,000 people have been killed in the war since
1984.
	   ``The (British) government has made it clear that it will not
sell for internal repression or external aggression,'' Robertson
said.

Ukrainian banks upset over government's debt conversion plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government-bankers' meeting, ADDS detail in 2nd
graf, trims outdated material &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian banks criticized the government
Tuesday for ordering what they called mandatory conversion of
short-term treasury bills held by the banks into longer-term paper.
	   The order, issued last Friday, applied to all government bonds
held by Ukrainian banks, worth about 10 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.3
billion). Commercial banks hold about a third of the bonds and the
rest is held by the National Bank.
	   The last of the bonds mature in August 1999 but under the
government's conversion plan, the bills can now be redeemed between
2001 and 2004.
	   ``Many banks drew funds to invest in treasury bills because they
thought such an investment was reliable and guaranteed by the
state,'' Yuliya Klymuk of Privat Bank, one of the country's
largest, told the Interfax news agency.
	   Some banks even complained that their bonds had already been
converted automatically without notification. They called the
government's decision ``unexpected'' and ``discourteous.''
	   Top government officials denied the banks' charges, saying the
conversion would be conducted on a voluntary basis.
	   Following complaints from the Ukrainian Bank Association, Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, National Bank chairman Viktor
Yushchenko and other officials met with the leading bankers Tuesday
to assure them there would be no mandatory debt restructuring.
	   The new conversion plan appeared after a number of banks, which
held a large portion of Ukrainian treasury bills, refused the
government's earlier proposal to voluntarily convert short-term
state debt into long-term bonds.
	   The move was one in a series of measures the government has
devised to prevent a financial crisis that started to slowly take
shape in Ukraine following the turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   However, even if the government defaults on its entire
outstanding debt held by domestic banks, it would still be left
with some 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 524 million) in debt obligations
to be covered by the end of 1998, Pustovoitenko acknowledged.
	   Meanwhile, the cash-strapped government, facing a lack of
confidence on the part of foreign investors and unable to draw new
loans, is forced to pay off its current debt at the expense of
shrinking budget revenues.
	   The Cabinet has been unable to meet revenue targets because of
economic stagnation and poor tax collection.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency, under pressure from investors who
have become increasingly wary of the government's ability to pay
off its debt, has gone down sharply against the U.S. dollar since
the start of the Russian crisis.
	   On Monday, it traded at 2.67 to the dollar, down from 2.14 in
mid-August.
	   In another sign of growing instability in the country's
financial market, the U.S. bond rating agency Moody's downgraded
Ukraine's credit rating last week, expressing fear that Ukraine may
fail to meet its debt obligations as early as next year.

Israel further eases closure of West Bank, Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement another 3,000 workers to be allowed
in effective Wednesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel eased its closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, allowing 10,000 Palestinian laborers and business
people into Israel on Tuesday and promising to let in another 3,000
on Wednesday.
	   However, Israel's borders will remain sealed to most of the more
than 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, including
tens of thousands of workers with jobs in Israel.
	   Normally, about 60,000 Palestinians are allowed to enter Israel
daily, most of them for work. Closures cause enormous economic
hardship in the Palestinian areas, where unemployment is high.
	   Israel sealed off the Palestinian lands on Friday, citing
threats of terror attacks. The militant Islamic group Hamas has
threatened to avenge the deaths of two of its top members,
fugitives who were killed by Israeli troops in a raid on their
hideout on Thursday.
	   The 7,000 workers permitted to return to their jobs Tuesday come
under what is described as a new program to let certain Palestinian
employees come to work in Israel even during security alerts.
	   Those workers must be aged 28 or over, married, and must have
worked in Israel for at least two years. Suicide bombers tend to be
young and single and have little steady employment history in
Israel.

Polish foreign minister arrives in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, UPDATES with Geremek-Kuchma meeting, detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek
met with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Tuesday to discuss
economic cooperation and border policies.
	   Ukraine wants a favorable climate for its citizens traveling to
Poland and is concerned that visa requirements would be toughened
if Poland is accepted into the European Union.
	   The future visa regime ``must be most favorable for Ukrainian
citizens crossing the Polish border,'' Ukraine's ambassador to
Poland, Petro Sardachuk, said Tuesday.
	   Ukraine and Poland have signed agreements on visa-free movement
and on readmission of illegal migrants. But Poland already has
restricted the entry for Russians and Belarusians out of concern
that it is becoming a transit point for illegal migration to the
West.
	   Polish officials say Warsaw will introduce visas for its eastern
neighbors if the EU demands that as a condition for Poland's
membership.
	   Geremek, who discussed the issue with Kuchma shortly after
arriving here Tuesday, promised that Poland would do everything to
maintain visa-free travel for Ukrainians, said Kuchma's spokesman
Oleksandr Maidannyk.
	   Kuchma, in turn, voiced hope that Poland's future EU membership
would not complicate relations between the two neighboring nations,
he said.
	   Maidannyk announced after the meeting that Kuchma would be
meeting with Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski at the end of
September in Crimea and again in mid-November in Warsaw, when
Poland celebrates its independence anniversary.
	   Geremek also is scheduled to hold economic talks with Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko on Wednesday.
	   Trade turnover between the two countries amounted to dlrs 1.7
billion in 1997 and grew by 12 percent in the first half of 1998
against the same period last year, according to Sardachuk. Polish
exports to Ukraine, however, account for two-thirds of that
turnover.

Tuesday in prison, police officials said.
	   The officials said Mahmoud Noureddin Soleiman, 60, died in Torah
Prison of a brain fever caused by a severe flu. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Soleiman was serving a life sentence at hard labor for leading
Egypt's Revolution, which carried out at least four attacks in
Egypt between 1984 and 1987.
	   Two Israelis died in the shootings in Egypt. The wife of an
Israeli diplomat was killed in March 1986 when the car she was
riding in was ambushed outside a trade fair in Cairo. In 1985, an
Israeli diplomat was killed on his way to work.
	   The attackers also wounded six Israelis and two American
diplomats.
	   The trial of 15 members of the group _ which included the eldest
son of late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and his cousin _
started in late 1988 and lasted for 26 months.
	   The defendants were charged with murder, attempted murder and
forming a clandestine organization to kill people.
	   Nasser's son Khaled Abdel Nasser was acquitted for lack of
evidence.
	   His cousin, Dr. Gamal Shawki Abdel Nasser, received a six-month
suspended sentence for failing to report that he treated the
gunshot wound of a gunman injured by a U.S. diplomat, who returned
the attackers' fire.
	   After each attack, foreign news agencies in Cairo received
typewritten statements or telephone calls claiming responsibility
for Egypt's Revolution.
	   The statements expressed opposition to Egypt's 1979 peace treaty
with Israel, criticized the United States and professed pan-Arab
Nasserite ideology.
	   Khaled Abdel Nasser left Egypt six months before the indictment
was issued in February 1988, but he returned to join the other
defendants in the latest stages of the trial.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A week into his latest Mideast peace mission,
American mediator Dennis Ross _ and the antagonists he is trying to
bring together _ gave little public sign Tuesday they were any
closer to an accord.
	   Instead, Israel and the Palestinians each made new complaints
about the other's intransigence.
	   ``The meetings are continuing, but until now, nothing in
particular has been reached,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
told reporters in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem
that if Arafat wants an agreement, ``he'll get one quickly.''
	   ``But he also has to understand that that agreement enables the
Palestinian Authority to fight their terrorists, not merely in
words but in deeds,'' Netanyahu added. ``This is decision time.''
	   Once such guarantees are given, a deal on a troop pullback from
the West Bank can be struck quickly, Netanyahu said.
	   How much Arafat's Palestinian Authority is doing to fight
Islamic militants has been a major point of contention. The
Palestinians signed off on an American-brokered security agreement
late last year, but Israel deemed it insufficient.
	   The Palestinians say the Israeli prime minister must commit
himself to the terms of an American-authored agreement for an
Israeli pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank if the peace
process is to move forward.
	   ``We see eye to eye with the Americans because we conform to the
American initiative,'' said Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil
Shaath. ``The question is where does Israel stand? That is the
missing link.''
	   A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Israel was not expecting a breakthrough during Ross' current
visit. His departure date has not been announced, but his talks
were likely to end before the Jewish New Year, which begins Sunday
night and continues through Tuesday.
	   Increasingly, the Palestinians were demanding that Ross publicly
blame Israel for the impasse.
	   ``By the end of Ross' trip, he must point to the party
responsible for the deadlock we reached,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   On Tuesday, Ross held talks with mid-level Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators, U.S. officials said. On Wednesday, he was to
brief Jordanian leaders in Amman and on Thursday, he was to hold
another round of talks with Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   In other developments:
	   _Israel took some steps to ease its closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, allowing 10,000 Palestinian laborers and business
people to enter Israel Tuesday and saying another 3,000 could come
in Wednesday. But most of the 60,000 Palestinians who are normally
allowed to come to jobs in Israel remain barred.
	   Israel sealed its borders pre-emptively last week after Hamas
threatened to carry out attacks in Israel in response to the
killing of two top fugitives from the Islamic militant group by
Israeli troops.
	   _In the West Bank village of Zattara, an Israeli motorist opened
fire on Palestinian teen-agers who were stoning his car, and
injured a 15-year-old boy, villagers said. The army confirmed there
was a shooting and said it was investigating the incident.

U.N. body with too much cash cuts patent fees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. agency responsible for protecting
copyrights and patents has a problem that other international
organizations would dearly like to share.
	   It has too much cash.
	   Anxious to wipe out a budget surplus of 16 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 11 million), the World Intellectual Property Organization on
Tuesday approved plans to cut the costs of registering patents by
up to 15 percent with effect from next January. The move follows a
10 percent cut last year.
	   WIPO's annual assembly also agreed to spend extra funds on new
projects like a study into the controversial issue of biotechnology
and patents, and seminars on the impact of the Internet on
copyrights.
	   Laurent Manderieux, spokesman for the agency, said WIPO was
alone among U.N. organizations in having such a budget surplus.
Most international agencies face continual financial shortfalls.
	   WIPO has been under pressure from the United States and other
Western countries to use its surplus to lower fees so that more
inventors worldwide can apply for patents. The Western group also
has been urging the agency to spend the money on improving respect
for the international patent system in developing countries.
	   The boom in registrations in patents is largely responsible for
WIPO's windfall. The number of new registrations rose 15 percent in
1997 to 54,000 _ earning WIPO about 100 million Swiss francs (dlrs
71 million).
	   For the first six months of this year, 34,000 applications were
lodged at WIPO's Geneva base _ a hefty 27 percent rise over
January-June 1997, Manderieux said.
	   Companies or individuals registering patents are covered by the
so-called International Patent Cooperation Union. This offers them
protection in the 98 signatory countries for between 20 and 30
months.
	   The cost of registering a patent varies depending on the length
of the request. Most range from 20-50 pages and cost the owner on
average 2,000 to 3,000 francs (dlrs 1,400 - dlrs 2,142) in fees.
	   With effect from next January, the initial filing fee will be
1,500 francs (dlrs 1,071), down from dlrs 1,650 francs (dlrs
1,178). Companies or people submitting the application
electronically rather than on paper will get a further discount,
said Manderieux.
	   The assembly also approved the expansion of WIPO's headquarters
to the tune of around 95 million francs (dlrs 68 million).
	   The assembly also fixed a budget of 400 million francs (dlrs 286
million) for the 1999-2000 two-year period, up from 300 million
francs (dlrs 214 million) for the current biennium.
	   WIPO groups some 170 countries. Kamil Idris of Sudan took over
as director-general late last year.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali
traded a pair of red boxing gloves for a golden dove Tuesday when
the United Nations named him its Messenger of Peace.
	   The gloves are ``a symbolism on Muhammad's part because
everything is a struggle. Hopefully you can use these,'' Ali's wife
Lonnie told Secretary-General Kofi Annan as she presented Annan
with the autographed gloves. They were contained in a clear case
inscribed ``1960 Olympic Gold Medalist'' and ``Heavy weight Boxing
Champion.''
	   Lonnie Ali acts as a spokeswoman for the once highly articulate
athlete. For more than a decade, Ali has suffered from Parkinson's
syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that has slowed his reflexes
and made it difficult for him to talk. His intellect is unaffected.
	   Ali showed his lively spirit when he lightly jabbed his right
fist toward a U.N. cameraman as he headed toward the
secretary-general's office.
	   During a brief ceremony, Annan pinned a small golden dove onto
Ali's lapel and presented him with a videotape of a speech Ali gave
at the United Nations in 1979 in which he criticized the racist
apartheid system in South Africa.
	   Annan also presented Ali with a citation noting that through
Ali's ``contributions to sports and human rights, the message of
peace, harmony and human dignity will resound through the
nations.''
	   Ali has traveled the world on humanitarian missions, most
recently to Cuba.
	   ``Muhammad and I would like to thank the secretary-general for
giving him this honor and this opportunity to serve the United
Nations in such a meaningful and effective way,'' Lonnie Ali told
Annan.
	   Annan, a slim man dwarfed by Ali, mentioned that he also boxed
when he was younger.
	   But as for a round with a man still known as ``The Greatest,''
Annan playfully replied: ``I don't want to take advantage. He's
retired. I am still in action.''

 &UR; Albanian government bans rally, calls on opponents to surrender

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Supporters of a former Albanian president
manned tanks and brandished submachine guns in front of their
headquarters Tuesday, ignoring orders to surrender their weapons or
face police attack.
	   But Prime Minister Fatos Nano warned the government will not
``wait endlessly'' for Sali Berisha's supporters to give up their
weapons following two days of rioting.
	   Berisha, however, remained defiant. His supporters held a
peaceful demonstration Tuesday despite a government ban, and the
former president called for another rally Wednesday unless Nano
steps aside in favor of a ``technical government'' and new
elections.
	   ``Now it's up to the Albanian political parties and the Albanian
people to defend the values of democracy,'' Berisha told reporters
in his party stronghold. ``I'm sure that people don't want
violence. But a worse thing is dictatorship.''
	   Berisha called himself ``a believer of peace.'' But he denounced
Nano as a ``very cruel man'' who was ``willing to plunge Albania
into bloodshed.''
	   President Rexhap Meidani was trying to mediate a settlement to
the crisis, which exploded after the weekend assassination of a
popular Berisha aide, Azem Hajdari. Government sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Meidani raised the possibility that
Nano could resign during a meeting late Monday.
	   But Nano refused as soon as Berisha remained defiant.
	   Hajdari's death, which Berisha blamed on his rival, triggered
two days of rioting in which opposition Democratic Party supporters
torched the prime minister's home, burned his office and briefly
held the government's television station and parliament building.
	   Sources at the military hospital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said 50 people had been hospitalized with wounds. The
government said Monday three Berisha supporters were killed in the
counterattack on government buildings.
	   The Interior Ministry _ responsible for law and order _ warned
Tuesday it would respond with force to any further resistance from
Berisha supporters. Police were authorized to ``shoot without
warning'' if opposed, the ministry said on state television.
	   Nevertheless, about 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied in the
main Tirana square, repeating demands for Nano to resign. The
protest ended peacefully, but tensions in the capital remained
high.
	   One tank was parked in front of Berisha's Democratic Party
headquarters Tuesday, apparently in rebel hands. About a half dozen
Berisha supporters armed with submachine guns were nearby.
	   With most strongpoints back in government hands, Nano met
Tuesday with his Cabinet to discuss further steps to restore order.
Afterward, Nano told a national television audience that the
government's patience was running out and it would not ``wait
endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of Berisha's
headquarters.
	   Nano guaranteed the safety of Berisha and his followers, and
said he was willing to consider ``in principle'' any formula for
resolving the crisis, presumably including his own resignation.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been
completed for ``an abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if
necessary.
	   Some of the dozens of shops looted Monday remained closed.
Government spokesman Ben Blushi said looters also cleaned out
Nano's villa in Tirana on Monday.
	   The chaos in one of Europe's most unstable countries has alarmed
European governments, which fear a repeat of the nationwide anarchy
that lasted for months in 1997 and sent refugees flooding into
Italy, Greece and other European countries.
	   Those riots were triggered by the collapse of pyramid investment
schemes which cost many people their life's savings. The current
unrest stems from a power struggle between two rivals and
widespread public disappointment with the government's inability to
revive the economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned
Tuesday that the stability of the southern Balkans was at stake.
Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Foreign ministers of Italy and Germany recommended Tuesday that
an international police force be sent to Albania to reinforce
Albanian security forces, stem the flow of weapons over the
Albanian border into Kosovo and the prevent refugees from coming
the other way.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his
policies became increasingly authoritarian.

OSCE sharply critical of Berisha in crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- The head of the local office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe denounced the
opposition Tuesday, describing the current unrest as an effort by
``criminal elements'' to topple the government.
	   ``We consider it a very serious attempt by criminal elements to
create maximum of chaos and anarchy involving the toppling of the
government,'' Daan Everts of Denmark told The Associated Press.
	   Everts spoke as the OSCE and Western diplomats were seeking to
mediate an end to the crisis between former President Sali Berisha
and Prime Minister Fatos Nano, which has led to two days of rioting
here.
	   Berisha blames Nano for the weekend assassination of popular
opposition politician, Azem Hajdari.
	   ``The whole idea was to try to consolidate the return of
normalcy and calm,'' Everts said. ``It's still a serious situation.
It is for us totally unintelligble how people can hang on to tanks
they steal from the state.''
	   Everts suggested that the refusal by Berisha's followers to hand
over weapons indicated ``maybe they are not totally in control of
the situation. Berisha himself should get them to give them back.''
	   He said the ``ridiculous situation with the tanks'' needs ``to
be resolved or there will be bloodshed.''
	   ``You do not demand change through violence,'' he added. ``It's
very difficult to bring parties together as long as one is ... not
cooperating. It is a stalemate as long as this issue is not
resolved.''
	   Asked if a technical government as proposed by Berisha is the
solution, Everts said ``I don't think so. A technical government
would mean a whole new government. That would be a very strange
conclusion if you put down a revolt and that is exactly what they
want.''

	   CIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees streamed into this
cramped village Tuesday, where ethnic Albanian rebels were
hunkering down to defend their last stronghold from a Serb
onslaught.
	   Late Monday and early Tuesday, Serb and Yugoslav security forces
ousted the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army from villages in western
Kosovo. According to a fighter near Cirez, four guerrillas were
killed in the action early Tuesday. No reports of Serb casualties
were immediately available.
	   Cirez is located in the Drenica region, 30 kilometers (18 miles)
west of the regional capital Pristina, where Serbs launched an
offensive against the successionist Albanians on Feb. 28. Drenica
is considered the KLA's last major holdout in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominate republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Tuesday's attacks sent hundreds of Albanian refugees fleeing
east to Cirez, where about 10,000 to 15,000 people have been taking
refuge for more than a month.
	   With foodstuffs and medical supplies running short, humanitarian
agencies are worried that the tens of thousands of people forced to
flee the fighting in Kosovo won't make it through the harsh winter.
	   Most of the refugees who arrived in Cirez have survived on a
meager diet of bread and milk from area cows for weeks. They were
met Tuesday by a humanitarian aid convoy, loaded with wheat flour,
cooking oil, beans and other non-food items.
	   But according to Anthea Webb, spokeswoman for the World Food
Programme, which helped organize the convoy, the supplies are only
enough for a couple of days.
	   About 60 people, mostly ill women carrying babies, were lined up
Tuesday afternoon outside a makeshift clinic on the single street
that forms most of Cirez.
	   ``We do all we can but people still die,'' said Osman Veligi,
one of two doctors in Cirez that together see 200 to 400 patients
per day. ``We have no way to treat injuries. All we can give is
rehydration serum for diarrhea.''
	   He said at least ten people have died in Cirez in the last week
from treatable illnesses, such as severe diarrhea and circulatory
ailments.
	   Many of the refugees feared Serb police would push through the
KLA lines in the coming days, forcing them to move on again.
	   Already, the United Nations' refugee agency estimates some
190,000 people are displaced within Kosovo itself, and more than
60,000 others have fled to neighboring Albania, or the other
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   U.S.-based aid agency, Mercy Corps International estimates the
fighting has driven a total of 400,000 refugees, or 20 per cent of
the province's 2 milion people, from their homes.
	   Officials fear a humanitarian disaster with the coming winter,
as most of the refugees are living in crude camps without shelter.
	   Since July, the Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from 40
percent, to all but a few patches, mostly in the mountains
	   ``If the police start to come, we will all go to the hills,''
said Hoti Skander, a 20-year-old student who fled nearby fighting
to Cirez. ``We just keep retreating.''
	   KLA soldiers, in groups of two or three on surrounding hills and
muddy roads, admitted they can do little if Serb security forces
advance to Cirez.
	   ``We have only Kalashnikovs and they're useless against tanks,''
said one middle-aged KLA soldier. ``We'll run but only after the
civilians are gone.''

	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The former president blamed
nano for the Saturday assassination of a popular opposition
politician, Azem Hajdari.
	   Hajdari's death set off two days of rioting in which opposition
members seized major government buildings before elite police units
recaptured them late Monday.
	   Sources at the military hospital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said 50 people had been hospitalized with wounds after
Monday's rioting. The government said Monday three Berisha
supporters were killed in the counterattack on government
buildings.
	   After Monday's chaos, the Interior Ministry _ responsible for
law and order _ warned Tuesday it would respond with force to any
further resistance from Berisha supporters. Police were authorized
to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed, the ministry said on state
television.
	   Nevertheless, about 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied in the
main Tirana square, repeating demands for Nano to resign. The
protest ended peacefully, but tensions in the capital remained
high.
	   Through the day, Berisha had remained defiant. He called for
another rally Wednesday unless Nano steps aside.
	   ``Now it's up to the Albanian political parties and the Albanian
people to defend the values of democracy,'' Berisha told reporters
in his party stronghold. ``I'm sure that people don't want
violence. But a worse thing is dictatorship.''
	   Berisha called himself ``a believer of peace.'' But he denounced
Nano as a ``very cruel man'' who was ``willing to plunge Albania
into bloodshed.''

	   With most strongpoints back in government hands, Nano met
Tuesday with his Cabinet to discuss further steps to restore order.
Afterward, Nano told a national television audience that the
government's patience was running out and it would not ``wait
endlessly for all weapons to be taken out'' of Berisha's
headquarters.
	   Nano said he was willing to consider ``in principle'' any
formula for resolving the crisis, presumably including his own
resignation, if Berisha ended his challenge in the streets.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
President Meidani had himself raised the possibility that Nano
could resign during a meeting late Monday. But Nano refused as soon
as Berisha remained defiant.
	   The chaos in one of Europe's most unstable countries has alarmed
European governments, which fear a repeat of the nationwide anarchy
that lasted for months in 1997 and sent refugees flooding into
Italy, Greece and other European countries.
	   Those riots were triggered by the collapse of pyramid investment
schemes which cost many people their life's savings. The current
unrest stems from a power struggle between two rivals and
widespread public disappointment with the government's inability to
revive the economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   The top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, warned
Tuesday that the stability of the southern Balkans was at stake.
Berisha has openly supported Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Foreign ministers of Italy and Germany recommended Tuesday that
an international police force be sent to Albania to reinforce
Albanian security forces, stem the flow of weapons over the
Albanian border into Kosovo and the prevent refugees from coming
the other way.
	   In southern Albania, police reported overnight shootouts between
gunmen and border guards at the Kakavia crossing to Greece. They
said the attackers, from the nearby Albanian city of Gjirokastra,
wounded three people.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his
policies became increasingly authoritarian.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Under strong international pressure,
followers of ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday surrendered two
of the tanks posted outside their headquarters after the government
threatened force unless the opposition gave up its weapons.
	   Following two days of rioting, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
promised to guarantee Berisha's safety and opened the door to a
political settlement of the crisis which has rocked this former
Communist capital.
	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' for
Berisha's supporters to give up their weapons. Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been completed for ``an
abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Berisha met late Tuesday with international officials, who had
blamed the opposition for trying to topple the government.
Returning from the meeting, Berisha met with his followers and
moments later the tanks were driven away from Democratic Party
headquarters and handed over to police.
	   Some of Berisha's followers could been seen unloading their
rifles but it was unclear whether they had given them up to police.
Witnesses said it appeared that some of Berisha's followers inside
the headquarters were still armed.
	   Nevertheless, the presence of the tanks had been seen as a major
stumbling blocks to efforts by President Rexhap Meidani and
international officials to mediate the crisis. Mediators hoped that
the transfer of the tanks could signal a breakthrough in easing
tensions.
	   ``It is the ridiculous situation with the tanks that needs to be
resolved or there will be bloodshed,'' Daan Everts of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation Europe told The
Associated Press earlier Tuesday. ``It is a stalemate as long as
this issue (of the tanks) is not resolved.''
	   As the tanks drove away, Berisha addressed his followers from
the balcony of his headquarters and called for another protest
rally Wednesday at the city's Skanderbeg Square.
	   ``I know that you are disappointed, but the tanks shall be taken
by the soldiers who did not kill the people yesterday and did not
use them against the crowd,'' Berisha said. ``The tanks are the
property of the national guard and the state. They were not Nano's
tanks.''
	   He said his Democratic Party did not believe ``that power can be
taken by violence and bloodshed. This kind of power is destined to
be condemned by history.''

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with new details, OSCE dismiss charges of conspiracy
and comments
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International organizers of
last weekend's Bosnian election announced Tuesday they were not
ready to release results as rival groups issued contradictory
statements claiming success.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
organized the Saturday and Sunday election, had announced it would
release initial returns Tuesday.
	   But Robert Barry, head of the office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said about 670,000 ballots of
the total 1.6 million cast must be triple-checked due to the
complicated election procedure.
	   He said no figures will be made public until the counting is
completed and results checked _ which may take several more days.
	   But some international officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the OSCE was alarmed because early results showed a
stronger-than-expected showing by radical nationalists.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1/2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, had
been a chance for voters to choose between hard-line ethnic leaders
from the war era and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace
plan that halted the fighting.
	   U.S. and international officials had spoken optimistically about
prospects for moderates among Muslim, Serb and Croat communities to
accelerate a trend away from the hard-liners which had emerged
during the previous elections.
	   Appearing before reporters, Barry dismissed suggestions that
OSCE was holding up announcing figures in order to manipulate the
outcome.
	   He said the large number of independent observers made any
manipulation ``basically impossible,'' Barry said.
	   He also said contradictory claims of victory by parties were
designed only to confuse the voters.
	   ``Partial results are not in the interest of establishing
legitimacy of the outcome of the vote,'' he said, adding that
``only a very small fraction of the ballots'' have been counted so
far.
	   The sources said it was too early to make a definitive judgment
since OSCE has not counted thousands of absentee ballots _ mostly
those of refugees voting for their pre-war hometowns. Absentee
returns could swing the election.
	   But Western diplomats, who spoke under the condition of
anonymity, said the initial results showed hard-line nationalist
parties doing better than expected.
	   Among those whose election was in doubt was the moderate
president of the Serb-run ministate, Biljana Plavsic, who is
reportedly trailing the candidate of Serb hard-line parties, Nikola
Poplasen, the sources said.
	   Plavsic was elected the president of Republika Srpska in 1996,
while she was still a hard-liner and a member of the ruling Serb
Democratic Party.
	   Later, she split from the Serb hard-liners and led the Serb
entity into the economic and political reforms. Western officials
fear Poplasen would use the considerable powers of the office to
reinforce his hard-liners.
	   But the sources said Serb hard-line candidates were faring
poorly in contests for the Bosnian Serb legislature and the joint
Bosnian parliament.
	   According to the sources, another Western favorite Kresimir
Zubak was also faring poorly. Zubak has recently split from the
Bosnian Croat hard-liners and formed a new, more moderate.
	   Initial results show the clear victory of the Croat hard-line
candidate, Ante Jelavic, which indicates that most of the Croats in
Bosnia are still controlled by the Croat hard-liners and their
protegee, Croatian president, Franjo Tudjman.
	   Yet, even Zubak said before the ballot that he would be
satisfied with anything more than 20 percent of the Bosnian Croat
votes.
	   In the Muslim-dominated areas of Bosnia, a victory by the leader
of the ruling Muslim SDA party and current chairman of the joint
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, was never doubted.
	   Yet sources said initial results show that two main Social
Democrat opposition parties are running neck-and-neck in races for
the federal parliament and some regional assemblies.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Voters cast ballots for a three-member presidency _ one from
each ethnic group _ along with a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity and region. The Serb republic also voted
for the president of their entity.

Kohl taunted and cheered on high-speed inaugural run
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRIEDER REIMOLD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl inaugurated a new
high-speed train line Tuesday connecting the German capital _
Berlin _ with his election challenger Gerhard Schroeder's home
city, Hanover.
	   The 263-kilometer (163-mile) journey at times passed through
territory hostile to the incumbent chancellor, who is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term in office in the Sept. 27 parliamentary
vote.
	   In Stendal, 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Berlin in
Brandenburg state, about a dozen people protesting labor cuts on
the German railway urged Kohl to get off the train to talk with
them.
	   ``Kohl, come out or we'll vote for the DVU,'' some yelled, using
the German initials for the extreme-right-wing German People's
Union that was voted into the state legislature in neighboring
Saxony-Anhalt.
	   Kohl did not get off the train there.
	   But he did a half-hour later in Wolfsburg, headquarters of
Volkswagen, where 1,000 cheering auto workers greeted him at the
station.
	   Kohl's campaign was boosted this weekend by a victory for his
Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union, in state elections. An
upswing has already registered in the polls.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats gained 2 points, for a 38-percent
support rating, in a poll released Tuesday by the Forsa Institute.
Front-runner Schroeder's Social Democrats lost 1 point since last
Saturday, for 41 percent support, in a poll of 1,004 citizens with
a margin of error of 3 percent.
	   On the InterCity Express inaugural run from Berlin-Hamburg, Kohl
reaffirmed controversial plans to build a magnetic train linking
Berlin and Hamburg, scheduled to open in 2006.
	   ``A magnetic levitation train soon will belong to this
network,'' Kohl said. ``We need this new means of transport to
secure our leading role in technology and transportation.''
	   The new InterCity Express route officially opens on election day
_ in less than two weeks _ and will be served by trains named for a
key conspirator in the failed 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler,
Count Claus von Stauffenburg.
	   It is considered a key step toward improving travel along the
east-west line connecting Paris in the west with Warsaw in the
east.
	   If Kohl's challenger, Lower Saxony governor Schroeder, wins the
election, he'll be able to speed home to Hanover in one hour and 43
minutes _ an hour quicker than currently possible _ after the
government resettles in Berlin in 1999.
	   During the trip, Kohl remembered the victims of the June ICE
train wreck in Eschede that killed 100 people. He also honored the
rescue workers for their response to the tragedy. ``It proved that
humanity and helpfulness are not foreign concepts in our country,''
Kohl said.

Rwanda investigation bogged down with conflicting accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers investigating France's involvement
in the 1994 Rwanda crisis complained Tuesday of being slowed by
widely conflicting testimony and said they plan to release their
report in December.
	   Originally planned for release sometime in the fall, the study
that began in March has bogged down with ``false trails'' and
``manipulation'' after 100 hours of testimony, said Deputy Paul
Quiles, the head of the panel.
	   Quiles said the report of ``several thousand pages'' will
include ``a lot of information'' on the death of Rwandan President
Juvenal Habyarimana in a plane crash near the capital Kigali on
April 6, 1994.
	   Habyarimana's plane was shot down, and speculation has varied
widely on whether fellow Hutus or ethnic Tutsis were responsible.
The crash sparked a Hutu-led genocide of an estimated 500,000
Tutsis.
	   France's longtime ties with the Hutu-led government at the time
have also been put into question.
	   Paris led the ``Operation Turquoise'' peacekeeping force with
the objective of halting the bloodshed and bringing in humanitarian
groups. But the force has been accused of protecting, and possibly
arming, the Hutus during the crisis.
	   ``I don't know if everyone is honest in this case, but you meet
people who have the desire to bring forth the truth,'' Quiles told
a news conference. ``Sometimes your head explodes. There are so
many theories that you have to start from scratch again.
	   ``On certain points,'' the Socialist ex-defense minister said,
``there are certain doubts.''
	   After testimony by politicians, military officers, human rights
activists and aid workers -- much of it behind closed doors --
Quiles said there was ``an enormous job of verification.''
	   Two members of the parliamentary panel -- Socialist Bernard
Cazeneuve and Pierre Brana -- were to travel this month to Rwanda
and other countries in central Africa's Great Lakes region.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) - Family Minister Claudia Nolte ducked
opposition barbs Tuesday, a day after she hinted Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's government would increase value-added taxes to make up for
revenues lost through a general tax reform.
	   Nolte shrugged off the critics saying the comments she made on
sales tax during an election campaign appearance Monday in Suhl in
eastern Thuringia state was an ``slip-up.''
	   She had suggested the government planned to raise value-added
taxes to make up for tax cuts for lower paid families. Such a raise
was socially justified because the better paid consume more
products, she said.
	   ``A mistake slipped in on me in the heat of the battle of a
discussion,'' Nolte said Tuesday in Bonn. She said the government
planned broad tax reforms, but no sales tax increase.
	   With parliamentary elections less than two weeks away, the
leftist opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens grabbed the
initiative, calling Nolte's about-face ``unbelievable.''
	   SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said the party rejects the
conservative's tax plans. Raising consumer taxes would choke off
the already weak domestic market, he said.
	   Greens spokesman Juergen Trittin said Nolte only expressed what
many in Kohl's conservatives faction are really thinking. For the
Christian Democrats raising value-added tax was their method to
stuff holes in the budget.
	   Even the Free Democrats, the junior coalition partners in Kohl's
government, blasted the blunder.
	   ``An increase in value-added tax would stop the economic upturn
and block the push for more jobs,'' said the party's parliamentary
faction leader Hermann Otto Solms.
	   Value-added tax in Germany is as high as 16 percent for most
products.

After 10 months, prosecutors conclude indictment in attempted
</HEADLINE>
assassination &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Ten months after they began, prosecutors
finished reading an indictment Tuesday in the trial of 15 people
accused of trying to kill Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze in
1995.
	   The trial of warlord Dzhaba Ioseliani and members of his
``Horsemen'' organization began last December, and lumbered through
much of this year with a succession of witnesses, defense
objections and legal procedures.
	   Throughout that time, prosecutors have been reading the lengthy
indictment charging the 15 men with plotting and carrying out an
Aug. 29, 1995, bomb attack against Shevardnadze, who was only
slightly injured.
	   The 15 are charged with attempted murder and attempting a state
coup. Prosecutors are seeking 15 years imprisonment for Ioseliani
and four other members of his group, and lesser terms for the
others.
	   Ioseliani is one of Georgia's most fascinating characters, a
convicted robber turned playwright and university professor who
became heavily enmeshed in Georgian politics and eventually formed
his own militia, known as the Mkhedrioni, or Horsemen.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Red Star Belgrade scored twice early
and dominated the match, only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 victory in their
UEFA Cup first-round, first-leg match Tuesday.
	   Red Star's fast winger Perica Ognjenovic, who has been courted
by several top European teams, opened the scoring in the third
minute from six meters (yards) out after a perfect back pass by
striker Goran Drulic.
	   Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th minute from nearly the same spot
after he controlled a long, looping pass by Goran Bunjevcevic and
fired the ball past Metz goalkeeper Lionel Letizi.
	   The young and inexperienced Red Star team completely dominated
for the most of the match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in
the first five rounds in the French league, virtually had no shots
at the goal until the last minute.
	   But on a fast counter-attack in the 90th, Metz striker Bruno
Rodriguez scored from some five meters (yards) when left unmarked
in front of the Red Star goal.
	   Some 45,000 fans watched the match.

Hopes all but dashed for EU-Italy accord on Malpensa airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission and Italy
failed to reach an accord Tuesday over the Italian government's
plan to expand Milan's Malpensa airport, a plan which non-Italian
airlines say discriminates against them.
	   Talks broke down after Italy failed to present satisfactory
proposals to the European Union's executive body, said Sarah
Lambert, spokeswoman for EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
The Commission says the plan as it stands violates EU fair
competition rules.
	   ``There's nothing on the table now,'' Lambert said by telephone
from Feldkirch, Austria where Kinnock attended a meeting of EU
transport ministers.
	   She said the commissioner was ``extremely disappointed'' by the
lack of new Italian plan and will recomend that 20-member
Commission reject the Italian plan in a vote Wednesday, unless he
receives a last-minute proposal.
	   Kinnock held lengthy bilateral talks with Italian Transport
Minister Claudio Burlando on the margin of the EU meeting in
Austria to try to break the deadlock.
	   Under the Italian government's plans, foreign airlines flying in
and out of Milan would be obliged to move next month from Linate
airport, just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown, to Malpensa
which is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the city center.
	   Only the Italian carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights between Rome
and Milan would be allowed to stay at Linate.
	   Nine European airlines complained have that the poor road and
rail links from Malpensa to downtown Milan would make their
passengers switch to Alitalia.
	   Over the past week Italy has floated a compromise under which
Alitalia could re-route its Milan-Rome shuttle service away from
the airline's hub at Rome's Fiumicino airport to Rome's second
airport at Ciampino.
	   The move would deny Alitalia a direct link between Milan and its
hub, but it failed to gather support and was dropped Tuesday.

Kabila's forces advance on Goma
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD rebel reaction, claims of Sudanese
involvement. Edits to conform. No pickup.
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Troops loyal to Congolese President
Laurent Kabila have pushed to within 50 kilometers (30 miles) of
the eastern city of Goma, where rebels launched their uprising in
August.
	   Goma, on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda, has served as the
headquarters for a rebel movement trying to oust Kabila for the
last seven weeks.
	   Fighters loyal to Kabila and his allies were in control of the
town of Kibumba near Goma, state-controlled Voice of the People
radio reported Tuesday.
	   ``The aggressors are fleeing their positions throughout the
area,'' the radio station said.
	   Several rebel officials in Goma, however, denied the capture of
Kibumba, saying it remained in their hands.
	   Earlier, government-allied troops failed to drive the rebels
from Goma, a city on the edge of Lake Kivu. After a six-hour battle
Monday, the rebels were still apparently in control and held the
city's airport and radio station _ primary targets of the
government force.
	   Rebel politician Lunda Bululu told reporters that the government
advance in eastern Congo was being aided by 2,000 Sudanese troops
at the town of Kindu, about 380 kilometers (235 miles) southwest of
Goma.
	   If true, the development would mark an escalation of the Congo
war which already involves forces from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
backing Kabila's government and Rwandan and Uganda allegedly behind
the rebels.
	   Uganda and Rwanda both deny involvement in the rebel movement,
although it is widely believed they have sent arms and troops in
support of the insurgents.
	   Sudan has cold relations with Uganda, which is believed to back
southern Sudanese rebels.
	   Reporters were taken Tuesday by rebel officials to see 70
prisoners, whom they identified as Congolese ethnic Mai-Mai
fighters and Rwandan Hutu militants known as the Interahamwe, being
held in a hangar at Goma's airport.
	   Lime-covered bodies of 12 people, including several women and
children, were shown to reporters by the rebels claiming the
corpses were the victims of the Interahamwe.
	   Rwanda has accused the Kabila of giving training to the
Interahamwe, who took refuge in Congo four years ago after
orchestrating the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which more than 500,000
people were killed.
	   Rebels say 300 loyalist attackers were killed in Monday's
battle, the first time their headquarters came under attack. Two
rebels were killed and 19 others injured, the rebels said.
	   Congo's rebels _ made up of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ launched their
rebellion Aug. 2. They say Kabila has failed to implement
democratic reforms, and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and
fostering ethnic divisions.
	   The push on Goma comes after a remarkable month of back and
forth fighting. The insurgents battled to the edge of Kinshasa in
the west at the end of August, but were stopped by Angolan and
Zimbabwean soldiers.
	   On Tuesday, leaders from southern African nations commended
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia for sending military forces to
``defeat the illegal attempt by rebels and their allies to capture
the capital city Kinshasa and other strategic areas.''
	   But representatives at the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community's annual summit held on the Indian Ocean
island of Mauritius devised no resolution to Congo's conflict.
	   The summit strongly urged negotiations with the rebels, who say
they will not abide by any agreement they do not negotiate, and
urged Kabila to make progress towards democracy.
	   Kabila has repeatedly refused to meet face-to-face with the
rebels, insisting the movement is simply a front for a Rwandan and
Ugandan invasion.
	   The war's tide began to turn in recent weeks and rebels are now
battling to keep their strongholds in eastern Congo.
	   At least 100 Congolese soldiers, however, have fled to nearby
Tanzania with their weapons to escape rebel forces, a newspaper in
the Tanzanian city of Dar Es Salaam reported.
	   The soldiers made their way across Lake Tanganyika separating
Tanzania and Congo to escape rebel attacks, Kigoma regional
commissioner Ukiwaona Ditopile Mzuzuri said by telephone.

South African rugby experiments with TV referee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Earlier version moved on some lines. Updates, edits, adds IRB
comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A South African Rugby Football
Union experiment using television replays to help referees making
border-line decisions could be scuttled by an international
moratorium on rule changes.
	   The SARFU revealed Tuesday it planned experimenting with a
fourth match official _ using television replays _ to assist the
on-field referee and linesmen in a provincial under-21 tournament
starting Saturday in Johannesburg.
	   The SARFU reportedly was proposing to extend the experiment, if
initially successful, into the Super 12 competition between
regional teams from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
	   But the experiment could be in jeopardy because the sport's
world governing body said it would contravene existing rules.
	   International Rugby Board general manager Hugh Penman said
Tuesday a referee relying on an extra official to rule on unseen
incidents would require an amendment to the rules, which was not a
consideration in the short term.
	   He said there was a moratorium on rule amendments until after
the Rugby World Cup in October next year and the next meeting to
discuss new laws was not expected until March 2000.
	   ``I haven't heard anything about it. As far as I'm aware, the
IRB has never officially discussed the prospect of referees using
television replays,'' he said Tuesday.
	   ``Like many things in rugby, there has been unofficial talk
about it _ but we normally would get wind of something like this if
it were being tested.''
	   The SARFU's chief referee, Freek Burger, said the decision to
implement a pilot project in South Africa was made at a conference
of rugby broadcasters from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.
	   Burger, who will referee the first game using the technology,
said using television replays could eliminate many of the
controversial close decisions in the sport.
	   ``Having followed the debate on the issue for some time, I began
looking at footage from matches in which there had been some very
close decisions,'' he said.
	   ``I was amazed at how many (controversial decisions) there were
and also how many could have been avoided with the use of
television.''
	   At first the television cameras will be placed to focus on
goal-area action, such as the scoring of tries, as well as
touchline and corner post decisions.
	   South Africa pioneered the ``third umpire'' in cricket, and
television replays are now used widely in international matches to
decide on borderline run-outs and stumpings in test matches and
limited-overs internationals.
	   However, the use of the technology has attracted criticism and
in August the International Cricket Council ruled that it was not
yet ready to extend its role in the sport.

Seven police killed in violence along Georgian-Abkhazian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire Tuesday on a police
post along the border between Georgia and the breakaway region of
Abkhazia, killing seven Abkhazian police officers and wounding
five, authorities said.
	   The shootings occurred near the village of Tagiloni in the Gali
district, according to Temur Khevsuriani, security minister of the
Abkhazian government in exile. The identity of the gunmen and their
motive was not immediately known.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence still breaks out sporadically despite the presence of
Russian peacekeepers in the region.
	   Last month, a 21-year-old woman and a 16-month-old baby were
killed when a bomb exploded near the border, and there have been
other recent incidents in the region.

Human rights groups charge Palestinians being pushed out of
</HEADLINE>
Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli human rights groups charged Tuesday
that Israel was aggressively moving ahead with quiet policies to
push out hundreds of Palestinians from traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem.
	   In a joint report released at a news conference, the groups _
Betselem and Hamoked _ said the number of Palestinians turned down
for residency status and denied social and health benefits is on
the rise.
	   In 1997, 606 Palestinians lost residency benefits and, in the
first three months of 1998, 187 Palestinians also lost permits.
Five years ago, the numbers of lost permits totaled 58.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed the area, encouraging Jews to move into
Palestinian neighborhoods there. At the same time, Israel revoked
the rights of Palestinians to retain Jerusalem residency permits
for a host of reasons, including marriage to Palestinians from the
West Bank or living abroad for seven years or more.
	   Eitan Felner, executive director of Betselem, called the
residency revocations a ``quiet deportation.''
	   ``This policy has one sole objective: to reduce the number of
Palestinians residing in the city and preserving a conclusive
Jewish majority so it will be impossible to question Israel's
sovereignty over all parts of the city,'' Felner told reporters
Tuesday.
	   Without the Israeli-issued residency permits, Palestinians loose
their rights to social and health care benefits and their rights to
travel freely throughout Israel, the West Bank and abroad.
	   Mouna Taraura, a Palestinian mother of four whose family has
been in Jerusalem for generations, was one of hundreds of
Palestinians whose cases have been documented by the human rights
groups over the past year.
	   She said that when she applied for health benefits for her
children last year, she received a letter from a government agency
turning her down and claiming that she was no longer a resident of
the city.
	   The letter from the National Insurance Institute did not give
any explanation for its decision but it could be because Taraura's
husband is a native of the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Without a renewal of her residency card, Taraura has been cut
off from health coverage she used to help pay for her kidney
treatments and free education for her children. Still, like
thousands of Palestinians thought to be living in the city
illegally, Taraura said she would rather stay near her family than
leave.
	   ``I can't leave Jerusalem. I was born here. It is my country and
I can't just leave it,'' she said.
	   Eliahu Abrams, legal advisor for HaMoked, one of the report's
sponsors, said the number of residency revocations in recent years
has increased dramatically. Between 1987-1994, less than 50
Palestinians lost their permits each year. But since 1995, the
number has shot-up into the hundreds.
	   Moshe Mosko, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry disputed the
validity of the report's figures, but declined to provide other
numbers. The ministry has stressed in the past that Israel's
Supreme Court had upheld the residency policy, and that the issue
has come to the fore recently because Palestinians who had been
living overseas have been returning in the wake of the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreements.

Calls for Manchester United ban in television talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United should be banned from talks over
Premier League broadcasting rights if the 623-million-pound (dlrs 1
billion) takeover by satellite broadcaster BSkyB goes ahead, a
rival club chairman said Tuesday.
	   BSkyB paid 734-million-pounds (dlrs 1.23 billion) to secure the
television rights to the Premier League until 2001.
	   Rupert Murdoch is the majority shareholder in BSkyB and fans
opposed to the takeover deal say the media tycoon only wants to buy
Britain's biggest club to ensure his grip on television rights.
	   Chelsea chairman Ken Bates said Manchester United officials
would ``quite simply... have to leave the room while details of any
deal with television were discussed.''
	   ``The same would apply to any other club involved with a
television company,'' he said referring to the 275-million-pound
(dlrs 462 million) bid for Arsenal by the Carlton communications
company.
	   ``There would be a clear conflict of interest and the contract
could not be debated or discussed in their presence,'' he was
quoted saying in the Evening Standard newspaper.
	   Meanwhile, the Independent Manchester United Supporters'
Association predicted a turnout of thousands of angry fans against
the BSkyb takeover at a rally in Manchester Tuesday.

Refugees report killing frenzy by Taliban troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Refugees fleeing the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif have told U.N. officials of a ``killing frenzy''
by the Taliban following the religious militia's capture of the
city, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
	   Officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
interviewed refugees who fled across the mountains to Pakistan and
reported ``indiscriminate killings,'' by Taliban troops,
particularly of members of the Hazara ethnic minority, a U.N.
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the eyewitness accounts
corroborated reports about mass killings that followed the
Taliban's seizure of the city from opposition forces on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban has acknowledged that unidentified soldiers acting
on their own killed nine Iranian diplomats during the takeover _
slayings that have prompted threats of military retaliation from
Tehran.
	   But the Taliban has denied allegations from the anti-Taliban
alliance and media in Iran, which is believed to back the alliance,
that Taliban fighters killed hundreds of people belonging to ethnic
minority groups.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked the three governments
that recognize Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to intercede and
persuade the Taliban to respect the rights of all people in
Afghanistan, Eckhard said.
	   The three _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
_ agreed to do so during a meeting Monday with Annan, he said.
	   The Taliban, meanwhile, has asked the United Nations to send a
humanitarian mission into Bamiyan province, west of Kabul, where
the Taliban is reporting massive territorial gains.
	   Central Bamiyan is dominated by Shiite Muslims. The Taliban are
rigidly fundamentalist Sunni Muslims. Iran, a largely Shiite
nation, is reporting atrocities by the Taliban in Bamiyan.
	   The United Nations was considering such a mission but was
waiting for security assurances from the Taliban. The Taliban
representative in New York was meeting with U.N. officials later
Tuesday to discuss the security guarantees, officials said.
	   The United Nations, while condemning the deaths of the Iranians,
was eager to send a mission there because they no longer have
non-Afghan staff working in the country, a U.N. official said.
	   The Security Council was briefed on the situation Tuesday by
Alvaro de Soto, assistant secretary-general, and was preparing a
response. De Soto called on the Taliban to investigate the killings
and to account for those Iranians still missing.
	   The UNHCR says many civilians were killed in the first few days
of the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif. Several thousand people have
fled the city, the official said.
	   ``All accounts that UNHCR has heard so far appear to confirm
there was specific targeting of the Hazara ethnic minority,'' the
official said.

In land of real-life roulette, new West Bank casino's a gamble
</HEADLINE>

opening

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank _ Look out, Vegas _ another desert town is
elbowing its way into the gambling racket.
	   The drls 50 million Oasis casino, a glass-and-glitz emporium set
incongruously amid the arid moonscape of the Judean desert, opened
its doors Tuesday to a limited selection of VIPs, and made ready
for a larger gambling public to descend.
	   While visitors to the U.S. gambling icon of Las Vegas encounter
a wacky wonderland of fake volcanos, pretend sea battles and mock
knights jousting on horseback, patrons at this Palestinian enclave
have plenty of real-world drama right at their doorstep.
	   The casino, on the outskirts of the biblical town of Jericho, is
just across the street from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a
shantytown of dirt roads, water shortages and frequent power
outages.
	   Security at the casino is tight. Before bettors can roll the
dice or play a hand of blackjack, they face searches and metal
detectors.
	   Already, Islamic fundamentalists are railing against the casino
as a den of iniquity. The militant Islamic group Hamas stopped
short of direct threats, but made clear its displeasure.
	   ``This is a indicator of corruption,'' the group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Tuesday in the Gaza Strip. ``In
the name of Hamas we condemn this project ... We are studying the
steps we shall take.''
	   The gala opening comes at a tense time. Hamas has threatened new
attacks against Israeli targets following last week's killing of
two of its top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   The casino, only a half-hour from Jerusalem, hopes to attract
foreign tourists and Israelis, while Palestinians are being barred
at the request of the Palestinian Authority.
	   A little of the hoped-for grand-opening glitz was missing.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to have attended the casino
opening, canceled at the last minute.
	   Yasser Arafat's cash-strapped government hopes the casino will
prove itself a jackpot in the form of gaming taxes. But many
Jericho residents fear that little of the wealth generated by the
casino will trickle down.
	   The Austrian operators of the ``Oasis'' say the casino is only
the start of what will become the largest resort in the Middle
East, with three luxury hotels, golf courses and convention
facilities planned _ along with 5,000 high-paying jobs for
Palestinians.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria has a 15
percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union Bank.
The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and Austrian
investors, whose names were not released.

Contents of historic Welsh mansion go up for sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LLANDYBIE, Wales (AP) _ The contents of an 800-year-old Welsh
mansion, ancestral home of the Stepney-Gulston family, fetched more
than 700,000 pounds (dlrs 1.2 million) at a Sotheby's auction on
Tuesday.
	   Antique collectors from all over Europe flocked to Derwydd
Mansion in southwest Wales for a chance at the home's 450 items of
furniture, fine art and curios.
	   Joy Stepney-Gulston, 73, whose husband Ralph died in March,
decided to sell the 42-room stone home and its contents because
there is no one left to inherit the property.
	   ``Derwydd had one of the last great collections left in south
Wales,'' said James Miller, deputy chairman of Sotheby's UK, who
characterized this as one of the most important house content sales
in the past 50 years.
	   A 174-piece dinner service, made in the 1740s, fetched 85,000
pounds (dlrs. 143,000).
	   An ebony and ivory inlaid cabinet that belonged to Marie
Antoinette and was given by one of her ladies-in-waiting to Eliza
Gulston-Stepney after the queen was guillotined in 1793 sold for
5,500 pounds (dlrs 9,200).
	   The house, gardens, farm, farmland and cottages _ 239 acres in
all _ are on the market at a starting price of dlrs. 880,000.

British trade secretary urges South Africa to clean up crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ British Trade and Industry
Secretary Pete Mandelson on Tuesday said South Africa's high crime
rate had not yet deterred British investors.
	   But he warned the luncheon meeting of business leaders in
Johannesburg that the country must tackle the problem.
	   ``We know the commitment with which the Government and the
business community are tackling it,'' Mandelson said.
	   He said he hoped his visit to South Africa _ his first overseas
trip since his appointment in July _ would stimulate more British
investment in the country.
	   He called for an alliance between the government and the private
sector to spur economic development and social justice.
	   ``The New South Africa is seen around the world as a shining
example of an emerging front rank market economy which is coming to
terms with the huge opportunities as well as the harsh realities of
the global economy,'' Mandelson said.
	   England is South Africa's largest trading partner and largest
overseas investor.

Bulgaria's Soccer Union banned from running national league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A government committee on sports Tuesday
banned Bulgaria's Soccer Union from running the national
championship because it failed to react to a positive doping test
of a local player.
	   The government's Committee on Youth, Physical Training and
Sports, which is empowered to license sports organizations and
teams, said it was revoking the license of the Bulgarian Soccer
Union and gave it to the Professional Soccer League.
	   The Committee said the Union broke international and Bulgarian
regulations by allowing Ilya Gruev to be included in the national
team although he had tested positive for performance-enhancing
drugs in April. Gruev plays for Neftochimik in the Black Sea city
of Burgas.
	   It also said the Union let 10 professional and more than 20
amateur teams play in the national championship without having the
necessary legal registration.
	   Ivan Vutsov, a Union official, told state television the Union
has filed an appeal in Gruev's case and licensing of teams was
underway but took a lot of time because of slow legal procedures.
	   The Union is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has drawn mounting public
criticism because of Bulgaria's poor performance in World Cup
finals in France this summer.
	   The Professional Soccer League, an association of Bulgaria's
professional teams, is part of the Soccer Union, which also
includes amateur clubs. So far the League has been in charge only
of the National Cup tournament.

Bulgaria calls on Albanians to stop violence; foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
suspends visit
 &UR; With BC-Albania-Unrest

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's prime minister warned Tuesday
that continued violence in Albania could result in civil war,
threatening regional stability.
	   ``All parties (in Albania) should refrain from using force,
otherwise an Albanian civil war _ in which nobody in Albania or the
region has any interest _ will erupt,'' Prime Minister Ivan Kostov
told the state news agency BTA.
	   Also Tuesday, Bulgarian Foreign minister Nadezhda Mihailova
indefinitely postponed a previously scheduled visit to Albania's
capital Tirana and condemned the violence there.
	   ``We are particularly worried by the situation in Albania and
categorically condemn the killing of the opposition leader Azem
Hadjari,'' Mihailova told BTA. ``We hope that the government will
take measures to find and punish the killers and the masterminds of
this crime.''
	   Hajdari, an aide of Albanian opposition leader Sali Berisha, was
assassinated over the weekend, triggering two days of rioting. The
opposition is demanding Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano resign.
	   Mihailova called on political parties in Albania ``to refrain
from violence ... and find a political solution to the crisis which
may endanger the whole region.''
	   Kosotov reiterated international observers' fears that unrest in
Albania could acerbate tensions in the neighboring southern Serb
province of Kosovo, where the predominate Albanian population wants
independence.
	   ``The crisis in Albania limits the opportunities for peace in
Kosovo,'' he said.

Broadcasting Corp. Philharmonic Orchestra and local singers and
dancers will entertain the guests with waltzes and Irish jigs.

Five nations sending business groups to Cuba this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Business groups from five nations will visit Cuba
this month to explore trade and investment opportunities on the
Caribbean island, the Cuban chamber of commerce said Tuesday.
	   Canada, Germany, Guatemala, Spain, Jamaica and the Czech
Republic each will send delegations to the communist nation, the
Prensa Latina news agency reported.
	   Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department rejected a U.S.
entrepreneur's bid to take American business executives on an
overnight visit to the island.
	   Though the 36-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba does not
prohibit visits outright, the Treasury Department said the trip led
by Washington-based Alamar Associates would be inconsistent with
current U.S. policy.
	   Cuba's National Assembly leader Ricardo Alarcon, who met the
Alamar group in Cancun, Mexico, last week, said Monday it is the
United States that is being isolated by its trade policy, not Cuba.
	   He called Washington's policy a ``failure,'' and said he came
away from the Cancun meeting with the belief that most U.S.
citizens wish to end the blockade, Prensa Latina said.
	   The U.S. Helms-Burton law, designed to punish foreign businesses
which trade with Cuba, has met widespread criticism. This month,
the 14-member Rio Group of Latin American nations attacked it as an
example of one nation trying to impose its laws outside of its
territory.

 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with Berisha followers surrendering
tanks, and comments &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo TIR101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Under strong international pressure,
followers of ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday surrendered two
of the tanks posted outside their headquarters after the government
threatened force unless the opposition gave up its weapons.
	   Following two days of rioting, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
promised to guarantee Berisha's safety and opened the door to a
political settlement of the crisis which has rocked this former
Communist capital.
	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' for
Berisha's supporters to give up their weapons. Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been completed for ``an
abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Berisha met late Tuesday with international officials, who had
blamed the opposition for trying to topple the government.
Returning from the meeting, Berisha met with his followers and
moments later the tanks were driven away from Democratic Party
headquarters and handed over to police.
	   Some of Berisha's followers could be seen unloading their rifles
but it was unclear whether they had given them up to police.
Witnesses said it appeared that some of Berisha's followers inside
the headquarters were still armed.
	   The weekend assassination of a popular Berisha ally touched off
two days of unrest reminiscent of the nationwide anarchy that
lasted for months in 1997 and sent refugees flooding into Italy,
Greece and other European countries.
	   Last year's riots were triggered by the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes which cost many people their life's savings. The
current unrest stems from a power struggle between two rivals and
widespread public disappointment with the government's inability to
revive the economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   Police said at least three Berisha supporters were killed and 14
wounded Monday when government forces launched a counterattack and
swiftly regained control of key facilities: Parliament, the state
television and radio building and Nano's office. Sources at the
military hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 50
people were injured.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   The presence of the tanks had been seen as a major stumbling
blocks to efforts by President Rexhap Meidani and international
officials to mediate the crisis. Mediators hoped that the transfer
of the tanks could signal a breakthrough in easing tensions.
	   As the tanks drove away Tuesday, Berisha addressed his followers
from the balcony of his headquarters and called for another protest
rally Wednesday at the city's Skanderbeg Square if Nano does not
resign.
	   He said his Democratic Party did not believe ``that power can be
taken by violence and bloodshed. This kind of power is destined to
be condemned by history.''
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The former president blamed
Nano for the Saturday assassination of a popular opposition
politician, Azem Hajdari.
	   After Monday's chaos, the Interior Ministry _ responsible for
law and order _ warned Tuesday it would respond with force to any
further resistance from Berisha supporters. Police were authorized
to ``shoot without warning'' if opposed, the ministry said on state
television.
	   Nevertheless, about 3,000 of Berisha's supporters rallied in the
main Tirana square, repeating demands for Nano to resign. The
protest ended peacefully, but tensions in the capital remained
high.
	   Berisha called himself ``a believer of peace.'' But he denounced
Nano as a ``very cruel man'' who was ``willing to plunge Albania
into bloodshed.''
	   Nano said he was willing to consider ``in principle'' any
formula for resolving the crisis, presumably including his own
resignation, if Berisha ended his challenge in the streets.
	   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
President Meidani had himself raised the possibility that Nano
could resign during a meeting late Monday. But Nano refused as soon
as Berisha remained defiant.
	   Foreign ministers of Italy and Germany recommended Tuesday that
an international police force be sent to Albania to reinforce
Albanian security forces, stem the flow of weapons over the
Albanian border into Kosovo and the prevent refugees from coming
the other way.
	   Berisha was Albania's first non-Communist leader after decades
under Stalinist Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, but his
policies became increasingly authoritarian.

Fragments of rocket found after failure with 12 U.S. satellites

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fragments of an Ukrainian rocket booster were
found Tuesday in a remote stretch of southern Siberia, five days
after it misfired while carrying 12 U.S. commercial satellites
aloft, a news agency reported.
	   Authorities in the Altai republic, about 3000 kilometers (1,850
miles) east of Moscow, said the fragments were found at the
junction of three Russian republics _ Altai, Tuva and Khakassiya,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Search teams had been looking for four days for some trace of
the Zenit-2 booster, which was launched by Russia's space agency
last Thursday from the Baikonur cosmodrome, which Russia rents in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   The rocket's control system failed in its fifth minute of
flight, shutting down the engines. The Ukrainian manufacturer
acknowledged it might be responsible, saying it was probably a
computer malfunction.
	   Fragments of both the rocket and the 12 Globalstar satellites
were believed to have fallen to Earth. The report about the
fragments did not say whether parts of the satellites were found as
well.
	   The satellites were built by Space Systems Loral, a subsidiary
of Loral Space and Communications Ltd. of New York. They were going
to be used as part of a $2.6 billion global hand-held mobile
satellite phone system, company spokesman David Benton said after
the crash.

Liverpool bash planned for ``Titanic'' release

	   LONDON (AP) _ An elegant ``Titanic'' ball is being planned for
next month in Liverpool, the city of the doomed liner's registry,
to celebrate the British release of the film on video.
	   Guests will be encouraged to wear Edwardian costumes for the
Titanic Ball at St. George's Hall on Oct. 10. The British
Broadcasting Corp. Philharmonic Orchestra and local singers and
dancers will entertain the guests with waltzes and Irish jigs.
	   The ``Titanic'' video is expected to break sales records in
Britain after American fans fought in store aisles to get their
hands on the first copies of James Cameron's epic, the biggest
grossing film ever made. The British launch is Oct. 19.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Under strong international pressure,
followers of ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday surrendered the
two tanks posted outside their headquarters after the government
threatened force unless the opposition gave up its weapons.
	   Following two days of rioting, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
promised to guarantee Berisha's safety and opened the door to a
political settlement of the crisis which has rocked this former
Communist capital.
	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' for
Berisha's supporters to give up their weapons. Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been completed for ``an
abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Late Tuesday, the government declared the unrest an ``attempted
coup'' and ordered a criminal investigation against Berisha and his
followers which could lead to an indictment.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A week into his latest Mideast peace mission,
American mediator Dennis Ross _ and the antagonists he is trying to
bring together _ gave little public sign Tuesday they were any
closer to an accord.
	   Instead, Israel and the Palestinians each made new complaints
about the other's intransigence.
	   ``The meetings are continuing, but until now, nothing in
particular has been reached,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
told reporters in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem
that if Arafat wants an agreement, ``he'll get one quickly.''
	   ``But he also has to understand that that agreement enables the
Palestinian Authority to fight their terrorists, not merely in
words but in deeds,'' Netanyahu added. ``This is decision time.''
	   Once such guarantees are given, a deal on a troop pullback from
the West Bank can be struck quickly, Netanyahu said.
	   How much Arafat's Palestinian Authority is doing to fight
Islamic militants has been a major point of contention. The
Palestinians signed off on an American-brokered security agreement
late last year, but Israel deemed it insufficient.
	   The Palestinians say the Israeli prime minister must commit
himself to the terms of an American-authored agreement for an
Israeli pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank if the peace
process is to move forward.
	   ``We see eye to eye with the Americans because we conform to the
American initiative,'' said Palestinian Cabinet minister Nabil
Shaath. ``The question is where does Israel stand? That is the
missing link.''
	   A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Israel was not expecting a breakthrough during Ross' current
visit. His departure date has not been announced, but his talks
were likely to end before the Jewish New Year, which begins Sunday
night and continues through Tuesday.
	   Increasingly, the Palestinians were demanding that Ross publicly
blame Israel for the impasse.
	   ``By the end of Ross' trip, he must point to the party
responsible for the deadlock we reached,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   On Tuesday, Ross held talks with mid-level Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators, U.S. officials said. On Wednesday, he was to
brief Jordanian leaders in Amman and on Thursday, he was to hold
another round of talks with Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   In other developments:
	   _Israel took some steps to ease its closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, allowing 10,000 Palestinian laborers and business
people to enter Israel Tuesday and saying another 3,000 could come
in Wednesday. But most of the 60,000 Palestinians who are normally
allowed to come to jobs in Israel remain barred.
	   Israel sealed its borders pre-emptively last week after Hamas
threatened to carry out attacks in Israel in response to the
killing of two top fugitives from the Islamic militant group by
Israeli troops.
	   _In the West Bank village of Zattara, an Israeli motorist opened
fire on Palestinian teen-agers who were stoning his car, and
injured a 15-year-old boy, villagers said. The army confirmed there
was a shooting and said it was investigating the incident.

	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' for
Berisha's supporters to give up their weapons. Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been completed for ``an
abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Late Tuesday, the government declared the unrest an ``attempted
coup'' and ordered a criminal investigation against Berisha and his
followers which could lead to an indictment.

Time running out for over 60,000 undocumented immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moving a step closer to expulsions, the government
on Tuesday night closed the door to further appeals by more than
60,000 illegal immigrants for residency papers.
	   Meanwhile, about 20 undocumented immigrants maintained a
two-week-old hunger strike in Creteil Cathedral outside Paris.
	   Immigrants and their supporters have staged marches, hunger
strikes, church sit-ins and other protests to press the leftist
government to ``regularize'' all immigrants.
	   But after legalizing 76,000 immigrants, the government has
rejected residency requests by more than 64,000 illegal immigrants
and gave them only until Tuesday night to appeal.
	   Officials say they want to wrap up the immigration question by
the end of the year.
	   The Movement Against Racism and Friendship Between Peoples,
MRAP, made a new appeal Tuesday to the government ``to intervene
quickly with a solution with common sense and humanity.''
	   But Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, halting the
expulsion charter flights by the conservative government before
him, has refused to grant blanket permission for all immigrants to
remain in France.
	   Officials have been vague about how they plan to deal with
remaining illegal immigrants, a sensitive issue in France with
immigrants mainly from Africa and North Africa. They insist there
will be no large-scale roundups.
	   Some leftists have criticized Jospin as being too tough on
immigration, while the far-right National Front has criticized
Jospin as being too soft. The Front blames immigrants for high
crime and unemployment.

Jimenez takes 10th leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAL, Andorra (AP) _ Jose Maria Jimenez of Spain won his second
leg of this year's Tour of Spain cycling race on Tuesday, taking
the 10th stage which ended in this tiny principality between Spain
and France.
	   Abraham Olano, a fellow Spaniard riding for Banesto, remained
first in the overall standings. But he showed signs of fatigue as
he fought to stay ahead of second-place Laurent Jalabert, a
Frenchman riding for ONCE-Deutsche bank. Third place is held by
Spaniard Fernando Escartin of Kelme-Costa Blanca.
	   Jimenez, who rides with Banesto, covered 199.3 kilometers (120
miles) from Vic in Barcelona province to the Andorran town of Pal
in 5 hours, 22 minutes, and 39 seconds.
	   Escartin finished 16 seconds behind him and Roberto Heras,
another Spaniard riding for Kelme-Costa Blanca, finished a minute
and 26 seconds behind Jimenez.
	   The leg was marked by a dramatic breakaway as eight riders built
up a lead of more than five minutes over the pack. But the cushion
evaporated as the riders tackled two mountain passes late in the
course.
	   Tour of Spain racers had the day off on Monday. Wednesday's 11th
leg covers 186 kilometers (116 miles) from the Andorran border to
the Spanish town of Cerler and includes four mountain passes, one
at the finish line.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ Look out, Vegas _ another desert town
is elbowing its way into the gambling racket.
	   The dlrs 50 million Oasis casino, a glass-and-glitz emporium set
incongruously amid the arid moonscape of the Judean desert, opened
its doors Tuesday to a limited selection of VIPs, and made ready
for a larger gambling public to descend.
	   While visitors to the U.S. gambling icon of Las Vegas encounter
a wacky wonderland of fake volcanos, pretend sea battles and mock
knights jousting on horseback, patrons at this Palestinian enclave
have plenty of real-world drama right at their doorstep.
	   The casino, on the outskirts of the biblical town of Jericho, is
just across the street from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a
shantytown of dirt roads, water shortages and frequent power
outages.
	   Security at the casino is tight. Before bettors can roll the
dice or play a hand of blackjack, they face searches and metal
detectors.
	   Already, Islamic fundamentalists are railing against the casino
as a den of iniquity. The militant Islamic group Hamas stopped
short of direct threats, but made clear its displeasure.
	   ``This is an indicator of corruption,'' the group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Tuesday in the Gaza Strip. ``In
the name of Hamas we condemn this project ... We are studying the
steps we shall take.''
	   The gala opening comes at a tense time. Hamas has threatened new
attacks against Israeli targets following last week's killing of
two of its top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   The casino, only a half-hour from Jerusalem, hopes to attract
foreign tourists and Israelis, while Palestinians are being barred
at the request of the Palestinian Authority.
	   A little of the hoped-for grand-opening glitz was missing.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to have attended the casino
opening, canceled at the last minute.
	   Yasser Arafat's cash-strapped government hopes the casino will
prove itself a jackpot in the form of gaming taxes. But many
Jericho residents fear that little of the wealth generated by the
casino will trickle down.
	   The Austrian operators of the ``Oasis'' say the casino is only
the start of what will become the largest resort in the Middle
East, with three luxury hotels, golf courses and convention
facilities planned _ along with 5,000 high-paying jobs for
Palestinians.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria has a 15
percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union Bank.
The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and Austrian
investors, whose names were not released.

Belgian company buys Brazilian power company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ In a test of investor confidence,
the government sold electric company Gerasul to Belgium's Tractebel
SA for 945.7 million reals, or dlrs 801 million.
	   Tractebel was the sole bidder at Tuesday's auction and paid the
minimum price for a controlling stake in Gerasul, the first
electric generating company to be privatized in Brazil.
	   The National Development Bank, which supervises privatizations,
admitted that foreign investors's interest waned in recent weeks of
turmoil, when Brazilian stock markets plunged and dollars fled the
country.
	   Bank Vice President Jose Pio Borges said several companies had
asked for a postponement until the situation calmed down.
	   But Borges said the government decided to go ahead with the
auction because ``the financial cost of waiting is higher'' than
the premium a competitive bidding might produce.
	   Besides the dlrs 801 million price paid for Gerasul, Tractebel
will take over a debt of dlrs 1.2 billion, most of it with
long-term maturity.
	   Gerasul serves 26 million residents of Brazil's southernmost
states. The company is a spin-off of Eletrosul, which is part of
federal electric holding company Eletrobras.
	   Borges said privatizations of government companies this year
have generated dlrs 35 billion, more than the dlrs 27.5 billion
last year.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International organizers of
last weekend's Bosnian election announced Tuesday they were not
ready to release results as rival groups issued contradictory
statements claiming success.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
organized the Saturday and Sunday election, had announced it would
release initial returns Tuesday.
	   But Robert Barry, head of the office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said about 670,000 ballots of
the total 1.6 million cast must be triple-checked due to the
complicated election procedure.
	   He said no figures will be made public until the counting is
completed and results checked _ which may take several more days.
	   But some international officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the OSCE was alarmed because early results showed a
stronger-than-expected showing by radical nationalists.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1/2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, had
been a chance for voters to choose between hard-line ethnic leaders
from the war era and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace
plan that halted the fighting.
	   U.S. and international officials had spoken optimistically about
prospects for moderates among Muslim, Serb and Croat communities to
accelerate a trend away from the hard-liners which had emerged
during the previous elections.
	   Appearing before reporters, Barry dismissed suggestions that
OSCE was holding up announcing figures in order to manipulate the
outcome.
	   He said the large number of independent observers made any
manipulation ``basically impossible,'' Barry said.
	   He also said contradictory claims of victory by parties were
designed only to confuse the voters.
	   ``Partial results are not in the interest of establishing
legitimacy of the outcome of the vote,'' he said, adding that
``only a very small fraction of the ballots'' have been counted so
far.
	   The sources said it was too early to make a definitive judgment
since OSCE has not counted thousands of absentee ballots _ mostly
those of refugees voting for their pre-war hometowns. Absentee
returns could swing the election.
	   But Western diplomats, who spoke under condition of anonymity,
said the initial results showed hard-line nationalist parties doing
better than expected.
	   Among those whose election was in doubt was the moderate
president of the Serb-run ministate, Biljana Plavsic, who is
reportedly trailing the candidate of Serb hard-line parties, Nikola
Poplasen, the sources said.
	   Plavsic was elected the president of Republika Srpska in 1996,
while she was still a hard-liner and a member of the ruling Serb
Democratic Party.
	   Later, she split from the Serb hard-liners and led the Serb
entity into the economic and political reforms. Western officials
fear Poplasen would use the considerable powers of the office to
reinforce his hard-liners.
	   But the sources said Serb hard-line candidates were faring
poorly in contests for the Bosnian Serb legislature and the joint
Bosnian parliament.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Red Star Belgrade and Monaco got off to winning
stars Tuesday as this season's UEFA Cup kicked off with 31
first-round, first-leg matches.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Red Star Belgrade scored in the first
12 minutes and dominated only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 win.
	   Perica Ognjenovic opened the scoring in the third minute from
six meters (yards) and Goran Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th from
nearly the same spot after he controlled a long, looping pass from
Goran Bunjevcevic and scored behind Metz goalkeeper Lionel Letizi.
	   The young, inexperienced Red Star team dominated most of the
match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in the first five
rounds in the French league, finally broke through when Bruno
Rodriguez scored in the 90th.
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Monaco _ semifinalists in last year's
Champions Cup _ got three second-half goals to win 3-1. Lodz took
the lead in the 10th on Piotr Matys' goal. Monaco equalized on a
own goal in the 59th by Witold Bendkowski. David Trezeguet made it
2-1 on a penalty in the 69th and Croatian international Robert
Spehar added the clincher in the 84th.
	   Monaco is unbeaten this season and won over league champion Lens
2-0 last week.
	   In Silkeborg, Denmark, Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev both
scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over Silkeborg.
	   In other early games:

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Under strong international pressure,
followers of ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday surrendered the
two tanks posted outside their headquarters after the government
threatened force unless the opposition gave up its weapons.
	   Following two days of rioting, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
promised to guarantee Berisha's safety and opened the door to a
political settlement of the crisis which has rocked this former
Communist capital.
	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' for
Berisha's supporters to give up their weapons. Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said plans had been completed for ``an
abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Late Tuesday, the government declared the unrest an ``attempted
coup'' and ordered a criminal investigation against Berisha and his
followers which could lead to an indictment.

Mir's crew prepares for venture inside ruptured module
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station on
Tuesday prepared for a strenuous mission inside the airless Spektr
module intended to boost power supply.
	   Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev are scheduled to enter the
module shortly after midnight and spend about three hours in the
vacuum of space inside the Spektr, which was punctured in a June
1997 collision with a cargo ship.
	   The Spektr is sealed from the rest of the sprawling six-module
station and the crew was to lock themselves in a docking chamber
and don their spacesuits before opening the hatchway leading to the
module.
	   Their sole task was to fasten cables connecting two of the
module's solar panels to Mir's power system. The connections have
loosened since a previous crew made repairs during two previous
excursions inside the the Spektr last August and October.
	   ``It's as easy as sweeping your corridor,'' joked deputy Mission
Control chief Viktor Blagov.
	   In fact, making delicate cable connections in bulky spacesuits
and simply moving inside the dark truck-size module cramped with
equipment is a hard and risky undertaking.
	   Before the mission, the crew went through a series of exercises.
These included work in spacesuits at a life-size Spektr mock-up
submerged in a pool at the cosmonauts' training center near Moscow
that emulates conditions of weightlessness, said Mission Control
spokeswoman Irina Manshilina.
	   The extensive training is necessary for the crew to get used to
the Spektr's conditions and learn to move inside the narrow space
without ripping their spacesuits.
	   If things were to go awry, the crew has the option of boarding a
Soyuz escape capsule attached to a docking port near the Spektr.
	   Re-activating the Spektr's solar panels is essential to bring
Mir's power supply back to normal, space officials said.
	   ``We now have to turn the whole station toward the sun in order
to preserve power, while the normal mode of operation envisages
turning the panels,'' Blagov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russian space officials initially planned to patch up the
module, but then gave up the idea as they now plan to discard the
whole station next June because of a desperate cash shortage.
	   Mission Control allowed Padalka and Avdeyev to get up later than
usual on Tuesday to give them extra rest before the mission. They
examined their spacesuits and were to have spent the day checking
other equipment and undergoing a long series of medical tests,
Manshilina said.

Turkey's Fenerbahce beats AC Parma Italy 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Fenerbahce beat AC Parma 1-0 in the
first leg of the first round of the UEFA Cup with a header by
Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan.
	   The goal came in the 23rd minute when Moldovan headed into the
left corner of the net off a well-placed free kick by Bosnian Elvir
Balic.
	   Fenerbahce were unable to improve on the score despite the fact
that they were playing against 10 men for the last 30 minutes when
Dino Bacio was sent off for a second bookable offense.
	   Parma wes reduced to nine men in the last two minutes when Fabio
Cannavaro was also sent off.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage, which means surviving in the
second leg in Italy in two week.

Refugees swell Kosovo village as guerrillas man thin defenses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of refugees streamed into this
cramped village Tuesday, where ethnic Albanian rebels were
hunkering down to defend their last stronghold from a Serb
onslaught.
	   Late Monday and early Tuesday, Serb and Yugoslav security forces
ousted the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army from villages in western
Kosovo. According to a fighter near Cirez, four guerrillas were
killed early Tuesday. No reports of Serb casualties were
immediately available.
	   Cirez is located in the Drenica region, 30 kilometers (18 miles)
west of the regional capital Pristina, where Serbs launched an
offensive against the successionist Albanians on Feb. 28. Drenica
is considered the KLA's last major holdout in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominate republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Tuesday's attacks sent hundreds of Albanian refugees fleeing
east to Cirez, where about 10,000 to 15,000 people have been taking
refuge for more than a month.
	   With foodstuffs and medical supplies running short, humanitarian
agencies are worried that the tens of thousands of people forced to
flee the fighting in Kosovo won't make it through the harsh winter.
	   Most of the refugees who arrived in Cirez have survived on a
meager diet of bread and milk from area cows for weeks. They were
met Tuesday by a humanitarian aid convoy, loaded with wheat flour,
cooking oil, beans and other non-food items.
	   But according to Anthea Webb, spokeswoman for the World Food
Programme which helped organize the convoy, the supplies are only
enough for a couple of days.
	   About 60 people, mostly ill women carrying babies, were lined up
Tuesday afternoon outside a makeshift clinic on the single street
that forms most of Cirez.
	   ``We do all we can but people still die,'' said Osman Veligi,
one of two doctors in Cirez that together see 200 to 400 patients
per day. ``We have no way to treat injuries. All we can give is
rehydration serum for diarrhea.''
	   He said at least ten people have died in Cirez in the last week
from treatable illnesses, such as severe diarrhea and circulatory
ailments.
	   Many of the refugees feared Serb police would push through the
KLA lines in the coming days, forcing them to move on again.
	   Already, the United Nations' refugee agency estimates some
190,000 people are displaced within Kosovo itself, and more than
60,000 others have fled to neighboring Albania, or the other
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
	   A U.S.-based aid agency, Mercy Corps International, estimates
the fighting has driven a total of 400,000 refugees, or 20 per cent
of the province's 2 million people, from their homes.
	   Officials fear a humanitarian disaster with the coming winter,
as most of the refugees are living in crude camps without shelter.
	   Since July, the Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from 40
percent, to all but a few patches, mostly in the mountains
	   ``If the police start to come, we will all go to the hills,''
said Hoti Skander, a 20-year-old student who fled nearby fighting
to Cirez. ``We just keep retreating.''
	   KLA soldiers, in groups of two or three on surrounding hills and
muddy roads, admitted they can do little if Serb security forces
advance to Cirez.
	   ``We have only Kalashnikovs and they're useless against tanks,''
said one middle-aged KLA soldier. ``We'll run but only after the
civilians are gone.''

</HEADLINE>
Internet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has stressed a need for greater
responsibility by journalists working in the age of Internet and
other speedy information systems.
	   In a message sent on his behalf by the Vatican's secretary of
state to a group of Catholic journalists meeting in Paris this
week, the pontiff said the written press has a ``responsibility
that has increased that much more as it uses that much more
extremely rapid means, such as Internet.''
	   The pope called on journalists to ``transmit information while
respecting truth, fundamental ethical principles and personal
dignity..''
	   The message was made public by the news agency of the Italian
bishops' conference.
	   Among the users of Internet is the Vatican itself, which has its
own web site.

Iranian leader orders military, top officials on full alert
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with nationwide demonstrations called for
Friday, statements from Iran's Parliament, Taliban leader and
Taliban diplomat in Riyadh. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran called Tuesday for nationwide
demonstrations to protest the slayings of nine Iranians in
Afghanistan, and Iran's supreme leader put the military and top
civilian leaders on alert.
	   The government-run Islamic Propagation Coordination Council
called on the public to turn out for protest rallies following
Friday prayers, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, the leadership of the Parliament warned that the
situation in Afghanistan ``will turn into a regional and
trans-regional crisis'' and urged Islamic nations to meet to
counter the threat, IRNA said.
	   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the
military and top civilian officials put on full alert amid
heightened tension with Afghanistan.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday. Khamenei is
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
the fundamentalist Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Tehran has vowed to avenge the deaths.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to the border
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   On Tuesday, thousands of Iranians staged a march in Qom, south
of Tehran, to condemn the killing of the diplomats, Iranian
television reported.
	   The demonstrators ``declared their hatred of the Taliban and
their foreign supporters, especially Pakistan and America ... and
expressed their readiness to implement the instructions issued by
the commander-in-chief of the armed forces,'' the broadcast said.
	   In Afghanistan, meanwhile, Taliban-run Radio Shariat quoted the
Taliban leader as urging the United Nations to censure Iran for
allegedly providing military aid to opposition Shiite Muslims.
	   ``The U.N. must stop Iran's interference in Afghanistan's
affairs,'' the radio quoted Mullah Mohammed Omar as saying.
	   The Taliban routinely accuses Iran of sending arms and
ammunition to its Shiite Muslim opponents belonging to the
Hezb-e-Wahadat group.
	   The Taliban is currently locked in a ferocious battle with
Hezb-e-Wahadat fighters in central Bamiyan province, where the
religious militia has made significant territorial gains in recent
days.
	   On Monday Khamenei said that unless Pakistan stops supporting
the Taliban and persuades the militia's leaders to put an end to
the country's civil war, the entire region will be in danger.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, is
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran, alleged to be
backing the alliance fighting the Taliban, has urged a government
be formed of all Afghan factions.
	   Iran continues to accuse the Taliban of holding some 40 truck
drivers who were taken prisoner when Mazar-e-Sharif fell last
month.
	   In the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, Taliban representative
Mawlawi Shehabuldin was quoted as saying that the militia was ready
to exchange the drivers for Afghan opposition leaders who have
sought refuge in Iran.
	   Shehabuldin also accused Iran of holding ``dozens of Taliban
fighters'' as captives.
	   He made the remarks in an interview with the London-based
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat which was to be published Wednesday.
	   The paper quoted him as saying the Taliban does not want war
with Iran but that ``we are ready to encounter and fight against
any outside Iranian invasion.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has stressed a need for greater
responsibility by journalists working in the age of Internet and
other speedy information systems.
	   In a, 2nd message sent on his behalf by the Vatican's secretary
of state to a group of Catholic journalists meeting in Paris this
week, the pontiff said the written press has a ``responsibility
that has increased that much more as it uses that much more
extremely rapid means, such as Internet.''
	   The pope called on journalists to ``transmit information while
respecting truth, fundamental ethical principles and personal
dignity..''
	   The message was made public Tuesday by the news agency of the
Italian bishops' conference.
	   Among the users of Internet is the Vatican itself, which has its
own web site.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Top seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia and second seeded Tim Henman of Great Britain easily
advanced to the round of 16 Tuesday on the second day of the dlrs
500,000 ATP Tour President's Cup.
	   Kafelnikov, ranked 11th by the ATP, overcame Martin Sinner of
Germany 6-4, 6-2. Henman, ranked 13th by the ATP, defeated Nir
Welgreen of Israel 6-1, 6-4.
	   Marc Rosset of Switzerland, seeded fifth, outplayed Tuomas
Ketola of Finland 7-6 (10), 7-5, in a difficult match.
	   ``The most important quality for a player is self-confidence,
which I've lacked recently. As a result I lost many matches last
season,'' Rosset, ranked 47th by the ATP, said at a news conference
after the match.
	   ``Today I won because I was stronger than my competitor,'' he
added.
	   Cedric Piolline of France, seeded third, upset Vadim Kutsenko of
Uzbekistan, 6-3, 6-3. When asked at a news conference why so many
French players came to the tournament, Piolline said, ``I came to
this tournament because the national team of France will play Davis
Cup on a hard-surface court and I would like to get used to it.''
	   The tournament drew about 3,500 spectators for the second day.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Fenerbahce upset AC Parma 1-0 Tuesday as
this season's UEFA Cup kicked off with 31 first-round, first-leg
matches.
	   Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan scored for Fenerbache on a
header in the 23rd off a free kick from Bosnian Elvir Balic. The
Turkish side failed to increase the margin despite a man advantage
for the last 30 minutes when Dino Bacio was sent off _ and a
two-man edge the last two minutes when Fabio Cannavaro was
dispatched.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage, which means surviving in the
second leg in Italy in two weeks.
	   In key other games, Red Star Belgrade and Monaco got off to
winning starts.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Red Star Belgrade scored in the first
12 minutes and dominated only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 win.
	   Perica Ognjenovic opened the scoring in the third minute from
six meters (yards) and Goran Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th from
nearly the same spot after he controlled a long, looping pass from
Goran Bunjevcevic and scored behind Metz goalkeeper Lionel Letizi.
	   The young, inexperienced Red Star team dominated most of the
match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in the first five
rounds in the French league, finally broke through when Bruno
Rodriguez scored in the 90th.
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Monaco _ semifinalists in last year's
Champions Cup _ got three second-half goals to win 3-1. Lodz took
the lead in the 10th on Piotr Matys' goal. Monaco equalized on a
own goal in the 59th by Witold Bendkowski. David Trezeguet made it
2-1 on a penalty in the 69th and Croatian international Robert
Spehar added the clincher in the 84th.
	   Monaco is unbeaten this season and beat league champion Lens 2-0
last week.
	   In Silkeborg, Denmark, Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev both
scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over Silkeborg.
	   The lone remaining UEFA game was set for Wednesday with
Anderlecht (Belgium) vs. Grasshopper (Switzerland).
	   In other early games:
	   Arges Pitesti 0, Celta Vigo 1; Brann, 2, Werder Bremen, 0;

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Thomas Johansson reached the
quarterfinals at the U.S. Open, a performance that secured him the
last spot on Sweden's defending champion Davis Cup team, which
hosts Spain in less than two weeks.
	   Coach Carl-Axel Hageskog announced the team Tuesday. Jonas
Bjorkman, Magnus Larsson or Johansson will play singles, he said,
while Bjorkman and Niklas Kulti will play doubles.
	   ``Bjorkman, Larsson and Johansson have all shown excellent form
recently,'' he said. ``It will be decided by current form.''
	   The match will be played Sept. 25-27 on hard courts at a stadium
near downtown Stockholm.
	   Johansson, Bjorkman and Larsson all reached the quarterfinals of
the U.S. Open. Johansson, 23, lost to Mark Philippoussis in a
five-setter. The Australian went on to reach the finals.
	   Larsson lost to Spain's Carlos Moya, while Bjorkman was defeated
by eventual U.S. Open winner Patrick Rafter of Australia.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The cockpit voice recorder aboard
Swissair Flight 111 stopped six minutes before the jetliner
crashed, killing all 229 people aboard, investigators said Tuesday.
	   The MD-11's flight data recorder also stopped six minutes before
the plane plunged into the North Atlantic off Nova Scotia on Sept.
2.
	   The report on the voice recorder provides further evidence that
the jetliner suffered a crippling failure of its systems. The
finding also means investigators will never learn what, if
anything, the two pilots said to each other in the final minutes of
the flight.
	   The pilots' conversation with air traffic controllers ended with
the pilots declaring an emergency because of smoke in the cockpit
and saying they had to land immediately.
	   The flight data recorder, which was recovered from the ocean
floor several days before the cockpit voice recorder, is being
examined by experts at a laboratory in Ottawa.
	   Canada's Transportation Safety Board said the experts have
confirmed a series of irregularities in systems on the plane prior
to the last six minutes of flight.
	   ``Developing a valid understanding of these anomalies will
require extensive examination of wiring and aircraft components
that have not yet been recovered from the wreckage,'' the board
said.
	   It said the effort to recover wreckage from the ocean floor _ a
task assigned to the U.S. Navy salvage ship USS Grapple _ could be
critical to the investigation.
	   Divers have located several large pieces of wreckage at a depth
of about 180 feet (55 meters).
	   Authorities say they won't begin hoisting large chunks of the
plane until human remains are removed, and divers have been told it
could take months to clear the crash site completely.

In land of real-life roulette, new West Bank casino's a gamble

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ There were no crooning lounge lizards,
and a few of the gamblers were just as worried about potential
terrorism as how their blackjack hands would play out.
	   But for most of the VIP crowd that turned out Tuesday for the
grand opening of the first casino in the Palestinian lands, the
question of safety was the same as it is every day in this part of
the world _ a roll of the dice.
	   The drls 50 million Oasis casino, a glitzy glass-and-stone
emporium set incongruously amid the arid moonscape of the Judean
desert, opened its doors Tuesday to a limited group of invitees,
and made ready for a larger gambling public to descend starting
Wednesday.
	   Only a half-hour from Jerusalem, on the outskirts of the
biblical town of Jericho, the casino aims to attract foreign
tourists, Israelis, and Palestinians who live in Israel. Residents
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are being barred at the request of
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   At a blackjack table, Arabs from east Jerusalem sat side-by-side
with Israelis, laying down their bets.
	   ``There's no discrimination here _ it gives me a good feeling,''
said Palestinian Sami Alayan, 26, who owns a small construction
company. ``This will bring us together.''
	   At the roulette table, a Palestinian dealer was calling bets
when one gambler piped up with a question: Will all this help bring
peace?
	   ``It'll help our economy,'' the dealer said, then segued
smoothly back into his croupier's role. ``No more bets, please!''
he called.
	   Yasser Arafat's cash-strapped government hopes the casino will
prove a jackpot in the form of gaming taxes. But some Palestinians
living nearby fear that little of the wealth generated by the
casino will trickle down.
	   The contrasts of glamour and poverty are inescapable. The casino
is just across the street from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a
shantytown of dirt roads, water shortages and frequent power
outages.
	   While the VIPs arrived, a few locals lingered at the gate,
peeking in to try to catch a glimpse. But they were turned away by
guards.
	   Security was tight. Before bettors could roll the dice or play a
hand of blackjack, they face searches and metal detectors. When the
casino opens to the general public, gamblers will have to register
their passport numbers.
	   The opening-night crowd quickly ballooned into the hundreds,
with buses rolling in from Tel Aviv and a steady stream of cars.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had few areas of
agreement with the Palestinians of late, had nothing critical to
say about the Palestinian move into the gambling trade.
	   ``It's their choice _ we respect it,'' he said.
	   Islamic fundamentalists, however, are railing against the casino
as a den of iniquity. The militant Islamic group Hamas stopped
short of direct threats, but made clear its displeasure.
	   ``This is a indicator of corruption,'' the group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Tuesday in the Gaza Strip. ``In
the name of Hamas we condemn this project ... We are studying the
steps we shall take.''
	   The gala opening comes at a tense time. Hamas has threatened new
attacks against Israeli targets following last week's killing of
two of its top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   A little of the hoped-for grand-opening glitz was missing.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to have attended the opening,
canceled at the last minute.
	   But the ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail
party, with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty
suits, chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot
machines. The music was taped big-band numbers, but casino
operators say later on there will be live acts.
	   The Austrian operators of the Oasis say the casino is only the
start of what will become the largest resort in the Middle East,
with three luxury hotels, golf courses and convention facilities
planned _ along with 5,000 high-paying jobs for Palestinians.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria has a 15
percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union Bank.
The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and Austrian
investors, whose names were not released.

Tony Blair tells new Russian leader to continue reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke by telephone to
his new Russian counterpart on Tuesday to reinforce the importance
of Russia continuing the reform process.
	   Russia Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said during the call that
Moscow did not plan to roll back economic reforms as it deals with
the current crisis, Downing Street sources said.
	   Western officials have repeatedly made clear that additional
financial aid is contingent on continuing reform.
	   Blair had planned to speak Tuesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, to brief him on nearly seven hours of London talks between
senior officials from top industrialized nations on Monday.
	   But Downing Street said Blair had been eager to speak with
Primakov to establish personal contact and congratulate him on his
appointment, and because Primakov was ``at the front-line'' of
efforts to correct Russia's economic tailspin.
	   The Downing Street spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity,
said Blair explained in his 20-minute call to Primakov that the G-7
meeting ``wasn't about taking decisions but that all agreed on the
importance of staying engaged with Russia and the importance of
Russia as a key partner.''
	   The Russian leader, who has met Blair previously in Moscow, also
said he would be talking to the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund in the next few days.
	   Blair, who currently holds the rotating presidency of the Group
of Seven industrialized nations, has not yet decided whether to
call a world summit of leaders to discuss the global economic
crisis.

Security Council meeting to extend Angola deadline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with council adopting resolution, UNICEF expressing
concern about humanitarian situation; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Tuesday to
keep U.N. military observers in Angola for another month and urged
Angolan authorities to reconsider barring the former rebel group
UNITA from the government.
	   In a resolution adopted by a vote of 15-0, the council demanded
that UNITA comply with the terms of a 1994 peace accord by
dismantling its armed forces and turning over territory to the
government. It said blame for the crisis in Angola and the current
impasse in implementation of the peace plan lay mostly with UNITA.
	   But the council also called on the government to reverse its
decision to break off dialogue with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi for
his failure to honor the peace accord.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos told the council of
his government's decision in a letter on Sept. 10. He said his
government has instead decided to recognize a group of UNITA
leaders who have split with Savimbi, called the UNITA Renovation
Committee, as the representatives of the group.
	   ``I request that you not hesitate to support the positions of
the Angolan government and those of the UNITA Renovation Committee,
for this is the only way to give the peace process a new thrust,
capable of leading it to its conclusions,'' dos Santos wrote.
	   The new resolution makes no mention of the committee, though it
does take note of dos Santos' letter. The goal of the resolution
was to extend the mandate of the U.N. observer mission in the
southwestern African nation through Oct. 15. The mandate was to
have expired Tuesday.
	   The council said it would assess the situation of U.N. observers
after Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports to it next month. The
U.N. chief has warned that the observers could be withdrawn by
February if UNITA didn't stop fighting immediately and implement
the 1994 accord.
	   Angola's peace process has crumbled with a resurgence in
fighting. Tensions mounted after the government said it was
severing all contact with Savimbi.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war against the
government for nearly two decades after Angola won independence
from Portugal in 1975. A U.N.-mediated 1994 accord, called the
Lusaka Protocol, ended the fighting, but the United Nations says
UNITA has resisted honoring it, particularly by refusing to hand
over four key territories and demobilize its troops.
	   UNICEF on Tuesday expressed concern about the plight of women
and children in Angola, saying their needs of food, shelter, clean
water and health care were both urgent and immense.
	   ``Fatigue over the drawn-out peace process in Angola should not
jeopardize the survival of the millions of children and women in
desperate need of continued humanitarian assistance,'' said UNICEF
executive director Carol Bellamy.
	   So far, only 37 percent of the dlrs 91 million needed to care
for them has been committed, she said.

Vasco, River Plate decide first place in Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian champion Vasco da Gama
meets River Plate of Argentina on Wednesday in a battle for first
place in Group E of the Mercosur Cup.
	   The teams could hardly be more evenly matched. Both have five
points, identical records of 1-2-0 and a goal difference of one. In
their first encounter in Buenos Aires, they tied 1-1.
	   In the group's other game Wednesday, Brazil's Gremio faces
Universidad Catolica of Chile in Santiago. Gremio has three points
and U. Catolica has two.
	   Vasco, exhausted from its victorious campaign in the
Libertadores Cup, will face the visitors with its reserve team,
nicknamed ``the little express.''
	   But that might not be much consolation. Vasco is so deep in
talent that the second-string has looked as sharp as the ``A''
team, which now is without injured starters Donizete and Pedrinho.
	   On Tuesday, Vasco announced it had acquired forward Guilherme
from Gremio. The club plans to use him in the Mercosur Cup and in
the world inter-club final against Real Madrid in December.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (0040 GMT Thursday) at
Sao Januario stadium.

Human rights groups charge Palestinians being pushed out of
</HEADLINE>
Jerusalem &QL; 
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli human rights groups charged Tuesday
that Israel was aggressively moving ahead with quiet policies to
push out hundreds of Palestinians from traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem.
	   In a joint report released at a news conference, the groups _
Betselem and Hamoked _ said the number of Palestinians turned down
for residency status and denied social and health benefits is on
the rise.
	   In 1997, 606 Palestinians lost residency benefits and, in the
first three months of 1998, 187 Palestinians also lost permits.
Five years ago, the numbers of lost permits totaled 58.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed the area, encouraging Jews to move into
Palestinian neighborhoods there. At the same time, Israel revoked
the rights of Palestinians to retain Jerusalem residency permits
for a host of reasons, including marriage to Palestinians from the
West Bank or living abroad for seven years or more.
	   Eitan Felner, executive director of Betselem, called the
residency revocations a ``quiet deportation.''
	   ``This policy has one sole objective: to reduce the number of
Palestinians residing in the city and preserving a conclusive
Jewish majority so it will be impossible to question Israel's
sovereignty over all parts of the city,'' Felner told reporters
Tuesday.
	   Without the Israeli-issued residency permits, Palestinians loose
their rights to social and health care benefits and their rights to
travel freely throughout Israel, the West Bank and abroad.
	   Eliahu Abrams, legal advisor for Hamoked, one of the report's
sponsors, said the number of residency revocations in recent years
has increased dramatically. Between 1987-1994, less than 50
Palestinians lost their permits each year. But since 1995, the
number has shot-up into the hundreds.
	   Moshe Mosko, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry disputed the
validity of the report's figures, but declined to provide other
numbers. The ministry has stressed in the past that Israel's
Supreme Court had upheld the residency policy, and that the issue
has come to the fore recently because Palestinians who had been
living overseas have been returning in the wake of the
Israel-Palestinian peace agreements.

Firings at private TV station provoke protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The new ownership of Slovakia's only
private TV station, Markiza, fired twelve top staff Tuesday,
prompting strong protest and raising questions about manipulation
of media ten days before parliamentary elections.
	   News of the dismissals prompted an immediate demonstration at
the TV station, and the dismissed staff broke into the building and
broadcast a brief appeal for public backing.
	   More than 1,000 protesters responded to the call. Late Tuesday,
they remained outside the building or in the lobby, but it was
unclear who was in control of the station.
	   Opposition politicians also showed up to talk to station
officials and to give speeches to the protesters. No incidents were
reported.
	   TV Markiza, which has been broadcasting for a year has been the
only source providing independent news to Slovakia, where the state
controls all radio and TV stations with nation-wide distribution in
the country.
	   The station came under new ownership in August, but a lengthy
and murky court case prevented the new owner, Gamatex Group, from
taking control until Tuesday.
	   Prime minister Vladimir Meciar, who is accused of backing
Gamatex, denied he was involved in the ownership.
	   ``The government ... is not involved in what is happening in
Markiza. It is only a problem between two independent businesses,''
Meciar said Tuesday at a rally in Trnava, 52 kilometers (35 miles)
northeast of Bratislava.
	   Meciar, who is in a close race for elections, has been accused
by international officials of trampling media rights.
	   The new ownership of Markiza, gave no reason for firing the
staff _ 10 journalists, plus the news editor and general director.

Taliban leader urges UN to censure Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iran-Afghanistan &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's reclusive Taliban
leader urged the United Nations Tuesday to censure Iran for giving
military aid to the country's opposition Shiite Muslims.
	   ``The U.N. must stop Iran's interference in Afghanistan's
affairs,'' the Taliban-run Radio Shariat quoted Mullah Mohammed
Omar as saying.
	   The Taliban routinely accuses Iran of sending arms and
ammunition to its Shiite Muslim opponents belonging to the
Hezb-e-Wahadat group.
	   The Taliban is currently locked in a ferocious battle with
Hezb-e-Wahadat fighters in central Bamiyan province, where the
religious militia has made significant territorial gains in recent
days.
	   ``If the U.N. does not take note of Iran's interference it will
only prove that the U.N. is against Islam and against the Islamic
Emirate of Afghanistan,'' Omar was quoted as saying.
	   Iran has amassed about 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan where they are conducting a massive military exercise.
The Taliban also has sent thousands of fresh troops to western
Afghanistan to bolster its forces on the border with Iran.
	   Iran has vowed to avenge the shooting deaths of their diplomats
in northern Mazar-e-Sharif last month by Taliban soldiers.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban leadership, who
has refused. Iran also has demanded the killers of the diplomats be
tried in an international court of law, something the Taliban also
has rejected.
	   The Iranian diplomats were among possibly thousands of people
believed to have been killed in Mazar-e-Sharif during the Taliban
takeover. Amnesty International accused the Taliban troops of
killing thousands of innocent civilians, a charge the Taliban
denies.
	   Also on Tuesday in Pakistan, Iran's Ambassador Mohammed
Akhoundzadeh met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who volunteered to
mediate between Afghanistan and Iran.
	   However, Pakistan is considered a strong supporter of the
Taliban and already has been accused by Iran of sending military
supplies and advisors to help the Taliban against its
northern-based opposition, which includes the minority Shiite
Muslims.
	   Most Pakistanis are Sunni Muslims like most Afghans. In Iran
most people are Shiite Muslims.
	   Sharif told Akhoundzadeh that Pakistan resented the accusations
and ``noted with concern the baseless allegations regarding the
involvement of Pakistani armed forces in recent fighting in
Afghanistan,'' according to a Pakistan foreign ministry press
release.

Separatists win important parliamentary by-election in Quebec
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHERBROOKE, Quebec (AP) _ Quebec separatists have triumphed in
an important parliamentary by-election, narrowly winning the seat
vacated by the man now seeking to oust them from control of the
provincial government.
	   The outcome of Monday's voting in Sherbrooke pleased Quebec's
separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard, who is trying to decide
whether to schedule the provincial election for this fall or next
spring.
	   ``It's an important electoral victory in a strategic place at a
crucial time in Quebec's and Canada's political life,'' Bouchard
said Tuesday.
	   Bouchard declined to answer directly when asked if the
Sherbrooke result would encourage him to hold the provincial
election promptly. If he wins that election over anti-separatist
Jean Charest, Bouchard is expected to begin organizing a referendum
on whether Quebec should secede from Canada.
	   Charest, one of Quebec's most popular politicians, has held the
Sherbrooke seat in Parliament since 1984. But he left federal
politics last spring to lead anti-separatist forces in their effort
to unseat Bouchard in the provincial vote.
	   In the by-election, the candidate of the separatist Bloc
Quebecois, Serge Cardin, received 16,157 votes to 15,836 for Robert
Pouliot of the anti-separatist Liberal Party. Other candidates
finished far back.
	   The Bloc Quebecois now has 45 seats in Parliament. The Liberals
have 156, the Reform Party 58, the New Democratic Party 21 and the
Progressive Conservatives 19. There are two independents.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who heads the federal Liberal
Party, tried to see a bright side to the results.
	   ``With a change of a couple of hundred votes we would have
won,'' he said.
	   But Bouchard saw the outcome as a blow for Charest.
	   ``Mr. Charest's political base is supposed to be in
Sherbrooke,'' Bouchard said. ``I think it's an extraordinarily
important defeat for him that's going to have repercussions across
Canada.''
	   Charest said the separatists should not be too confident, noting
that their victory came with only 44.3 percent of the votes. That
is less than the 49.4 percent showing by the separatists in
Quebec's 1995 referendum on independence.

Italy calls on Albania to bring killers to justice; no plans to
</HEADLINE>
evacuate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	    &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Prodi's phone appeals to Berisha and Nano
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian military aircraft and ships were readied for
possible evacuation of Italian citizens from Albania's latest
violence, but no immediate exodus was planned, Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Tuesday.
	   Dini, briefing an emergency joint session of the foreign affairs
committee of the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies, called on
the Albanian government to bring to justice the killers of an
opposition leader whose death sparked the unrest in the Balkan
country.
	   He told lawmakers that the Albanian crisis was a ``test'' for
Italy because of the ``many Italian businessmen who have invested
their savings in Albania,'' because of the ``thousands of Albanian
refugees in Italy'' and because of the ``delicacy'' of the
situation in the troubled Balkan nation.
	   The last outbreak of violence in Albania, in 1997, sent
thousands of refugees fleeing across the Adriatic to Italy. Rome
sent most of them back when Albania calmed down.
	   Italian naval vessels kept up their regular patrol of the
Adriatic on the lookout for illegal immigrants, but no boatloads of
Albanians were spotted.
	   Italy also led a multinational military force deployed to
protect aid shipments to Albania in the wake of the 1997 uprising.
	   Dini said the only sure way to restore peace in Albania was to
bring to justice the killers of a popular opposition leader whose
death helped ignite the crisis. He warned that Italy's support is
``strictly conditioned on conduct inspired by moderation and
respect for the law, by both the government and the Albanian
opposition.''
	   Premier Romano Prodi, in telephone calls to Albania's premier,
Fatso Nano, and to its opposition leader Sali Berisha, said that
the Italian government would not recognize ``the result of the
exercise of violence as an instrument of political struggle in
Albania,'' Prodi's office said Tuesday evening. Prodi expressed
hope that all of Albania's political forces would find the courage
to resume dialogue without retaliation.
	   About 2,000 Italians are in Albania. Rome has encouraged Italian
investment there as a way to develop jobs there to encourage
Albanians to stay at home instead of fleeing to search for black
market work in Italy.
	   The leader of Italy's lobby of industrialists, Confindustria,
expressed concern that the Italian business community in Albania
was running a big risk in the current violence. ``I hope that the
(Albanian) government is able to intervene more quickly than it has
in the past,'' said the group's president, Giorgio Fossa.
	   Italy and Germany on Tuesday recommended sending an
international police force to Albania to help stablize the nation.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government showed some of its cards
Tuesday, proposing printing money to pay off back wages and
imposing some Soviet-style controls over the market _ but also
making a key appointment to enhance its reform credentials.
	   The head of the centrist Our Home Is Russia parliament faction,
Alexander Shokhin, was named deputy prime minister in charge of
financial issues. He said another member of his faction, Georgy
Boos, had been appointed head of the State Tax Service, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   It was unclear what would happen to the former tax chief, Boris
Fyodorov, who is highly respected by market-oriented reformers and
the Western investment community.
	   Russian liberals and media have been making doomsday predictions
that the new government, under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
will represent a retreat to Soviet-era economic policies.
	   Primakov has insisted that he is only trying to create a cabinet
that represents all the major political and economic factions,
including the Communist Party.
	   The prime minister met Tuesday with a delegation of officials
from the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Among those at the meeting was the
IMF's top official for Russia, John Odling Smee.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, Primakov's office issued a statement
saying the Russian side ``stressed the new government's firm
commitment to the policy of market reforms, but pointed out the
need for some changes in the ways of their implementation to ensure
sustainable economic growth and to take into account all the social
aspects of the reforms.''
	   Interfax said the international lenders supported the strategic
goals of the new government.
	   However, aside from a few preliminary measures, Primakov has not
announced any economic program and appears to be seeking political
consensus rather than quick economic steps. He has asked to be
given up to a year before his policies were assessed.
	   Still, there have been indications that the government intends
to play a stronger role in the economy.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko on Tuesday called for
a return to the Soviet-era practice of requiring exporters to turn
in all of their hard-currency earnings to the government, in
exchange for rubles at a state-determined rate.
	   The measure ``is long overdue,'' Gerashchenko said. ``That
should have been done last year,'' he said.
	   Gerashchenko also said he supported printing more money to pay
off many months' backlog of wages.
	   ``We can't do without that,'' he said.
	   However, he did not say if the increase in the money supply
would be underpinned by the Central Bank's hard currency reserves.
If the bank simply prints money that is not backed by assets, this
would erode the value of the ruble and could lead to
hyperinflation.
	   ``We will find the necessary solutions to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Primakov told reporters Tuesday. He did not
elaborate.
	   No decision on increasing the money supply will be made until
the Central Bank's new board of directors is in place, Gerashchenko
said. The board is scheduled to come up for a confirmation vote in
parliament Wednesday.
	   No one in the government has called for reviving Soviet-era
fundamentals such as fully nationalized industry, price controls or
ending the free flow of capital and the ruble's convertibility.
	   The Communist Party has distanced itself from the new
administration, saying it would be ``inexpedient'' to join the
cabinet. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Cabinet
appointments of Yuri Maslyukov, a communist, and Gerashchenko, a
former Soviet chief banker, was a Kremlin initiative, not the
party's proposal.
	   Zyuganov met with Primakov on Tuesday to discuss the new
government.
	   Boris Berezovsky, former deputy security chief and one of the
Russia's richest business moguls, said it was premature to predict
that the new government would swing to the left.
	   ``Any hasty answers to the question of whether the latest events
in Russia's political life are a red revanche are dangerous, above
all for Russia itself,'' Berezovsky said, according to Interfax.
	   President Boris Yeltsin assured his French counterpart Jacques
Chirac during a telephone conversation that Russia ``will not
deviate from the course of economic reforms,'' Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Russia's currency, which has been gaining strength in recent
days, was trading in a band between 7.5 and 10 to the dollar on
Tuesday.
	   Russian stock ended slightly lower in very thin trading, closing
at 62.03 points, down 2.89 percent from Monday.

Rights group appeals for release of ailing Syrian prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A New York-headquartered human rights group
on Tuesday appealed for the release of Syrian dissident Nizar
Nayouf, saying he had been tortured and denied medical treatment.
	   Human Rights Watch said that Nayouf, 36, could die if he did not
receive medical care for Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer that
is treatable.
	   ``We are deeply concerned that Nizar Nayouf is being denied
medical treatment until he pledges to cease all political activity
and signs an admission that he made false declarations concerning
the situation of human rights in Syria,'' the group said in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   It added that ``he has been tortured, unfairly tried and held in
solitary confinement for many years.'' The torture, it said, left
Nayouf with ``permanent physical injuries.''
	   It urged Damascus-based diplomats to appeal for his release.
	   Nayouf was a founding member of the Committee for the Defense of
Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, Human Rights Watch
said.
	   It said he was arrested in January 1992 as part of a Syrian
government crackdown on the country's nascent human rights
movement.
	   ``Authorities held Nayouf's wife and baby daughter hostage to
induce him to turn himself in,'' the group said.
	   He was sentenced in March 1992 by the Supreme State Security
Court to 10 years in prison and has been incarcerated at the Mezze
military prison in the Syrian capital Damascus, it said.

Russia and No. 2 seed Tim Henman of Britain easily advanced to the
round of 16 Tuesday at the dlrs 500,000 President's Cup.
	   Kafelnikov, ranked 11th in the world, defeated Martin Sinner of

	   ``The most important quality for a player is self-confidence,
which I've lacked recently. As a result I lost many matches last
season,'' Rosset said at a news conference after the match. ``Today
I won because I was stronger than my competitor.''

	   KOSICE, Slovakia (AP) _ Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 victory over
Kosice in the UEFA Cup first-round, first leg match Tuesday with
Czech international Patrik Berger playing a starring role.
	   Berger, highly rated in Kosice despite rivalry between the Czech
Republic and Slovakia, scored Liverpool's opener when he drilled a
penalty through a defensive wall in the 19th minute.
	   The Slovakian champions came close to equalizing a minute later
but a brilliant save by goalkeeper Brad Friedel, the first of his
five saves, ensured the visitors maintained an advantage.
	   Karlheinz Riedle increased Liverpool's lead to 2-0 in the 23rd
minute when a Steve McManaman cross from left-field found him
unmarked in front of goal and he headed into goal.
	   Former England international Robbie Fowler replaced Riedle in
the second half and within seconds put 18-year-old striker Michael
Owen into space to score Liverpool's third in the 59th minute.

<TEXT>
	   BARI, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian striker Edmundo scored twice in the
second half, including the winner with eight minutes left, to rally
10-man Fiorentina past Croatia's Hajduk Split 2-1 Tuesday in a UEFA
Cup first round, first leg game.
	   Fiorentina trailed 1-0 at halftime, but Edmundo equalized in the
51st minute by splitting two defenders atop the penalty area and
rounding Hajduk 'keeper Tonci Gabric before slotting the ball home.
The hosts then had defender Moreno Torricelli expelled in the 72nd
for a last-man foul on Jurica Vucko.
	   Edmundo completed the comeback with a rising blast from 12
meters (yards) away off an assist from Argentine star Gabriel
Batistuta, who drew two defenders before passing.
	   Vucko had given Hajduk the lead with a goal in the 45th. The
striker moved past defender Giulio Falcone on the left flank and
brought the ball along the end line before firing. Francesco Toldo
blocked that shot, but Vucko gathered the rebound and lofted it
past the fallen 'keeper.
	   About 10,000 people attended the game in Bari, 600 kilometers
(370 miles) southeast of Florence. UEFA forced Fiorentina to move
the match away from its home city because fans tossed coins and
fireworks onto the field during the club's last European cup
outing, a Cup Winners Cup semifinal against visiting FC Barcelona
in 1997.

Mexican government, political parties advance on financial bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican legislators and government officials
have reached a series of framework agreements aimed at unblocking
debate on financial reform bills submitted in March, Mexico City
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Political party leaders and officials, including Interior
Minister Francisco Labastida and Finance Minister Angel Gurria, met
for five hours Monday at the Interior Ministry.
	   Participants said they agreed on, among other things, calls for
new laws to tighten penalties for financial crimes, efforts to
reduce the fiscal cost of the government's banking-system bailout,
and further help for small debtors.
	   The most controversial of the proposals before the
opposition-dominated Congress is the government's plan to
consolidate as public debt 552 billion pesos, or dlrs 53.6 billion,
in liabilities in the bank savings protection fund Fobaproa.
	   Stemming from the bank crisis of 1995, when soaring interest
rates pushed hundreds of thousands of debtors into default, the
government absorbed billions of pesos in bad loans from banks as
part of a capitalization plan.
	   Other liabilities were absorbed through government intervention
in insolvent banks.
	   The opposition has questioned the constitutionality and legality
of the bailout operations.

Lendl opens a Mucha exhibition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Former tennis champion Ivan Lendl
opened an exhibition of his favorite artist Tuesday during a tennis
tour of his native country.
	   A passionate follower and collector of the world-famous Czech
artist Alfons Muca, Lendl opened an exhibit Tuesday of late works
by the art-nouveau master in the town of Prostejov, 250 kilometers
(156 miles) east of Prague, CTK news agency reported.
	   Lendl, winner of eight Grand Slam titles and former No. 1 for a
record 270 weeks, played an exhibition match in the town Prerov,
300 kilometers (187 miles) east of Prague, last weekend, his first
match since he retired from active tennis in December 1994.
	   Born in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, in 1960, Lendl defected from
his homeland in 1985 to eventually become an American citizen seven
years later.
	   He has been back to his native country several times on
golf-related trips, since Communism fell in 1989.
	   After retiring from active tennis, Lendl has become a passionate
golfer, even taking part in professional tournaments.

Europe's Viagra factory in Loire Valley ratchets up production
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POCE-SUR-CISSE, France (AP) _ For four years the U.S. drugmaker
Pfizer had been preparing for this day, expanding its European
Viagra factory near the vineyards and chateaus of the Loire Valley.
	   On Tuesday, when the European Union in Brussels finally gave the
green light to sell the new virility drug, factory director Jean
Lhoste was ready to ratchet up production right away.
	   ``We've already delivered to the English. Then come the Germans
and then the French,'' Lhoste told reporters in this village across
the Loire River from the Chateau d'Amboise near Tours.
	   The United Kingdom was getting the anti-impotence drug first
because ``the British have less red tape,'' said Lhoste. Because of
France's bureaucracy, the drug won't hit store shelves until
mid-October.
	   The 40-hectare (100-acre) factory, which produces different
kinds of medication, had been delivering Viagra to countries
outside the EU, like Switzerland and the Middle East.
	   But over the past four years, the company had invested 500
million francs (about dlrs 85 million) in the factory for the
European market. The plant will produce Viagra for a total of 30
countries.
	   Built to produce 120 million boxes of different medications, the
factory is expected to churn out 80 million boxes by next year.
About 20 percent of the factory's capacity was earmarked for
Viagra.
	   Surveillance cameras and identity checks are part of security at
the factory, but employees aren't frisked, Lhoste said.
	   ``It's a question of confidence,'' he said. ``We aren't a gold
mine.''
	   Some people might disagree.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ There were no crooning lounge lizards,
and a few of the gamblers were just as worried about potential
terrorism as how their blackjack hands would play out.
	   But for most of the VIP crowd that turned out Tuesday for the
grand opening of the first casino in the Palestinian lands, the
question of safety was the same as it is every day in this part of
the world _ a roll of the dice.
	   The drls 50 million Oasis casino, a glitzy glass-and-stone
emporium set incongruously amid the arid moonscape of the Judean
desert, opened its doors Tuesday to a limited group of invitees,
and made ready for a larger gambling public to descend starting
Wednesday.
	   Only a half-hour from Jerusalem, on the outskirts of the
biblical town of Jericho, the casino aims to attract Israelis, who
cannot gamble legally at home, plus foreign tourists and
Palestinians who live in Israel.
	   Residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are being barred at
the request of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   At a blackjack table, Arabs from east Jerusalem sat side-by-side
with Israelis, laying down their bets.
	   ``There's no discrimination here _ it gives me a good feeling,''
said Palestinian Sami Alayan, 26, who owns a small construction
company. ``This will bring us together.''
	   At the roulette table, a Palestinian dealer was calling bets
when one gambler piped up with a question: Will all this help bring
peace?
	   ``It'll help our economy,'' the dealer said, then segued
smoothly back into his croupier's role. ``No more bets, please!''
he called.
	   Arafat's cash-strapped government hopes the casino will prove a
jackpot in the form of gaming taxes. But some Palestinians living
nearby fear that little of the wealth generated by the casino will
trickle down.
	   The contrasts of glamour and poverty are inescapable. The casino
is just across the street from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a
shantytown of dirt roads, water shortages and frequent power
outages.
	   While the VIPs arrived, a few locals lingered at the gate,
peeking in to try to catch a glimpse. But they were turned away by
guards.
	   Security was tight. Before bettors could roll the dice or play a
hand of blackjack, they face searches and metal detectors. When the
casino opens to the general public, gamblers will have to register
their passport numbers.
	   The opening-night crowd quickly ballooned into the hundreds,
with buses rolling in from Tel Aviv and a steady stream of cars.
The casino lies just inside Palestinian territory, and the main
road to Jericho is controlled by Israel and well-patrolled by the
military.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had few areas of
agreement with the Palestinians of late, had nothing critical to
say about the Palestinian move into the gambling trade.
	   ``It's their choice _ we respect it,'' he said.
	   Islamic fundamentalists, however, are railing against the casino
as a den of iniquity. The militant Islamic group Hamas stopped
short of direct threats, but made clear its displeasure.
	   ``This is a indicator of corruption,'' the group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Tuesday in the Gaza Strip. ``In
the name of Hamas we condemn this project ... We are studying the
steps we shall take.''
	   The gala opening comes at a tense time. Hamas has threatened new
attacks against Israeli targets following last week's killing of
two of its top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   A little of the hoped-for grand-opening glitz was missing.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to have attended the opening,
canceled at the last minute.
	   But the ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail
party, with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty
suits, chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot
machines. The music was taped big-band numbers, but casino
operators say later on there will be live acts.
	   The Austrian operators of the Oasis say the casino is only the
start of what will become the largest resort in the Middle East,
with three luxury hotels, golf courses and convention facilities
planned _ along with 5,000 high-paying jobs for Palestinians.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria has a 15
percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union Bank.
The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and Austrian
investors, whose names were not released.

Beatles lyrics notebook to be a 21st birthday surprise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A notebook containing draft Beatles lyrics for
``Hey Jude'' and ``Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''
fetched 100,000 pounds (dlrs. 168,000) at a Sotheby's auction on
Tuesday.
	   A private collector from Liverpool _ birthplace of the Beatles _
bought the spiral-bound book to celebrate his daughter's 21st
birthday.
	   The notebook, which also includes doodles by John Lennon, was
sold as part of a Sotheby's sale of rock 'n' roll memorabilia at
the Hard Rock Cafe. Sotheby's had expected it to fetch between
dlrs. 150,000 and dlrs. 200,000. The auction house did not name the
buyer.
	   Filled with scribbles and brightly colored ink, the notebook
covers 18 months of 1967-68, when the Beatles were at the top of
the charts releasing albums including ``Sergeant Pepper'' and ``The
Beatles'' _ more commonly known as the White Album.
	   The group's road manager, Mal Evans, compiled it. He was killed
by police in Los Angeles in 1976 after brandishing a fake gun.
	   Evans included a draft of ``Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite''
with half a line added by Lennon and George Harrison's recording
notes for ``All You Need Is Love.'' The notebook begins with what
seems to be a checklist about the filming of promotional clips for
the ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' single.
	   The auctioned items came from an anonymous vendor associated
with Sotheby's for the past 30 years.
	   Also under the hammer was a corduroy jacket worn by John Lennon
on the last Beatles tour, which fetched 8,000 pounds (dlrs. 13,000)

Beatles lyrics notebook to be a 21st birthday surprise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix coding &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A notebook containing draft Beatles lyrics for
``Hey Jude'' and ``Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''
fetched 100,000 pounds (dlrs. 168,000) at a Sotheby's auction on
Tuesday.
	   A private collector from Liverpool _ birthplace of the Beatles _
bought the spiral-bound book to celebrate his daughter's 21st
birthday.
	   The notebook, which also includes doodles by John Lennon, was
sold as part of a Sotheby's sale of rock 'n' roll memorabilia at
the Hard Rock Cafe. Sotheby's had expected it to fetch between
dlrs. 150,000 and dlrs. 200,000. The auction house did not name the
buyer.
	   Filled with scribbles and brightly colored ink, the notebook
covers 18 months of 1967-68, when the Beatles were at the top of
the charts releasing albums including ``Sergeant Pepper'' and ``The
Beatles'' _ more commonly known as the White Album.
	   The group's road manager, Mal Evans, compiled it. He was killed
by police in Los Angeles in 1976 after brandishing a fake gun.
	   Evans included a draft of ``Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite''
with half a line added by Lennon and George Harrison's recording
notes for ``All You Need Is Love.'' The notebook begins with what
seems to be a checklist about the filming of promotional clips for
the ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' single.
	   The auctioned items came from an anonymous vendor associated
with Sotheby's for the past 30 years.
	   Also under the hammer was a corduroy jacket worn by John Lennon
on the last Beatles tour, which fetched 8,000 pounds (dlrs. 13,000)

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Business groups from six nations will visit Cuba
this month to explore trade and investment opportunities on the
Caribbean island, the Cuban chamber of commerce said Tuesday.
	   Canada, Germany, Guatemala, Spain, Jamaica and the Czech
Republic each will send delegations to the communist nation, the
Prensa Latina news agency reported.
	   Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department refused to
allow a U.S. business consultancy to take American executives on an
overnight visit to the island.
	   Though the 36-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba does not
prohibit visits outright, the Treasury Department said the trip led
by Washington-based Alamar Associates would be inconsistent with
current U.S. policy.

Fenerbache upsets Parma; Red Star, Monaco win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds Liverpool, Fiorentina winning; other scores &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Fenerbahce _ with a hefty financial bonus
reportedly on the line _ upset AC Parma 1-0 Tuesday as this
season's UEFA Cup kicked off with 31 first-round, first-leg
matches.
	   Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan scored for Fenerbache on a
header in the 23rd off a free kick from Bosnian Elvir Balic. The
Turkish side failed to increase the margin despite a man advantage
for the last 30 minutes when Dino Baggio was sent off _ and a
two-man edge the last two minutes when Fabio Cannavaro was
dispatched.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage, which means surviving in the
second leg in two weeks against Parma, winners of the '93 Cup
Winners Cup, '95 UEFA Cup and players last season in the Champions
League.
	   In key other games, Red Star Belgrade, Monaco Liverpool and
Fiorentina got off to winning starts.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Red Star Belgrade scored in the first
12 minutes and dominated only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 win.
	   Perica Ognjenovic opened the scoring in the third minute from
six meters (yards) and Goran Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th from
nearly the same spot after he controlled a long, looping pass from
Goran Bunjevcevic and scored behind Metz goalkeeper Lionel Letizi.
	   The young, inexperienced Red Star team dominated most of the
match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in the first five
rounds in the French league, finally broke through when Bruno
Rodriguez scored in the 90th.
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Monaco _ semifinalists in last year's
Champions Cup _ got three second-half goals to win 3-1. Lodz took
the lead in the 10th on Piotr Matys' goal. Monaco equalized on a
own goal in the 59th by Witold Bendkowski. David Trezeguet made it
2-1 on a penalty in the 69th and Croatian international Robert
Spehar added the clincher in the 84th.
	   Monaco is unbeaten this season and beat league champion Lens 2-0
last week.
	   In Kosice, Slovakia, Czech-born Patrick Berger _ with friends in
the stands _ scored in the 18th for Liverpool on a free kick from
30 meters (yards). Karlheinz Riedle made it 2-0 on a close-in
header in the 23rd and Michael Owen capped it off, scoring in the
59th for a 3-0 Liverpool victory and a comfortable edge for the
second leg.
	   In Bari, Italy, Brazilian Edmundo scored twice in the second
half, including the winner with eight minutes left, to rally 10-man
Fiorentina past Croatia's Hajduk Split 2-1.
	   Fiorentina trailed 1-0 at halftime on Jurica Vucko's goal, but
Edmundo equalized in the 51st. The hosts had defender Moreno
Torricelli expelled in the 72nd, but Edmundo completed the comeback
with a rising blast from 12 meters (yards).
	   In Silkeborg, Denmark, Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev both
scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over Silkeborg.
	   The lone remaining UEFA game was set for Wednesday with
Anderlecht (Belgium) vs. Grasshopper (Switzerland).
	   In other early games:
	   Arges Pitesti 0, Celta Vigo 1; Brann, 2, Werder Bremen, 0;

Italy calls on Albania to bring killers to justice; no plans to

evacuate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	    &UR; EDS: SUBS 8th graf, Premier Romano to CORRECT typo in first
name to Fatos
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian military aircraft and ships were readied for
possible evacuation of Italian citizens from Albania's latest
violence, but no immediate exodus was planned, Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Tuesday.
	   Dini, briefing an emergency joint session of the foreign affairs
committee of the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies, called on
the Albanian government to bring to justice the killers of an
opposition leader whose death sparked the unrest in the Balkan
country.
	   He told lawmakers that the Albanian crisis was a ``test'' for
Italy because of the ``many Italian businessmen who have invested
their savings in Albania,'' because of the ``thousands of Albanian
refugees in Italy'' and because of the ``delicacy'' of the
situation in the troubled Balkan nation.
	   The last outbreak of violence in Albania, in 1997, sent
thousands of refugees fleeing across the Adriatic to Italy. Rome
sent most of them back when Albania calmed down.
	   Italian naval vessels kept up their regular patrol of the
Adriatic on the lookout for illegal immigrants, but no boatloads of
Albanians were spotted.
	   Italy also led a multinational military force deployed to
protect aid shipments to Albania in the wake of the 1997 uprising.
	   Dini said the only sure way to restore peace in Albania was to
bring to justice the killers of a popular opposition leader whose
death helped ignite the crisis. He warned that Italy's support is
``strictly conditioned on conduct inspired by moderation and
respect for the law, by both the government and the Albanian
opposition.''
	   Premier Romano Prodi, in telephone calls to Albania's premier,
Fatos Nano, and to its opposition leader Sali Berisha, said that
the Italian government would not recognize ``the result of the
exercise of violence as an instrument of political struggle in
Albania,'' Prodi's office said Tuesday evening. Prodi expressed
hope that all of Albania's political forces would find the courage
to resume dialogue without retaliation.

responsibility by journalists working in the age of Internet and

	   In a message sent on his behalf by the Vatican's secretary of

Mir's crew prepares for venture inside ruptured module
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with mission under way. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station began
a strenuous mission early Wednesday inside the airless Spektr
module in an effort to boost power supply.
	   Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev entered the module seconds
after midnight and were to spend about three hours in the vacuum of
space inside the Spektr, which was punctured in a June 1997
collision with a cargo ship.
	   The Spektr is sealed from the rest of the sprawling six-module
station and the crew had to lock themselves in a docking chamber
and don their spacesuits before opening the hatchway leading to the
module.
	   Their sole task was to fasten cables connecting two of the
module's solar panels to Mir's power system. The connections have
loosened since a previous crew made repairs during two previous
excursions inside the the Spektr last August and October.
	   ``It's as easy as sweeping your corridor,'' joked deputy Mission
Control chief Viktor Blagov.
	   In fact, making delicate cable connections in bulky spacesuits
and simply moving inside the dark truck-size module cramped with
equipment is a hard and risky undertaking.
	   Before the mission, the crew went through a series of exercises.
These included work in spacesuits at a life-size Spektr mock-up
submerged in a pool at the cosmonauts' training center near Moscow
that emulates conditions of weightlessness, said Mission Control
spokeswoman Irina Manshilina.
	   The extensive training was considered necessary for the crew to
get used to the Spektr's conditions and learn to move inside the
narrow space without ripping their spacesuits.
	   If things were to go awry, the crew had the option of boarding a
Soyuz escape capsule attached to a docking port near the Spektr.
	   Re-activating the Spektr's solar panels is essential to bring
Mir's power supply back to normal, space officials said.
	   ``We now have to turn the whole station toward the sun in order
to preserve power, while the normal mode of operation envisages
turning the panels,'' Blagov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russian space officials initially planned to patch up the
module, but then gave up the idea as they now plan to discard the
whole station next June because of a desperate cash shortage.
	   Mission Control allowed Padalka and Avdeyev to get up later than
usual on Tuesday to give them extra rest before the mission. They
examined their spacesuits and spent the day checking other
equipment and undergoing a long series of medical tests, Manshilina
said.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ There were no crooning lounge lizards,
and a few of the gamblers were just as worried about potential
terrorism as how their blackjack hands would play out.
	   But for most of the VIP crowd that turned out Tuesday for the
grand opening of the first casino in the Palestinian lands, the
question of safety was the same as it is every day in this part of
the world _ a roll of the dice.
	   The drls 50 million Oasis casino, a glitzy glass-and-stone
emporium set incongruously amid the arid moonscape of the Judean
desert, opened its doors Tuesday to a limited group of invitees,
and made ready for a larger gambling public to descend starting
Wednesday.
	   Only a half-hour from Jerusalem, on the outskirts of the
biblical town of Jericho, the casino aims to attract Israelis, who
cannot gamble legally at home, plus foreign tourists and
Palestinians who live in Israel.
	   Residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are being barred at
the request of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   At a blackjack table, Arabs from east Jerusalem sat side-by-side
with Israelis, laying down their bets.
	   ``There's no discrimination here _ it gives me a good feeling,''
said Palestinian Sami Alayan, 26, who owns a small construction
company. ``This will bring us together.''
	   At the roulette table, a Palestinian dealer was calling bets
when asked by a reporter: Will all this help bring peace?
	   ``It'll help our economy,'' the dealer said, then segued
smoothly back into his croupier's role. ``No more bets, please!''
he called.
	   Arafat's cash-strapped government hopes the casino will prove a
jackpot in the form of gaming taxes. But some Palestinians living
nearby fear that little of the wealth generated by the casino will
trickle down.
	   The contrasts of glamour and poverty are inescapable. The casino
is just across the street from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a
shantytown of dirt roads, water shortages and frequent power
outages.
	   While the VIPs arrived, a few locals lingered at the gate,
peeking in to try to catch a glimpse. But they were turned away by
guards.
	   Security was tight. Before bettors can roll the dice or play a
hand of blackjack, they face searches and metal detectors. When the
casino opens to the general public, gamblers will have to register
their passport numbers.
	   Michael Levy, 60, a surgeon from Tel Aviv who in the past made
several trips a year to London casinos, said he hoped to become a
regular at the Oasis. However, he said he was somewhat concerned
about possible terrorism. ``If there is even the slightest
incident, all the money invested here will go out the window,'' he
said.
	   The opening-night crowd quickly ballooned into the hundreds,
with buses rolling in from Tel Aviv and a steady stream of cars.
The casino lies just inside Palestinian territory, and the main
road to Jericho is controlled by Israel and well-patrolled by the
military, though there were no Israeli checkpoints Tuesday night.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had few areas of
agreement with the Palestinians of late, had nothing critical to
say about the Palestinian move into the gambling trade.
	   ``It's their choice _ we respect it,'' he said.
	   Islamic fundamentalists, however, are railing against the casino
as a den of iniquity. The militant Islamic group Hamas stopped
short of direct threats, but made clear its displeasure.
	   ``This is a indicator of corruption,'' the group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Tuesday in the Gaza Strip. ``In
the name of Hamas we condemn this project ... We are studying the
steps we shall take.''
	   The gala opening comes at a tense time. Hamas has threatened new
attacks against Israeli targets following last week's killing of
two of its top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   A little of the hoped-for grand-opening glitz was missing.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to have attended the opening,
canceled at the last minute. She cited other obligations, but an
Israeli newspaper speculated Tuesday that she may have feared for
her safety.
	   But the ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail
party, with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty
suits, chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot
machines. The music was taped big-band numbers, but casino
operators say later on there will be live acts.
	   The Austrian operators of the Oasis say the casino is only the
start of what will become the largest resort in the Middle East,
with three luxury hotels, golf courses and convention facilities
planned _ along with 5,000 high-paying jobs for Palestinians.
	   Officials were evasive about ownership. Casinos Austria has a 15
percent share, followed by 10 percent for the Austrian Union Bank.
The rest of the shares are held by private Palestinian and Austrian
investors, whose names were not released.

Annan: obstacles remain for vote in disputed Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief said Tuesday he was pleased
the effort to identify voters in the disputed Western Sahara was
nearly complete but added that administrative difficulties ``impede
progress'' toward the holding of a planned referendum.
	   In his monthly report to the Security Council, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan noted that the governments involved in Western Sahara
have yet to sign agreements that outline rules about where U.N.
workers can live, the use of property and other technical matters.
	   The Western Sahara is a disputed area of North Africa claimed
both by Morocco and the Polisario, a rebel group seeking
independence for the area's indigenous people. The two sides have
agreed to hold a referendum on the territory's future, and voters
will choose between independence for the region and integration
with Morocco.
	   A U.N. force has been trying to identify voters because of
disagreements about who is eligible to take part in a referendum.
The two sides have failed to resolve differences over identifying
voters among three Saharan tribes.
	   Annan said he was concerned that Morocco has ``yet to take
concrete action'' to enable the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
to prepare for the repatriation of Saharan refugees to vote.

	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Jon Dahl Tomasson notched two goals
and Feyenoord Rotterdam scored in quick succession in the first
half time to stun Stuttgart 3-1 in their UEFA Cup first-round,
first-leg match Tuesday.
	   The outcome left the Dutch team an overwhelming favorite to
advance to the second round.
	   Jean Paul Van Gastel took advantage of a fast counter-attack as
Feyenoord exploited Stuttgart's shaky defense to put the Dutch team
into the lead in the 19th minute.
	   Van Gastel approached the German goal unchallenged and unleashed
a curving shot from 25 meters (yards) that took goalkeeper Franz
Wohlfahrt by surprise.
	   Only two minutes later, Stuttgart, still stunned from the first
goal, conceded the second.
	   Julio Cruz, Feyenoord's Argentine forward, broke through but had
his effort blocked by two Stuttgart defenders, Thomas Berthold and
Frank Verlaat. But Tomasson, the Danish forward, sent the rebound
past Wohlfahrt, who was helpless this time.
	   Fredi Bobic put Stuttgart back into the match when he scored in
the 31st. Sreto Ristic, Stuttgart's Yugoslav forward, shook off
Bert Konterman and slipped a past to Bobic, who slammed the ball
home from close range.
	   But Stuttgart's hopes lasted only one minute.
	   Cruz sent a clever through pass to Tomasson, who easily outran
Berthold, Stuttgart's veteran defender, and slipped the ball past
Wohlfahrt.
	   Ristic came close early in the second half, bit his header from
close range was saved by Jurek Dudek, the Feyenoord goalkeeper.
	   On the other side, Wohlfahrt had to stretch to palm away a shot
by Cruz and Tomasson, completely free after another fast
counter-attack, shot high from 12 meters (yards).
	   Rowdy Dutch fans tore down one of the fences separating the
stands form the field after the early Feyenoord goals and clashed
with security forces.
	   Several fans were arrested, while one security guard was carried
off the field injured. His condition was not immediately known.
	   Riot police ringed off the section of the stands filled with
Dutch fans.
	   Fearing clashes, German authorities sent 1,000 policemen and 500
other security guards to provide security at the match.
	   Some 25,000 fans watched the match.

Iranian leader orders military, top officials on full alert
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with nationwide demonstrations called for
Friday, statements from Iran's Parliament, Taliban leader and
Taliban diplomat in Riyadh. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran called Tuesday for nationwide
demonstrations to protest the slayings of nine Iranians in
Afghanistan, and Iran's supreme leader put the military and top
civilian leaders on alert.
	   The government-run Islamic Propagation Coordination Council
called on the public to turn out for protest rallies following
Friday prayers, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, the leadership of the Parliament warned that the
situation in Afghanistan ``will turn into a regional and
trans-regional crisis'' and urged Islamic nations to meet to
counter the threat, IRNA said.
	   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the
military and top civilian officials put on full alert amid
heightened tension with Afghanistan.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday. Khamenei is
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
Thursday, when the Taliban admitted to killing eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to the border
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   On Tuesday, thousands of Iranians staged a march in Qom, south
of Tehran, to condemn the killing of the diplomats, Iranian
television reported.
	   The demonstrators ``declared their hatred of the Taliban and
their foreign supporters, especially Pakistan and America ... and
expressed their readiness to implement the instructions issued by
the commander-in-chief of the armed forces,'' the broadcast said.
	   In Afghanistan, meanwhile, Taliban-run Radio Shariat quoted the
Taliban leader as urging the United Nations to censure Iran for
allegedly providing military aid to opposition Shiite Muslims.
	   ``The U.N. must stop Iran's interference in Afghanistan's
affairs,'' the radio quoted Mullah Mohammed Omar as saying.
	   The Taliban routinely accuses Iran of sending arms and
ammunition to its Shiite Muslim opponents.
	   The Taliban, a Sunni Muslim group, is currently locked in a
ferocious battle with opposition fighters in central Bamiyan
province, where it has made significant territorial gains in recent
days.
	   On Monday Khamenei said that unless Pakistan stops supporting
the Taliban and persuades the militia's leaders to end the
country's civil war, the entire region will be in danger.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, is
widely believed to be supported by Pakistan. Iran has urged a
government be formed of all Afghan factions.
	   Iran continues to accuse the Taliban of holding some 40 truck
drivers who were taken prisoner when Mazar-e-Sharif fell last
month.
	   In the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, Taliban representative
Mawlawi Shehabuldin was quoted as saying that the militia was ready
to exchange the drivers for Afghan opposition leaders who have
sought refuge in Iran.
	   Shehabuldin also accused Iran of holding ``dozens of Taliban
fighters'' as captives.
	   He made the remarks in an interview with the London-based
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat which was to be published Wednesday.
	   The paper quoted him as saying the Taliban does not want war
with Iran but that ``we are ready to encounter and fight against
any outside Iranian invasion.''

British Airways negotiating London-Havana-Grand Cayman route
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE TOWN, Grand Cayman (AP) _ British Airways is negotiating
with the Cuban government to fly from London to Havana, and use a
new Boeing 777 jumbo jet.
	   The proposed route, which could be added as early as this
winter, would continue from Havana to Grand Cayman.
	   ``It can't be confirmed that we will fly the route, but we have
been looking at Cuba with a view to starting as soon as possible,''
BA spokesman Sandy Gardiner said in a telephone interview from New
York City this week.
	   Gardiner said they were proposing a weekly return flight with
the Boeing 777 that soon will replace a DC-10 on the route to Grand
Cayman, a British Caribbean territory.
	   Sources close to the negotiations said the Cubans were balking
at the possibility of BA carrying passengers from Grand Cayman to
Cuba, a route currently served by aging Russian-made turboprops
from the national Air Cubana airline.
	   The new Boeings can carry more than 400 passengers, compared to
330 on the DC-10. They also need less runway than the old 747s,
making them more viable at small airports in the Caribbean.

European Union traffic ministers agree to open rail transport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FELDKIRCH, Austria (AP) _ Transportation ministers within the
European Union have agreed on a long-term controlled deregulation
of Europe's rail shipping companies, Austria's transport minister
said Tuesday.
	   Speaking at a news conference on the first of a two-day informal
meeting of EU transportation ministers, Austrian Minister of
Traffic and Transport Caspar Einem said the majority of the 15
member states backed the decision.
	   Einem said most of the EU recognized the importance of
deregulating the railway industry, as increased competition will
make shipping goods by train more efficient, cost effective and
environmentally sound.
	   During the transition period, which would not be complete before
2000, a temporary regulatory body would be set up to help increase
cooperation between the different rail companies and to bring all
of the railways up to equal technological levels.
	   The ministers gathered in Feldkirch, 240 kilometers (180 miles)
southwest of the Austrian capital Vienna for informal discussion on
traffic and transportation issues within the EU.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union.

Tampa Bay Lightning defeats European champs 4-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FELDKIRCH, Austria (AP) _ The Tampa Bay Lightning kickstarted
pre-season training camp with a solid 4-1 defeat over European
League champions Feldkirch on Tuesday in the opening match of the
International Challenge tournament.
	   Playing with NHL rules and referees but on the larger European
ice, the Florida team, which had the worst record in the NHL last
season, had little trouble showing there is still a big gap in the
way the game is played on the two continents.
	   In front of some 5,500 relentless foot-stomping fans, Tampa Bay
opened scoring when Craig Janney, acquired from Phoenix in June,
knocked in a loose puck to account for all the first period
scoring.
	   Defenceman Pavel Kubina slammed home a drop pass from Mikael
Andersson, and Paul Ysebaert also found the back of Feldkirch net
as the Lightning went up 3-0 after two periods.
	   Acquired from Washington this season, Bill Ranford saw his first
real action of the year when Feldkirch scored their lone goal with
just 10 minutes remaining.
	   It was former-Canadian Rick Nasheim who saved face for
Feldkirch, drilling the puck from the top of the left circle to get
it past Ranford, who took over from Corey Schwab mid-way through
the second period.
	   Rob Zamuner answered with an empty net goal with just 43 seconds
remaining.
	   ``We were a little nervous going in,'' said Tampa Bay head coach
Jacques Demers. ``Feldkirch are the European champions and you have
to respect that.''
	   With its newly reinforced team, including the 1998 first overall
entry draft pick Vincent Lecavalier and former-Maple Leaf Wendel
Clark, Tampa Bay is playing in the tournament, along with the
Buffalo Sabres, as part of an NHL bid to promote hockey and NHL
marketing throughout Europe.
	   The Sabres will take on Austrian League runners-up Klagenfurt on
Wednesday, before the final showcase event Friday when the two NHL
teams meet and the two Austrian clubs face each other.
	   John Cullen, returning after a year-long battle with cancer, is
expected to make his comeback against Buffalo on Friday.

Fenerbache upsets Parma; Feyenoord dumps Stuttgart
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Aston Villa losing, Feyenoord beating Stuttgart; other
scores &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Fenerbache _ with a hefty financial bonus
reportedly on the line _ upset AC Parma 1-0 Tuesday as this
season's UEFA Cup kicked off with 31 first-round, first-leg
matches.
	   The other stunner saw Dutch leaders Feyenoord win at Stuttgart
3-1, a match in which rowdy Dutch fans clashed with a heavy police
presence estimated a 1,000 with 500 more security guards on duty.
	   In key other games, Red Star Belgrade, Monaco, Liverpool and
Fiorentina got off to winning starts.
	   Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan scored for Fenerbache on a
header in the 23rd off a free kick from Bosnian Elvir Balic. The
Turkish side failed to increase the margin despite a man advantage
for the last 30 minutes when Dino Baggio was sent off _ and a
two-man edge the last two minutes when Fabio Cannavaro was
dispatched.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage, which means surviving in the
second leg in two weeks against Parma, winners of the '93 Cup
Winners Cup, '95 UEFA Cup and players last season in the Champions
League.
	   In Stuttgart, Jon Dahl Tomasson notched two first-half goals as
Feyenoord Rotterdam shocked Stuttgart 3-1 before 25,000 home fans
in Germany.
	   Jean Paul Van Gastel put the Dutch ahead in the 19th and
Tomasson scored two minutes later to make it 2-0. Fredi Bobic got
Stuttgart back into the game with a goal in the 31st but Tomasson
scored again a minute later.
	   Notorious Dutch fans tore down one of the fences separating the
stands from the field. Several fans were arrested, while one
security guard was carried off injured. His condition was not
immediately known. Riot police ringed off the section of the stands
filled with Dutch fans.
	   Fearing clashes, German authorities sent 1,000 policemen and 500
security guards to the match.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Red Star Belgrade scored in the first
12 minutes and dominated only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 win.
	   Perica Ognjenovic opened the scoring in the third minute from
six meters (yards) and Goran Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th from
nearly the same spot.
	   The young, inexperienced Red Star team dominated most of the
match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in the first five
rounds in the French league, finally broke through when Bruno
Rodriguez scored in the 90th.
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Monaco _ semifinalists in last year's
Champions Cup _ got three second-half goals to win 3-1. Lodz took
the lead in the 10th on Piotr Matys' goal. Monaco equalized on a
own goal in the 59th by Witold Bendkowski. David Trezeguet made it
2-1 on a penalty in the 69th and Croatian international Robert
Spehar added the clincher in the 84th.
	   Monaco is unbeaten this season and beat league champion Lens 2-0
last week.
	   In Bratislava, Slovakia, Czech-born Patrick Berger _ with
friends in the stands _ scored in the 18th for Liverpool on a free
kick from 30 meters (yards). Karlheinz Riedle made it 2-0 on a
close-in header in the 23rd and Michael Owen capped it off, scoring
in the 59th for a 3-0 Liverpool victory and a comfortable edge for
the second leg.
	   In Bari, Italy, Brazilian Edmundo scored twice in the second
half, including the winner with eight minutes left, to rally 10-man
Fiorentina past Croatia's Hajduk Split 2-1.
	   Fiorentina trailed 1-0 at halftime on Jurica Vucko's goal, but
Edmundo equalized in the 51st. The hosts had defender Moreno
Torricelli expelled in the 72nd, but Edmundo completed the comeback
with a rising blast from 12 meters (yards).
	   In Silkeborg, Denmark, Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev both
scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over Silkeborg.
	   In Birmingham, England, English league leaders Aston Villa
suffered a crucial loss 2-1 to Norway's Stromsgodset with goals
from Anders Michelsen (21st) and Christer George (23rd). Villa's
Gary Charles scored in the 83rd to give Villa a chance in the away
leg second leg.
	   The lone remaining UEFA game was set for Wednesday with
Anderlecht (Belgium) vs. Grasshopper (Switzerland).
	   In other games:
	   Arges Pitesti 0, Celta Vigo 1; Brann, 2, Werder Bremen, 0;

In land of real-life roulette, new West Bank casino's a gamble

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ There were no crooning lounge lizards,
and a few of the gamblers were as worried about terrorism as how
their blackjack hands would play out.
	   But for most of the VIP crowd at Tuesday's grand opening of the
first casino in the Palestinian lands, the question of safety was
the same as it is every day in this part of the world _ a roll of
the dice.
	   The dlrs 50 million Oasis casino, a glitzy glass-and-stone
emporium in the arid moonscape of the Judean desert, opened its
doors to a limited group of invitees and prepared for the gambling
public to descend starting Wednesday.
	   Only a half-hour from Jerusalem, on the outskirts of the
biblical town of Jericho, the casino _ eventually to be joined by
luxury hotels and golf courses _ is hoped to attract foreign
tourists, Israelis, and Palestinians who live in Israel. Residents
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are being barred at the request of
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   That request apparently was made in part to appease Arafat's
Islamic opposition, which has condemned gambling as sinful and said
Tuesday that it was considering what steps to take now that the
casino is open.
	   At a blackjack table, Arabs from east Jerusalem, which is
controlled by Israel but also claimed by the Palestinians, sat
alongside Israelis, laying down their bets.
	   ``There's no discrimination here _ it gives me a good feeling,''
said Sami Alayan, a 26-year-old Palestinian who owns a small
construction company. ``This will bring us together.''
	   Michael Levy, a 60-year-old surgeon from Tel Aviv, said he hopes
to become a regular at the Oasis although he is somewhat concerned
it could become a target for terror attacks.
	   ``If there's even the slightest incident here, all the money
invested will go out the window,'' Levy said.
	   At the roulette table, a Palestinian was calling bets when asked
whether the casino will help bring peace.
	   ``It'll help our economy,'' the dealer said, then segued
smoothly back into his croupier's role. ``No more bets, please!''
he called.
	   Arafat's cash-strapped government hopes the casino will prove a
jackpot in the form of taxes. But some Palestinians living nearby
fear that little of the wealth generated by the casino will trickle
down.
	   The contrasts of glamour and poverty are inescapable. The casino
is just across the street from the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp, a
shantytown of dirt roads, water shortages and frequent power
outages.
	   While the VIPs arrived, a few locals lingered at the gate,
peeking in to try to catch a glimpse. Guards turned them away.
	   Security was tight. Before bettors could roll the dice or play a
hand of blackjack, they were searched and scanned by metal
detectors. When the casino opens to the general public, gamblers
will have to register their passport numbers.
	   The opening-night crowd quickly ballooned into the hundreds,
with buses rolling in from Tel Aviv and a steady stream of cars.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had few areas of
agreement with the Palestinians of late, had nothing critical to
say about the Palestinian move into the gambling trade.
	   ``It's their choice _ we respect it,'' he said. Gambling is
illegal in Israel.
	   Islamic fundamentalists, however, are railing against the casino
as a den of iniquity. The militant Islamic group Hamas stopped
short of direct threats, but made clear its displeasure.
	   ``This is an indicator of corruption,'' the group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Tuesday in the Gaza Strip. ``In
the name of Hamas we condemn this project. ... We are studying the
steps we shall take.''
	   The gala opening comes at a tense time. Hamas has threatened new
attacks against Israeli targets following last week's killing of
two of its top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   A little of the hoped-for grand-opening glitz was missing.
Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who was to have attended, canceled at
the last minute citing other obligations.
	   But the ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail
party, with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty
suits, chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot
machines. The music was taped big-band numbers, but casino
operators say live acts will come later.
	   The Austrian operators of the Oasis say the casino is only the
start of what will become the largest resort in the Middle East,
with three luxury hotels, golf courses and convention facilities
planned _ along with 5,000 high-paying jobs for Palestinians.

Borg beats McEnroe in charity game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SODERTALJE, Sweden (AP) _ Bjorn Borg Tuesday beat John McEnroe
6-4, 4-6, 6-4 as the two former tennis greats clashed in a charity
game in Borg's home town Sodertalje.
	   But no quarters were given in the two-hour-long battle where the
6,500 people in the capacity-filled Scaniarinken were able to
revive what these guys could do with a tennis ball. Both players
excelled in passing shots and volleys in a match rated by tennis
commentators and coaches as a far better than they had expected.
	   ``Both players were impressive. Borg was playing a lot better
compared to when he launched his unsuccessful comeback in Monaco in
the late 80`s,'' said Percy Rosberg, who coached Borg before he had
his international breakthrough.
	   ``And McEnroe did a lot more than could be expected by someone
who arrived here in the morning after an Atlantic flight. He
definitely showed glimpses of his greatness, '' Rosberg added.
	   It was a match that neither of them wanted to lose. Borg, who
had trained two hours every day for the last three weeks, broke the
American twice to clinch the first set 6-4. Then McEnroe bounced
back, taking the second set 6-4 after breaking Borg twice. In the
decider both players held service until the tenth game when Borg
broke McEnroe to clinch the match.

Beatles lyrics notebook to be a 21st birthday surprise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to include name of buyer in graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A notebook containing draft Beatles lyrics for
``Hey Jude'' and ``Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''
fetched 100,000 pounds (dlrs. 168,000) at a Sotheby's auction on
Tuesday.
	   Alan Murphy, a private collector from Liverpool _ birthplace of
the Beatles _ bought the spiral-bound book as a surprise for his
daughter's 21st birthday. His daughter, Davinia, plays a character
called ``Jude'' in a British soap opera.
	   The notebook, which also includes doodles by John Lennon, was
sold as part of a Sotheby's sale of rock 'n' roll memorabilia at
the Hard Rock Cafe. Sotheby's had expected it to fetch between
dlrs. 150,000 and dlrs. 200,000.
	   Filled with scribbles and brightly colored ink, the notebook
covers 18 months of 1967-68, when the Beatles were at the top of
the charts releasing albums including ``Sergeant Pepper'' and ``The
Beatles'' _ more commonly known as the White Album.
	   The group's road manager, Mal Evans, compiled it. He was killed
by police in Los Angeles in 1976 after brandishing a fake gun.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Economists said Tuesday the new
government's austerity package was badly needed to ease Ecuador's
financial crisis, but labor leaders immediately called for street
protests to block the tough measures.
	   President Jamil Mahuad, who took office Aug. 10, announced an
emergency economic rescue package late Monday that devalued
Ecuador's currency, the sucre, ended subsidies on electricity,
cooking gas and diesel oil, and promised to trim the bloated public
payroll.
	   The sucre fell by nearly 10 percent Monday after the government
shifted the band within which the sucre is allowed to trade
downwards by 15 percent. The sucre has fallen nearly 39 percent
this year, including the latest drop. Late Tuesday afternoon, the
currency was bid at 6,070 sucres to the dollar, compared with 6,150
bid on Monday.
	   The sucre's devaluation comes nearly two weeks after neighboring
Colombia reduced the value of its currency.
	   Despite Ecuador having one of Latin America's smallest
economies, the devaluation heightened fears of the spread of
financial instability in the region, which has been battered by
recent the global turbulence that began in Asia more than a year
ago.
	   Economists greeted the package with relief, saying it had been
needed for years. But they warned that past governments had
promised reform only to be forced to back down by militant labor
unions and leftist opposition.
	   ``What is needed now is a true restructuring of public spending
and a reduction in the bloated bureaucracy to achieve sustainable
growth,'' said Alvaro Cortez, a trader for the Ecuadorean stock
brokerage firm Vicadal.
	   Mahuad said in a nationally televised address that he
implemented the package to ``prevent a catastrophe.''
	   The reforms were aimed at reducing annual inflation that exceeds
40 percent, one of the highest in Latin America, and reduce
Ecuador's ballooning budget deficit, which has the nation on the
verge of bankruptcy.
	   Labor leaders vowed to block the reforms, which will increase
the price of cooking gas 400 percent, more than double electricity
rates and increase the price of diesel fuel by 39 percent.
	   ``The workers are going to fill the streets and protest. We've
toppled other governments for much less than this,'' said Jose
Chavez, leader of Ecuador's largest labor federation, the
leftist-dominated Unified Workers Front.
	   Former President Abdala Bucaram was removed from power in
February 1997 by Congress amid massive street protests set off by
similar austerity measures.
	   The government will hand out welfare coupons for about dlrs
16.40 a month per person to the poor to cushion the effects of the
price increases, Mahuad said.
	   Ecuador has been hit hard by slumping world oil prices and the
Asian economic crisis. Asian countries are among the main
purchasers of its three principal exports _ oil, bananas and
shrimp.

Villa snatches a 3-2 win over Stromsgodset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Premier League leaders Aston Villa
scored three late goals to snatch a 3-2 win over Stromgodset in the
UEFA Cup first-round, first-leg match at Villa Park on Tuesday.
	   Villa loomed as upset losers to the Norwegians until the last
minute of regular time when Darius Vassell scored the equalizer.
	   Vassell struck again in injury time to score the clincher and
salvage a stunning victory.
	   The England under-18 striker, an 80th minute substitute, turned
the game when he netted his first.
	   Within four minutes he swooped on a rebound off goalkeerp Arne
Hansen to score the winner.
	   Villa was stunned when the visitors scored two goals within two
minutes midway through the first half.
	   Stromgodset held a 2-0 lead until the 83rd minute when Gary
Charles scored the first of Villa's three goals.
	   A brilliant save by Villa's Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich
midway through the second half was a major factor in the win.
	   England defender Gareth Southgate contributed to Stromgodset's
first goal in the 21st minute when he was dis-possessed by Anders
Michelsen, who went on to beat Bosnich in a one-on-one challenge.
	   Bosnich blocked Michelsen's first strike but couldn't back up to
stop the Norwegian's second attempt off the rebound.
	   Substitute Christer George doubled Stromgodset's lead two
minutes later when he sent the ball wide of Bosnich after Rene
Hagen had beaten some slack defense down the right flank.
	   Villa missed chances to reduce the margin early in the second
half but still trailed 2-0 when a spectacular save by Bosnich,
blocking another attempt from Michelsen, stopped the home side
conceding a vital third goal.

Mexico's TV Azteca announces cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's No. 2 television broadcaster, TV
Azteca, said Tuesday it would slow expansion and cut spending in an
effort to prepare for a slowdown in the Mexican economy.
	   The company said it would cut top executive pay by 10 percent
and slash sales and administrative costs by 20 percent.
	   Planned investment spending for 1998 would drop to dlrs 25
million from dlrs 35 million, the broadcaster said.
	   ``Our plan is very simple,'' said Ricardo Salinas Pliego,
chairman and chief executive officer. ``Our cash reserves must be
maintained.''
	   Salinas Pliego said the 10 percent executive pay cut would send
a ``strong message'' about the need for all employees to make
sacrifices.
	   He said TV Azteca had dlrs 578 million in debt as of June 30,
including dlrs 125 million due in 2004 and dlrs 300 million in
2007.
	   Planned spending on programming and production will be unchanged
the rest of the year.
	   Last year, TV Azteca announced plans to buy television stations
throughout Latin America and the U.S. It has stakes in stations in
Chile, El Salvador and Costa Rica.
	   TV Azteca said its international expansion plans are in ``slight
recess,'' although it would continue to evaluate opportunities in
Latin America and the United States.
	   ``We're cautiously optimistic about Mexico's ability to face the
current instability in world markets,'' Salinas Pliego said. He
said the financial crisis in 1995 indicated the need to prepare for
currency devaluations and economic sluggishness.

Fenerbache upsets Parma; Feyenoord wins at Stuttgart 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Villa score to 3-2 win &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Fenerbache _ with a hefty financial bonus
reportedly on the line _ upset AC Parma 1-0 Tuesday as this
season's UEFA Cup kicked off with 31 first-round, first-leg
matches.
	   The other stunner saw Dutch leaders Feyenoord win at Stuttgart
3-1, a match in which Dutch hooligans clashed with a heavy police
presence estimated a 1,000 with 500 more security guards on duty.
	   In key other games, Red Star Belgrade, Monaco, Liverpool and
Fiorentina got off to winning starts.
	   Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan scored for Fenerbache on a
header in the 23rd off a free kick from Bosnian Elvir Balic. The
Turkish side failed to increase the margin despite a man advantage
for the last 30 minutes when Dino Baggio was sent off _ and a
two-man edge the last two minutes when Fabio Cannavaro was
dispatched.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage, which means surviving in the
second leg in two weeks against Parma, winners of the '93 Cup
Winners Cup, '95 UEFA Cup and players last season in the Champions
League.
	   In Stuttgart, Jon Dahl Tomasson notched two first-half goals as
Feyenoord Rotterdam shocked Stuttgart 3-1 before 25,000 home fans
in Germany.
	   Jean Paul Van Gastel put the Dutch ahead in the 19th and
Tomasson scored two minutes later to make it 2-0. Fredi Bobic got
Stuttgart back into the game with a goal in the 31st but Tomasson
scored again a minute later.
	   Notorious Dutch fans tore down one of the fences separating the
stands from the field. Several fans were arrested, while one
security guard was carried off injured. His condition was not
immediately known. Riot police ringed off the section of the stands
filled with Dutch fans.
	   Fearing clashes, German authorities sent 1,000 policemen and 500
security guards to the match.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Red Star Belgrade scored twice in the
first 12 minutes and dominated only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 win.
	   Perica Ognjenovic scored in the third minute from six meters
(yards) and Goran Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th from nearly the
same spot.
	   The young, inexperienced Red Star team dominated most of the
match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in the first five
rounds in the French league, finally broke through when Bruno
Rodriguez scored in the 90th.
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Monaco _ semifinalists in last year's
Champions Cup _ got three second-half goals to win 3-1. Lodz took
the lead in the 10th on Piotr Matys' goal. Monaco equalized on a
own goal in the 59th by Witold Bendkowski. David Trezeguet made it
2-1 on a penalty in the 69th and Croatian international Robert
Spehar added the clincher in the 84th.
	   Monaco is unbeaten this season and beat league champion Lens 2-0
last week.
	   In Bratislava, Slovakia, Czech-born Patrick Berger _ with
friends in the stands _ scored in the 18th for Liverpool on a free
kick from 30 meters (yards). Karlheinz Riedle made it 2-0 on a
close-in header in the 23rd and Michael Owen capped it off, scoring
in the 59th for a 3-0 Liverpool victory and a comfortable edge for
the second leg.
	   In Bari, Italy, Brazilian Edmundo scored twice in the second
half, including the winner with eight minutes left, to rally 10-man
Fiorentina past Croatia's Hajduk Split 2-1.
	   Fiorentina trailed 1-0 at halftime on Jurica Vucko's goal, but
Edmundo equalized in the 51st. The hosts had defender Moreno
Torricelli expelled in the 72nd, but Edmundo completed the comeback
with a rising blast from 12 meters (yards).
	   In Birmingham, England, English league leaders Aston Villa
survived 3-2 against Norway's Stromsgodset. Anders Michelsen (21st)
and Christer George (23rd) scored for the Norwegians, but Villa
rallied with three late goals from Gary Charles (83rd) and Darius
Vassell with two goals in injury time.
	   In Silkeborg, Denmark, Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev both
scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over Silkeborg.
	   The lone remaining UEFA game _ the 32nd _ was set for Wednesday
with Anderlecht (Belgium) vs. Grasshopper (Switzerland).
	   In other games:
	   Arges Pitesti 0, Celta Vigo 1; Brann, 2, Werder Bremen, 0;

Aggressive therapy may be best for high-risk patients, studies
</HEADLINE>
suggest &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDSEY TANNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A study suggests that men with fast-growing
prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body fare
much better if treated with surgery or traditional radiation rather
than implanted radioactive ``seeds,'' an increasingly popular
approach.
	   A second study appears to suggest that in cases of fast-growing
prostate cancer, doctors may want to rethink the practice of
``watchful waiting,'' in which older men are left untreated on the
assumption that other ailments are more likely to kill them first.
	   Both studies, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, buttress previous research.
	   If confirmed by further research, the studies could help doctors
and patients choose the most appropriate treatment for what is the
second-leading cancer killer of men, behind lung cancer.
	   An estimated 184,500 men nationwide will be diagnosed this year
with cancer of the prostate, a walnut-sized gland that is involved
in semen production. Nearly one fifth of them will die, according
to the American Cancer Society.
	   The first study may dampen the popularity of brachytherapy, in
which tiny ``seeds'' of radioactive material are injected into the
prostate.
	   Brachytherapy has become more prevalent in the past decade
because it causes fewer of the side effects associated with
prostate cancer treatment such as impotence and incontinence. The
seeds also tend to require only an overnight stay at a hospital and
no follow-up treatments.
	   Researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of
Pennsylvania looked at the treatment of 1,872 men with slow-,
medium- or fast-growing tumors. The men received either a radical
prostatectomy, which involves the removal of the prostate plus
surrounding tissue; traditional radiation; or brachytherapy.
	   The study found that brachytherapy patients with the most
aggressive tumors were as much as twice as likely to have their
cancer recur within four or five years as men who had surgery or
traditional radiation.
	   Brachytherapy patients with medium-growing tumors were more than
three times as likely to have their cancer recur within five years
as men who had surgery or traditional radiation. However, the
brachytherapy patients fared as well as the others if hormone
therapy was used, according to the study, led by Harvard radiation
oncologist Dr. Anthony D'Amico.
	   Those with slow-growing cancer _ which constitutes only about 20
percent of all diagnoses nationwide _ fared equally well regardless
of which treatment they received.
	   In the second study, University of Connecticut Health Center
researchers studied 767 patients who received minimal treatment.
Those with the most aggressive tumors faced a 60 percent to 87
percent chance of dying from the disease within 15 years of
diagnosis, even up to age 74.
	   The risk of death for those with medium tumors was anywhere from
6 percent to 70 percent, and for those with slow-growing tumors it
was 4 percent to 7 percent.
	   ``This study strongly showed that the only men your could write
off are the men after age 74,'' said Dr. William Catalona, chief of
urology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
``It appears that early diagnosis and treatment would be
warranted'' in men 74 and younger.

Borg beats McEnroe in charity game

<TEXT>
	   SODERTALJE, Sweden (AP) _ Bjorn Borg beat John McEnroe 6-4, 4-6,
6-4 on Tuesday as the two former tennis greats clashed in a charity
game in Borg's home town Sodertalje.
	   Borg, who had trained two hours every day for the last three
weeks, broke the American twice to clinch the first set 6-4. Then
McEnroe bounced back, taking the second set 6-4 after breaking Borg
twice. In the decider both players held service until the tenth
game, when Borg broke McEnroe to clinch the match.
	   Tennis commentators and coaches said the match was far better
than they had expected.
	   ``Both players were impressive. Borg was playing a lot better
compared to when he launched his unsuccessful comeback in Monaco in
the late 80s,'' said Percy Rosberg, who coached Borg before he had
his international breakthrough.
	   ``And McEnroe did a lot more than could be expected by someone
who arrived here in the morning after an Atlantic flight. He
definitely showed glimpses of his greatness, '' Rosberg said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The government will spend dlrs 2 million this
year to restore 12 of the most important archeological and
colonial-era sites in the Yucatan Peninsula.
	   The restoration will help the southern region attract additional
tourists, Alfredo Barrera Rubio of the National Institute for
Anthropology and History told the Notimex news agency on Tuesday.
	   The projects also will create 1,500 temporary jobs in the
region, he said. The money for the projects comes from government
social development and cultural service agencies.
	   Maya culture flourished in the Yucatan from the year 600 to 900.
Spanish explorers landed on the peninsula in 1519, leading the way
for colonial settlers.

series of medical tests because of intense back pains caused by a
hernia, and ``everything is fine,'' his office reported Tuesday.
	   The 82-year-old former dictator, who now holds a lifetime Senate
seat, spent several hours at the Santiago Military Hospital on
Monday and then ``resumed his activities,'' said one of his
secretaries, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   She said published reports that Pinochet remained hospitalized
``are totally untrue.'' In fact, Pinochet was at his office Tuesday
morning.
	   In an interview published last week, Pinochet said he was having
troubles walking because of the pain from the hernia.
	   The Santiago newspaper La Hora said Tuesday that Pinochet wanted
to undergo surgery to correct the hernia, but his doctors
discouraged him because of his age.
	   Pinochet*s health is generally considered good, although he has
used a pacemaker for several years.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Health authorities in the Pacific resort city
of Mazatlan called for urgent action after reporting the discovery
of 23 new cases of dengue on Tuesday.
	   Health workers were dispatched to neighborhoods to watch for
signs of the mosquito-spread virus characterized by fever, joint
pain, chills and, in serious cases, hemorrhaging, the government
news agency Notimex reported.
	   Local officials have ordered crews to fumigate fields and
neighborhoods to destroy mosquitoes and their larva.
	   Doctors discovered the new cases after examining 40 people
suspected of being infected. One of the 23 positive cases proved to
be hemorrhagic dengue, which can be fatal, said Raul Vizcarra,
chief of the local health district.
	   On Monday, Vizcarra had said that only three dengue cases had
been detected in Mazatlan and that authorities believed they were
isolated cases.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An illegal tap on a fuel pipeline in central
Mexico caused more than 66,000 gallons of gasoline to spill, the
state oil company Pemex said Tuesday.
	   Workers repaired the faulty valve Sunday in the Hidalgo town of
Bomintzha, 40 miles (65 kms) north of Mexico City, and finished
cleaning up the spilled fuel late Monday, the company announced.
	   Pemex said it was the 176th time this year that it has
discovered an illegal tap on its pipelines. It urged local
authorities to help fight such theft.
	   Pemex said installation of an automatic pipeline control system
underway in central Mexico would help to detect such incidents in
the future.

Atletico de Madrid wins 2-0 over Obilic of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Osvaldo Giroldo Juninho led Atletico de
Madrid to a 2-0 victory over Obilic of Yugoslavia on Tuesday in a
first-round UEFA Cup match.
	   Juninho scored in the 15th minute after intercepting a pass
intended for the Yugoslav goalkeeper Nenad Lukic.
	   Jose Maria Romero added another goal in the 53rd minute,
deflecting the ball in as he fell in front of Lukic after a pass
from Carlos Aguilera.
	   Obilic, playing its first European match, is the defending
champion of the Yugoslav league after just one year in the first
division. The two teams play the return match in two weeks in
Belgrade.
	   Obilic's president is Zelko Raznatovic, a former Serb
paramilitary leader known as 'Arkan' who is wanted by the west for
war crimes he allegedly committed during the Bosnian war.
	   Since he faces arrest if he leaves Yugoslavia, Raznatovic's wife
Svetlana represented him at the game in Madrid.

UNITED NATIONS: report said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Human rights officials have been anxiously awaiting the report,
fearing that it wouldn't take a strong enough stand against the
violence that has wracked the country for six years.
	   The insurgency began after the army cancelled parliamentary
elections in January 1992 that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, an estimated 75,000 people have been killed.
	   While the government blames Muslim insurgents for the massacres,
human rights groups say the government is responsible for torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   Algeria had long rejected any outside probe into the violence,
claiming it was an internal matter. The government relented in
July, and a group of ``eminent persons'' chosen by the U.N. chief
visited Algeria in July and August.
	   The team, however, said the Algerian government had prevented
them from meeting with key opposition officials they wanted to see.
Among them was the leader of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front,
Abassi Madani, who is under house arrest, and Ali Belhadj, his
second in command, who is imprisoned.
	   The Algerian government said the team couldn't meet with the
leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front because they were ``outside
the framework of legality,'' or that their whereabouts weren't
known, said the report.
	   Security concerns were also given as a reason for not allowing
the team to meet with representatives of Berber cultural movements.
	   The report doesn't single out the government for any role in the
attacks and instead condemns terrorism as a whole.
	   It does say, however, that Algeria's ``law-enforcement, security
and self-defense forces should be held to strict standards of
accountability so that the Algerian population and the
international community at large will feel confident that the rule
of law prevails in Algeria.''
	   The team was headed by the former president of Portugal, Mario
Soares. Other team members were a former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, Donald McHenry; former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral; former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti;
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako; and former French Health
Minister Simone Veil.

Palestinians angered over Israeli burial of Hamas brothers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials expressed anger Tuesday
at Israel's refusal to hand over the bodies of two members of the
Islamic militant group Hamas killed last week by Israeli troops,
and warned that the incident could lead to retaliatory attacks.
	   Israeli military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Adel and Imad Awadallah were buried at a cemetery reserved for
the graves of ``enemies of Israel.''
	   Israeli soldiers shot and killed the Awadallah brothers last
Thursday in a cottage near the West Bank city of Hebron. The two
were high on Israel's most-wanted list for their alleged role in
Hamas bombings that have killed several Israelis.
	   Ahmed Tibi, an advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
called the Israeli burial ``an inhumane decision and a risky
step.'' Tibi said any Israeli plan to use the bodies as bargaining
chips in possible exchanges with Hamas would backfire and was ``an
indirect invitation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.''
	   Israel's army radio said the Awadallah family had asked several
other Palestinian officials to try and retrieve the bodies for
Muslim burial. The radio also reported that Israel had purposely
left the graves unmarked to prevent Hamas from snatching the
remains.
	   ``The Israeli authorities know the Palestinian position is to
deliver the bodies to the families,'' Tibi said.
	   Hamas has vowed revenge attacks for the killing of the brothers,
which Israeli security officials said had dealt a severe blow to
the group.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. team sent to Algeria to look into
the six-year Muslim insurgency condemned the extremism that has
spurred the violence but also called on the government to rein in
its security forces, which have been accused in some attacks.
	   The team's report, obtained Tuesday, recommended the
international community step up efforts to combat terrorism in
Algeria. ``Algeria deserves the support,'' it said.
	   Human rights officials have been anxiously awaiting the report,
fearing that it wouldn't take a strong enough stand against the

Venezuela sells state electricity company to U.S. company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela sold a state-owned
electricity company on Tuesday for dlrs 63 million to a consortium
led by U.S.-based CMS Electric and Gas company.
	   Officials called the successful privatization a needed sign of
investor confidence in the Venezuelan economy, which has been
crippled this year by low oil prices.
	   Venezuela has had to call off the proposed sale of a huge
state-owned aluminum company three times in the last year.
	   CMS, the fourth-largest electricity and gas company in the
United States, was the highest bidder for the National Electric
Company of Nueva Espara. The company provides service to the
popular tourist destination of Margarita Island in the Caribbean
Sea.
	   CMS controls 70 percent of the consortium and the Venezuelan
companies Casa Paris and Consultores Occidentales control 25
percent and 5 percent respectively.
	   Some 20 percent of shares in the new electricity company _
called Enelmar _ will be reserved for company workers and small
investors in the Caracas stock market.
	   The CMS consortium is expected to invest dlrs 210 million in the
company over the next decade.
	   Venezuela has lagged behind other Latin American countries in
its efforts to privatize state-owned companies. Labor unions
generally oppose the sales, saying they will lead to layoffs and
lower wages.

Tiger Woods opens youth golf course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Tiger Woods helped open a new youth golf course
where a crime-ridden housing project once sat.
	   Wood and 10 young golfers hit ceremonial drives Monday to open
the first nine holes of the Charlie Yates Golf Course, which will
be the home course for the East Lake Junior Golf Academy.
	   ``I always say I want golf to look like America,'' said Woods,
22. ``And you know what? We're here. Look at us. This is what it's
all about.''
	   The course is named for Charlie Yates, the 85-year-old former
British Amateur champion who is president of the East Lake Golf
Club.
	   The youth course and the East Lake Golf Club are located at what
once was East Lake Meadows, a failed housing project in east
Atlanta. Nine more holes will be added to the youth course later.
	   Architect Rees Jones designed the academy's course without a
fee.

Manchester United fans protest against takeover bid

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ More than 1,000 Manchester United
fans rallied here Tuesday to protest against a 623-million-pound
(dlrs 1 billion) takeover of the club by satellite broadcaster
BSkyB.
	   Former players and rock star Gordon Taylor lent their support to
the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association
demonstration against the biggest takeover bid in sports history.
	   IMUSA chairman Andy Walsh said objections raised by fans would
go into submissions being prepared for the Office of Fair Trading
investigation into the deal.
	   Meanwhile a second potential buyer for Manchester United put its
bid on hold Tuesday.
	   American investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, asked on behalf
of an undisclosed client to negotiate with Manchester United
financial advisers HSBC Holdings, said Tuesday it had advised its
client against proceeding until the OFT review of the BSkyB deal
was finalized.

Pregnant Tammie Green doesn't mind limiting playing time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Tammie Green, who is six months pregnant,
doesn't mind limiting her playing time in the Solheim Cup.
	   ``In fact, I think everybody else will be kind of hoping they
only get to play 18 a day,'' said Green, whose restriction was
ordered by team captain Judy Rankin. ``This is a tough course to
walk.''
	   The three-day Solheim Cup begins Friday at the long and hilly
Muirfield Village Golf Club in the suburb of Dublin, also the home
of the Memorial Tournament on the PGA Tour.
	   The first two days of the Solheim are team events of 18 holes
each morning and afternoon. The team captains decide how often they
use a player.
	   All 12 members of each team play the singles matches on Sunday.
	   ``My weight shifts a little bit now and then, depending on what
side the baby's on. It's a little different, but I've been playing
well,'' Green said.
	   Rankin doesn't expect the course to trouble the 38-year-old
Green.
	   ``She's one of those people who is very steady and solid, and I
think that's going to play well at Muirfield Village,'' Rankin
said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Under strong international pressure,
followers of ex-President Sali Berisha on Tuesday surrendered the
two tanks posted outside their headquarters after the government
threatened force unless the opposition gave up its weapons.
	   Following two days of rioting, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
promised to guarantee Berisha's safety and opened the door to a
political settlement of the crisis which has rocked this former
Communist capital.
	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' for
Berisha's supporters to give up all their weapons, by dawn
Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan
Bizhga said plans had been completed for ``an abrupt attack'' to
take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Late Tuesday, the government declared the unrest an ``attempted
coup'' and ordered a criminal investigation against Berisha and his
followers which could lead to an indictment. A special
parliamentary commission was called upon to deal with the request.
	   At the end of a 4{ hour parliamentary session, the government
also passed a law allowing the military police to take orders from
the interior ministry. Some members of the ruling Socialist party
opposed the decision, warning that it resembled Berisha's calling
in the army last year.

Theme for Jordan trial: promises, promises

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Both sides in the Michael Jordan lawsuit accused
the other Tuesday of breaking promises regarding a movie that was
to have featured the Chicago Bulls star.
	   ``When you make a promise and you commit to do something, you
must honor that promise,'' Dean Dickie, the plaintiff's lawyer,
told jurors during opening statements in Cook County Circuit Court.
	   Jordan sat at the defense table Tuesday, using a back entrance
to the courtroom to avoid reporters and onlookers. He is to testify
next week in a case expected to last about a month.
	   The 1993 lawsuit filed by Heaven Corp. accuses Jordan of backing
out of the film ``Heaven is a Playground'' after signing a 1988
contract guaranteeing him dlrs 350,000 plus 5 percent of the film's
profits.
	   Jordan's lawyer, Frederick Sperling, said his client never
refused to appear and the contract was a preliminary agreement that
was not legally binding. He added that the producers knowingly
misled Jordan about financing and missed a deadline in that regard.
Jordan has countersued, seeking dlrs 4 million.
	   The movie, with former Loyola Marymount basketball standout Bo
Kimble assuming Jordan's role, made dlrs 168,000 at the box office.
	   Dickie said that with Jordan as the star, ``We would have today
a movie that is a classic.''
	   Sperling scoffed at that, pointing out that Jordan was to appear
in about 12 minutes of a 104-minute film that was widely panned by
critics.
	   Heaven Corp. is seeking dlrs 16 million to dlrs 20 million in
damages, which it says represents the profit it would have made had
Jordan appeared.
	   Dickie seemed reluctant to attack the man he described as ``the
greatest basketball player ever'' in his hometown. Instead, he went
after Jordan's agent, David Falk.
	   Dickie portrayed Falk as manipulating Jordan, whose fame was
growing during the time producers Brian Fried and Keith Bank were
trying to make the movie.
	   Dickie said Falk threatened Fried and Bank, saying he would
destroy their careers, have them jailed and make sure they never
worked again, except in ``Outer Mongolia.''
	   Falk was originally named a defendant in the suit but was
removed by Judge Richard Neville.

Barbados lawyer to mediate between political parties in Guyana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Ending weeks of delays, Guyana's
warring political parties have agreed to allow an outside mediator
help carry out a fragile agreement that ended weeks of violence.
	   The announcement came Monday night from St. Lucia Premier
Kenneth Anthony, current chairman of the 15-nation Caribbean
Community, who had spent the day shuttling between the offices of
President Janet Jagan and opposition leader Desmond Hoyte.
	   Maurice King, a former attorney general of Barbados, next week
will begin acting as broker between the two parties in Guyana, he
said. The Caribbean Community appointed King to mediate at their
annual summit in St. Lucia in July, after a peace agreement
negotiated by the community collapsed.
	   King's main task will be to ensure the parties set up a
constitutional reform commission, which was to have started work in
January.
	   ``All of us feel a measure of pain about Guyana,'' Anthony said.
``We want Guyana to resolve its problems and have peace and
stability and to realize its vast potential as a nation.''
	   There have been sporadic outbreaks of violence in Guyana since
elections last December. Hoyte accuses Jagan of vote rigging,
abusing power and discriminating against blacks and other
minorities. Jagan's party is dominated by Guyanese of East Indian
descent.

From lining up putts to going online

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ For players like Robert Damron, who
admits he doesn't even know where to find a computer's on-off
switch, now is the time to learn.
	   Starting with the season-opening Mercedes Championship in
January, the PGA Tour plans to give every exempt player an IBM
laptop complete with a program that will enable him to do
everything from entering and withdrawing from tournaments, signing
up for child care and making travel arrangements.
	   ``It's going to be so handy for us,'' golfer Chris Smith said.
``You wouldn't believe how much time we spend on the phone right
now, trying to get hotels set up, committing to tournaments. This
is probably going to save us at least two hours a week on the
phone.''
	   And the tour will be able to keep in touch with every player
simply by hitting a button.
	   ``One of the things we'll start doing is polling the players
electronically on issues on a fairly regular basis, so the advisory
council has an idea where the membership is on an issue without
trying to corral all the players,'' said commissioner Tim Finchem.
``The way the system works now, we don't always have all the
players in one place. So that's going to help us.''
	   The program has been two years in the making. One of its
features is to display an important message upon logging on.
	   The idea grew out of PGA Tour's 10-year contract extension with
IBM. The tour signed up a core group of about 20 players, from
those who have their own Web sites to those, like Damron, who are
computer illiterate.
	   ``I said, 'If you need a guy who knows nothing about computers,
I'm your man.' I'm anxious to learn,'' Damron said.
	   The core group tried it out in Memphis, Tenn., and the immediate
results were good, although there are still a few bugs.
	   ``It's going to improve our communications and make life
easier,'' said Sid Wilson, vice president of player relations.
``They can use it for their own personal business, to follow stocks
or read their hometown newspaper. There's just so many options.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HAVING A BALL: &LR;  The secret's out on the new Titleist ball.
	   Jeff Sluman won with the new ball _ for now, called the Tour 100
_ at the Greater Milwaukee Open. Then, Billy Andrade used it in his
playoff win at the Canadian Open last week.
	   ``This pretty much affirms everything we want,'' Titleist
spokesman Joe Gomes said.
	   The ball has the liquid center and elastomer cover of the
Titleist Professional, but its softer cover gives it spin more
comparable to the regular Tour balata. Eleven players used it in
Milwaukee. Eight players had it in the bag at the Canadian Open,
including Mike Hulbert, who finished one stroke out of a playoff.
	   Andrade says the new ball gives him at least 15 yards off the
tee.
	   As for the last time Andrade actually bought balls?
	   ``Last year I bought a dozen ball at the Skills Challenge,'' he
said. ``I bought the Tour distance, or whatever they're called, for
the long drive contest which, by the way, I won.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DUNHILL DALY: &LR;  John Daly, whose spot in the Dunhill Cup raised
doubts three weeks ago when he was overcome by the shakes in
Vancouver, British Columbia, was on the final U.S. roster announced
Monday.
	   Daly is set to join Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara Oct. 8-11 at
St. Andrews, a course where Daly has thrived. He won the British
Open in 1995, and teamed with Payne Stewart and Fred Couples in
1993 in a U.S. victory in the Dunhill Cup.
	   Woods is making his first appearance in the 16-team tournament.
	   South Africa, the defending champion, will have the same team of
Ernie Els, David Frost and Retief Goosen.
	   Other top teams include Australia's Steve Elkington, Stuart
Appleby and Craig Parry; Zimbabwe's Nick Price, Mark McNulty and
Tony Johnstone; and Germany's Bernhard Langer, Alex Cejka and Sven
Struver.
	   The teams will be divided into four groups for round-robin play,
with the group winners advancing to the semifinals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LONG-BALL CADDIE: &LR;  Mark McGwire can smack home runs, but his
work as a caddie leaves something to be desired.
	   ``He was terrible,'' said Billy Andrade.
	   Andrade, who became friends with McGwire when they played the
Pebble Beach pro-am together starting in 1990, invited him to an
event in Australia in 1992 and asked Mac to carry his bag.
	   ``He complained the whole time,'' Andrade recalled. ``His feet
hurt, the bag was too heavy. It was like 115 degrees and he was
carrying the bag like a suitcase.
	   ``I'd take the putter and he'd be back in the fairway. The whole
group would be done putting, and he was lumbering up to the green.
But we had a hell of a good time, and I ended up playing pretty
well.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Ernie Els has a Dec. 31 wedding date. He will marry
Liezl Wehmeyer outside Capetown, South Africa.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAT OF THE WEEK: &LR;  Annika Sorenstam has Top 10 finishes in 14
of 17 LPGA tournaments this year.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. became the fourth-youngest
player in North American major league history to reach 1,000 RBIs,
lining a two-run single to center field in the Seattle Mariners
game against the Minnesota Twins Tuesday.
	   Griffey has 1,001 RBIs in his 10 seasons. At 28 years and 10
months, Griffey got to 1,000 RBIs faster than anyone except Mel Ott
(27 years, three months), Jimmie Foxx (27 years, eight months) and
Lou Gehrig (28 years, 9 1/2 months).
	   Gehrig got to the milestone 10 days faster than Griffey.
	   Griffey also is the first in Seattle history with 1,000 RBIs. He
has 129 this season, third-best in the AL and the third-highest
total of his career. He also leads the AL with 51 homers and needs
one stolen base to become only the third player ever with 50 homers
and 20 steals in a season.
	   Willie Mays did it in 1955 (51 homers, 24 steals) and Brady
Anderson did it in 1996 (50-21).

UN Algeria report calls on government to rein in security forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two grafs with diplomats saying internal divisions
prompted delay, possible softening of report. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. team sent to Algeria to look into
the six-year Muslim insurgency condemned the extremism that has
spurred the violence but also called on the government to rein in
its security forces, which have been accused in some attacks.
	   The team's report, obtained Tuesday, recommended the
international community step up efforts to combat terrorism in
Algeria. ``Algeria deserves the support,'' it said.
	   Human rights officials have been anxiously awaiting the report,
fearing that it wouldn't take a strong enough stand against the
violence that has wracked the country for six years.
	   The insurgency began after the army cancelled parliamentary
elections in January 1992 that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, an estimated 75,000 people have been killed.
	   While the government blames Muslim insurgents for the massacres,
human rights groups say the government has carried out torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   Algeria had long rejected having any outside probe into the
violence, claiming it was an internal matter. The government
relented in July, and a group of ``eminent persons'' chosen by the
U.N. chief visited Algeria in July and August.
	   The team, however, said the Algerian government had prevented
them from meeting with key opposition officials they wanted to see.
Among them was the leader of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front,
Abassi Madani, who is under house arrest, and Ali Belhadj, his
second in command who is imprisoned.
	   The Algerian government said the team couldn't meet with the
leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front because they were ``outside
the framework of legality,'' or that their whereabouts weren't
known, said the report.
	   Security concerns were also given as a reason for not allowing
the team to meet with representatives of Berber cultural movements.
	   The report doesn't single out the government for any role in the
attacks and instead condemns terrorism as a whole.
	   It does, however, say that Algeria's ``law-enforcement, security
and self-defense forces should be held to strict standards of
accountability so that the Algerian population and the
international community at large will feel confident that the rule
of law prevails in Algeria.''
	   The team was headed by the former president of Portugal, Mario
Soares. Other team members were former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, Donald McHenry; former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral; former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti;
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako; and former French Health
Minister Simone Veil.
	   Even before the report was released, diplomats and human rights
officials said that differences of opinion within the group were
thwarting a tougher statement and helped delay the report.
	   U.N. officials, however, noted that because of the delicacy of
the mission, a less critical report was perhaps the best way to
enter into a preliminary dialogue with the Algerian government.

Fenerbache upsets Parma; Feyenoord wins at Stuttgart 3-1

	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey's Fenerbache _ with a hefty financial bonus
reportedly on the line _ upset AC Parma 1-0 Tuesday as this
season's UEFA Cup kicked off with 31 first-round, first-leg
matches.
	   The other stunner saw Dutch leaders Feyenoord win at Stuttgart
3-1, a match in which Dutch hooligans clashed with a heavy police
presence estimated a 1,000 with 500 more security guards on duty.
	   In key other games, Red Star Belgrade, Monaco, Liverpool and
Fiorentina got off to winning starts.
	   Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan scored for Fenerbache on a
header in the 23rd off a free kick from Bosnian Elvir Balic. The
Turkish side failed to increase the margin despite a man advantage
for the last 30 minutes when Dino Baggio was sent off _ and a
two-man edge the last two minutes when Fabio Cannavaro was
dispatched.
	   Fenerbache players reportedly will receive a dlrs 18,000 bonus
for advancing to the next stage, which means surviving in the
second leg in two weeks against Parma, winners of the '93 Cup
Winners Cup, '95 UEFA Cup and players last season in the Champions
League.
	   In Stuttgart, Jon Dahl Tomasson notched two first-half goals as
Feyenoord Rotterdam shocked Stuttgart 3-1 before 25,000 home fans
in Germany.
	   Jean Paul Van Gastel put the Dutch ahead in the 19th and
Tomasson scored two minutes later to make it 2-0. Fredi Bobic got
Stuttgart back into the game with a goal in the 31st but Tomasson
scored again a minute later.
	   Notorious Dutch fans tore down one of the fences separating the
stands from the field. Several fans were arrested, while one
security guard was carried off injured. His condition was not
immediately known. Riot police ringed off the section of the stands
filled with Dutch fans.
	   Fearing clashes, German authorities sent 1,000 policemen and 500
security guards to the match.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Red Star Belgrade scored twice in the
first 12 minutes and dominated only to see Metz score in the final
minute, leaving the Yugoslav team with a slim 2-1 win.
	   Perica Ognjenovic scored in the third minute from six meters
(yards) and Goran Drulic made it 2-0 in the 12th from nearly the
same spot.
	   The young, inexperienced Red Star team dominated most of the
match and Metz, which has not scored a goal in the first five
rounds in the French league, finally broke through when Bruno
Rodriguez scored in the 90th.
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Monaco _ semifinalists in last year's
Champions Cup _ got three second-half goals to win 3-1. Lodz took
the lead in the 10th on Piotr Matys' goal. Monaco equalized on a
own goal in the 59th by Witold Bendkowski. David Trezeguet made it
2-1 on a penalty in the 69th and Croatian international Robert
Spehar added the clincher in the 84th.
	   Monaco is unbeaten this season and beat league champion Lens 2-0
last week.
	   In Bratislava, Slovakia, Czech-born Patrick Berger _ with
friends in the stands _ scored in the 18th for Liverpool on a free
kick from 30 meters (yards). Karlheinz Riedle made it 2-0 on a
close-in header in the 23rd and Michael Owen capped it off, scoring
in the 59th for a 3-0 Liverpool victory and a comfortable edge for
the second leg.
	   In Bari, Italy, Brazilian Edmundo scored twice in the second
half, including the winner with eight minutes left, to rally 10-man
Fiorentina past Croatia's Hajduk Split 2-1.
	   Fiorentina trailed 1-0 at halftime on Jurica Vucko's goal, but
Edmundo equalized in the 51st. The hosts had defender Moreno
Torricelli expelled in the 72nd, but Edmundo completed the comeback
with a rising blast from 12 meters (yards).
	   In Madrid, Brazilian Juninho returned from injury to score in
the 15th as Atletico de Madrid beat Obilic of Yugoslavia 2-0. Jose
Maria Romero added the other in the 53rd.
	   Obilic, playing its first European match, is the defending
champion of the Yugoslav league. Obilic's president is Zelko
Raznatovic, a former Serb paramilitary leader known as 'Arkan' who
is wanted by the west for war crimes.
	   Since he faces arrest if he leaves Yugoslavia, Raznatovic's wife
Svetlana represented him at the game in Madrid.
	   In Birmingham, England, English league leaders Aston Villa
survived 3-2 against Norway's Stromsgodset. Anders Michelsen (21st)
and Christer George (23rd) scored for the Norwegians, but Villa
rallied with three late goals from Gary Charles (83rd) and Darius
Vassell with two goals in injury time.
	   In Silkeborg, Denmark, Francesco Totti and Dmitri Alenichev both
scored in the second half to give Roma a 2-0 win over Silkeborg.
	   The lone remaining UEFA game _ the 32nd _ was set for Wednesday
with Anderlecht (Belgium) vs. Grasshopper (Switzerland).

Council urges North Korea to refrain from further launchings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council urged North Korea on
Tuesday not to launch another satellite or other object without
warning and urged neighboring countries to refrain from taking
retaliatory action.
	   North Korea launched what was initially believed to be a missile
on Aug. 31 over Japan's main island. The action alarmed nearby
countries, especially Japan, which filed a formal protest with the
council last week.
	   With a range of more than 900 miles (1,450 kilometers), the test
suggested that North Korea could strike anywhere in Japan.
	   North Korea has insisted that it launched a satellite, not a
medium-range, two-stage ballistic missile as the U.S. State
Department initially reported. The U.S. agency on Monday backed
away from its original statement and confirmed the object was a
satellite that failed to reach orbit.
	   In a statement to reporters read by council president Hans
Dahlgren of Sweden, the 15-member security council expressed
concern that the launching took place in heavily used commercial
air space without prior warning.
	   Japanese Ambassador Hisashi Owada said parts of the rocket
landed in busy sea lanes.
	   ``We in Japan have no intention whatsoever to take any
confrontational position in relation with this activity,'' Owada
said. ``The purpose of our bringing this matter to the Security
Council is to take a firm and clear position on the issues involved
in the correct way so that there is not going to be a recurrence of
events which could exacerbate the situation.''
	   In its statement, the council also said it ``recognized the
legitimate right of any state to develop space programs for
peaceful purposes, provided that they are transparent and
compatible with the international safety norms.''
	   However, Russian experts said Tuesday that they were still
unsure what North Korea launched.
	   The object did not emit any signals, and its weight of only 13
kilograms (28.6 pounds) complicated efforts to identify it, said a
senior expert with Russia's Space Agency, Gennady Khromov,
according to the Interfax news agency.

Refugees report killing frenzy by Taliban troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with council condemning deaths of
Iranians, expressing concern about reports of mass killings. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Refugees fleeing the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif have told U.N. officials of a ``killing frenzy''
by the Taliban following the religious militia's capture of the
city, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
	   Officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
interviewed refugees who fled across the mountains to Pakistan and
reported ``indiscriminate killings,'' by Taliban troops,
particularly of members of the Hazara ethnic minority, a U.N.
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the eyewitness accounts
corroborated reports about mass killings that followed the
Taliban's seizure of the city from opposition forces on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban has acknowledged that unidentified soldiers acting
on their own killed nine Iranians during the takeover _ slayings
that have prompted threats of military retaliation from Tehran.
	   But the Taliban has denied allegations from the anti-Taliban
alliance and media in Iran, which is believed to back the alliance,
that Taliban fighters killed hundreds of people belonging to ethnic
minority groups.
	   The Security Council on Tuesday condemned the slayings of the
Iranians and called for the United Nations to participate in an
investigation. The council also expressed its ``deep concern''
about the reports of mass killings in the north and about
escalating tensions in Bamiyan province.
	   ``It demands that the Taliban fully respect international
humanitarian law and human rights,'' the council said in a
presidential statement.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked the three governments
that recognize Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to intercede and
persuade the Taliban to respect the rights of all people in
Afghanistan, Eckhard said.
	   The three _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
_ agreed to do so during a meeting Monday with Annan, he said.
	   The Taliban, meanwhile, has asked the United Nations to send a
humanitarian mission into Bamiyan province, west of Kabul, where
the Taliban is reporting massive territorial gains.
	   Central Bamiyan is dominated by Shiite Muslims. The Taliban are
rigidly fundamentalist Sunni Muslims. Iran, a largely Shiite
nation, is reporting atrocities by the Taliban in Bamiyan.
	   The United Nations was considering such a mission but was
waiting for security assurances from the Taliban. The Taliban
representative in New York was meeting with U.N. officials later
Tuesday to discuss the security guarantees, officials said.
	   The United Nations, while condemning the deaths of the Iranians,
was eager to send a mission to Afghanistan because it no longer has
non-Afghan staff working in the country, a U.N. official said.
	   The Security Council was briefed on the situation Tuesday by
Alvaro de Soto, assistant secretary-general, who called on the
Taliban to investigate the killings and to account for those
Iranians still missing.
	   The UNHCR says many civilians were killed in the first few days
of the takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif. Several thousand people have
fled the city, the official said.
	   ``All accounts that UNHCR has heard so far appear to confirm
there was specific targeting of the Hazara ethnic minority,'' the
official said.

	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ The Galileo spacecraft has solved
the mystery of Jupiter's faint rings, revealing they were formed
when cosmic debris smashed into four small inner moons, scientists
said Tuesday.
	   The rings _ which are nearly invisible to even the best
telescopes _ clearly show their relation to the moons' orbits,
scientists said.
	   ``Pictures are the smoking gun that allow us to say this theory
works,'' said Joseph Burns, the Cornell University astronomy
professor who arrived at the explanation for the rings.
	   It was long thought that the only ringed planet was Saturn, with
its prominent, icy bands, but the Voyager spacecraft revealed in
1979 that Jupiter also was surrounded by rings.
	   A more detailed look by the unmanned Galileo revealed the rings
are more numerous and complex than previously thought.
	   Michael Belton, an astronomer with the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Arizona, joined Burns and
Cornell colleagues Joseph Veverka and Maureen Ockert-Bell to
release the findings and images during a media teleconference from
Cornell.
	   The material was jointly announced with the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, which manages the Galileo project.
	   Dust grains and particles of comets and asteroids drawn by
Jupiter's strong gravity stream toward its irregularly shaped moons
at about 25 miles a second (40 kilometers a second) _ 100 times the
speed of a bullet, Veverka said.
	   They slam into the moons, creating explosive dust clouds that
eventually turned into orbiting rings so tenuous that the stars
shine right through them.
	   Because of Galileo, ``we now have a definitive answer to the
origin of this ring system and we now understand the processes
which lead to their appearance,'' said Belton, leader of the
Galileo imaging team. ``It's a big step forward.''
	   Galileo, launched in 1989, arrived at Jupiter in December 1995
and began a two-year tour of Jupiter and its four largest moons.
The current two-year mission extension is focusing on the moon
Europa.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Under strong international pressure,
former President Sali Berisha surrendered two tanks posted outside
his headquarters Tuesday after the government threatened force if
his followers did not give up their weapons.
	   Following two days of rioting, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
promised to guarantee Berisha's safety and opened the door to a
political settlement of the crisis that has rocked this former
Communist capital.
	   But Nano warned the government would not ``wait endlessly'' and
ordered Berisha's supporters to give up their weapons by dawn
Wednesday. The Interior Ministry announced plans earlier Tuesday
for ``an abrupt attack'' to take the weapons by force if necessary.
	   Late Tuesday, the government declared the unrest an ``attempted
coup'' and ordered a criminal investigation of Berisha and his
followers. A special parliamentary commission was called upon to
deal with the request.
	   At the end of a 4 1/2-hour parliamentary session, the government
also passed a law allowing the military police to take orders from
the interior ministry. The order effectively put military troops at
the immediate command of the government, prompting criticism from
some members of the ruling Socialist party, who warned the move
resembled Berisha's decision to call in the army during unrest last
year.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran called Tuesday for nationwide
demonstrations to protest the slayings of nine Iranians in
Afghanistan, and Iran's supreme leader put the military and top
civilian leaders on alert.
	   The government-run Islamic Propagation Coordination Council
called on the public to turn out for protest rallies following
Friday prayers, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Meanwhile, the leadership of the Parliament warned that the
situation in Afghanistan ``will turn into a regional and
trans-regional crisis'' and urged Islamic nations to meet to
counter the threat, IRNA said.
	   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the
military and top civilian officials put on full alert amid
heightened tension with Afghanistan.
	   ``All officials and those in charge of affairs of the country,
including the armed forces, must be ready for speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior political
and security authorities deem necessary,'' Khamenei told the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Tuesday. Khamenei is
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
	   Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high since
Thursday, when the Taliban admitted to killing eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist last month.
	   Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the United States understands the anger of the Iranian government
over the killing of its diplomats, but called on the Tehran
government not to use force.
	   ``We urge all the parties in the region to respect international
borders and to refrain from taking actions which would inflame or
enlarge the conflict,'' he said.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Low clouds and wind gusts
hampered for a second day search and rescue efforts to reach a
tourist flight which crashed on a glacier peak on New Zealand's
South Island, authorities said.
	   Rescue coordinators Tuesday gave up hope that the missing trio,
New Zealand pilot Bjorn Van Kessel, 28, and two Japanese women,
Mariko Saijo, 59, of Naruto, and Yuriko Morikawa, 46, of Tokushima,
were surviving freezing temperatures by using emergency equipment
on board the plane.
	   Police Sgt. Noel Brown said emergency locator beacon signals had
helped pinpoint the plane's crash site at about 10,800 feet (3,300
meters), on the side of the Rudolph Glacier, north of Mount Cook.
	   Fluctuating weather conditions Monday and early Tuesday grounded
helicopters and prevented a team of specialist alpine rescuers from
reaching the area, 280 miles (450 kms) southwest of Wellington.
	   Later Tuesday, authorities said the search had been called off
until there was a break in the weather, possibly around midday
Wednesday.
	   After initially being hopeful those on board had survived the
crash and the freezing conditions, authorities said late Tuesday
all three were probably dead.
	   ``Knowing now exactly where the plane has gone down, there is
very little chance that they would have survived the crash,'' said
police spokesman Bill Apes. ``There is no urgency now.''
	   Family members and tour company representatives from Japan had
arrived at Mount Cook on Tuesday, he said.
	   The alpine guides were airlifted onto the eastern side of the
glacier at about 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) but were forced back by
wind-driven snow, low clouds, gusting winds and poor visibility,
Brown said.
	   Four helicopters were involved in the search, but the
fluctuating weather conditions meant they could operate for brief
periods only, said Emma Peel, spokeswoman for the National Rescue
Coordination Center.
	   Planes flying in alpine regions are required to carry emergency
equipment including rescue blankets, clothing, shovels, dried food
and a cooker, and it was possible for the missing trio to survive,
said Brown.
	   The rescue center continued to receive intermittent readings of
signals from the emergency beacon, which was still active. Normally
a beacon has enough power to run for four to five days.

Mir's crew ventures inside ruptured module

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with spacewalk over, crew returning safely to main

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian cosmonauts on the Mir space station
carried out a brief ``internal'' spacewalk inside the airless
Spektr module early Wednesday on a mission intended to boost the
power supply.
	   Wearing their protective spacesuits, Gennady Padalka and Sergei
Avdeyev spent less than an hour connecting power cables inside the
Spektr, which was punctured in a June 1997 collision with a cargo
ship.
	   The Spektr is sealed from the rest of the sprawling six-module
station and the crew had to lock themselves in a docking chamber
and don their suits before opening the hatchway leading to the
module.
	   Their sole task was to fasten cables connecting two of the
module's solar panels to Mir's power system. The connections had
loosened since a previous crew made repairs during two previous
excursions inside the Spektr.
	   ``It's as easy as sweeping your corridor,'' deputy Mission
Control chief Viktor Blagov joked beforehand.
	   In fact, making delicate cable connections in bulky spacesuits
and simply moving inside the dark module cramped with equipment was
a hard and risky undertaking.
	   But the crew quickly completed its task and returned safely to
the main Mir module, said spokesman Valery Lyndin. It will still be
a while before the crew can tell for sure whether their efforts
were successful, he said.
	   Re-activating the Spektr's solar panels is essential to bring
Mir's power supply back to normal, space officials said.
	   ``We now have to turn the whole station toward the sun in order
to preserve power, while the normal mode of operation envisages
turning the panels,'' Blagov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Russian space officials initially planned to patch up the Spektr
module, but then gave up the idea. Now plan to discard the whole
Mir station next June. The Mir has been aloft since 1986, by far
the longest serving space station.

	   ONEONTA, New York (AP) _ Olga Letyushova scored in the 82nd
minute on a deflected pass Tuesday and Russia tied Brazil 2-2 in
the Nike U.S. Cup series.
	   The Russians, still fighting for a berth in next year's Women's
World Cup, nearly upset the South American champions in the final
minutes despite being overmatched for much of the second half.
	   Letyushova scored the apparent game-winner on a long pass in the
87th minute but it was nullified when she was ruled offside.
	   Brazil, which defeated the Olympic champion U.S. team 1-0 in San
Paulo in their last meeting in December 1997, is one of 10 teams
already qualified for the 1999 Women's World Cup, which will be
played in the United States from June 19 through July 10.
	   Russia is vying for a spot in the 16-team field as one of six
European teams. Russia defeated Finland 2-1 Friday and needs a
victory in Helsinki on Oct. 11 to earn a berth.
	   Brazil took a 2-0 lead in the first half on goals by Pretinha.
	   Pretinha, the team's second-leading scorer, drove a left-footed
shot high into the right corner in the 25th minute on an assist
from Roseli.
	   Then, playing in the add-on time at the end of the first half,
Pretinha got behind the defense, took a pass from Katia and
dribbled it just outside the goalie box before sending a shot past
Russian keeper Svetlana Petko.
	   After being shut out by Brazil goalie Maravilha in the first 45
minutes, the Russians finally scored four minutes into the second
half when Natalia Barbashina rolled a soft shot past her on a feed
from Inna Grigorieva.
	   When Russia found itself with one of its few second-half chances
to push the ball upfield, Letyushova, who had the ball about five
yards outside the goalie box, shot quickly. The ball hit off a
sliding Maravilha and into the goal for the tying score.
	   The series resumes Friday in Rochester when Brazil plays Mexico
and the United States plays Russia.

Mystery man behind Peru's Fujimori emerges from shadow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori's mysterious
security adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos, stepped out of the shadows
Tuesday and gave a rare interview to a mob of reporters waiting for
him.
	   Montesinos, who has appeared in public only a handful of times
during Fujimori's eight years in power but had never taken
questions from Peruvian reporters, addressed the press mob as he
left police headquarters in Lima.
	   Montesinos is de facto chief of the feared intelligence
services, which have played a key role in a successful campaign
against Peru's rebels but have also been linked to murder, torture
and human rights abuses.
	   He is credited with designing the rescue raid that freed 72
hostages held by leftist rebels in the Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima last year.
	   True to his reputation, Montesinos revealed nothing new to
reporters.
	   ``Those of us who are responsible for fighting terrorism and
drug trafficking must continue working, carrying out the
pacification strategy designed by President Fujimori,'' said
Montesinos, who wears his black hair slicked back in the style of a
1920s tango singer.
	   Montesinos is Fujimori's closest adviser and the second most
powerful man in Peru, feared for his extensive network of spies,
analysts say.
	   Opposition legislators said his brief appearance Tuesday was
part of an attempt to clean up his image and may mark the start of
a new more public role for Montesinos.
	   Dismissed as an army captain, Montesinos was jailed for one year
in the 1970s after being charged with selling military secrets. He
later became a lawyer defending drug traffickers before linking up
with Fujimori as his security adviser after the 1990 presidential
election.
	   Since taking power in 1990, Fujimori has shed many key aides,
but Montesinos has remained as his irreplaceable adviser, always
close by but out of the public eye.

Typhoon Stelle hits central Japan, two injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with typhoon hitting land, dozens evacuated, heavy
rains expected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Typhoon Stelle, packing winds up to 108 kilometers
(65 miles) per hour, hit land in central Japan early Wednesday,
injuring two power company workers knocked to the ground by high
sea waves.
	   Waves as high as 7 meters (23 feet) hit coastal areas in
Shizuoka prefecture, or state, where Stelle came ashore at around
4:30 a.m. (1930 GMT Tuesday), the Meteorological Agency said.
	   The season's fifth typhoon, was located near the city of Machida
on the western outskirts of Tokyo as of 8:50 a.m. (2350 GMT
Tuesday) and was heading north-northeast at a speed of 45
kilometers (28 miles) per hour, the agency said.
	   It was expected to head toward Japan's northern main island of
Hokkaido later Wednesday, the agency said.
	   In Shizuoka, about 100 people were evacuated to public
facilities on high land for safety after more than 36 centimeters
(14 inches) of rainfall was recorded over the 24-hour period up to
6 a.m. (2100 GMT Tuesday), said prefectural police spokesman Kenji
Nomura.
	   The two injured men were among six Tokyo Electric Power Co.
workers engaged in restoring power to households in the town of
Higashiizu, he said.
	   Katsumi Inamoto, 46, suffered a skull fracture after he was
knocked to the ground by high waves hitting a sea side road, Nomura
said. Masashi Suzuki, also 46, sustained bruises to his body.
	   Both men were treated at a nearby hospital in Higashiizu, a
coastal hot spring resort, 150 kilometers (94 miles), west of
Tokyo, Nomura said.
	   Additionally, 275 homes were flooded in Shizuoka by heavy rains
from the typhoon, Nomura said.
	   National broadcaster NHK reported disruptions to transportation
in wide swaths of central, eastern and northern Japan.
	   Three domestic airlines canceled scheduled morning flights to
and from Tokyo's Haneda airport, but flights to and from Tokyo's
main international airport at Narita were largely unaffected, NHK
said.
	   Some railway lines in central Japan and the Tokyo area suspended
train runs on Wednesday morning due to the typhoon, according to
the broadcaster.
	   Ferry lines and some subways in the Tokyo area were also
affected.
	   In late August, the season's fourth typhoon, Rex, lingered over
the Pacific south of the main island of Honshu, bringing record
rainfalls to central Japan, killing 16 people and injured 46
others.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks pushed higher Tuesday after some early
profit-taking, giving Wall Street its first three-session winning
streak in more than a month. The Dow Jones industrial average
overcame an early 63-point deficit and rose 79.04 points _ or by 1
percent _ to 8,024.39, extending the rally that began Friday to 410
points. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in August as
consumers snapped up back-to-school clothes and home furnishings.
August sales increased to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 224.8 billion,
the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That followed a 0.6 percent
drop in July caused mainly by a General Motors strike that had
sharply reduced auto sales. But outside the volatile automobile
category, sales of all other retail goods rose by a relatively
modest 0.3 percent in August. That was on the heels of a 0.6
percent jump in July _ better than first reported _ that was more
typical than previous months' shopping sprees this year.
(US-ECONOMY)
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A federal task force Tuesday recommended major
changes in Canada's banking system that would allow foreign banks
to open branches and lift a ban on mergers of the country's biggest
banks. The task force report came at a crucial time for the banking
industry in Canada, with the government facing a decision on two
merger proposals involving four of the five largest banks. Though
executives of those banks said they were pleased by the report, the
task force chairman sounded a cautious note, saying no mergers
should be approved without a thorough public review of the
consequences. The pending merger proposals would combine Royal Bank
of Canada with Bank of Montreal, and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce with Toronto Dominion Bank. (CANADA-BANKING)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government on Tuesday proposed
printing money to pay off back wages and imposing some Soviet-style
controls over the market _ but also making a key appointment to
enhance its reform credentials. The head of the centrist Our Home
Is Russia parliament faction, Alexander Shokhin, was named deputy
prime minister in charge of financial issues. He said he expected
another member of his faction to be named to a Cabinet post later.
Russian liberals and media have been making doomsday predictions
that the new government, under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
will represent a retreat to Soviet-era economic policies.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian gold production fell to 59.4 million tons
during the first eight months of 1998 from 66.4 million tons during
the same period of 1997, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
the Ministry of Economics. The ministry's Department of Precious
Metals and Gemstones said it expected production to fall this year
because of disruptions to output in the Yakutia and Chukotka
regions. The ministry said the country's economic crisis has also
prevented output reaching the market, with producers hanging on to
gold rather than selling it for devalued rubles, while banks that
had signed contracts to buy gold have been unable to honor them.
Russia produced 123 million tons of gold in 1997. (RUSSIA-GOLD)
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador's president has announced a
package of emergency measures to mend the nation's tattered
economy, including a devaluation of the national currency. The
devaluation of the sucre, announced late Monday, comes nearly two
weeks after neighboring Colombia reduced the value of its currency.
Although Ecuador has one of Latin America's smallest economies, the
measure sparked fears of additional devaluations in the region,
which has been battered by the global financial turmoil. In a
nationally televised address, President Jamil Mahuad, who took
power on Aug. 10, also announced an end to subsidies on electricity
and gas and promised to cut state spending. The sucre fell by
nearly 10 percent on Monday after the government shifted the band
within which the sucre is allowed to trade downwards by 15 percent.
(ECUADOR-ECONOMIC AUSTERITY)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Riding on a spurt in agriculture, India
is headed for higher growth this year despite devastating floods
that ravaged millions of acres (hectares) of fertile farm fields,
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said Tuesday. ``We are looking to a
better year economically than what we had last year,'' Sinha told a
meeting of top bankers, predicting the most prominent gains would
come from the agriculture sector. The minister said he was unfazed
by the floods, worst in decades in several states, that had roared
across six provinces along the fertile Gangetic plain. At least 70
percent of India's population lives in its villages and relies on
agriculture as its main occupation. (INDIA-ECONOMIC GROWTH)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano warned
followers of ex-President Sali Berisha to hand in their weapons by
dawn Wednesday, or the state would intervene. The warning came at
the end of a 4-1/2-hour parliamentary session, during which the
government passed a law allowing the military police to operate
under the interior ministry. The decision effectively put military
troops at the disposal of police officials. Earlier Tuesday,
Berisha surrendered two army tanks seized in rioting this week,
ending a standoff at his Democratic Party headquarters. (ALBANIA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The White House braced itself Tuesday for the
release of damaging new evidence as Republicans in the House of
Representatives pushed to make public a videotape of President Bill
Clinton's grand jury testimony, said to show a chief executive
uncomfortably answering pointed questions. Lawyers familiar with
the testimony, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
videotape shows the president at times angry with graphic
questioning from lawyers in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
office and accusing prosecutors of criminalizing his private life.
House Republicans want the videotape released as possibly as early
as this week. Democrats are objecting, saying Clinton is being
treated unfairly because no other witness' testimony was taped. The
videotape would likely be played and replayed by television
stations around the country if released. (US-CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran called Tuesday for nationwide
demonstrations to protest the slayings of nine Iranians in
Afghanistan, and Iran's supreme leader put the military and top
civilian leaders on alert. The government-run Islamic Propagation
Coordination Council called on the public to turn out for protest
rallies following Friday prayers, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported. Meanwhile, the leadership of the Parliament
warned that the situation in Afghanistan ``will turn into a
regional and trans-regional crisis'' and urged Islamic nations to
meet to counter the threat, IRNA said. Tensions between the two
neighbors have been running high since Thursday, when the Taliban
admitted to killing eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist last
month. (IRAN-AFGHANISTAN)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new government showed some of its cards
Tuesday, proposing to print money to pay back wages and impose some
Soviet-style controls over the market _ but also making a key
appointment to enhance its reform credentials. The head of a
centrist party, Alexander Shokhin, was named deputy prime minister
in charge of financial issues _ a daunting job as Russia tries to
pull itself out of its economic morass. He said he expected another
member of his faction to be named to a Cabinet post later. Shokhin
served as Russia's economics minister at the start of the country's
free-market reforms. Russian liberals and media have been making
doomsday predictions that the new government, under Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, will retreat to Soviet-era economic policies.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A week into his latest Mideast peace mission,
American mediator Dennis Ross _ and the antagonists he is trying to
bring together _ gave little public sign Tuesday they were any
closer to an accord. Instead, Israel and the Palestinians each made
new complaints about the other's intransigence. ``The meetings are
continuing, but until now, nothing in particular has been
reached,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said in the West Bank
town of Ramallah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in
Jerusalem that if Arafat wants an agreement, ``he'll get one
quickly.'' But he said the Palestinians must do more against
terrorists for Israel to withdraw from occupied West Bank land. How
much Arafat's Palestinian Authority is doing to fight Islamic
militants has been a major point of contention.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican singer Alejandro Fernandez is
relieved and thankful that kidnappers freed his older brother after
the family paid a dlrs 3.2 million ransom, a Mexico City daily said
Tuesday.
	   The Fernandez family, led by Mexico's celebrated ranchero singer
Vicente Fernandez, has been reluctant to comment on the
4-month-long kidnapping of Vicente Fernandez Jr. which ended last
week.
	   ``Thanks to God, everything ended well and we were able to be
reunited as a family,'' Alejandro Fernandez told the Reforma
newspaper.
	   The younger Fernandez, who has risen to fame with contemporary
ballads along with his father's traditional mariachi songs, spoke
in Las Vegas during a U.S. concert tour.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Former tennis champion Ivan Lendl
opened an exhibition of his favorite artist Tuesday in his native
country.
	   A passionate collector of the world-famous Czech artist Alfons
Muca, Lendl opened an exhibit Tuesday of late works by the
art-nouveau master in the town of Prostejov, 250 kilometers (156
miles) east of Prague, CTK news agency reported.
	   Lendl, winner of eight Grand Slam titles and former No. 1 for a
record 270 weeks, played an exhibition match in the town Prerov,
300 kilometers (187 miles) east of Prague, last weekend, his first
match since he retired from active tennis in December 1994.
	   Born in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, in 1960, Lendl defected from
his homeland in 1985 to eventually become an American citizen seven
years later.
	   He has been back to his native country several times since the
collapse of Communism there in 1989.

	   TILBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Wanted: Young men with a calling.
Job requirements: Celibacy, compassion and charity. Salary: None.
	   A Dutch order of Roman Catholic friars launched a nationwide
recruitment drive this week to attract new brothers as old age
takes its toll on their ranks.
	   ``We are looking for people (male) with a heart who have the
courage to become a friar,'' proclaimed a newspaper advertisement
that ran in national and regional newspapers on Saturday.
	   ``We have a pile of disadvantages to report,'' the advertisement
continued. ``You get no salary, no promotion, and you may not
marry.''
	   Undeterred, ``dozens'' of interested applicants contacted the
friars this week, campaign leader Frans van Pinxteren said.
	   ``There is no one so far who has said `I want to be a friar,'
but there are people who are very seriously interested,'' Van
Pinxteren added.
	   When Van Pinxteren, 63, joined the Friars of Tilburg 45 years
ago, the order had 1,100 members. That number has dwindled to 175,
mainly 70-somethings based in this southern Dutch city.
	   The order performs voluntary education and health care work in
the Netherlands and runs schools in developing countries.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of the department store
Harrods, thinks his life is interesting. Just look on his Web site.
	   The new site _ www.alfayed.com _ says it is dedicated to
carrying a ``comprehensive database of newspaper articles relating
to Mr. Al Fayed's interesting life.''
	   The site includes a large section of stories related to the car
crash last year in Paris that killed his son, Dodi, and Princess
Diana. A Website section under construction will contain three
subheadings about the couple: ``The Love Affair,'' ``August 31''
and ``Unanswered Questions.''
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ A notebook containing draft Beatles lyrics for
``Hey Jude'' and ``Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''
fetched 100,000 pounds (dlrs. 168,000) at a Sotheby's auction on
Tuesday.
	   A private collector from Liverpool _ birthplace of the Beatles _
bought the spiral-bound book to celebrate his daughter's 21st
birthday.
	   The notebook, which also includes doodles by John Lennon, was
sold as part of a Sotheby's sale of rock 'n' roll memorabilia at
the Hard Rock Cafe. Sotheby's had expected it to fetch between
dlrs. 150,000 and dlrs. 200,000. The auction house did not name the
buyer.
	   Filled with scribbles and brightly colored ink, the notebook
covers 18 months of 1967-68, when the Beatles were at the top of
the charts releasing albums including ``Sergeant Pepper'' and ``The
Beatles'' _ more commonly known as the White Album.
	   The group's road manager, Mal Evans, compiled it. He was killed
by police in Los Angeles in 1976 after brandishing a fake gun.
	   The auctioned items came from an anonymous vendor associated
with Sotheby's for the past 30 years.
	   Also under the hammer was a corduroy jacket worn by John Lennon
on the last Beatles tour, which fetched 8,000 pounds (dlrs. 13,000)
	   ___
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ A pig as big as a small car is a
huge celebrity at the New Mexico State Fair.
	   Harley, a 1,050-pound (476-kilo) Yorkshire hog, is delighting
the crowds even though he spends most of his day snoring. Even
congressional candidates are awestruck by him.
	   ``Dang, that thing's huge,'' Democratic hopeful Phil Maloof said
on a recent visit.
	   Harley is 8 feet (2.44 meters) long and 4 feet (1.22 meters)
tall, with a snout the size of a salad plate. For 50 cents,
fairgoers get to see the porker laying on a wooden platform tucked
among the horse and cow barns at the fairgrounds.
	   Owner Steve Frabott calls him ``buddy.''
	   Visitor James Koster of Albuquerque treated Harley with less
emotion.
	   ``Good, Lord,'' Koster said. ``That is a big ol' slab of
bacon.''

	   BLAZISHTE, Bulgaria (AP) _ A few chickens roam the nearly empty
streets of this once-lively mountain village. Stray dogs slink
behind deserted houses with broken windows.
	   An eerie silence hangs over Blazishte and dozens of other
virtually deserted towns in the Kardzhali region of southern
Bulgaria. Most of the ethnic Turks who have populated the area for
centuries are deserting it for Turkey, suddenly unable to survive
in one of the poorest parts of one of Europe's poorest countries.
	   Djemine Ramadan, 88, lives alone in a dilapidated house she once
helped build, her daughter and four sons now gone.
	   Asked how she spends her days, she looked down the lifeless road
and said: ``I'm waiting for somebody to come back.''
	   Bulgaria's economic misery of the 1990s makes a return to more
prosperous times unlikely any time soon.
	   Turks who once endured fierce discrimination in this Balkan
country have recovered their rights in the post-communist era. But
now they are fleeing in huge numbers due to grinding poverty that
has shut down employers, emptied villages and left many remaining
families on the verge of starvation.
	   The average income for the region is barely half the nationwide
average of dlrs 100 (leva 180,000) a month, and unemployment tops
50 percent. Without income or hope, some 200,000 people have moved
to Turkey in the last six years, legally or otherwise.
	   ``The main motive to emigrate to Turkey is the hope for a better
life,'' says Adil Naim, a municipal employee for the town of Djebel
whose parents and sister already have gone south.
	   Naim, 42, worked as a schoolteacher until last year. But his
school was closed down because there were not enough children left.
	   ``Every year schools have to be closed. There are five or six
children in a class,'' he says sadly.
	   The population of the Djebel district alone has shrunk from
32,000 in 1989, when Bulgaria dumped communism for democracy, to
less than 7,000.
	   Many have headed to western Turkey. Turkish media reported that
a third of the 1.5 million residents in the city of Bursa came from
Bulgaria.
	   ``The Bulgarian Turks integrate easily in their new homeland.
They speak the language and have generally a better education than
the local residents,'' says Naim.
	   Despite the departures, Turks still comprise Bulgaria's biggest
minority, with roughly 10 percent of the country's 8.5 million
population, and the cash-strapped government has been criticized
for neglecting them.
	   Bulgaria, a mainly Slavic Orthodox country, suffered harsh
Turkish domination from the late 14th to the late 19th century. But
it is Bulgaria's Turks who have been the victims of oppression in
recent years.
	   Under Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, ethnic Turks in Bulgaria
were forced to change their names and deprived of the rights to use
their language, religion and customs.
	   When Zhivkov opened Bulgaria's borders in the summer of 1989,
320,000 Turks fled to Turkey _ Europe's biggest exodus in 40 years.
	   Ethnic Turks' status and freedom improved with the collapse of
communism. Legislation was enacted restoring their names, and they
are again free to practice Islam and speak Turkish in public.
	   But Bulgaria's economic hardships have hit them worst of all.
	   ``The situation is hopeless,'' says Djebel Mayor Bahri Yumer.
``There is no government strategy for recovering this crisis-shaken
region.''
	   Tobacco growing has for decades been one of the few
opportunities to earn a living in the backward Kardzhali region.
But even that industry has broken down, due to shrunken demand for
cigarettes of the Oriental blend Basma that were popular in the
former Soviet Union.
	   Hundreds of Djebel-area families are on the verge of starvation
because of the failure of the recently privatized tobacco company
to pay them for their crops as promised.
	   Yashar Ali, who runs a small tobacco plant outside Djebel, has
been waiting a year for the tobacco money, which he needs to
smuggle his 6-year-old grandson to Turkey to be reunited with his
parents.
	   Smugglers charge dlrs 1,500 in U.S. bills to get a person
through the border, usually hidden in car trunks or bus luggage
compartments. Despite the whopping price and the reported deaths of
eight children on the perilous trip, they are in great demand.
	   ``The most lucrative job nowadays is the channelmen's,'' Adil
says of the smugglers. ``This illegal business is flourishing and
it looks like the government doesn't care much.
	   ``Probably this is a plan to solve the problems in the region,''
he says bitterly.

Aid flow still slow to Mexican flood victims

	   HUIXTLA, Mexico (AP) _ Thousands of flood victims remained
without food aid or medical care, five days after rivers washed
away homes, crops and many of their neighbors.
	   Cloudy weather on Tuesday prevented aid flights from reaching
many areas in the ravaged coastal region of southern Mexico.
	   In the remote village of Vademia, one of thousands of
settlements blasted by the floods, farmer Ramon Gutierrez _ his
feet swollen from infection _ was angry.
	   ``The aid that President Ernesto Zedillo offered by television
still has not arrived and we are sure it will not arrive because we
are from the PRD,'' he said, referring to the opposition Democratic
Revolutionary Party.
	   But Lt. Col. Edgar Novelo, an army surgeon helping oversee
medical aid efforts, said authorities ``are doing everything
possible to reach all of the communities.''
	   He noted that with roads and bridges destroyed, hundreds of
communities can be reached only by air. About 1.2 million people
live in the municipalities affected by last week's flooding.
	   In nearby Huixtla, aid did arrive, and hundreds lined up to
receive food or medical treatment.
	   ``The medical attention of the soldiers is very good,'' said
Amparo Moreno Palomeque, waiting in a food line as she balanced a
baby against her tattered blue dress with one hand and clutched a
plastic food bowl with the other.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo said Monday that officials had
organized a 70-helicopter airlift to bring aid to isolated
villages. But on Tuesday, state officials said they had to suspend
air operations because of low clouds that drizzled rain.
	   Officials say the death toll is sure to rise above the 90
confirmed dead so far in Chiapas. Mexican newspapers, citing
unofficial sources, put the death toll in the hundreds.
	   Zedillo demanded that that aid be distributed fairly and without
fraud.
	   But frustrations over the aid delays has inspired complaints.
	   In a communique that reached reporters late Monday, the
Zapatista National Liberation Army, which rebelled in Chiapas in
1994, accused the state government of ``a scandalous robbery'' of
humanitarian aid, claiming that donations of food and money were
being diverted.
	   Novelo said the medical situation is ``critical.'' The high,
contaminated waters _ and a lack of safe water to drink _ have left
many people suffering from diarrhea, eye infections and severe foot
fungus.
	   Mexico's Red Cross continued to call for donations of food and
medicine. Among those responding was Pope John Paul II, who donated
dlrs 50,000 through Roman Catholic charities for Mexico.

	   JAFFNA, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The assassination of Jaffna's new mayor
and its military and police commanders in a bombing last week shows
that even two years after recapturing the 1,000-square-kilometer
(400-square-mile) Jaffna Peninsula, the army's hold on the city is
far from secure.
	   Jaffna, once a thriving port colonized by the Portuguese and the
Dutch across the narrow straits from southern India, bears the
signs of military occupation _ barbed wire and sandbagged check
points. Nearly 45,000 Sinhalese soldiers are maintaining order in a
city of nearly 500,000 Tamils.
	   The Tamil Tigers seized the city in 1990 and proclaimed a
government for the more than 1 million people who live in northern
Sri Lanka, where Tamils predominate. Sri Lanka's army retook the
city in 1995 after a bitter 50-day offensive.
	   Maj. Gen. Lionel Balagalle, the area army commander, said
recently that only 100 rebels are active in the peninsula, carrying
out occasional attacks. The main force fighting for an ethnic Tamil
homeland has been driven across a broad lagoon into the jungles of
the Sri Lankan mainland.
	   But on Friday, suspected rebels bombed Jaffna city hall, where
Mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan was meeting with the city's garrison
commander, Brig. Susantha Mendis; the police chief, Superintendent
Chandra Perera; and others. In all, 20 people died.
	   Just a few months earlier, the previous mayor, Sarojini
Yogeswaran, was shot and killed while she met with residents. Both
attacks were blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
	   During a meeting with a group of visiting foreign journalists in
his office in August, Sivapalan was quite conscious of the security
risk he faced, saying, ``Anything can happen here any time.''
	   Sivapalan said the solution to the ethnic conflict lay in
finding a political solution.
	   Determined to win the trust of Tamils and to overcome their
deep-rooted suspicion of Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese, President
Chandrika Kumaratunga has offered a constitutional restructuring to
give Tamil areas more autonomy. But the proposal is stalled by the
refusal of opposition parties to support the plan, and the rebels
reject it outright.
	   Kumaratunga also ordered the army to restore civilian services
in Jaffna as quickly as possible.
	   People saw signs of recovery when the authorities opened a movie
theater two months ago in the war-ruined city, deprived of power,
gasoline and other elements of normalcy for five grim years. Even a
war film from India drew crowds, although battle scenes were the
last thing many people wanted to see.
	   During the control of Jaffna by the Liberation Tigers, few
medicines or other goods penetrated the blockade imposed by the Sri
Lankan military.
	   J.M. Pathmanathan's pharmacy was virtually empty then. Today he
is back in business, his shop stacked with drugs and crowded with
customers.
	   ``The life is 75 percent normal here,'' he says.
	   Schools and colleges have reopened. So have banks and hospitals.
	   A private airline operates five flights daily between Jaffna and
Colombo, the national capital 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the
south. Thousands of residents travel to Colombo in cargo ships for
business and to meet relatives.
	   Jaffna used to be an elegant city, the center of Tamil culture
with a renowned university and Tamil-language library. It became a
bombed-out victim of the 15-year-old war between Tamils and the
island's majority Sinhalese, a war that so far has killed 54,000
people.
	   So far, one of the city's seven cinemas has reopened _ a novelty
in a town that did not have enough electricity to run a movie
projector.
	   Streets are clogged with bicycles, three-wheel taxis and some
vintage Morris Minor cars, but a fleet of 90 buses is providing
badly needed transportation. During the years of blockade, the only
fuel available was an unstable homemade brew of kerosene and
vegetable oil.
	   Hardships remain. Only 5 percent of Jaffna's residents have
electricity as the government installs generators to serve 80
percent of homes. Telephone lines, which were nonexistent until
recently, reach just 505 houses.
	   ``It is an artificial situation. People are surrounded by the
army and there is night curfew daily,'' says M. Thangarajah, a
textile trader.
	   Checkpoints are positioned every few hundred yards (meters).
Wary of attacks by suicide bombers, soldiers ask bicycle riders to
dismount and walk their bikes through.
	   The city remains cut off by land from southern Sri Lanka. A
fierce battle has been raging for 15 months for control of the
highway heading south.
	   It is not clear how deeply support for the rebels still runs
among Jaffna's war-weary Tamils. Many say that discrimination by
Sinhalese remains pervasive and that they still want independence.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his record 63rd home run,
breaking out of a tie with Sammy Sosa when he connected as a
pinch-hitter in the first game of a doubleheader Tuesday night.
	   McGwire had been in a 3-for-18 slump with three singles since
hitting his record-breaking 62nd home run off Chicago's Steve
Trachsel on Sept. 8. Sosa homered twice Sunday to tie McGwire at
62.
	   McGwire didn't start the first game of the twin-nighter against
Pittsburgh, resting his back, but batted in the ninth and got his
sixth career pinch homer, a 385-foot (117-meter) drive to
left-center off Jason Christiansen.

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The Rally of New Zealand is
expected to remain on the international calendar for 1999 after a
government agency stepped in Wednesday to ensure sponsorship of the
auto rallying event.
	   Major Events New Zealand said it will help Rally NZ ensure the
event goes ahead despite a loss of its sponsor this year. Two
international companies are discussing sponsorship proposals with
their head offices.
	   ``It's looking a lot more promising than a month ago,'' event
administrator Gary Upson said Wednesday.
	   The rally has also been approved internationally, being placed
on the provisional calendar drawn up by the world body's rally
commission for next year's world championship.
	   ``They've indicated they want us and we have made a commitment
for 1999,'' Upson said.
	   New Zealand's inclusion and the dates of July 16-18 are expected
to be confirmed at a full FIA (Federation Internationale de
l'Automobile) meeting next month. (djp)

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano has
issued an ultimatum to followers of ex-President Sali Berisha: Hand
in your weapons or face a government crackdown.
	   The deadline to surrender the weapons, by dawn Wednesday, was
announced after a 4 1/2-hour parliamentary session. During
Tuesday's session, the government also passed a law allowing the
military police to operate under the Interior Ministry.
	   The decision effectively places military troops at the disposal
of the government, without having to formally call in the army.
Members of Nano's Socialist party criticized the move, saying it
resembled Berisha's decision to call in the army during unrest last
year.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Berisha handed over two army tanks seized in
rioting this week, ending a standoff at his Democratic Party
headquarters in this former Communist capital.
	   Scores of heavily armed Berisha supporters faced off with
Albanian police, who set up roadblocks around the building and
stood guard with automatic rifles. The supporters planned another
protest Wednesday, in their bid to oust the government.
	   Tensions remained high in Tirana, with police convoys patrolling
with blue lights flashing and sirens wailing through unusually
empty streets.
	   Berisha's party turned over the tanks after Nano promised to
guarantee his safety and opened the door to a political settlement
of the crisis, the second to rock Albania in 18 months.
	   Also Tuesday, the government declared the unrest an ``attempted
coup'' and ordered a criminal investigation against Berisha and his
followers which could lead to an indictment.
	   Berisha met with international officials, who had blamed the
opposition for trying to topple the government, and then returned
to his party headquarters where he spoke from a balcony as the two
tanks parked on either side rumbled away.
	   ``The democrats don't believe that power can be taken by
violence and bloodshed,'' he said as children ran after the tanks,
which had been stripped of mounted guns and ammunition. ``This kind
of power is destined to be condemned by history.''
	   Some of Berisha's followers unloaded their automatic rifles and
placed them in the back of a car, but others still carried their
weapons inside the party headquarters.
	   Pro-Berisha party officials said Wednesday's protest would be
peaceful, similar to one held on Tuesday.
	   The presence of the tanks at Berisha's headquarters had been
seen as a major stumbling blocks to efforts by President Rexhap
Meidani and international officials to mediate the crisis.
Mediators hoped that the transfer of the tanks could signal a
breakthrough in easing tensions.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The former president blamed
Nano for the Saturday assassination of a popular opposition
politician, Azem Hajdari.
	   The killing of Hajdari, a Berisha ally, touched off two days of
unrest reminiscent of the months of nationwide anarchy last year.
The 1997 violence followed the collapse of shady investment schemes
that cost many people their life's savings.
	   The current unrest stems from a power struggle between two
rivals and widespread public disappointment with the government's
inability to revive the economy and restore confidence in the
nation's future.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Italy placed its military aircraft and ships on standby for a
possible evacuation of the 2,000 Italian citizens, mostly
businessmen and their families, in Albania.
	   Italy and Germany on Tuesday recommended sending an
international police force to Albania to help stabilize the
troubled Balkan nation.

Hart's coaching job could be in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand coach John Hart's job
could be in jeopardy based on the actions of at least one New
Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) board member.
	   Kevin Roberts will take part in Saturday's board inquiry into
the All Black season by video link from Los Angeles. Roberts is
believed to be part of a powerful group opposed to Hart retaining
his coaching job.
	   Newspaper reports say early unofficial counts of board sentiment
suggest Hart is in serious trouble _ perhaps by as much as six
votes to three if a vote is taken.
	   Hart and team manager Mike Banks will present full reports to
the meeting, and the union's own report will also go before the
board.
	   Rugby Services director Bill Wallace and staff had been
debriefing coaches, management and team members, chief executive
David Moffett said Wednesday.
	   ``We're going to do a proper job on this,'' Moffett said.
``There's a lot of work. We would normally complete a review like
this over a longer period of time, but because we want to get the
matter dealt with as soon as possible we've had to compress a lot
of work into a shorter period.''
	   The All Blacks lost five consecutive tests to conclude the
season, three of them to Australia in the Bledisloe Cup series.
Australia's clean sweep was its first against the All Blacks since
1929.

Investigators say voice recorder stopped six minutes before crash

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The cockpit voice recorder aboard
Swissair Flight 111 stopped six minutes before its deadly crash _
at the same time as the flight data recorder, crash investigators
said Tuesday.
	   The finding provides further evidence that the MD-11 suffered a
crippling systems failure at that moment on Sept. 2, shortly before
it plunged into the North Atlantic off Nova Scotia, killing all 229
people on board.
	   ``They are on separate power buses (systems) so ... it would
mean most likely a very severe power incident,'' said Dana Doiron,
a spokesman for Canada's Transportation Safety Board in Halifax.
	   Doiron said the cockpit voice recorder will still be able to
provide valuable information about the situation the crew faced.
	   But without recordings from the last six minutes, investigators
will never learn what, if anything, the two pilots said to each
other after their last communication with air traffic controllers.
That conversation ended with the pilots declaring an emergency
because of smoke in the cockpit and saying they must land
immediately.
	   The flight data recorder, which was recovered from the ocean
floor several days before the cockpit voice recorder, is being
examined by experts at a laboratory in Ottawa.
	   Hugh Waterman, a former pilot and retired aircraft safety expert
with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, said the pilots may
have turned off the recorders in an effort to find the source of
the smoke.
	   ``Automatically the system wouldn't work that way'' and shut
down at the same time, Waterman said.
	   The safety board said experts have confirmed a series of
irregularities in systems on the plane prior to the last six
minutes of flight.
	   ``Developing a valid understanding of these anomalies will
require extensive examination of wiring and aircraft components
that have not yet been recovered from the wreckage,'' the board
said.
	   It said the effort to recover wreckage from the ocean floor _ a
task assigned to the U.S. Navy salvage ship USS Grapple _ could be
critical to the investigation.
	   Divers have located several large pieces of wreckage at a depth
of about 180 feet (55 meters). On Tuesday they brought bags with
more victims' remains to the surface, which were taken to a
temporary morgue at a nearby military base.
	   Authorities say they won't begin hoisting large chunks of the
plane until human remains are removed, and divers have been told it
could take months to clear the crash site completely.

Arabs and Jews find a shared purpose as casino opens

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ This is what the dreamers of a new
Middle East may have envisioned.
	   Once they stepped through the elegant portals of the Oasis
Casino, Arabs and Jews found a shared purpose _ beat the odds at
blackjack, hit the jackpot at the slots and have a good time.
	   The dlrs 50 million glass-and-glitz gambling emporium in this
Palestinian-run town offered a luxurious, albeit brief, respite
from the resentments and suspicions that usually make it so hard
for Israelis and Palestinians to relax together.
	   ``We are all together. It's very nice,'' said Menachem Dante,
the longtime driver of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as he
sipped whisky and placed poker bets with a Palestinian dealer
during Tuesday night's invitation-only gala opening.
	   The ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail party,
with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty suits,
chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot machines.
	   Still, the tense reality of a 100-year bloody conflict could not
be shut out entirely.
	   The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, on Tuesday railed against the casino as a den of iniquity.
While Yassin did not make explicit threats, Hamas has killed scores
of Israelis in recent years and vowed only last week to resume
suicide bombings to avenge two members shot dead by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday night, dozens of security guards patrolled the
parking lot. Before bettors could play a hand of blackjack, they
faced searches and metal detectors. When the casino opens to the
general public Wednesday, gamblers will have to register their
passport numbers.
	   Michael Levy, 60, a Tel Aviv surgeon, said he hoped to become a
regular at Oasis _ in the past he made several trips a year to
London casinos since gambling in Israel is illegal _ but that
terrorism was a concern.
	   ``If there is even the slightest incident, all the money
invested here will go out the window,'' he said.
	   The casino lies just inside Palestinian territory and is just a
half hour drive from Jerusalem on a road controlled by Israel. The
nearest Israeli military outpost is just a few hundred yards
(meters) away.
	   The Austrian operators said they were aware that unrest could
spoil their business, but that they would not be discouraged by
temporary setbacks.
	   ``We are taking the long-term approach,'' said Leo Wallner, the
president of Casinos Austria which has a 15 percent share, along
with 10 percent held by the Austrian Union Bank. The remainder is
in the hands of private Palestinian and Austrian investors.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's government, strapped for cash
and still largely dependent on foreign aid, has a pressing interest
in making sure the project succeeds since it stands to earn
millions of dollars in taxes.
	   Oasis is also the start of what developers say will become the
largest tourism resort in the Middle East, with three luxury
hotels, golf courses and convention facilities _ along with 5,000
jobs for Palestinians.
	   If profitable, the project will likely attract foreign investors
who have stayed away until now because of the political turmoil.
	   Even though the casino has employed hundreds of area residents,
many Palestinians are still skeptical about the sudden promise of
prosperity, perhaps because their hopes for a better life since the
first peace accord with Israel in 1993 were so badly disappointed.
	   Others yet fear the casino will erode their Islamic traditions
and open the door to what they consider Western debauchery.
	   ``This is not what we have waited for,'' Nael Suweiti, a
resident of the Aqabat Jaber refugee camp across the street, said
disdainfully as convoys of buses and cars pulled up outside the
casino.
	   Suweiti won't be able to see for himself what is going on
inside. Palestinians are barred at the request of the Palestinian
Authority, which apparently wanted to appease Islamic opponents.
	   However, the restriction does not apply to Israeli Arabs or
Palestinians with Israeli identity cards from east Jerusalem, such
as Sami Alayan, 26, who owns a small construction company in
Jerusalem.
	   ``There's no discrimination here _ it gives me a good feeling,''
Alayan said, sitting at a blackjack table with a group of Israelis,
including a well-known TV journalist dressed in a tuxedo.
	   A Palestinian roulette dealer gently set straight a TV cameraman
who asked whether he had a problem serving Israelis.
	   ``I'm serving human beings,'' the dealer said.
	   Will this be good for peace, the cameraman wanted to know.
``It'll help our economy,'' the dealer said, then segued smoothly
back into his croupier's role. ``No more bets, please!''

U.N. report on Algeria calls on government to rein in security

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. team sent to Algeria to look into
the six-year Muslim insurgency condemned the extremism that has
spurred the violence but also called on the government to rein in
its security forces.
	   The team's report, obtained Tuesday, urged a ``change of
mentality'' in Algeria's police, army, judiciary and human rights
institutions following reports of human rights violations by both
the government and insurgents.
	   ``Cases were cited of magistrates who had allegedly turned a
blind eye to credible evidence of torture upon people in police
custody,'' the report said.
	   Human rights officials have been anxiously awaiting the report,
fearing that it wouldn't take a strong enough stand against the
violence that has wracked the country.
	   The insurgency began after the army canceled parliamentary
elections in January 1992 that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, an estimated 75,000 people have been killed.
	   While the government blames Muslim insurgents for the massacres,
human rights groups say the government has carried out torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   Algeria had long rejected having any outside investigation into
the violence, claiming it was an internal matter. The government
relented in July, and a group of ``eminent persons'' chosen by the
U.N. chief visited Algeria in July and August.
	   The team, however, said the Algerian government had prevented
them from meeting with key opposition officials they wanted to see.
Among them was the leader of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front,
Abassi Madani, who is under house arrest, and Ali Belhadj, his
second in command who is imprisoned.
	   The Algerian government said the team couldn't meet with the
leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front because they were ``outside
the framework of legality,'' or that their whereabouts weren't
known, the report said.
	   The report doesn't single out the government for any role in the
attacks and instead condemns terrorism as a whole.
	   It does, however, say that Algeria's ``law-enforcement, security
and self-defense forces should be held to strict standards of
accountability so that the Algerian population and the
international community at large will feel confident that the rule
of law prevails in Algeria.''
	   The team was headed by the former president of Portugal, Mario
Soares. Other team members were former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, Donald McHenry; former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral; former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti;
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako; and former French Health
Minister Simone Veil.
	   Even before the report was released, diplomats and human rights
officials said that differences of opinion within the group were
thwarting a tougher statement and helped delay the report.
	   U.N. officials, however, noted that because of the delicacy of
the mission, a less critical report was perhaps the best way to
enter into a dialogue with the Algerian government.

McGwire hits 63rd home run

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout McGwire waiting for fans before going to
bat; Will be led with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ It took Mark McGwire only one at-bat to take
back sole possession of the North American major league home run
record.
	   McGwire, pinch-hitting in the ninth inning, hit his 63rd home
run Tuesday night to move ahead of Sammy Sosa in the great race.
	   McGwire ended a six-game homer drought with his solo shot off
Pittsburgh reliever Jason Christiansen in St. Louis' 8-6 loss to
the Pirates in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   The Cardinals slugger did not start the opener as a precaution
for his ailing back, and to allow more fans a chance to see him
play. The games were sold out, but only about 10,000 fans were
watching when the first game began.
	   The ballpark was filled by the time McGwire, batting for leadoff
hitter Delino DeShields, made his third pinch-hit appearance of the
season with one out and nobody on in the ninth. On a 1-0 pitch, he
hit a long drive measured at 385 feet (117 meters) into the
bleachers in left-center field. It was his sixth career pinch-hit
homer.
	   The homer was McGwire's first since he broke Roger Maris' record
with No. 62 on Sept. 8, and restored his lead over Sosa, whose
Chicago Cubs played at San Diego later Tuesday.
	   McGwire had been 3-for-18, all singles, since breaking the
record.

Outback road workers hunt wild pigs for extra cash

<TEXT>
	   WINTON, Australia (AP) _ Another day has passed, and the five
road workers in orange shirts are passing around cans of beer.
	   They aren't celebrating another successful repaving effort.
They're cheering the haul from their after-work sideline _ the
eight mud-spattered wild boar lying tied up in the back of the
truck.
	   Meet Ernie Ellis, Frank Mutton, Trevor Parlett, ``Tucker''
Laffin, and ``Chick'' Patterson. They work for the district council
in Winton, the central west Queensland town best known as the
birthplace of Australia's unofficial anthem, ``Waltzing Matilda.''
	   Repairing and building roads in remote parts of this outback
district means the men know exactly where the wild boar roam. Every
afternoon, as soon as their shift is over, they grab their dogs,
jump on their motorbikes or into their truck, and head off across
the ranches and sheep farms in search of pigs.
	   It's become a profitable routine for the rugged quintet.
	   The boars they catch are exported as Australian game meat,
mainly to traditional game-eating countries like Germany, France
and Italy.
	   The going rate for a big wild boar is U.S. 44 cents a kilogram
(32 Australian cents a pound). On average, the men make about 400
Australian dollars a week, about U.S. dlrs 240, from hunting.
	   They live together at roadside camps in portable sheds during
the week, returning to their homes in town each weekend.
	   On Friday mornings, they slaughter the boars they've caught
during the week _ usually at least 20, although they once got 56 in
one afternoon. They take them into Winton to sell to game buyers,
pooling the proceeds to buy food for their week at the road camp
and splitting any leftover cash equally.
	   ``Most of us are supporting families in town, and our living
away from home allowance isn't much, so the extra money always
comes in handy,'' Ellis said.
	   Game meat is a boutique market and accounts for only a small
portion of Australia's export meat market, said Cliff Dee, director
of the company Wild Game Resources in Brisbane. He estimated about
2,500 metric tons of wild boar meat are exported a year.
	   All the wild meat bought by Wild Game Resources is exported.
	   ``Australians have never been a nation of game-eaters,'' said
Michael Mulligan, president of the Australian Game Meat Producers
Association.
	   Indeed, the Winton men say they never eat boar meat themselves.
They don't like the taste.
	   But they like the hunt.
	   Ellis, a 25-year-old father of three, says he has been catching
pigs and kangaroos since he was ``knee-high.''
	   ``I wouldn't keep doing it if it wasn't fun,'' he said.
	   Catching a boar takes courage, speed and strength, but the road
workers are modest about their hunting skills. They say it's just
another job.
	   Patterson described the method: ``Ernie rides his motorbike
along the creek and cuts the biggest pig out from the group. We
chase it in the truck, and our dogs grab the pig by the ears. Then
we go in and grab it and tie it up.'' The latter usually involves a
great deal of wrestling.
	   With boars having a gestation period of three months, three
weeks and three days, ``there's enough pigs out there to keep
everyone happy,'' Patterson said.

Typhoon Stella hits central Japan, two injured

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Typhoon Stella, packing winds up to 108 kilometers
(65 miles) per hour, hit land in central Japan early Wednesday,
injuring two power company workers knocked to the ground by high
sea waves.
	   Waves as high as 7 meters (23 feet) hit coastal areas in
Shizuoka prefecture, or state, where Stella came ashore at around
4:30 a.m. (1930 GMT Tuesday), the Meteorological Agency said.
	   The season's fifth typhoon, was located about 150 kilometers (93
miles), northeast of Tokyo as of 10:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) and was
heading north-northeast at a speed of 45 kilometers (28 miles) per
hour, the agency said.
	   It was expected to head toward Japan's northern main island of
Hokkaido later Wednesday, the agency said.
	   In Shizuoka, about 100 people were evacuated to public
facilities on high land for safety after more than 36 centimeters
(14 inches) of rainfall was recorded over the 24-hour period up to
6 a.m. (2100 GMT Tuesday), said prefectural police spokesman Kenji
Nomura.
	   The two injured men were among six Tokyo Electric Power Co.
workers engaged in restoring power to households in the town of
Higashiizu, he said.
	   Katsumi Inamoto, 46, suffered a skull fracture after he was
knocked to the ground by high waves hitting a sea side road, Nomura
said. Masashi Suzuki, also 46, sustained bruises to his body.
	   Both men were treated at a nearby hospital in Higashiizu, a
coastal hot spring resort, 150 kilometers (94 miles), west of
Tokyo, Nomura said.
	   Additionally, 275 homes were flooded in Shizuoka by heavy rains
from the typhoon, Nomura said.
	   National broadcaster NHK reported disruptions to transportation
in wide swaths of central, eastern and northern Japan.
	   Three domestic airlines canceled scheduled morning flights to
and from Tokyo's Haneda airport, but flights to and from Tokyo's
main international airport at Narita were largely unaffected, NHK
said.
	   Some railway lines in central Japan and the Tokyo area suspended
train runs on Wednesday morning due to the typhoon, according to
the broadcaster.
	   Ferry lines and some subways in the Tokyo area were also
affected.
	   In late August, the season's fourth typhoon, Rex, lingered over
the Pacific south of the main island of Honshu, bringing record
rainfalls to central Japan, killing 16 people and injured 46
others.

Aussies keep pressure on rivals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Daniel Kowalski was prepared to
come right out and say what a lot of Aussies have joked about at
the Commonwealth Games pool.
	   ``This meet has become like a national championships,'' said
Kowalski, adding that it's great for Australia but that the contest
may not be as much fun for everyone else.
	   The Aussie pool party raged on into a fourth day and the team
has won 17 of the first 20 medals on offer. In Tuesday's individual
events Australia won 10 of the 12 overall medals and scored a
thumping relay win.
	   ``You get a sort of feeling that you're above other people, and
those guys are racing for second,'' said Michael Klim, a winner of
four world championship golds earlier this year. ``You're the
standard above and it makes your job a bit easier.''
	   Australia's rout has left just three golds for the other
nations, won by Canada's Joanne Malar and Mark Versfeld and
England's Sarah Rolph.
	   The Australian program is aimed at getting its swimmers to a
point where they can challenge the United States for supremacy in
the pool at the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
	   Central to those plans are Australia's teen stars such as Ian
Thorpe and Grant Hackett.
	   The pair recorded the second and third fastest times ever
Tuesday in claiming the 400-meter freestyle gold and silver.
	   World champion Thorpe, 15, finished in 3 minutes, 44.35 seconds.
World silver medalist Hackett was second on 3:44.88 and Kowalski
third at 3:48.91.
	   The top two were both surprised to get near compatriot Kieren
Perkins' world mark of 3:43.80, set at the 1994 Rome world
championships.
	   Both beat the former second best time of 3:45.00 set by Russian
Evgeni Sadovyi in winning the 1992 Olympic gold medal.
	   Thorpe's victory from the front came after he missed the
200-meter freestyle world record by just .01 seconds earlier in the
meet.
	   ``It wasn't quite as close as my 200 but who's complaining,''
said Thorpe, who picked up a third gold. ``It's much faster than I
expected to go at these championships so I'm happy with that.''
	   Thorpe came from a long way behind to beat Hackett at the world
championships in Perth in January but decided to alter his plan at
this meet.
	   ``I decided to go out faster tonight than I normally do,''
Thorpe said. ``I've realized I can't hold back in the first 200 and
try to come over the top of these guys on the international
scene.''

Rebels accuse Kabila of sponsoring ethnic massacres
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba stood
over the bodies of 12 Congolese Tutsi civilians slain with machetes
and hammers, blamed their slaughter on government-allied troops and
ordered a moment of silence.
	   A day after Congolese rebels fought off loyalists of President
Laurent Kabila in a six-hour battle for the eastern rebel
stronghold of Goma, Wamba was indignant during a somber ceremony
for slain countrymen.
	   He blamed Kabila for massacring the Tutsis and told reporters
standing over the lime-covered corpses: ``We cannot permit Mr.
Kabila to win this war.''
	   Wamba said Monday's attackers were Congolese traditional
warriors and Rwandan Hutu militants, who participated in the 1994
genocide of half a million Tutsis in neighboring Rwanda. The rebels
say the ethnic slayings are continuing in Congo, with Kabila's
backing.
	   Local journalists have reported finding mass graves filled with
the bodies of Congolese Tutsis, and Human Rights Watch reported
last month that government forces had arrested Tutsi civilians and
executed some of them. The reports could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Rebel politician Lunda Bululu said Kabila's acts are aimed
against the Tutsi-led Rwandan government.
	   ``The fighting yesterday constitutes additional proof of the
acts to destabilize a neighboring country, into which Laurent
Desiree Kabila has frenetically thrown himself,'' he said.
	   On Tuesday, reporters were shown 70 captured pro-government
fighters being held at Goma's airport. Rebel officials were irate
over the killings of three men, six women and three children
smashed and hacked to death by as many as 1,000 assailants.
	   The body of one man was missing a hand, another had a deep
jagged wound in the face.
	   Vincent Habimana, one of the prisoners displayed Tuesday, said
his group had planned to capture Goma and then continue to the
Rwandan capital Kigali.
	   The 32-year-old Rwandan said the Hutu fighters had killed Tutsi
women and children ``because they are the enemy.''
	   Rebel leaders, meanwhile, denied government claims Tuesday that
Kabila's troops had pushed to within 50 kilometers (30 miles) of
Goma, insisting they had firm hold on all the eastern Congolese
areas they control.
	   Bululu said rebel forces had dealt Monday's attackers a heavy
blow, killing 300 Kabila loyalists and taking 100 prisoners. He
said two rebel soldiers were killed and 19 wounded.
	   But at the same time, Monday was the first time rebel
headquarters came under attack since the rebellion began Aug. 2.
Bululu claimed Kabila _ whom the rebels accuse of nepotism,
corruption and fostering ethnic violence _ had assistance from
2,000 Sudanese soldiers in addition to those of Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia.
	   Kabila has accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of leading the
rebellion, and demanded the withdrawal of their troops from Congo
before he will hold talks with the rebels.
	   Both countries have denied the charges, but say they have the
right to protect their borders threatened by rebels from their
countries operating out of Congo with Kabila's support.
	   Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame said Monday he had already
mapped out Rwanda's next move in Congo and did not deny Rwandan
troops were across the border.
	   On Tuesday, leaders from southern African nations commended
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia for sending military forces to help
Kabila fight the rebels, but offered no solution for the conflict.
	   Representatives at the annual summit of the 14-nation Southern
African Development Community strongly urged negotiations with the
rebels and urged Kabila to make progress toward democracy.

McGwire hits 63rd home run

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ It took Mark McGwire only one at-bat to regain
the lead in the North American major league home-run derby.
	   McGwire, pinch-hitting in the ninth inning, hit his 63rd home
run Tuesday night to move ahead of Sammy Sosa in the great race. He
ended a six-game homer drought with a solo shot off Pittsburgh
reliever Jason Christiansen in St. Louis' 8-6 loss to the Pirates
in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   ``He's been doing it for a year and two months, people cheering
`C'mon Mark, we want you to hit one,' '' Cardinals manager Tony La
Russa said. ``Boom, he hits one! How does he do it? I have no idea,
except that he's remarkable.''
	   The Cardinals' slugger did not start the opener as a precaution
for his ailing back, and to allow more fans a chance to see him
play. The games were sold out, but only about 10,000 fans were
watching when the first game began.
	   The ballpark was filled and everyone was standing when McGwire,
batting for leadoff hitter Delino DeShields, made his third
pinch-hit appearance of the season with one out and nobody on in
the ninth. On a 1-0 fastball that was down and in, he hit a
towering drive measured at 385 feet (117 meters) into the bleachers
in left-center field for his sixth career pinch-hit homer.
	   It was a gratuitous appearance given the Cardinals were down
three runs, but La Russa said this was a special case. He would
have liked to have had McGwire hit for reliever Jeff Brantley, who
was up fifth that inning, but didn't know if it would last that
long.
	   ``You sit around and wait for that, you may not get there,'' La
Russa said. ``I gave him a shot.''
	   Pirates manager Gene Lamont had no complaints.
	   ``Under ordinary circumstances, you wouldn't send McGwire up in
that situation,'' Lamont said. ``But I understood why Tony did it.
It was a good idea.''
	   The homer was McGwire's first since he broke Roger Maris' record
with No. 62 on Sept. 8, and restored his lead over Sosa, whose
Chicago Cubs played at San Diego later Tuesday.
	   McGwire had been 3-for-18, all singles, since breaking the
record. He did not speak with reporters between games.

General Motors to raise stake in Japan's Suzuki Motor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ General Motors Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp.
announced Wednesday GM will triple its stake in the Japanese
manufacturer as part of a strengthening in their strategic
alliance.
	   In addition to GM upping its capital stake to about 10 percent
from 3.3 percent, the two companies said they will increase
coordination of their global manufacturing operations.
	   The agreement also assigns Suzuki primary responsibility for the
design and development of small and ``mini'' passenger vehicles as
well as small displacement engines, particularly in Asia.
	   U.S.-based GM will be responsible for midsize and large
passenger vehicles.
	   Suzuki is the largest producer of minicars in Japan and one of
the world's leading manufacturer of motorcycles.
	   The two companies also agreed to exchange ``preliminary
information'' regarding advanced technology in areas such as
alternative fuels and intelligent vehicles.
	   As part of the agreement, Suzuki on Nov. 18 will issue 33.6
million new shares to GM for 1,258 yen (U.S. dlrs 9.36) per share
for a total of 42.27 billion yen (dlrs 315 million).
	   GM currently owns 14.7 million shares of Suzuki stock.

North Korea warns Japan against reviving militarism after rocket
</HEADLINE>
launch

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea has warned Japan that any attempt to
use the North's recent rocket launch as a pretext to revive
militarism will have ``catastrophic'' consequences.
	   In a statement issued by its Foreign Ministry, North Korea
accused Japan of trying to use the rocket launch as an excuse to
build up its military and said Tokyo harbors a plan to ultimately
invade the North.
	   The statement, carried Tuesday by the North's official Korean
Central News Agency, also said Japan was using the launch to
deflect attention from its domestic economic crisis.
	   ``The Japanese authorities must ponder over what catastrophic
consequences will result,'' it said.
	   An North Korean radio broadcast of the statement, monitored
Wednesday by Tokyo-based Radio Press, said relations between the
countries have deteriorated to the point of placing them ``on the
verge of war.''
	   The reference to war, however, was not included in KCNA's text
of the statement.
	   Many legislators in Japan are calling on the government to build
a multi-purpose spy satellite following the North's Aug. 31 launch
of a three-stage rocket that sailed over Japan.
	   The North's rocket launch was believed to have been a ballistic
missile test, but the United States announced Tuesday that experts
have determined it was probably a failed attempt to put a satellite
into orbit.
	   Asian countries are highly suspicious of any signs Japan may be
increasing its military capabilities because of its brutal conquest
of East Asia during World War II.

Memoir by Singapore founder infuriates Malaysians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian politicians have accused
Singapore's senior statesman of writing a book that promotes racism
and poisons relations between the two neighbors _ criticism the
author rejects.
	   Lee Kuan Yew's memoir, which went on sale in Singapore on
Wednesday, describes how Singapore and Malaysia merged in 1963
after independence from Britain, but split two years later after
bitter feuding.
	   Singapore, a small island state off Malaysia's southern tip, is
predominantly ethnic Chinese, while Malays make up the majority in
Malaysia.
	   The book comes as tension is rising again between the nations
over disputes involving the location of a railroad border post,
competition over ports and Singapore's purchase of Malaysian water,
among other issues.
	   In ``The Singapore Story,'' Lee, who served as prime minister
from 1959 until 1990, depicts Malaysian leaders in the 1960s as
corrupt and morally lax.
	   Lee, 75, accuses Malaysia's late prime minister Tunku Abdul
Rahman of entertaining at a men's club frequented by call girls. He
also claims that after separation, the Tunku threatened to bully
Singapore through control of its water. Singapore relies on its
neighbor for much of its water.
	   Such accusations provoked harsh criticism from several Malaysian
leaders, including Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar who accused
Lee of ``manipulating facts.'' Excerpts of Lee's book were
published Sunday in a Singaporean newspaper.
	   ``Racial sentiments were fanned as if he was the one who
determined our history,'' Syed said.
	   The youth wing of Malaysia's dominant party, the United Malay
National Organization, said in a statement Tuesday that Lee's book
was an attempt to poison relations between the two countries.
	   Lee told journalAjective account of why and how Singapore sought merger with
Malaysia but in two years was asked to leave Malaysia.''
	   Lee said that his accounts of the brief Singapore-Malaysia union
and its failure are supported by reports of British, American and
Australian diplomats based in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur at the
time.
	   Lee, who in the past had repeatedly said his biggest political
regret is the failure of the merger with Malaysia, now said the
breakup was better for Singapore's prosperity.
	   He cited Singapore's open economy as a significant factor in
transforming the island from a village of about 120 fishermen
before British colonization into today's thriving city of 3.1
million people.

Fierce foe of Mexican church honored in Tabasco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A former governor revered by many for social
reforms and hated by others for his repression of the church has
become the 10th person to have his name inscribed in gold on the
walls of Tabasco's state Congress.
	   Tomas Garrido Canabal is best remembered outside the state as a
malevolent inspiration for Graham Greene's masterpiece ``The Power
and the Glory,'' a novel about religious repression in Mexico.
	   But the government's Notimex news agency said officials in this
Gulf coast state honored him on Tuesday for building schools,
establishing a minimum wage, pushing through votes for women and
expanding agriculture.
	   Writing in ``Mexico: Biography of Power,'' historian Enrique
Krause called Garrido Canabal ``the most frenzied anti-Catholic
ever born in Mexico.''
	   As governor from 1919 to 1926, Garrido Canabal had aides greet
him with the words, ``God does not exist.'' He fiercely pursued
priests and shuttered churches under anti-church laws set off a
rebellion by Catholic laymen in which tens of thousands died.
	   Garrido died in 1943.

UN considers sending team to visit latest Taliban conquest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with Taliban and UN seeking to send team
to province. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban leaders and the
United Nations are trying to arrange for a U.N. team to go to
Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of a key province.
	   The Taliban's invitation for a humanitarian team to go to
Bamiyan comes amid reports that Taliban troops carried out mass
killings after its takeover of the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The U.N. refugee agency reported Tuesday that people fleeing the
city reported a ``killing frenzy'' following the Taliban's Aug. 8
takeover.
	   Reports from Iran, which the Taliban says is backing the
anti-Taliban alliance that has been driven from an estimated 90
percent of Afghanistan, have said similar slayings occurred in the
capture of Bamiyan.
	   Tensions between the neighboring countries have escalated
following the deaths of nine Iranian diplomats during the Taliban
attack on Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The Taliban have acknowledged that unidentified members killed
the Iranians during the takeover of the city _ slayings that have
prompted threats of military retaliation from Tehran.
	   But the Taliban have denied that their fighters killed hundreds
of people belonging to ethnic minority groups.
	   The Taliban was willing to have the United Nations visit Bamiyan
``so that the accusation does not get out of hand as it did in
Mazar-e-Sharif,'' the Taliban's New York representative, Noorullah
Zadran, said in an interview.
	   Central Bamiyan is dominated by Shiite Muslims. The Taliban are
Sunni Muslims. Iran is a largely Shiite nation.
	   Zadran met Tuesday with the U.N. humanitarian aid coordinator,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, and Kieran Prendergast,
undersecretary-general for political affairs, to discuss a possible
mission.
	   U.N. officials were primarily concerned with security guarantees
for the team. Zadran said the team's security was assured.
	   The United Nations was eager to send a mission to Afghanistan
because it no longer has non-Afghan staff working in the country, a
U.N. official said.
	   The meeting came as the Security Council issued a statement
condemning the slayings of the Iranians and calling for the United
Nations to participate in an investigation.
	   ``This was a crime committed in flagrant violation of
international law and despite repeated assurances by the Taliban
leaders guaranteeing the safety and security of the personnel of
foreign missions in Mazar-e-Sharif,'' the council said.
	   The council expressed its deep concern at the escalation of
military operations in Bamiyan and the reports of the
Mazar-e-Sharif slayings.
	   It repeated its earlier condemnation of the slayings of a U.N.
military observer in Kabul and two humanitarian workers in the
eastern city of Jalalabad.
	   Zadran said he told de Mello and Prendergast that two Pakistanis
were in custody and were being investigated for the death of the
observer, Lt. Col. Carmine Calo of Italy, who was killed Aug. 21.
Zadran said he told the officials Afghan authorities would share
the report when it is completed.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked the three governments
that recognize Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to intercede and
persuade the Taliban to respect the rights of all people in
Afghanistan, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. The three _
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates _ agreed to do
so during a meeting Monday with Annan, he said.

England crashes Aussie pool party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Empire strikes back.
	   After four days of Commonwealth Games gold gluttony, Australia's
pool party was put on hold as English swimmers dominated qualifying
for Wednesday's swimming finals.
	   England's James Hickman and Mark Foster led qualifying for the
200-meter butterfly and 50-meter freestyle respectively while Sue
Rolph was well placed in third after the heats of the 200-meter
individual medley.
	   Rolph won the first event of the meet, the 100-meter freestyle,
but then watched Australia win 17 of the next 19 gold medals.
	   Another Englishman, Stephen Parry, was third fastest behind
Hickman and said Australia's dominance was disappointing.
	   ``We're a bit gutted really,'' Parry said. ``You've got to
respect the times the Australian lads are doing but we're keeping
our heads up. It's kind of a hard measuring stick against the
Aussies.''
	   But England is looking to add to Rolph's gold. The only other
two golds won by non-Australians so far have gone to Canadians
Joanne Malar and Mark Versfeld, and they were also well placed to
add to their totals Wednesday.
	   Malar was second behind compatriot Marianne Limpert in the 200
medley heats after winning the 400, while Versfeld led qualfying in
the 100 backstroke after winning the 200.
	   Versfeld was pushed by England's Martin Harris and Neil Willey.
	   ``There seems to be a whole host of people who can do well
tonight,'' said Hickman.
	   Hickman has a silver medal from the 400-meter medley after being
disqualified in the 100-meter butterfly.
	   ``I was really pleased with the way I could lift myself up
immediately and go in for the medley,'' said Hickman. ``I'm
confident today. This has been my main event for a long time now.'
	   Foster broke a games record to qualify as No. 1 for the 50-meter
freestyle. His 22.68 seconds beat Andrew Baildon's 22.76 at the
1990 games.
	   Michael Klim, the world championship bronze medalist, was third
fastest in 22.95, with South Africa's Bredon Dedekind second.

Ramos Horta urges next Australian government to back referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta on
Wednesday urged both sides in Australia's forthcoming national
election to support a referendum on independence for East Timor.
	   The East Timorese independence leader welcomed an apparent
turnaround by Australia's opposition Labor Party, which announced
Tuesday that it supports self-determination for the disputed
territory, and called for a similar commitment from the
conservative government.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it in 1976. Australia is the only country that recognizes
Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
	   Horta praised Labor's new policy and said that it followed years
of Australian support of the annexation of East Timor and ``many
years of lies, half truths (and) omissions.''
	   Speaking on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, he urged the
conservative government to match Labor's promise.
	   However, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said improving the
situation in East Timor was better done by encouraging dialogue
between the Indonesian government and independence leaders.
	   The conservative Liberal-National governing coalition takes on
the opposition Labor Party in a national election on Oct. 3.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Some Asian countries will probably
emerge from the financial crisis with better democracies and
economic systems, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
	   Their economic structures will become ``more competitive, more
transparent, more accountable'' and their governments ``more
democratic'' Downer told Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV.
	   Speaking on the same topic, opposition foreign affairs spokesman
Laurie Brereton said Indonesia's crisis also presented Australia
with a chance to help resolve unrest in East Timor.

More than half of voters disapprove of prime minister, poll says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With key financial reform bills stuck in Parliament
and the economy firmly in recession, more than half of Japanese
voters disapprove of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet,
according to a poll released Wednesday.
	   A full 54 percent of those questioned said they ``do not
support'' Obuchi's seven-week-old government, according to the poll
conducted earlier this week by the Asahi newspaper.
	   Only 21 percent of the 1,106 voters polled by telephone
expressed support for the new Cabinet, the newspaper said. No
margin of error was given.
	   That's down from a 32-percent support rate in polls conducted
right after Obuchi took over on July 30. The Asahi called the
figure the lowest since the government of then Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa in the early 1990s, when Japan's property price
``bubble'' burst.
	   Now Obuchi's finance minister, Miyazawa has faced stiff
resistance in Parliament to a series of bills aimed at cleaning up
the bad loans left on the books of Japan's banks from the collapse.
	   Just 8 percent of those in Wednesday's poll expressed confidence
Obuchi's government would be able to turn the economy around.
	   Despite Obuchi's unpopularity, the poll indicated the largest
opposition party has failed to gain ground. Support for the
opposition Democratic Party of Japan even slipped to 15 percent
from 20 percent in a poll last month, the Asahi said.
	   Twenty-three percent said they support Obuchi's Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   The poll also showed a continuing split between urban and rural
voters, with 52 percent of those engaged in agriculture describing
themselves as LDP supporters and only 17 percent of white collar
respondents backing the ruling party.

Dollar rises against yen, Japanese stocks higher at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Wednesday
morning amid speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will
not cut interest rates anytime soon. Japanese stock prices rose
slightly.
	   The dollar bought 134.38 yen in early trading, up 1.80 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
133.90 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Japan were closed Tuesday for a national
holiday.
	   The dollar's strength also benefited from an overnight rise on
Wall Street, traders said.
	   Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich, speaking at a global
economic conference in Pittsburgh, said on Tuesday that inflation
was a greater threat to the U.S. economy than deflation, a
statement interpreted to mean the United States was less likely to
cut interest rates.
	   That view contradicted the impression held by financial markets
that the Federal Reserve was prepared to cut interest rates if it
would help the economy overcome the negative effects of Asia's
spreading financial crisis.
	   Lower interest rates make a nation's currency less attractive to
investors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were buoyed by the
gains on Wall Street and hopes that the ruling party will reach an
agreement with the opposition on urgently needed banking reform
bills.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 47.01 points,
or 0.33 percent, to 14,274.38 at the end of the morning session. On
Monday, the Nikkei closed up 310.39 points, or 2.23 percent.
	   Traders were encouraged by reports the government is ready to
accept opposition demands for a temporary nationalization of ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in return for support on bills to
clean up the banking system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.59 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,088.75. On
Monday, the TOPIX closed up 12.68 points, or 1.18 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.765 percent, down from 0.775 on Monday,
driving its price up to 114.84 from 114.76 yen.

Fan who caught record-breaking ball in no hurry to give it up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The fan who caught Mark McGwire's 63rd home run
is looking to cash in.
	   ``The ball is worth something to someone, and I'd like to have
something for it myself,'' said John Grass, a 46-year-old from St.
Louis.
	   Grass is the first fan who has not surrendered the ball since
McGwire's 55th home run. He spoke to reporters moments after
catching McGwire's 385-foot (117-meter) pinch homer in the ninth
inning of the first game of Tuesday's doubleheader against
Pittsburgh.
	   Grass, a groundskeeper for a St. Louis County school district,
said he and a friend had purchased four left-field bleacher seats
for the 14 Cardinals home games in September at a cost of dlrs 178
each.
	   ``I was sitting in the eighth row and the ball came right to
me,'' Grass said. ``I saw it all the way.''
	   Grass said he wants McGwire to get the ball, but that he was not
in a big rush to give it to him.
	   ``Right now, its going in my safe deposit box,'' he said.
	   McGwire has said that he will not pay for any baseballs returned
by fans but will trade items such as bats, jerseys and tickets for
them. Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said he did not
expect the team to do any negotiating with Grass.
	   ``I don't know how you would figure out what it's worth,''
Jocketty said. ``It might not be worth much, depending on how many
home runs he hits.''
	   Grass said he wasn't concerned about the value of the ball.
	   ``Whatever happens, I got what I wanted,'' he said. ``I hope
Mark gets the ball, but I'll be happy to keep it or sell it. I want
to think about it.''

Boldon fastest on wet track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later events, finals &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Running in the soggiest lane in
the opening heat, Ato Boldon was the fastest qualifier for the
second round of the Commonwealth Games 100 meters Wednesday and
predicted there probably wouldn't be any world record fireworks
until the final.
	   ``That's unless they put me and Frankie (Fredericks) and Obadele
(Thompson) in the semifinal,'' he said. ``Then, who knows?''
	   Overnight rain had left the National Stadium damp, especially
the home straight, and Boldon had the wettest of all in lane one.
	   But the Trinidadian, who has suggested the world record of 9.84
will go in ideal conditions here with Namibia's Fredericks and
Thompson of Barbados in the field, soon left the others trailing
and crossed the line six meters clear of the field in 10.17
seconds. Second placer Elliot Bunney of Scotland was .53 slower.
	   The winning time was slow by Boldon's standards. He's twice done
9.86 this season and predicts getting faster each round at a venue
where he likes the heat and humidity. The second round was to come
later Wednesday with the semifinal and final on Thursday.
	   ``Maybe 9.9 in the next round. I want to go faster but let's
wait until the final,'' he said.
	   Fredericks, who almost pulled out of the Games after hearing the
Namibian Prime Minister no longer considered him the nation's top
sportsman, was second fastest in 10.19 while Obadele Thompson, who
ran 9.87 at altitude in Johannesburg on Friday, cruised to a heat
win in a modest 10.30.
	   Favored to win the 200 meters, Fredericks said he had forgotten
his difference of opinion with Prime Minister Hage Geingob.
	   ``I was upset. But I thought it was the best thing to come here
and compete for my country,'' the two-time Olympic 200 silver
medalist said.
	   ``I only decided on Sunday night to come here. It's no big deal
now.''
	   The Namibian said he wasn't disappointed with his time.
	   ``Times are not important at this stage,'' he said. ``The main
thing is to get through.''
	   Boldon's appearance was in doubt until three days before the
track events started.
	   ``I meant to throw people off,'' the Trinidadian said. ``Some
people were forcing me to go to certain meets and I didn't want to
people to know I was coming here.
	   ``But this event is important to me. I've got a world
(200-meter) title and great times but I haven't got a Commonwealth
gold medal.
	   ``When Linford Christie won this event four years ago I was in
the final and it was one man against boys. Now I have the chance to
do something about that.''
	   Among other big names to gain the second round later Wednesday
were European champion Darren Campbell of England, who won his heat
in 10.23, and world junior champion Christian Malcolm of Wales, who
placed third in his heat in a modest 10.47.
	   Canada's big hopes, in the absence of world and Olympic champion
and world record holder Donovan Bailey and countryman Bruny Surin,
all made it safely to round two without winning their heats.
	   Glenroy Gilbert, who has shared in three relay gold medal
performances with Bailey and Surin, clocked 10.42 behind Ghana's
Azziz Zakari, who had 10.29. O'Brian Gibbons was beaten by
England's Marlon Devonish and clocked 10.35, and Bradley McCuaig
finished second in 10.35 to Thompson.

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Manny Ramirez hit three homers for his first
40-homer season and drove in five runs Tuesday night as the
Cleveland Indians moved closer to the AL Central title by beating
the Toronto Blue Jays 7-5.
	   Ramirez homered in consecutive at-bats in third, fifth and
seventh, the first two off Dave Stieb (1-2). He didn't bat again.
	   Toronto, which dropped four games behind Boston in the AL
wild-card case, lost its second straight after winning 14 of 16.
Cleveland won its third and reduced their magic number for
clinching the AL Central to two.
	   Chad Ogea (5-3) allowed one run in three innings, and Paul
Assenmacher got one out for his second save.
 &UR; Red Sox 9, Yankees 4
	   In New York, Jason Varitek homered twice and drove in a
career-high five runs and Tim Wakefield (16-8) took a shutout into
the seventh as Boston stopped a three-game losing streak, winning
for only the third time in 12 games.
	   New York, which gave rookie pitcher Mike Jerzembeck (0-1) his
first major league start in order to give their starters an extra
days' rest, dropped to 6-9 in its last 15. The Yankees need to go
8-5 in their final 13 games to set the AL record for wins in a
season.
	   Scott Brosius hit a three-run homer and Bernie Williams had a
solo shot for New York.
 &UR; Rangers 6, Orioles 5
	   In Baltimore, Ivan Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the ninth
inning off Armando Benitez (5-5) as Texas rallied from a 5-0
deficit and moved within one game of Anaheim in the AL West.
	   The Angels travel to Texas for a two-game series that begins
Wednesday. Tim Crabtree (5-1) got the final out in the eighth, and
John Wetteland finished for his 40th save.
	   Juan Gonzalez picked up his 152nd RBI for Texas, the most in the
majors since Tommy Davis had 152 for the Los Angeles Dodgers in
1962.
 &UR; Devil Rays 8, Angels 1
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Rolando Arrojo (14-12) set a record
for wins by an expansion pitcher, allowing an unearned run and four
hits in seven innings to win at home for the first time since June
17.
	   Tampa Bay scored six runs off Jeff Juden (1-3) and Rich Butler
hit a two-run homer off Mike Fetters.
 &UR; Mariners 12, Twins 7
	   In Minneapolis, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his AL-leading 52nd homer
and drove in five runs to become the fourth-youngest player to
reach 1,000 RBIs.
	   Griffey, who was 4-for-6, lined a two-run single to center field
with the bases loaded in a four-run fourth inning to pass the
milestone. He then added a three-run homer in a six-run seventh.
	   Griffey now has 1,004 RBIs in 10 seasons. At 28 years and 10
months, he got to 1,000 faster than anyone except Mel Ott (27
years, three months), Jimmie Foxx (27 years, eight months) and Lou
Gehrig (28 years, 9{ months).
	   Former-Twin Paul Abbott (2-0) allowed four runs on seven hits in
five-plus innings on his 31st birthday. Frank Rodriguez (4-6) lost
his fourth straight.
 &UR; Royals 6, Athletics 3
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Jeff King and Scott Leius drove in two
runs apiece as Kansas City stretched a home winning streak to four
for the first time in since Sept. 13-17, 1996.
	   Pat Rapp (12-12) gave up five hits in six innings, including
solo homers by A.J. Hinch, Tejada and Matt Stairs. Jeff Montgomery
got three outs for his 34th save.
	   Kenny Rogers (14-8) allowed five runs and six hits in five
innings.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire, pinch-hitting in the ninth
inning, hit his 63rd home run in the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-6 loss
to Pittsburgh in the first game of a doubleheader.
	   McGwire moved ahead of the Cubs' Sammy Sosa in the home-run

Jason Christiansen. McGwire had been 3-for-18, all singles, since

three runs in the third inning.
 &UR; Reds 5, Brewers 1
	   In Cincinnati, Barry Larkin and Bret Boone homered and Mike
Remlinger pitched six strong innings to lead Cincinnati.
	   Remlinger (8-15), in his second start since making six relief

Aid flow still slow to Mexican flood victims

	   HUIXTLA, Mexico (AP) _ Thousands of flood victims remained
without food aid or medical care, five days after rivers washed
away homes, crops and many of their neighbors.
	   Cloudy weather on Tuesday prevented aid flights from reaching
many areas in the ravaged coastal region of southern Mexico.
	   In the remote village of Vademia, one of thousands of
settlements blasted by the floods, farmer Ramon Gutierrez _ his
feet swollen from infection _ was angry.
	   ``The aid that President Ernesto Zedillo offered by television
still has not arrived and we are sure it will not arrive because we
are from the PRD,'' he said, referring to the opposition Democratic
Revolutionary Party.
	   But Lt. Col. Edgar Novelo, an army surgeon helping oversee
medical aid efforts, said authorities ``are doing everything
possible to reach all of the communities.''
	   He noted that with roads and bridges destroyed, hundreds of
communities can be reached only by air. About 1.2 million people
live in the municipalities affected by last week's flooding.
	   In nearby Huixtla, aid did arrive, and hundreds lined up to
receive food or medical treatment.
	   ``The medical attention of the soldiers is very good,'' said
Amparo Moreno Palomeque, waiting in a food line as she balanced a
baby against her tattered blue dress with one hand and clutched a
plastic food bowl with the other.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo said Monday that officials had
organized a 70-helicopter airlift to bring aid to isolated
villages. But on Tuesday, state officials said they had to suspend
air operations because of low clouds that drizzled rain.
	   The federal Defense Secretariat, however, issued a news release
late Tuesday saying that its aid flights had continued without
pause.
