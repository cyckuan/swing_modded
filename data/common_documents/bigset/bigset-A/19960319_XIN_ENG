<HEADLINE> New GCC Chief Visits Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) leaders are keen for enhancing unity of member states,
visiting new GCC Secretary General Jamil al-Hojeilan told Kuwait
News Agency, KUNA, today.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit here, al-Hojeilan held talks with
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah soon after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hojeilan said after the meeting that there were no
differences but divergence in views with Qatar, and
his naming as new GCC Secretary General,
</P>
<P>
It is the right of Qatar to express its opinion and "I will be
at the service of all GCC member states," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyhow the matter was solved, he said, adding that "I am sure
that the wisdom of (Qatari Emir) Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani
was behind the solution."
</P>
<P>
During the last GCC Summit conference held in Oman last
December, Qatar objected to naming al-Hojeilan, a Saudi Arabian
career diplomat, as new GCC Secretary General and favored the
naming of its candidate.
</P>
<P>
But recently Qatar announced its approval on Hojeilan's naming as
the new GCC chief.
</P>
<P>
al-Hojeilan said he would visit Qatar in the near future, but
no date was yet set for the visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would cling to the same methodology and policy
adopted by his predecessors Abdullah Bishara of Kuwait and Sheikh
Fahim al-Qassimi of the United Arab Emirates after he assumes
office on April 1.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes to Launch Cyprus Negotiation After May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States has expressed
the hope to launch a negotiation between the two communities in
Cyprus after the country's parliamentary election in May, in an
effort to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides today,
U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher said that the
negotiation is aimed at solving the dispute of the two communities
-- the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a report that the U.S. has prepared a plan aimed
at resolving the Cyprus problem, the U.S. diplomat said that his
country has not prepared such a plan.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the U.S. has the intention to move forward in
a serious manner to try to help solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Boucher noted that the elements that are necessary to make the
solution are on the table. "What we need is to sit down and to put
these elements together in way that makes sense and meets the
fundamental needs of the two communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel will visit
Washington at the end of March, and U.S. President Bill Clinton
intends to discuss the Cyprus issue with him.
</P>
<P>
In April, Greece's Prime Minister Costas Simitis will be
visiting Washington and in May, Greece's President Costis
Stephanopoulos will meet President Clinton, Boucher added.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will put us in a position to launch a
negotiation after the parliamentary election (in Cyprus) in May,"
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized northern third of the island following an abortive coup
by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks today with his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel in
southern Egyptian resort of Aswan mainly on Middle East peace
process and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who arrived in Egypt earlier today, also discussed
with Mubarak the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following their meeting, both
Mubarak and Demirel hailed relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president told reporters that Turkey and Egypt are
seeking to step up the bilateral relations, noting that the volume
of trade exchanges and mutual investments have been increased.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries are also looking forward to
further cooperation in military field.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, voicing his country's support for the regional peace
march, lauded Mubarak's efforts to push forward the Arab-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who attended the Summit of Peacemakers in the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh last Wednesday, told the press
conference that the summit reflected the solidarity of the
international community against all kinds of terrorism, which
should be fought whatever its motives were.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that there is no evidence that Syria was involved
in any terrorist operation.
</P>
<P>

several-hour visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Sends Detailed Budget to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- President Clinton sent to the
U.S. Congress today a detailed budget of fiscal 1997 that would
provide modest tax cut and a balanced budget in seven years.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a spending of 1.6486 trillion dollars for the U.S.
government in the fiscal year which begins from October 1. The
spending is 4 percent higher than the estimated 1.57 trillion
dollars the government will spend in current fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
With a projected revenue of 1.4844 trillion dollars in fiscal
1997, President Clinton expected a budget difficulty of 164.2 billion
dollars in the year.
</P>
<P>
The formal submission of the budget is six weeks late this year
due to the protracted deadlock with the Republican-controlled
Congress over the budget of 1996.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton sent to the Congress on February 5 a outlined
budget and the detailed proposals today provide the first
program-by-program look at a budget plan totaling more than 2000
pages.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's budget today restated his "Middle Class Bill of
Rights" tax cut proposals he first outlined in December 1994. He
would cut taxes by 100 billion dollars over seven years including
3.3 billion in 1996 and 13.9 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's budget projects the deficit for 1997 will rise to
164.2 billion dollars, up from 158 billion in the current fiscal
year, but then decline steadily until reaching a surplus of 7.6
billion in 2002. These calculations use economic assumptions of
the Congressional Budget Office demand by Republicans in the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the balanced budget, the president proposes savings
of 593 billion dollars from 1996 through 2002, including cutting
124.2 billion in Medicare, 59.1 billion in Medicaid, 40 billion in
welfare and 297 billion in other governmental programs.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans in the Congress have already dismissed
president Clinton's budget as doing too little to curb the
government's expensive benefit programs such as Medicare and
providing too little in tax relief.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans is reportedly plans to begin on a plan of their
own after Congress's two-week recess in early April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with U.S. fiscal 1996 half gone, the budget of the
1996 is remaining unsettled and some government departments and
agencies are operating under a stopgap spending bill expiring on
March 22.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Small Business Federation To Monitor Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's small,
independent businesses have been offered a legislative mouthpiece
with their two organizations set up here today.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony of the South African National
Federation of Independent Business (SANFIB) and its associate
foundation, the Small Business Project (SBP), SANFIB founder
member and SBP executive director Chris Darroll said the
organizations were formed to give small and independent business
owners a voice in government decision making.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued at the ceremony, SANFIB
''exists purely to champion and advocate the interests of small
and independent business owners by advancing their concerns on
legislative, regulatory and policy matters which affect and
hinder the growth of small and medium enterprises''.
</P>
<P>
The SANFIB would consist of two components: the SBP as an
independent policy formulation and economic research unit, and a
membership component which would operate as a voluntary
association of small and independent business owners.
</P>
<P>
''As the SANFIB gathers strength in numbers, it will provide
legislators with a clear message as to how the small and
independent business community views specific policy, laws and
regulations,'' said Darroll.
</P>
<P>
The federation would monitor and evaluate all laws and
regulations imposed by government that could impact on small
business, she added.
</P>
<P>
The South African government earlier promised to help the
small and medium-sized business, which had been deprived of the
opportunity of development under apartheid, both financially and
legislatively in a bid to boost the economy of the country.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Market Shows Signs of Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- There has been a widespread
increase in demand from potential house buyers in Britain in the
first two months of this year, according to a survey of more than
130 estate agents published today.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
provides further evidence of a revival in the housing market
following recent increases in building society and bank mortgage
lending.
</P>
<P>
Almost two-thirds of English and Welsh estate agents, replying
to the institution's survey, said requests for viewings and
valuations by potential buyers had increased by up to 10 percent
in the three months to the end of February.
</P>
<P>
A further 12 percent reported that housing market activity had
risen by between 25 percent and 50 percent over the period.
</P>
<P>
The institution said: "The figures show that prospects for a
rise in house sales are the best since the survey was started in
1994."
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the recovery remained fragile and agents
remained concerned that the recent revival could peter out, as
some agents say that although market activity continues to
increase, it is still difficult to get sales to completion due to
buyer's caution.
</P>
<P>
Other agents point out that house buying demand had increased
at the beginning of the two previous years only to fall away
sharply after Easter.

<HEADLINE> Greek Farmers Stage Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 farmers and stock-
breeders from all over Greece demonstrated in the center of Athens
today to press demands for higher prices for their produce,
causing traffic chaos for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Dairy farmers, who have been particularly affected by low
prices, are demanding income support.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered outside the agriculture ministry
building before marching through the center of the capital to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The farmers attributed what they described as their ''dire''
position to the policies of the European Union and successive
Greek governments.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution addressed to the country's Parliament Speaker
Apostolos Kaklamanis, the protesters said the government must
immediately double the eu and national funds allocated for
infrastructure works and grant interest subsidies for building
installations and machinery.
</P>
<P>
They are also demanding controls on the prices of farm supplies
and animal feed machinery, the abolition of special taxes on fuel
used in agricultural production, the reduction of value added tax
(VAT) on purchases by farmers and the introduction of market
police regulations obliging dairy industries to pay dairy farmers
a minimum of 215 drachmas (about 0.9 U.S. dollars) per kilo for
milk.
</P>
<P>
After the resolution had been submitted, representatives of
the farmers warned ''the struggle is beginning now'' and
threatened to block national roads until their demands were met.
</P>
<P>
there have been demonstrations and rallies all over the country
during the last few weeks, with farmers spilling large quantities
of milk and slaughtering lambs outside public buildings.

<HEADLINE> Intervention Halts Indian Rupee's Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI)'s timely dollar selling intervention halted the slide of the
rupee and the Indian currency rallied to close at 35.15/20 per US
dollar at the Interbank foreign exchange market in Mumbai (Bombay)
today.
</P>
<P>
Resuming lower at 35.05/15 rupees per dollar from the overnight
finish of 34.95/35.00, the rupee later breached the 35.50 rupees
psychological barrier and nose-dived to 35.75/85 due to all-round
corporate dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
The RBI began to sell dollars at noon and the rupee staged a
modest rally to 35.40/45 rupees. Renewed dollar buying by
corporates and importers resulted in another fall of the Indian
unit to 35.60/70, forcing a second dollar selling intervention by
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The timely RBI interventions resulted in dollar selling
pressure, the rupee recovered partly to settle at 35.10/20 rupees
per dollar, still sharply lower from Monday's levels.
</P>
<P>
The rupee had plunged to an all-time low of 38.20/40 rupees on
February 6, which had forced the RBI to initiate a series of
measures to halt the steep fall of the rupee.

<HEADLINE> Peres's Military Advisor to Be New Mossad Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Major-General Danny Yatom,
the military advisor to Prime Minister Shimon Peres, will be the
next head of the Israeli intelligence service, known as Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said today that the appointment of Yatom will be
officially announced at the next Israeli cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Israeli military censor has
allowed publication of the name of a Mossad chief.
</P>
<P>
The precedent followed a report in Monday's Haretz newspaper
giving the name despite military censorship regulations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the name of Amit Ayalon, head of the
Israeli General Security Service (GSS) was also published by the
media although the military censor also forbids such publication.

<HEADLINE> Burkina Faso To Send Troops To Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Burkina Faso has declared "its
intention" to contribute troops to the West African peacekeeping
force, known as ECOMOG, in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Executive Secretary of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Edouard Benjamin, in
the Liberian Capital Monrovia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin told the regular annual meeting of chiefs of staff of
ECOMOG that Burkina Faso had agreed to contribute troops to
ECOMOG after an appeal to ECOWAS member states to augment the
strength of ECOMOG, according to a report received here today.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace agreement signed by all parties to the Liberian
conflict in Nigeria's capital Abuja last August, the ECOMOG force
is responsible to disarm about 60,000 combatants of seven
Liberian warring factions before an election in the war-torn
Liberia takes place.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led peacekeepers, coming from Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Mali, are believed to be about
7,000 troops at present.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS secretary said that "the current figure is far from
the full strength needed" to carry out the disarmament of the
Liberian combatants.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS sent the ECOMOG force to Liberia in August 1990,
eight months after the Liberian civil war broke out, to help
restore peace to the West African nation.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Deport Hamas, Islamic Jihad Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Ori Orr said today that once the necessary legal process is
completed, his country will begin deporting Islamic extremists in
retaliation of the recent wave of Hamas suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Orr made the remarks during a tour of the Jordan Valley
accompanied by senior Jordanian army officers, Israel Television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Orr said that the decision of deportation has already been
taken and is now only subjected to legal approval.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli security sources, two brothers of Hamas
bomb expert Yehiyeh Ayyash, who was killed in an explosion in
January, are among those on the list of Hamas and Islamic Jihad
activists to be deported from the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip. The list was drawn up by the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Four Hamas suicide bombings from February 25 to March 4 in
Israel killed 58 people and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent severe crackdown by both the Palestinian
police and the Israeli security forces, over 800 Hamas and
Islamic Jihad activists have so far been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Report Lists Ways to Boost EU Investment in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- European companies have
underestimated growth potential in Asia is one of the reasons why
Europe lags behind Asia and the United States as an investor in
the region, according to a report published today by the European
Commission(EC).
</P>
<P>
The report, carried out by independent consultants under the
joint sponsorship of the EC and the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, recommended that the European Union(EU)
should extend its investment initiatives to the whole of Asia and
improve coordination between them, while Asian countries should
further liberalize their investment regimes and improve legal
certainty and transparency for European firms investing on their
territory.
</P>
<P>
It also contained the suggestion that all foreign direct
investment worldwide should ultimately take place within the same
multilateral ground rules.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that the main drive in the effort to extend
and deepen the economic links between the EU and Asia can only
come from business itself.
</P>
<P>
"European Union firms must recognize that a stronger EU
presence in this region is essential for their future global
competitiveness," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
This report will be discussed by some 60 top business leaders
from the EU and Asia at a key investment conference in Geneva on
April 1.
</P>
<P>
According to EC officials, reactions to the report from
business will help the EU formulate a detailed investment strategy
in order to plug the gap that exists between European investment
and that of its key economic partners.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this report, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade
commissioner, said: "Much of European business has been slow to
latch on to the vast implications of economic growth in Asia. This
report will help us to diagnose the problem and take the views of
business on board as to what to do about it."
</P>
<P>
"That is a necessary prelude to effective action," he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Rafah Crossing-Point Opens to Palestinian Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has opened its Rafah
crossing-point as of Monday night to Palestinian exports, allowing
Palestinian goods to enter Egypt and be shipped from the Cairo
airport, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Agriculture Ministry Undersecretary Atta Abu-Kersh
was quoted as saying that Egypt's move was a result of contacts
between the two sides following Israel's closure of its
crossing-points to Palestinian agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Finance Minister Mohi Eddin el-Gharib has asked the
Customs Authority to facilitate all procedures for the entry of
shipments of Palestinian exported goods so that they can reach
Egyptian ports and airports in due time, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
A shipment of flowers bound for the Netherlands has already
arrived at the Rafah crossing-point from the Gaza Strip on its way
to the Cairo airport, MENA added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's move is apparently aimed at alleviating the hardship of
the Palestinians caused by the Israeli closure of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sealed off the Palestinian self-rule territories
following four suicide bombings in Israel in a nine-day period
since February 25.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed responsibility
for the attacks, which killed 58 innocents and four suicide
bombers.

LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Students of the University of
Zambia began a class boycott today, demanding some of allowances
which the government has reportedly failed to pay them.
</P>
<P>
Public secretary of the university's students union Brian
Mulenga said by refusing to pay, the government wanted to drag
the students into confrontation and use the situation as an
excuse to pave way for closure of the university before the
general and presidential elections later this year.

The government had taken a wrong stance over this issue
because this could not work on its advantage, Mulenga said.

It was not the students' wish to act, but if necessary, they

<HEADLINE> Shift-Based Electric Services In Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Electric Light
and Power Authority announced today that it would continue the
shift-based electric services because the amount of rainfall
decreased by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Public relations manager of the authority Sendeku Araya said
Addis Ababa and other towns that get electric power from hydro-
electric power stations would continue receiving services on
shift basis with at least a 13-hour power blackout weekly.
</P>
<P>
He further explained the reason that the amount of last year's
rainfall which entered into Melka Wakena and Koka dams had
significantly decreased when compared to the previous years.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the authority after residents of
the capital recently expressed anger through mass media over the
repeated power failure since the end of last year which incurred
loss in their business.
</P>
<P>
Sendeku said the current shift-based service might be
reconsidered only when the volume of water in the dams increased
due to the coming raining season.
</P>
<P>
He said unexpected power failure might also occur due to winds
and tree felling,adding that in an effort to mitigate the problem
of power failure occurring due to contacts of electric lines and
trees, a task force set up to create favorable conditions began
activities today.

<HEADLINE> Georgia May Sign CIS Integration Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze hinted here today that his country may join an
in-depth integration treaty to be signed by four other CIS
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The principles, on which Russia and three other countries of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) plan to sign an
in-depth integration treaty, are 'completely acceptable' to our
country," Shevardnadze told reporters after a three-hour
closed-door meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said an integration treaty will be signed by Russia,
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan this month.
</P>
<P>
"This document," Yeltsin said, "will be open for other
countries to sign," and Georgia will be able to sign it as soon as
it is ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian president, who arrived here on Monday for a
two-day official visit, said relations between the two former
Soviet republics had been " actually developing along the road of
in-depth integration, particularly in such sectors as ferrous and
non-ferrous metallurgy and machine-building" since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also said he proposed to Yeltsin an emergency
meeting of CIS leaders to discuss the Russian State Duma's
adoption of resolutions scrapping the 1991 accords which dissolved
the former Soviet Union and formed the CIS.
</P>
<P>
"In this situation, urgent measures should be taken," the
Georgian leader said, adding that the resolutions passed by the
Duma, or lower house of parliament, affect not only Russia, but
also "the interests of all the CIS member-states."
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that during their meeting Yeltsin had
denounced the resolutions. Yeltsin described the
resolutions as "an infringement on the statehood of Russia" and on
the constitution, said the Georgian leader.
</P>
<P>
"The Duma started an uproar for the whole world to hear, and it
will answer for its irresponsible actions," Shevardnadze quoted
Yeltsin as warning.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is chairman of the Council of the CIS, said he
would take part in any meeting called by CIS leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also agreed to hold "a big Caucasian summit"
to discuss how to settle armed conflicts in the region. Yeltsin
will contact heads of Russia's North Caucasian republics, while
Shevardnadze will contact the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze is expected to hold a meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin later today, after which a number of
agreements will be signed to expand bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides may also sign a joint declaration on the
settlement of the situation in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Most Tragic Fire I Have Ever Seen" (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Fire incidents are part of life in
Metro Manila, especially during the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Almost every day, you can hear sounds of alarm sent by fire
trucks along Metro Manila's main streets.
</P>
<P>
However, the morning fire that hit the ozone disco in Quezon
city in Metro Manila, which killed at least 150 people, is the
most tragic fire to happen in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most tragic fire I have ever seen," a fire fighter
told this reporter today inside the disco house at the corner of
Tomas Morato street and Timog Avenue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fire was tapped in at 0:05 a.m. and lasted 52
minutes.
</P>
<P>
A portion of the disco house exploded followed by the collapse
of its attic, resulting a stampede, he added.
</P>
<P>
There were about 350 people inside the disco pub when the fire
broke out, police said.
</P>
<P>
The 150 fatalities, mostly graduating students from various
universities in Metro Manila, were enjoying dancing the disco
music when the fire took place.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the disco house, without fire exit, only
has one entrance/exit door.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims died of suffocation when they failed to
leave the burning building during the stampede at the height of
the fire, they added.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos visited the site and mourned over the
death of the victims. He said, "This is a terrible tragedy. We
must make sure that there is no recurrence of this incident."
</P>
<P>
He also ordered to form a special team to investigate the disco
fire tragedy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bureau of Fire Protection, the ozone disco
blaze is the 625th fire incident in the country for 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 6,935 fire incidents occurred in the Philippines,
killing 148 people, leaving 378 injured and burning 103 million US
dollars worth of properties.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country witnessed 7,856 fire incidents, killing
234 people, injuring 553 and damaging 235.7 million dollars of
properties.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of 1996, 420 fire cases were reported,
killing six people, injuring 30 and damaging 30.56 million dollars
of properties.

<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced
that over 30 donor countries have agreed on new funding for the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank
affiliate which is the main source of development for low-income
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said donors meeting in Tokyo today endorsed a package
which will allow concessional lending of 22 billion U.S. dollars
over the next three years. New contribution to this package is
about 11 billion dollars, with the rest coming mainly from past
donor contributions, repayments of IDA credits, and contributions
from the World Bank itself.
</P>
<P>
The three-year package begins with a one-year interim fund of
about 3 billion dollars running from July this year, with
decision-making and procurement limited to contributing donors and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States will not contribute to the interim fund and
it is instead undertaking to pay about 934 million dollars
remaining due to fulfil its commitment to IDA's Tenth
Replenishment, which ends in June this year, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
In each of the two subsequent years, starting mid-1997, all IDA
donors will contribute about 4 billion dollars to the Eleventh
Replenishment of IDA.

<HEADLINE> polluted river kills mounds of fish in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of fish were found dead
and floating in the Ciliwung river in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
This type of fish known locally as "sapu-sapu", which live in
the dirtiest waters, died suddenly and for no apparent reason,
according to sources from the city's environmental study and
monitoring office here today.
</P>
<P>
There are not many industries in the area where the dead fish
were found. Dozens of marine officers helped to remove them from
the river.
</P>
<P>
Domestic waste may be part of the cause, leading to a lack of
oxygen. Other causes might be pollution of the river and a
subsequent "red tide", a phenomenon which cuts off the river's
oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
Although the Jakarta administration has carried out a city's
clean river campaign, the condition of the river is still bad.
</P>
<P>
The city's environmental study and monitoring office together
with the city's fishery agency are checking into the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations appealed on
Tuesday for 57 million U.S. dollar worth of aid to meet the
humanitarian needs in Sierra Leone, where a five-year civil
conflict has left some 2 million people displaced.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. also called for quick response to the appeal, saying
the capacity of relief organizations to deliver assistance is
greatest during the current dry season.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. appeal is supposed to cover the period from March 1996
through February 1997, meeting the emergency needs of the
war-affected population in the country, which is facing a serious
humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Starvation menaces the entire communities of the displaced
persons, U.N. noted. Moreover, poor security conditions have
allowed only sporadic delivery of relief goods for the last 18
months in some areas of the country, in particular the south and
the east, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. reported that only one eighth of the 1.6 million
internally displaced people have found shelters in camp
structures, with the majority fleeing to district towns, where
local coping mechanisms are collapsing under the strain of
overcrowding, malnutrition and the outbreak of disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 persons were injured in
violent clashes here today when police stopped opposition
processionists protesting against the holding of the first session
of the newly-elected sixth parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prosessionists tried to march towards the parliament
building and police charged batons, lobbed teargas shells and
fired rubber bullets to disperse the agitating crowd who in turn
pelted stones on police.
</P>
<P>
The opposition activists also set fire in some offices while
series of gun shots were heard from the Dhaka university campus.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sheikh Hasina, opposition leader and president of the
largest opposition party -- the Awami (People's) League, addressed
a rally and reiterated the demand for cancellation of the 6th
parliamentary election of February 15 to pave the way for fresh
polls under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
If the demand was not met, the situation in the country would
be worsened further, she warned.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won the February
15 elections which were boycotted by all opposition parties.
Since then, the opposition have enforced an indefinite nationwide
non-cooperation movement to press their demand.
</P>
<P>
But despite the resistance, the new BNP cabinet led by Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia was sworn in today and the
newly-elected 6th parliament also held its first session.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENTIANE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Wen Jiabao, Head of the Chinese
Communist Party delegation to the ongoing Sixth Congress of the
Lao People's Revolutionary Party, has met Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, chairman of the Cambodian FUNCINPEK Party, and Chea
Sim, chairman of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
The two meetings were held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere
on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao is an alternate member of the Political Bureau and

Communist Party of China, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh is also the
First Prime minister of the Cambodian government, while Chea Sim
is President of the Cambodian National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Wen said the Sino-Cambodian friendship
began a long, long ago. In 1955, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai met
Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, opening a new era of Sino-Cambodian
friendship.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, friendship between the two nations has been
steadily developing as a result mutual visits by leaders of the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that the Communist Party of China wished to develop
friendly relations with FUNCINPEK and CPP on the basis of the four
principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, so as to
promote the friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao also expressed appreciation and thanks to Cambodia's
following the "one China" policy and supporting China's great
cause of national unification.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh recalled China's support for the Cambodian people's
cause in various historical periods, saying that the
Sino-Cambodian friendship will never change.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim thanked the Chinese party, government and people for
their support to the Cambodian people's struggle and national
reconstruction, saying that his party and the Kingdom adhere to
the "one China" stance, and expressed admiration of China's
achievements scored in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, Ranariddh and Chea Sim are all here to attend the
Sixth Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, being held
on March 18-20.
</P>
<P>
Four foreign political party delegations have been invited by
the Lao party to the Congress -- the Communist Party of China, the
Communist Party of Vietnam, the FUNCINPEK Party and the Cambodian
People's Party.

donated medicine including polio, BCG and measles vaccines worth
630,000 US Dollars to Zambia to support the southern African
country's health program in 1995-1996.

<P>
Speaking at a hand-over ceremony here, Zambian Deputy Health

<HEADLINE> Mandela's 38-year Marriage Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela's 38-year marriage ended here today.
</P>
<P>
During the second day of the divorce proceedings at
Johannesburg's Rand Supreme Court, which was brought by the
president against his estranged wife Winnie, Judge Justice
Frikkie Eloff ordered the divorce and ordered Mrs. Mandela to pay
Mr. Mandela's court costs for the two-day proceedings.
</P>
<P>
''The position appears to be clear to me,'' said Justice
Eloff, ''The plaintiff is entitled to a divorce.''
</P>
<P>
Eloff based the ruling on two grounds that the divorce act
requires as necessary for a marriage to be considered
irretrievable: living apart for at least one year and one party
having committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
''Both of these have been established and remain unchallenged
(by Mrs. Mandela),'' said Eloff.
</P>
<P>
When the ruling was made, Mandela closed his eyes, spoke to
Winnie's lawyer and shook hands with his own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Winnie looked grim and left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 78, married Winnie Makizikela in 1958. The couple
separated in 1992, two years after Mandela's release from 27
years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Winnie, who reportedly refused to settle the matter out
of court, contested the divorce and asked for half of
Mandela's estate.

<HEADLINE> China Urges End to Confrontation on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday condemned Western
countries for using the United Nations Commission on Human Rights
as a tool for political confrontation with developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission should not be an arena for political
confrontation, still less a tribunal to put developing countries
on trial", China's Ambassador to the U.N. Geneva office Wu
Jianmin told a meeting of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who headed the Chinese delegation to the six-week conference
that opened Monday, made the remarks after speeches by delegates
from a number of developing countries condemning the
politicization of human rights, double standards and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission was a place for intense East-West
confrontation," Wu said, and now "with the Cold War over, the
East-West confrontation has been replaced by one between the North
and the South."
</P>
<P>
He said most of the 58 country resolutions adopted by the
commission since 1992 pointed fingers at developing countries, and
almost all the 17 country Rapporteurs and Special Representatives
appointed by the Commission are hostile to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Recalling a list of 51 developing countries denounced as
violators of human rights by a representative of a group of
developed countries at the last session, Wu said the commission
had become a court where the vast majority of developing countries
are put on trial by the judges of a few developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"The supreme judge is that super power," he said, which itself
is troubled by "serious violations of human rights such as racial
discrimination, police violence and crimes."
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at those countries which regarded the Commission
as a "tool to pursue their foreign policy" and whose interest was
not human rights but power politics.
</P>
<P>
Wu said their sense of supremacy had led to double standards
and imposition of one's views on others, which undermined the
principle of international cooperation and obstructed the normal
function of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
He called for an end to political confrontation which would
only lead U.N. activities in the human rights arena to a dead
end. He urged the promotion of human rights through dialogue and
cooperation on an equal footing in conformity with the principles
of the U.N. Charter and Vienna Declaration and Program of Action.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Arrests 13 Suspected Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces today
arrested 13 suspected Moslem militants in a crackdown in Cairo and
five provinces, Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
An official security source was quoted as saying that the
crackdown was part of the Interior Ministry's strategy of tracking
down fugitive militants.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, some wanted in attacks on a mosque and video
shops, have been known for their "blood-thirsty orientations,"
MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Among the arrested were Zahr-Edding Fikri Zahran, involved in
setting ablaze video stores in Cairo, and some other members of
Gamaa Al Islamiya, or the Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said that the security forces have been
tracking down fugitive militants involved in past acts of
terrorism all over Egypt, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been haunted by terrorist attacks since 1992. The
attacks, mainly targeting Christians and policemen, are believed
to have been carried out by suspected Islamic fundamentalist
militants, who have waged a violent campaign against the
government over the past four years in an attempt to install
strict Islamic rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
The security forces have cracked down on Moslem militants
fiercely and largely contained their terrorist acts, which have
only occurred sporadically in villages in the south.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Interior Minister Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy announced
that a two-year-old curfew on the southern city of Mallawi has
been lifted in the light of the improved security in the city.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Chinese swimming star
Wang Dali took a four-day leave from his Japanese University study
to begin helping the Hong Kong team Tuesday prepare for next
month's Asian championships.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 29, men's 1500 meters freestyle at the 1986 Asian Games
in Seoul, has been studying in the University of Takushoku in
Tokyo since 1992 as a business major.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) has offered Wang an
assistant coach's post, which was recently vacant after the former
coach's contract expired.
</P>
<P>
"Although Hong Kong has something attractive to me, I've not
yet come to any decision," he said at the pool side in the HKSI.
</P>
<P>
Wang is expected to make up his mind after returning to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The former star said that he wished to be a coach first after
his graduation in April.
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, I'll try to know more about the society and things
around me so that I can be ready someday for switching to
business," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But on the longer terms, I'll probably go back to my
motherland for further development," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Meeting of Nepal's Second Ruling Party Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Party
(RPP), Nepal's second ruling party, today postponed an emergency
meeting of its Central Committee as party leaders still could not
reach consensus over a no-confidence against the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The central meeting, demanded by 14 central members and earlier
scheduled for this afternoon, was postponed with the consent of
party leaders, a notice by RPP party office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of party workers gathering around RPP
headquarters today were clearly divided into two groups supporting
party President Surya Bahadur Thapa and parliamentary party leader
Rokendra Bahadur Chand respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two top RPP leaders reportedly have different views over
the no-confidence motion against the present three-party
government under Sher Bahadur Deuba to be tabled by the main
opposition in the parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) is to
challenge the coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC)
Party and has requested RPP to withdraw from the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
UML promised to form an alternative coalition government with
RPP with Chand as prime minister if RPP helps pass the
no-confidence motion in the special house session starting from
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders of RPP also have been divided into two camps
loyal to Chand and to Thapa triggering rumors that the party might
split in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
RPP holds the key to survival of the ruling coalition with its
19 MPs in the Lower House while the main ruling NC and the main
opposition UML hold 86 and 88 seats respectively in the 205-seat
house.
</P>
<P>
The postponed RPP central meeting was expected to finalize the
party's stance on the opposition motion and thus to decide whether
the present government would step down or not.
</P>
<P>
However, RPP Vice President Jog Meher Shrestha told reporters
today that "the party will not split."

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven people who took part
in Monday's riot in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya, were arrested
by the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) today, according to an
evening report by the state-run television, TVRI.
</P>
<P>
An Antara report today quoted ABRI General Chief of Staff Lt.

in Jayapura.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ABRI will take stern measures to prevent
these people from disturbing the peace.
</P>
<P>
Monday's riots started shortly after Thomas Wapay Wainggai's
body arrived in the city. Wanggai was sentenced to 20 years in
prison in 1988 for proclaiming an independent Melanesian state in
Irian Jaya. He died of a heart attack on March 12 on the way to
the hospital from his prison outside Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Many students had hoped that Wainggai's remains would be
brought to the Cendrawasih university campus where he once was a
professor.
</P>
<P>
When they learned that the body had been driven straight from
the airport to his house, the students joined by local youths got
angry.
</P>
<P>
A market was torched and several cars and houses damaged as
thousands students and youth ran riot in Jayapura.
</P>
<P>
An official at the emergency room of the Jayapura general
hospital told "The Jakarta Post" by phone last night that two
people had died and three others were injured in the riot.
</P>
<P>
Calm was restored by the evening. However, the main roads have
been blocked by security officers.

<P>
Jayapura police Chief Lt. Col. Sentot Sukandono said his force
was still investigating the cause of the riots.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A last-minute goal lifted
South Korea to a hard 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan in its second
match of Group B at the Asian Zone qualifying soccer tournament
for the Atlanta Olympic Games on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, who lost to China 1-3 in its first match on Sunday,
opened the lead only two minutes into action when Grokhovki Igor
headed home a cross from Korov Konstantin.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans, who were also eager to win a match after
drawing with Saudi Arabia on Sunday, launched fierce attacks but
their efforts turned out fruitless in the first half before the
strong defense of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea completely controlled the match with all-out
attacks and Lee Ki Hyung finally scored the equaliser in the 69th
minute to bring South Korea back to the winning track.
</P>
<P>
Substitute striker Woo Sung Yong hammered the ball into the net
on a goalmouth scramble in the 89th minute to secure the three
points for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will take on China Thursday while the winless
Kazakhstan, which has actually been kept out of the Olympics,

<HEADLINE> Economic Studies Prepare For Better Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Better Hong Kong Foundation
 has commissioned a series of economic studies on such key issues
that will have a great impact on Hong Kong into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The studies, to be coordinated by the Hong Kong Center for
Economic Research, will be conducted by economists based at the
territory's leading tertiary institutions.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the commission of the studies here today,
Henry Cheng, chairman of the Advisory Council of the Better Hong
Kong Foundation, said: "It is a timely, worthwhile and meaningful
initiative."
</P>
<P>
Given that Hong Kong is at an important historical moment with
the handover of sovereignty in less than 500 days, coupled with
economic transformation, Cheng said that it is the right time to
look at the existing economic systems and identify the challenges
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Researchers will concentrate on nine areas, ranging from a
variety of economic policies in Hong Kong to its business links
with the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, as well as its role in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The studies are scheduled to be completed during 1996 and will
be published in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation hoped that the Hong Kong government can make use
 of the studies in making policies on the future development of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Professor Richard Wong, head of the Hong Kong Center for
Economic Research, said that it was the first time that Hong Kong
academic economists get together to undertake economic research on
 policy issues.
</P>
<P>
Funded by private voluntary donations, the Center is an
independent economic policy research institute established in
1987.
</P>
<P>
The Better Hong Kong Foundation is a privately-funded,
non-profit making and non-governmental organization formed by
leading business people in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> BOT System Helps Finance China's Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to attract more
foreign funds through the BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) system to
buttress its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The bidding for the construction of a power plant in Laibin, in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is being
carried out smoothly. The power plant is the first project with
formal approval from the central government to be constructed
through BOT.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Hainan Province, the largest special economic
zone in the country, the Meinan Power Plant, with investment
totalling 140 million US dollars, is expected to go into operation
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"China will further experiment with BOT in more highways,
bridges, water-supply plants, and power plants during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000)," said, Zhang Jiufei, head of
the Department of Foreign Capital Utilization of the State
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
BOT means a chartered company builds and operates a project
before transferring it to the government to which the project
belongs, said Roger Lawrence, a UN official attending an
international BOT seminar which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"It's an international practice for raising funds for
infrastructure projects in energy, communications and
telecommunications," he said. "It has spurred economic growth in
many developing countries."
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhiben, director of the Foreign Investment Administration
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said,
"BOT will help China widen the channels for utilizing foreign
capital, and introduce more foreign funds for infrastructure
projects."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that by the end of 1995 China had
signed contracts to make use of 400 billion US dollars in foreign
investment, of which less than ten percent had flowed into
infrastructure industries and projects.
</P>
<P>
China started to try the BOT method in 1994. The power plant in
Laibin was formally approved by the central government as the
first pilot project to be built with the BOT method in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Huaneng Group, a major electricity producer, has plans to
expand a power plant with the BOT method. Huaneng has also set up
the Beijing Botuo Investment Development Company to plan, organize
and implement BOT investment.
</P>
<P>
"The government should not only have clear industrial policies
and positive attitudes to direct and support BOT investment but
exert more efforts to build a better legal framework," said Zhou
Baocheng, deputy director of the Economic Cooperation Department
of Hainan. "So far, China has no clear regulations on the
implementation of BOT investment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Planning Commission disclosed that
they are speeding up steps to revise China's first BOT-related
regulations, and the revisions will go into effect after being
approved by the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Russia, EU to Build Partnership Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Davydov said today that relations between Russia and the European
Union (EU) will be built on the basis of a bilateral agreement on
partnership and cooperation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, Davydov said
Russia and the EU agreed to speed up the process of ratification
of the agreement, which was confirmed during last week's talks in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Davydov said he also discussed with European Commissioner Hans
Van den Broek measures Russia needed to take to win recognition as a
market economy, to create infrastructure for transport and energy
corridors and to build a free trade zone between Russia and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Before ratification of the agreement in 1997, Russia and the EU
hope to settle a number of trade disputes including textiles and
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
"We are striving for a peaceful settlement of these trade
problems with the EU, and we pledge not to take any tough measures
to restrict all European textile imports into Russia with the
possible exception of tapestry and carpets until the end of the
negotiating process," he said.
</P>
<P>
A further round of talks on mutually-acceptable solutions to
these trade disputes would begin soon, he said. These could
include EU assistance to modernize Russia's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's recent move to fix minimum prices for vodka and
other hard drinks sold in Russia, Davydov stressed the move was
aimed at protecting consumers from contraband and substandard
products not at affecting European imports.
</P>
<P>
The EU is now Russia's biggest trading partner -- 45 percent of
Russia's trade turnover is accounted for by the 15 EU
member-countries -- and has a small negative trade balance with
Russia, according to Itar-Tass.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Mugabe Reelected? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Thirdly, in fact, Mugabe was the
sole candidate of this presidential elections after opposition
challengers Ndabaningi Sithole of ZANU (Ndonga) and United
Parties leader retired Bishop Abel Muzorewa withdrew last week.
</P>
<P>
The two pulled out of the race citing an uneven playing field,
but the government refused to acknowledge the withdrawal, saying
it was invalid as it was done less than 21 days before polling as
stipulated by the election act.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here held that it was an election without any rival
and the victory certainly belonged to Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the above-mentioned reason, this election's
voter turnout was very low, with only a 31 percent of the 4.9
million registered voters. It also showed that the Zimbabwean
complaint was rising in the recent difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling ZANU-PF is congratulating upon its success in
the presidential election, observers here noted that President
Robert Mugabe is facing many knotty problems such as resettlement
of landless people, indigenization of the national economy and
difficult economic situation caused by the droughts, high
government spending, low GDP growth, high inflation and
unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
In his coming term, President Mugabe will shoulder
responsibilities in recovery and development of economy and
improvement in the people's living standard. He and his party
need making the gigantic efforts for carrying out effective
economic reforms in the light of Zimbabwe's actual conditions.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Mugabe Re-elected? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's incumbent President
Robert Mugabe has won the March 16-17 presidential election and
is to serve for a six-year term of presidency.
</P>
<P>
He got 1,404,501 votes, accounting 92.7 percent of the total
valid ones. The two rivals -- Abel Muzorewa of the United Parties
and Ndabaningi Sithole of ZANU (Ndonga) -- received 4.8 percent
and 2.4 percent of the votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that Mugabe won an emphatic victory and
became the third executive president since the country's
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
With a deteriorating economic situation in the southern
African nation, why is Mugabe re-elected in the presidential
election?
</P>
<P>
First, on the current political arena, the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) led by Mugabe is
the first largest party in the country and occupied a dominant
position.
</P>
<P>
As compared with it, the opposition parties are relatively
weak and do not constitute a crucial threat against the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
In the present Parliament elected last year, ZANU-PF won 117
of the whole 120 elected seats, with ZANU (Ndonga) collecting
two, and an independent occupying the last one.
</P>
<P>
In the latest local government elections, ZANU-PF won a
majority on all rural district and urban councils and held all
executive mayorships of towns and cities except one city.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Mugabe enjoys high prestige among the Zimbabweans.
He was born in a farmer's family in 1942, joined in political
movement in 1960s and led the Zimbabwean liberation struggle in
1970s. He made outstanding contributions to the Zimbabwean
liberation and independence.
</P>
<P>
After the country's independence, Mugabe became the Prime
Minister, then the Executive President for two terms of eight
years. He and his government have been pursuing the domestic
policy of national unity and racial conciliation and the foreign
policy of non-alignment and good-neighborly friendship, which
brought a result of the long-time relatively stable political
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, he has put the stress of the development of
economy in the domestic policy, and speeded up economic reforms,
and took a series of measures to mitigate social contradictions,
striving for the support of the masses for the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
In the recent years' droughts, Mugabe and his government made
a lot of work for the masses, providing huge relief food for more
than 6 millions of the country's 10.5 million people. The
Zimbabweans thank him while he enjoys their trust.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Exxon Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
met with Harry J. Longwell, senior vice-president of the Exxon
Corporation of the United States, and Wu encouraged US business
people to invest more in China's onshore and offshore petroleum
exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
Wu extended congratulations to Exxon on its signing of a new
contract with the China National Petroleum Corporation to explore
for petroleum and natural gas in the Tarim Basin, in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Exxon's investment in China's petroleum industry accords with
the country's industrial policy and is thus encouraged by the
Chinese government, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"There are thus bright prospects for the co-operation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The development of the petroleum industry is closely related to
that of the automobile and petrochemicals industries, Wu noted,
explaining that the latter are two of the four pillar industries
in the national economy designated by the Chinese government in
its long-term development program as approved by the
just-concluded Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Longwell said he was optimistic about China's economic
development and the prospects for the country's petroleum
resources. Exxon is confident about its investments in China and
is expecting to further its co-operation with its Chinese
counterparts in financing and technology, he said.

<HEADLINE> Banditry Decreases In Uganda: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said here today that the banditry in his country has
been decreasing.
</P>
<P>
When addressing a press conference, the president denied a
reproter's allege that the rebels' activities in northern Uganda
have been increasing since last month.
</P>
<P>
He said that though the banditry is reviving in northern
Uganda recently, it is decreasing across the country on the
whole.
</P>
<P>
The banditry is to be confined to only the Acholi area,
especially in parts of Gulu district, over 300 kilometers north
of Kampala, he added.
</P>
<P>
"However in the past, we have rebels' activities in
northwestern, northern and northeastern parts of the country,
even near Kampala," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of heroic work of the government and the
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) which have helped roll back
the rebels' criminal activities that covered the whole of Uganda
from 1962 to 1986, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the question now lies in why the UPDF haven't wiped
out the rebels yet.
</P>
<P>
The answer is capacity-building, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need comprehensive capacity to deal with the nomadic
bandits such as the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in
Gulu district. We shall have mobile forces to chase these rebels,
but not moss manpowers," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that these rebels can return back to Sudan
to get new weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "capacity-building needs a process. I wanted to end
bush war earlier in 1980s but still spent five years in bush. To
eliminate LRA rebels is the same thing. We still need time."

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Reunified After Four-Year Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- With the entry of 75
Muslim-Croat Federation police into Grbavica this morning to take
control of the last Serb-held district in Sarajevo, the capital
city, divided by war since 1992, was finally reunified.
</P>
<P>
However, there was little celebration in this part of Sarajevo
as federation police took back this deserted neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The unification itself means the end of the multi-ethnic
Sarajevo. Under the Dayton peace agreement, five Serb-held
Sarajevo districts were to revert to the control of the Muslim-Croat
Federation to make the city a "unified" capital.
</P>
<P>
But fear of reprisals led more than 90 percent of the
140,000-strong Serb population in these five areas to flee since
late November when the Dayton accord was struck, seeking refuge in
other Serb-held areas in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The mass exodus of Sarajevo Serbs and the end of the multi-ethnic
city is really a disaster," a United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) official said in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Grbavica was a frontline municipality linked with downtown
Sarajevo by the "Brotherhood and Unity" bridge. Tanjug news agency
said only 1,000 to 2,000 Serbs now remained in this area which had
a population of more than 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The handover of Sarajevo Serb districts to Muslim-Croat control was
accompanied by a wave of violence. Many houses and buildings were
looted and set ablaze before the Serbs fled, determined to leave
nothing behind to their former enemies.
</P>
<P>
The few Serbs who wanted to stay on in these districts were
harassed, looted, intimidated or detained by Muslims, until they
too were finally forced to evacuate, IFOR and UNHCR officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Seals Off Part Of Tete City Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's Geological and
Mineral Bureau has ordered to seal off several places which
deposit radioactive materials in the suburbs of Tete city,
capital of Tete province, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a sum of abandonded cobalt60 was discovered by the
department of mineral resources and energy of Tete Province. The
cobalt60 was left over in mid-1980s when Mozambique prospected
coal at the suburbs of Tete city, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
After informed of this by the concerned department of Tete
Province, the national Geological and Mineral Bureau sent a group
of experts to the spots. After a survey, they decided to close
the areas to avoid possible damages to residents there.
</P>
<P>
At present, the concerned department of Mozambique is studying
and analyzing the abandoned cobalt60 to make clear if it is still
radioactive and harmful.

MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today his government does not see a military solution as the
main option for addressing the present problems in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that peace in Mindanao will be achieved
through socio-economic programs and other programs that make life
better.
</P>
<P>
"This will not be done through bullets," he indicated.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Conflicts have always been the child of want -- born
of the unjust sharing of wealth and opportunity and the
alleviation of poverty is intrinsic to resolving the conflicts in
Filipino society."
</P>
<P>
"Without poverty alleviation, we can have no peace. Without
peace we can have no development."
</P>
<P>
Tension has gripped Mindanao anew following a series of
bombings in the past week by terrorists to disrupt the peace
process of the government with the Moro National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
Despite the renewed tension in some parts of the region, he
said that the situation is under control.
</P>
<P>
He also directed the military to protect peace and development
efforts against lawless elements in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Osman Atto's Men Captures Southern Somali Port Of Merca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern Somalia's port town
of Merca was captured this morning by USA/SNA forces after heavy
fighting between the militiamen of General Mohamed Farah Aidid
and Osman Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Dirie Elmi, spokesman for the United Somali
Congress/Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA) led by Atto, said
their militiamen captured four technicals wagons and neutralized
another one in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters that Merca fell to his
organization at midday.
</P>
<P>
He said the fighting has also spread to the nearby districts
of Shalambod and Afgoye, where the fighting is still going on.
</P>
<P>
Elmi said after four days of extensive negotiations, General
aidid launched attacks on their militia positions in Merca.
However, the spokesman said, his militiamen forced all technical
wagons of Gen. Aidid out of Merca.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said his militiamen have also gained control of
the militia bases of El-Jaalle and El- Ahmed, 15 km south of
Merca.
</P>
<P>
Merca has been tense for the last five days after Osman Atto's
organization has mobilized large numbers of soldiers for what he
called securing the stability of the port town.
</P>
<P>
The casualty figures are not available, however.
</P>
<P>
Armed wagons of both warring sides were seen transporting
wounded militiamen to their militia medical centers.
</P>
<P>
There has been no word from the selfstyled governent of
General Aidid so far, but tension was visibly high around the
headquarters of his "government".
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the headquarters of the USC/SNA was also tense with
lots of people flowing into it for information while many young
armed men were wandering around it for a possible strengthening
mission to the battlefield. enditem

ULAN BATOR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank

poor.

Earlier this month, the United Nations Development Program

</P>
<P>
A poverty alleviation program set up by the Mongolian

<HEADLINE> TV Violence Censoring Chip Causes Dispute In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) - Proposals to fit new televisions
with the controversial V-chip which can block out violence, bad
language and sex on TV sparked a row Monday among broadcasters and
viewers' groups.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat MP David Alton plans to put down an amendment
to the Broadcasting Bill supporting the electronic censoring
device, known as the V-chip, and Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley has pledged to give "a full appraisal" of censoring
technology to protect young viewers from "unsuitable" programs.
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the V-chip offers help," said Bottomley, who
called for a meeting of broadcasters, manufacturers and viewers'
groups later this week.
</P>
<P>
But TV audience groups do not think this is the answer. "It
takes the onus for setting program standards away from the
broadcasters and on to the consumer," today's Daily Telegraph
quoted John Beyer of the National Viewers and Listeners
Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bottomley has been urged to follow the lead of U.S. President
Clinton who signed a Telecommunications Act requiring new
televisions to be installed with the chip from next year in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But the Heritage Department said Monday that adopting the chip
may not be the best solution. Introduction of the chip into the
European Union may not be workable due to varying opinions among
member countries on what levels of sex and violence are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
A department spokesman also said that introducing the V-chip
unilaterally could make British-made televisions more expensive.
Japanese manufacturers including Sony, Hitachi and Mitsubishi have
television factories in South Wales and Scotland which manufacture
a quarter of televisions sold in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Although 66 percent of TV watchers believe there is too much
violence on TV, the spokesman said, the chip "won't solve all
problems."
</P>
<P>
One major problem would come from classification bodies, which
would have to examine more than 100,000 hours of TV programs
broadcast each year, compared to around 700 films released in
cinemas. Classification of live broadcasts which may have
unexpected violent or sexual content would be difficult. Another
handicap is the time-lag before the chip is put into widespread
use.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Declares All-out War Against Poverty (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
declared an all-out war against the evil of poverty that has
plagued the country for the last 100 years or more.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the two-day national
anti-poverty summit, President Fidel Ramos said that poverty has
remained as a scourge it can be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, he said that the United Nations estimated that the
Philippines had 2.7 percent of the world's poor or 1.9 million
poor Filipino families.
</P>
<P>
But this had been dropped down by 222,000 based on a 1994
survey due to the combined effects of economic growth and the
state's social reform programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is an appreciable gain. But it is still far
from being acceptable. The ranks of our very poor are still too
many. The war against poverty is not yet won."
</P>
<P>
Ramos called for a proper balance of the market economy and
social reform to achieve long-term and medium-term growth so that
the poor sector will be beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed that his government will focus its resources and
development to the countryside where poverty is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House speaker Jose de Venecia today disclosed a plan
of sharing some 3.5 billion pesos (140 million US dollars) or 70
percent of the total countryside development fund (CDF) of 201
congressmen to finance the government's poverty alleviation
program.
</P>
<P>
Part of the CDF allocations will be used to fund the planting
of one billion trees in the country.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia put forth a proposal for immediate passage of a
resolution that will set aside 30 percent of the 2.9 billion
dollars official development assistance from Japan to the
Philippines for anti-poverty.
</P>
<P>
He also support the establishment of "anti-poverty bank" in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The country's national poverty incidence stood at 35.7 percent
in 1994 as against 39.9 percent in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Begin Withdrew Heavy Weapons Around Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban Islamic student
militia have begun withdrawing their heavy weapons from their
major base in Charasyab, 25 kilometers south of Kabul, a report
from Kabul quoted Afghan defense officials as saying today.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban are now pulling all their heavy arms and
stockpiles back to mountainous areas further from the city in
order to gain a firmer foothold on higher ground," a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"The reason why they are doing this is because they feel very
vulnerable at Charasyab which lies on flat ground near the front,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it was not known exactly where the heavy
weapons would be placed.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted independent witnesses as saying that
they had seen heavy weapons being dismantled near Charasyab and on
another front southwest of Kabul in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Charasyab was captured by the Taliban last September from the
rival Hezb-i-Islami faction led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls for Flexibility in Nuclear Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali today appealed to the 38 countries involved in talks
on a global nuclear test ban treaty to conclude their negotiations
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion of this treaty cannot be deferred any longer, it
must be concluded this year," he said. "Otherwise a severe blow
will be dealt to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and thereby
to peace and security as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali was speaking to a special plenary session of the
Conference on Disarmament, which began to negotiate a
comprehensive test ban treaty in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General called for flexibility and
open-mindedness from all parties in the ongoing negotiations in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Given the very short time limit to reach the complex deal,
"flexibility, open-mindedness, a spirit of compromise and the will
to succeed" are still required from all participating states, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although all 38 members of the Conference have expressed their
willingness to complete the negotiations this year, negotiators
have yet to iron out their differences on a large number of key
issues concerning the scope of a test ban, the verification
system, the institutional framework and how many signatories will
be needed for the treaty's implementation.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly about 1,200 "disputed provisions" in the
rolling draft text of the treaty now under consideration.
</P>
<P>
After two separate meetings with representatives from the five
nuclear states - China, Britain, France, Russia and the United
States - and the Group 21 of non-aligned countries in Geneva on
Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that he
was "cautiously optimistic" a comprehensive nuclear test ban
treaty could be reached this year.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Testifies In Court For Divorce Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela was cross-examined today at Rand Supreme Court
here by his estranged wife Winnie's lawyer Ishmael Semenya in his
divorce suit.
</P>
<P>
Testifying during the second day of divorce proceedings,
Mandela declined to tell the court whether Mrs. Winnie Mandela
had remained committed in their 38 years of marriage, saying that
''I would like you to appreciate that I don't want to wash our
dirty linen here.''
</P>
<P>
''I appeal to you that I would not be forced to reveal facts
that would damage the defendant and bring pain to the children,''
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Semenya told the court Mrs. Mandela had suffered during the
struggle against apartheid because of her marriage to Mandela. He
said she had been arrested several times during demonstrations
and been fired by employers for having been engaged in protests.
</P>
<P>
''Yes, she was subjected to very cruel persecution by the
security police,'' said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Although he acknowledged she had gone through difficulties,
Mandela said there were many other women in this country who
suffered far more than she did under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to Semenya's remarks that Mrs. Mandela
had done a great deal of organizing for the struggle against
apartheid, Mandela said: ''I would not have regarded that as her
sole responsibility. We had an organization, the African National
Congress, which took care of these things. As part of that
organization she made a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mandela, 78, initiating divorce proceedings, married
Winnie Madizikela in 1958. The couple separated in 1992, two
years after Mandela's release from 27 years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mandela, who reportedly refused to settle the matter out
of court, contested the divorce and asked for half of her
husband's estate, claiming she contributed to his worth during
their marriage.

HELSINKI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Finland's national debt will
soar to a new record of 418 billion Finnish marks (91 billion
U.S. dollars) - 70 percent of GNP - by the end of the year, the
government said today.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show the deficit rose to 392 billion Finnish
marks (85 billion dollars) at the end of February, up from a
record 372 billion marks (81 billion dollars) at the end of 1995,
of which 46 per cent was foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said Finland still needs to borrow some 46
billion Finnish marks (10 billion dollars) this year because
projected expenditure will exceed revenue.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce its foreign debt, the Finnish government
has been forced to cut public spending and social welfare which
has led to a fall in living standards.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah has announced that the Kuwaiti-Jordanian
relations would be restored and normalized soon following frequent
contacts between officials of the two countries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview by Saudi newspaper "Ukaz" with the
Kuwaiti foreign minister, which was carried by Kuwait News Agency
(KUNA) today.
</P>
<P>
Sabah pointed out that the bilateral contacts had taken place
between Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah and Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti foreign minister denied that any external pressure
was put on his country to normalize its relations with Jordan,
and that this decision was stemmed from "a Kuwaiti conviction."
</P>
<P>
Sabah decline to say whether a Kuwaiti-Jordanian summit would
be convened to expedite the normalization process. He also
declined to disclose whether it would be possible for Kuwait to
normalize relations with the so-called adversary states, which
refer to those that took sides with Iraq following the latter's
invasion of Kuwait in August, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which sided with Iraq during the Gulf crisis and the
later Gulf war, has distanced itself from Iraq recently.

<HEADLINE> Part of HK Road Pricing System Study Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Transport officials have
dropped part of a 100 million HK dollars study into the proposed
use of electronic road pricing system.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Commissioner for Transport Lee Shu-chee said
yesterday that a section of the study focusing on technical
evaluation of the project would be dropped.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the department's failure to win support for
the study from the Legislative Council transport panel last week,
although Secretary for Transport Haider Barma insisted it was
economical.
</P>
<P>
Panel members held that the price would be too high if the
system could not go ahead after the study. The study consists of
two parts - system and pricing strategy, and technical evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The two separate parts were to be carried out simultaneously in
 a period of two years by an appointed consultant prior to a
period of public consultation.
</P>
<P>
And the technical evaluation itself is expected to cost more
than half of the money budgeted for the study.
</P>
<P>
The department would then only propose a study on the system
and pricing strategy, which would start at the end of this year
and last about a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An unidentifed vessel was
shelled yesterday when it was tring to dock into Mogadishu new
port.
</P>
<P>
The ship had managed to escape the shooting and sailed deep into
the Indian Ocean waters.
</P>
<P>
Militiamen supporting the North Mogadishu faction leader, Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, were behind the shelling. According to one of the
militiamen, none of the their rounds hit the ship.
</P>
<P>
This morning many long-range anti-aircraft missiles and
technicals patrolled the beach to prevent ships from docking into
the port, banning banana exportation from Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen said the vessel they shelled belonged
to some banana companies, who thought the banana ban was eased.
</P>
<P>
The former Shipping Agency of Somalia had urged the ship to
flee the dangerous zone around the port. Abdurahman Aden, an
engineer of the agency, said the agency, whith the help of its
poor communications equipment, managed to warn the ship.
</P>
<P>
Aden said they could not identify the ship, but they thought
it was one of those vessels hired by the Somali merchants.
</P>
<P>
However, some other eyewitness at the port said the ship was
chartered by the United Somali Congress/Somali National Alliance
and was carrying food aid from Saudi Arabia and lost its way to
Merca, 100 km south of here. enditem

<HEADLINE> 2nd Interior Fair Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Second International
Interior Fair opened here today with 183 exhibitors from 20
countries and regions participating.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) and Messe Frankfurt, the fair aims at promoting Hong Kong's
interior design services and related merchandise trade. It is
expected to attract 8,000 traders from Asia and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hong Kong has seen enormous demand for high
quality office and home furniture and it is acting as an important
 regional sourcing center for interior products.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Hong Kong reported an 11 percent increase in imports
of interior furnishing products to 42 billion HK dollars (5.38
billion US dollars), mainly from the Chinese mainland, Japan,
Italy, Indonesia, the United States, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's furniture industry consists of some 600 companies
involved in 6 billion HK dollar (769 million US dollars) worth of
exports per year with leading markets being the Chinese mainland,
the United States, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
A new feature at the fair this year is the design with a focus
on trend-setting function. The trends will be presented in
conjunction with exhibitors' fabrics in a setting conceived by
British designer Michael Edser.
</P>
<P>
A market seminar featuring speakers from the Chinese mainland,
Hong Kong, Taiwan province and Spain will be held during the
three-day fair.

<HEADLINE> Round Trip Price Drops Between Macao and Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The price of the round trip between
Macao and Beijing drops to 2,000 patacas (nearly 260 US dollars)
from today on, about half of the current price of 3,800 patacas.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yunda, deputy general manager of Air Macao, said the drop
of price is aimed at "developing a larger air market", which means
to attract more passengers going to Beijing via Macao Airport.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the price will be returned to 3,800
between March 28 and April 6 during the Easter holidays, when more
people are expected to travel.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao now has daily flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen
as well as Kaohsiung and Taipei in Taiwan. The seat occupancy
rate for the Macao-Beijing route has reached about 50 percent, and
the rate for the Macao-Shanghai route, 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Competition among airports in the Pearl River Delta has become
fiercer as more airports are being built in the region. There are
at least five airports, including Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Shenzhen,
Hong Kong and Macao, operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many people going to Beijing leave via Zhuhai
Airport at a cheaper price. But the price cut by Air Macao is
expected to attract those passengers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Woo Regional Headquarters  (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
grant more incentives for regional headquarters (RHQS) in a bid to
push forward its drive to woo more investors.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has drafted bills
proposing the granting of additional incentives to RHQS and their
expatriate employees.
</P>
<P>
These incentives include income tax exemptions, tax- and
duty-free importation of motor vehicles and training materials,
and exemptions from registration requirements.
</P>
<P>
Expatriates will also be given multiple-entry special visas for
one year, and enjoy tax- and duty-free importation of personal and
household effects.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bills also seek to allow RHQS to bring in whatever
amount is necessary to cover its operations here and to derive
income from its activities, such as rendering management services
and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said today that President Fidel Ramos has
endorsed the bills and written to leaders of both legislative
chambers to press for the early passage of the bills.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said, "The measures, consistent with the policy of
liberalization, would further encourage the entry of more foreign
investments, and thus make the country an attractive and
competitive investment destination in the ASEAN region."
</P>
<P>
Some 40 multinational companies applied last year to locate
their regional bases here, bringing the total number of RHQS in
the country to 237.
</P>
<P>
About 35 percent of these companies come from Hong Kong, 30
percent from Europe, 20 percent from the US and 15 percent from
other Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Expects Bumper Harvest This Tear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua)-- Zambia would reap a bumper harvest
of maize this year, the staple food of the Zambians, Times of
Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Agriculture Minister Suresh Desai as saying
that the anticipated 15 million bags ( 90 kg per bag) of maize
would be harvested and stored properly.
</P>
<P>
The government had used large sums of money in repairing grain
storage facilities in readiness for the harvest, desai said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the government would ensure the grain storages
were used properly and no storage facility would lie idle.
</P>
<P>
The grain storages had not been used for the past two years
because there was not enough maize to store due to the drought of
the successive years.
</P>
<P>
There is fear that though a bumper harvest is expected this
year, some maize may be left to waste due to shortages of storage
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's annual consumption of maize stands at some 11 million
bags (90 kg per bag). enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Leone President-Elect Appeals For Support To Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's President-elect,
Tejan Kabbah, today appealed to his supporters to ''embrace'' the
armed forces because as he put it, ''they form an integral part of
the (Sierra Leone) society and have a vital role to play in nation
building.''
</P>
<P>
Kabbah in an exclusive interview with Xinhua said the ''total
cooperation ''by the five other parties which gave their support
to the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) ''is a clear indication
that unlike the past, Sierra Leoneans are now capable of uniting
and working together in the interest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
''The challenges ahead are many,'' Kabbah said. ''As a
resurgent nation, it is through dedication that peace and unity
will be realised.''
</P>
<P>
Asked about his close door meeting on Monday with the head of
state, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio, Kabbah said, ''the
military is committed to a speedy transition. Arrangements are
well underway for a smooth transition in about two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
On whether he would be prepared to hold peace talks with the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Kabbah reacted, ''why not?
Aren't they Sierra Leoneans? Together we can bring peace which had
dvdged (?) Sierra Leone for a long time and end the destruction of
lives and property.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a RUF spokesman, Fayia Musa, said in a BBC focus on
Africa program on Monday that the organization ''would be prepared
to hold talks with the incoming civilian government.''
</P>
<P>
This is a back track from the rebels' earlier statement that it
will only ''continue to talk peace if the military government does
not hand over power to a civilian regime.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the interior today said the ceasefire
announced on Sunday by the RUF ''is holding and there has been no
violation. ''
</P>
<P>
''No shot has been heard and everybody is hoping it shall stay
that way,'' one observer reached in Bo, 190 miles south of the
capital said.
</P>
<P>
Transporters and businessmen sending goods to the provinces are
''still cautious over the ceasefire and few vehicular traffic have
been plying the roads to the interior,'' the President of the
Motor Drivers Association, Mohamed Sillah, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has said the ceasefire would be in place for two months.
</P>
<P>
West African diplomats said that the first ever meeting between
a Sierra Leonean leader and rebel leader Foday Sankoh ''would come
off within a week,''.
</P>
<P>
Both Bio and Sankoh are to meet in Cote d'Ivoire for peace
talks to be brokered by the Ivorian government, diplomats here say.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ghanaian Deputy Foreign Minister, Alhaji Chambas
arrived here today and presented a special message to General Bio.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the message can be linked with current efforts
on the peace talks with the RUF.
</P>
<P>
Chambas left later for Senegal. enditem

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Parliament Passes Cooperatives Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese National Assembly
adopted a law on cooperatives Monday with 326 out of 332 votes in
favor, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 10-chapter law represents one of the most significant
pieces of legislation passed by the national assembly since the
advent of economic renovation, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It provides, for the first time, a comprehensive national law
defining the rights and responsibilities of an economic unit that
has been at the backbone of the Vietnamese economy since
independence in 1954.
</P>
<P>
There are currently an estimated 25,000 cooperatives in all
business areas in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the state protects the legal rights of
cooperatives and ensures equality of the cooperatives in business.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative members will continue to receive government
subsidies through programs such as one to eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that co-op members are responsible for
their own business transactions.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a cooperative is entitled to dissolve itself, to
merge with other cooperatives and to join in a union of
cooperatives for business operations.
</P>
<P>
A cooperative member is entitled to receive his or her share of
after-tax profits in accordance with the value of his or her share
of capital contributed to the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he or she can have another share of the after-tax
profits appropriate to his or her access to co-op services and his
or her contributions to the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
The "Vietnam News" today quoted Planning and Investment
Minister Do Quoc Sam as saying that over the past 10 years, an
estimated 75,000 cooperatives have been forced to close down
after Vietnam began to shift to market economy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's 1992 constitution recognizes the significant
existence of cooperatives, but amendments to regulations on
cooperatives have created many difficulties for their business
operations and even for the recognition of their social status,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The current number of 25,000 cooperatives in all businesses
only accounted for one quarter of Vietnam's co-ops in their hey
day 10 years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao is likely to take a decision soon on whether the
ruling Congress Party will go in for alliance with any other party
in Tamil Nadu state in the coming elections, the National Herald
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Nadu is the only state in which the Congress Party may
have a tie-up with another party. Senior Congress Party leaders
have claimed that the party will go it alone in the forthcoming
general elections except in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
But Congress Party leaders in the state differed on which
partner they should choose. Some of them want to renew alliance
with the ruling Aiadmk as in the previous general elections but
others are in favor of having a tie-up with another party in the
state -- the DMK.
</P>
<P>
Both groups have met with Prime Minister Rao over the past
week. Rao, who is also president of the Congress Party, indicated
at the meetings that he would take a decision on the issue
shortly.

<HEADLINE> Israel Decides to Disband South Lebanon Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
decided to start disbanding the South Lebanon Army (SLA)
cooperating with it after it has become clear to the Israeli
government that it is wrong to continue relying on the efficiency
of that army for ensuring the security of Israeli settlements in
the Galilee Heights area.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspaper AL Diyar today quoted a Western report from
Tel-Aviv as saying that the aforesaid decision -- which was made
at a recent Israeli cabinet meeting -- was irrevocable, and that
the SLA would be abandoned financially and politically as from the
end of the current month.
</P>
<P>
The report affirmed that 20 percent of the SLA personnel
deserted it last week, and that essential elements of the SLA have
turned into military experts for the Hezbollah (Party of God)
militia.
</P>
<P>
The report added that those deserters have supplied Hezbollah
with accurate information about Israeli troop movements, which
will help Lebanon's Islamic resistance movement carry out military
operations against Israeli posts in southern Lebanon and the West
Bekaa district.
</P>
<P>
The South Lebanon Army was founded in 1985. It is made up of
about 3,000 guerrillas and is in control of the so-called Security
Zone set up by Israel in southern Lebanon in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Criticized as "Source of Instability" in Taiwan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past five years, 5,230 cases of bribery in elections
in Taiwan have been exposed, and 2,300 persons involved were
brought to court.
</P>
<P>
In the election of "council heads" or "deputy council heads" at
county and city levels held in April 1994, 341 candidates were
found to have practised bribery. Of the current 858 "council
members" at county and city levels elected, nearly 300 have
criminal records, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The money and underworld society-controlled political elections
in Taiwan caused a lack of justice and public confidence, and led
to poor public order and social instability, seriously hampering
the economic growth of Taiwan, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the activities of Lee Teng-hui, preaching
reunification in public while practicing "Taiwan independence"
secretly, have intensified cross-straits relations, and further
hindered the long-term economic development of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the ultimate aim of the "Reunification
Program" worked out by the Taiwan authorities, under Lee's
instructions, was to cause a "peaceful evolution on the mainland,"
and to "make the social system on the mainland consistent with
that in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Under the "program", the commentary noted, the prerequisite of
exchanging mail services, trade and air and shipping services
between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, is to "acknowledge the
existence of two equal political entities, split the country and
rule under separate regimes and allow both sides to develop in
parallel the living space internationally," and is "the mainland's
promise of giving up the use of force".
</P>
<P>
On the question of cross-straits exchanges, the commentary
said, Lee disregarded the cross-straits economic relationship of
mutual complementarity and benefit, set restrictions on investment
in the mainland, and disturbed cross-straits economic exchanges
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Lee took the exchanges as a bargaining counter in
political deals, and made industrialists and businessmen in Taiwan
to be full of misgivings on investing in the mainland, bungling
the chance for Taiwan's economic development, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The economic and social development in Taiwan is tasting the
bitterness created by Lee Teng-hui. The creating of "Two Chinas"
or "One China, One Taiwan" by Lee Teng-hui during his visit to
the United States last year, made the relations between both sides
of the Taiwan Straits very tense.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the commentary noted, the turnover of the Taipei
bourse declined by 46 percent. The rate in the sales of properties
plunged 41 percent. The outflow of funds in the third quarter of
last year climbed to 170 billion new Taiwan dollars. Eight percent
of Taiwan residents in the age group ranging from 20 to 49
expressed the wish to emigrate abroad.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion in Taiwan pointed out that the internal affairs
of Taiwan will not be stabilized so long as there exists
instability in the relations between the mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Now Lee still deceived local residents by saying that he is a
"most experienced, bold and capable man, in dealing with relations
with the mainland." However, the facts are just the opposite, the
commentary pointed out. Lee is the source of all disasters and the
current tense situation on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, the
commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Strenuous Exercise Can Kill Smoker: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Doctors say heavy smokers, even
young and apparently healthy persons, are prone to sudden death
while taking strenuous exercise or soon after that, Indian daily
Patriot reported today.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the Heart Care Foundation of India says
that during smoking the carbon monoxide content of tobacco
combines with hemoglobin of the blood which results in not enough
oxygen being pumped to the heart muscles during exercise when the
demand for oxygen is more.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the nicotine content in tobacco also
increases the heart beat, blood pressure and work-load of the
heart which requires adequate supply of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Lack of oxygen leads to erratic and ineffective contraction of
heart muscles followed by cardiac arrest and sudden death even in
the case of an apparently health person.
</P>
<P>
Probing sudden death, the study also reveals that it does occur
sometimes without warning.

<HEADLINE> Thai Prime Minister's China Visit to Focus on Trade, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming China visit by
Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa will focus on bilateral
trade and investment, Thailand's ambassador to China said in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sawanit Kongsiri said in an interview with Xinhua
that the relations between his country and China are "good".
</P>
<P>
Such relations cover bilateral cooperation in all fields,
including politics, economy, trade, culture, science and
technology, said Sawanit, who has been ambassador in the capital
for three years.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the visit of my prime minister is to promote and
expand such relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the visit comes "at an important time" when the
session of China's National People's Congress has just ended, and
China has outlined its economic development for the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Since China implemented the opening policy, Thailand has
answered the call of the Chinese government to come to invest in
China, Sawanit recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have over 2,000 joint-venture projects in all Chinese
provinces except Qinghai and Tibet. Trade volume between the two
countries hit 3.6 billion US dollars last year", Sawanit said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, prime minister Banharn is
scheduled to attend the opening ceremony of a new office building
of the Bank of Bangkok, Thailand's largest bank, in Shantou during
his trip.
</P>
<P>
He added that 60 Thai business people will accompany Prime
Minister Banharn on the visit, and they will have meetings with
business people in Beijing and Shanghai, exchanging views with
them on furthering economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Thailand also would like to know how the
talks on China's entrance to the WTO are progressing. He added
that his country supports China's entry at an early date because
it will mean "better market access" for all countries including
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In the political sphere, he said, Thailand and China are
cooperating on a multilateral basis. This includes the two
countries' cooperation in the ASEAN and the APEC.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Thai prime minister is expected to discuss regional
and global issues with Chinese leaders during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and China view the world "very much from similar
perspectives" and both countries want to have an environment of
peace and stability. It is on this basis the two nations have been
cooperating in multilateral institutions, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the first ever Asia-Europe Meeting, which was held
in Bangkok at the beginning of this month, the ambassador said the
meeting "can be considered a success."
</P>
<P>
Attention was drawn to the growth and dynamism in countries in
Asia and many projects were agreed upon to follow up, including
investment, trade, economy, cooperation in the WTO, as well as
cultural field, he said.
</P>
<P>
Now it is up to the two sides to carry out the projects, and
present concrete progress to the next meeting, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Is A Part of China, Not A US Protectorate: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that the United States must
immediately stop its activities designed to interfere in China's
internal affairs and intensify the tension across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is a part of China instead of a protectorate of the
US," the spokesman said in response to a question concerning the
issue at a routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
He expressed strong displeasure over the US's interference in
China's internal affairs and the showing of its forces there.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that Taiwan issue is entirely an internal affair of
China which allows no foreign interference. He pointed out that on
the question of Taiwan, what the US should pursue is just the
principles enshrined in the three Sino-US joint communiques and it
is also on this basis should the US develop its relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
On China's MFN trading status, Shen pointed out that the status
is a mutually-beneficial and reciprocal one to China and the
US. He expressed the hope that that status would be renewed, but
reiterated that on issues concerning sovereignty and territorial
integrity, China will not barter away the principles.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Law-makers Support Ranariddh's Stand on Border  Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A petition in support of First
Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh's stance on Cambodia's border
dispute with Vietnam was circulated Monday among National Assembly
deputies, "The Cambodia Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
By late Monday, at least 10 deputies have signed the petition,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the opposition Khmer Nation Party also expressed
their support in a statement for "the highly nationalistic speech"
made by Ranariddh, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Assembly's Human Rights Commission
Kem Sokha, also a member of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party,
is urging his colleagues to support Ranariddh on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who in January denounced Vietnam's encroachment upon
Cambodian territory as a "full invasion of Cambodia," warned last
Thursday that Cambodia might resort to force to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The support might have been motivated by a statement of a
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman last week that "If it
(Ranariddh's statement) is true, we will be very sorry because it
does not conform to the interests of the two countries, their
friendly relations and high-level agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian-Vietnamese border dispute began last December
when Vietnamese villagers reportedly entered Cambodian territory
to farm in the eastern Kompong Cham, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng and
Takeo provinces.
</P>
<P>
On January 17, Cambodian Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Vag Huot summoned Vietnamese Ambassador
to Cambodia Tran Huy Choung for talks, but Choung denied that
Vietnamese villagers had entered Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Later in February, the Cambodian government issued a bulletin,
urging local governments on both sides of the shared border to
find a peaceful solution to their dispute.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam also said it welcomes talks with Cambodia to seek a
peaceful settlement.

KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua)-- Muhammad Mayanja Kibirige,
Director of Planning, Makerere University here, has announced his
candidature in the presidential elections in July this year.
</P>
<P>
In a release to the local daily the New Vision today,
Kibirige, 46, said he had decided to contest for the presidency
to bring about "peace, security and justice" which he said had
since Uganda's indepencence in 1962 eluded the country.

have eluded our people," Kibirige, who holds a bachelor of
commerce and masters degrees in economic policy and planning,
said.
</P>
<P>
His candidature brings the number of presidential hopefuls to
four. The other presidential candidates are incumbent President
Yoweri Museveni, leader of the Democratic Party Paul Kawanga
Ssemogerere and President of the recently formed National Freedom
Party Herman Semujju.
</P>
<P>
Kibirige, born in munde, 30 kilometers southwest of Kampala,
promised to offer a concrete economic plan that will correct the

He also attacked the current government of rewarding itself
for fighting the past regimes by apportioning itself all the
loans in the banks.
</P>
<P>
He also described President Museveni's anti-poverty campaign
as a mockery. enditem

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese investors are showing
more and more interest in Pudong, one of China's largest economic
and technology development zones.
</P>
<P>
The lastest statistical report showed that Japan has become the
largest investor in Pudong, a booming area in Shanghai which had
received a total Japanese investment of one billion US dollars by
the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the good result to the development
of China's national economy, which has offered an opportunity for
Japanese investors to increase their value of capital.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Pudong has noticed that more and more
medium-sized and small Japanese enterprises are intending to
cooperate with it in form of capital, market, products and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it will invite Japanese business people to
participate in its economic and trade seminars, and intermediate

in the area this year.
</P>
<P>
Founded in April 1990, Pudong has accommodated more than 7,000

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today released
a commentary entitled "Lee Teng-hui is the source of instability
in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that what Lee has done since coming to
power eight years ago proves that it is precisely his autocratic
rule, and wanton activity to split the motherland, have resulted
in instability in the political situation in Taiwan, damaged the
development of relations across the Taiwan Straits, and created
tensions in the straits.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the development of the political situation, and
economic growth in Taiwan, is adversely affected by the struggle
between those supporting China's reunification, and a small number
of people advocating "independence of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that public opinion in Taiwan has pointed
out time and again that, on the issue of reunification or "Taiwan
independence" that is essential to the Taiwan future, the
splittist line pursued by Lee Teng-hui for "Taiwan independence"
constitutes, in essence, the very roots of instability in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to office, Lee has wantonly shielded and backed
those preaching "Taiwan independence", and given them a green
light, it said, adding that consequently, the force preaching
"Taiwan independence" has run rampant, and the Democratic
Progressive Party preaching "Taiwan independence" has grown
rapidly to become the second most influential political party in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has also discriminated against those holding
different views, and abrogated all authority to himself, by taking
advantage of his power from a dictatorship system, and the force
advocating "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
He has called Kuomintang "a political power from outside" and
asserted that "Taiwan must belong to Taiwan residents," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It also criticized Lee for taking advantage of the
contradiction between native Taiwan residents, and those from
other parts of China, to serve his separatist line.
</P>
<P>
Under Lee Teng-hui's rule, those backing China's reunification
have been dealt severe blows, thus producing an immeasurable
negative impact on the political situation, economy and society in
Taiwan, it said.
</P>
<P>
As the Kuomintang president, Lee has gone so far as to split
the Kuomintang. He tries to consolidate his ruling position by
relying on underground societies in Taiwan and the politics based
on money. All these have resulted in the rampancy of underground
societies and bribery in elections.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Elect Grassroots Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The sun shone down on the courtyard
where one thousand villagers gathered on the afternoon of March 15
to elect deputies to a township people's congress, the grassroots
legislature.
</P>
<P>
They came from Nanggar Village to choose 13 deputies to the
People's Congress of Donggar Township in Doilungdeqen County near
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 43 candidates in the election were all nominated by the
village's 1,112 voters. Among the candidates, 10 were women and 16
were non-Communists.
</P>
<P>
Qamce, a lama from the Gardong Monastery in the village, was
nominated unanimously by the 27 colleges in his temple.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that we can also have a say in the policy-making
process," he said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
Cering Zhoima, 77, was the oldest voter.
</P>
<P>
"I was a maid in a mansion before Tibet's peaceful liberation,"
she recalled. "Then I did not have enough to eat, and had no
freedom as a person, let alone political rights,"
</P>
<P>
She said that now both of her two children are government
employees, and her family is now well-off.
</P>
<P>
"This is the seventh election I have participated in since
1978," she said, "I want to get the tenth voter certificate. I
believe that my livelihood will become even better then."
</P>
<P>
Dagar Cangjam, an 18-year-old high school student, asked for
leave from her school in the county seat to cast her vote.
</P>
<P>
She said, "I treasure my election right to choose deputies who
will lead us in achieving prosperity."
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the hope that she will be nominated as a
candidate in the next round of elections.
</P>
<P>
Oiser, who is serving a five-year prison term which will expire
later this year, asked his family to vote for him. He told his
sister-in-law that he wanted to elect those backing sideline
production in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He had learned some skills in a prison and planned to work as a
carpenter, or a painter after he is released, his sister-in-law
said.
</P>
<P>
Ngawang, a blacksmith in the village, said he cast his vote
also on behalf of his father.
</P>
<P>
"When Tibet was ruled by the Dalai Lama, blacksmiths were
looked down upon," Ngawang said.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, my father roamed from one place to another.
Wherever he went and no matter how hard he worked, he couldn't
afford a shirt on his back."
</P>
<P>
"Now I have built my own house, and bought a TV set," Ngawang
said, "Our little workshop is very busy and our work is respected."
</P>
<P>
"I resolutely support the current social system," he said.
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 p.m. the result of the election was announced. Thirteen
people were elected as deputies.
</P>
<P>
After being elected, Dagwa pledged to introduce more
agro-techniques to raise the village's grain production, and to
step up sideline productions.
</P>
<P>
Qamce looked disappointed after his failure in the election.
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to do more good things for villagers in the future,"
he said, "I'll try to win the election next time."

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Leaves for Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said that he would inform Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak of Turkey's position on the issue of the Euphrates waters
and the Turkish reaction toward the recent statements of the Arab
League on the water issue during his one-day visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks this morning before his departure for
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president said to the Middle East News Agency
earlier that Turkey was ready for dialogue with its neighboring
Iraq and Syria on the water question.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insists on the tripartite water talks between Turkey,
Iraq and Syria instead of the water talks in the framework of the
Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria have so far rejected a Turkey-proposed
three-stage plan, which envisages technical studies to find out
each country's land inventory and water resources. In the final
stage of the plan, Turkey proposes, if necessary, a water
transfer from the Tigris to the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria have stepped up a campaign against Turkey on
international platforms, saying that since the construction of
Ataturk Dam, the backbone of Turkey's Southeast Anatolia Project
(GAP), the water coming downstream in the Euphrates was polluted.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry remains determinedly quiet on the
recent statements of the Arab League on the water conflict
between Turkey, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel said Monday that " it is
my understanding that the ambassadors of the Arab League will
draft the final statement this week. I would rather wait until
I see the statement before I comment on it."
</P>
<P>
During Demirel's visit in Cairo, he will also exchange views
with Mubarak on what concrete measures can be taken to cope with
terrorism in accordance with the spirits of the anti-terrorism
summit which was held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik
last week.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reinforces Measures to Prevent Entry of Palestinian Deportees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- For fear that Israel could resort
to the deportation to strike radical and militant Palestinian
groups, the Lebanese army has strengthened measures in the South
to prevent entry of Palestinian deportees.
</P>
<P>
Security sources from the South reported today that more
troops and light armored vehicles were sent to the South in the
last few days to reinforce the army posts opposite an
Israeli-occupied enclave in South Lebanon and Western Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
They said that the army has been keeping a close watch over the
cross-points on the border of the buffer strip carved by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources in the capital reported that
the government has asked the command of the U.N. Interim Force in
South Lebanon to inform immediately any deportation of
Palestinians by the Israeli authorities when this really happens
in the areas controlled by the multi-national peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an unconfirmed report coming from the border
strip said that Israel has transferred a batch of Palestinians to
a Jewish settlement near the international border in northern
Israel last evening in preparation to deport them to South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not specify the number of the Palestinians
and when the deportation could start.
</P>
<P>
Facing this development, the Lebanese army has made an urgent
reinforcement to its post at Zamriya, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Israel deported some 415 Palestinians, mainly supporters of
the militant fundamentalist Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance
Movement, to a no-man's area at Marj Az-Zuhour in Western Bekaa in
December, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure by the international community, Israel,
after one year, allowed most of the deportees to return to their
homelands in the occupied Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul reiterated Monday the
position of his country to prohibit entry of Palestinian
deportees.
</P>
<P>
The position "will never change no matter what the
considerations and the reasons are and Lebanon will never yield to
the Israeli pressures," the defense minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Ministers took a clear decision in this regard
and has repeated it for times," he announced, "and the security
forces, especially the Lebanese army, has taken all the measures
and arrangements to ensure an enforcement of the decision."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Lebanon would not allow a replay of the
Marj Az-Zuhour experiment, underlining that it is a right for
Lebanon to take the measures in order to prevent entry of
Palestinian deportees.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Citizens to Pay More for Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Urban families in northeast
China's Liaoning Province will pay more for their homes from this
year because of government housing reforms.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has recently decided to require all
institutions and enterprises to cancel the practice of
distributing houses to employees free of charge.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform policies, all institutions, state-owned
or collectively-owned enterprises, must set up a housing reserve
fund system in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The province has decided on a sharp increase in rent, making it
account for about 15 percent of a couple's average salary.
</P>
<P>
People in low-income households, who also have housing
difficulties, will receive government help through the Anju
Project, a scheme aimed at providing affordable and comfortable
houses for low-income urban citizens.
</P>
<P>
By implementing the project, the province last year helped
15,000 such households to buy new apartments, some as large as 50
square meters. This year the province will pour 200 million yuan
(about 24 million US dollars) into the project.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of urban citizens in the province are expected
to have privately-owned homes after the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is the only province in China where population of
workers exceed that of farmers. In China, farmers build houses for
themselves, but workers depend on the government to provide houses
to them as a kind of welfare.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's urban citizens per capita living space is 7.7 sq m,
below the average level of the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Cabinet: German Arrest Warrant Unfounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
claimed that the arrest warrant issued by German Federal
Prosecutor against Iranian information minister was against
international protocols.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today that the
Iranian cabinet Monday debated the topic of the arrest warrant
for the Information Minister Ali Fallahiyan.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Iranian government held that the
Germany Prosecutor General issued the warrant solely on vague and
unfounded suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian cabinet said that it was extremely unlikely for
the German government to uphold that warrant since the Germans
are fully aware of the fact.
</P>
<P>
"The leveling of unsubstantiated charges is contrary to
intentional norms and practices," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that once such illogical behavior should become the
practice it will entail personalities in independent countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian cabinet observed that "obviously Germany will not
want to set the precedence for the others to follow."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet expressed hope that the Germans would "come to
realize the impropriety of that crude and unjustifiable measure
and the risks involved in it."
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Some 200 extremists staged demonstrations in
front of the German Embassy to protest the arrest warrant. Holding
large black and white photos of blindfolded American hostages,
Ansare Hezbollah, a riotous and frightening group in Iran, burnt
the American and Israeli flags in front of the German embassy to
condemn actions of "the pro-Zionist lobby" in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from the group chanted slogans: "Europe
Beware," "Denounce U.S.A.," "Down with U.S.A.," and "Down with
Israel," Loudspeakers placed on the back of a pickup truck
carried the voice of the boy to the embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the German ambassador to Tehran, the
demonstrators demanded an apology for insulting "a sitting
minister" in the cabinet of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The letter demanded that the warrant for Fallahiyan's arrest
should be canceled, while calling on German government to be
alert against U.S. and Israeli influences.
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant has been issued by German Federal
Prosecutor's Office for Iran's Information Minister Ali Fallahiyan
on charges of ordering the killing of four members of the Iranian
Kurdish opposition in Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After the four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition were found
murdered in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, the relations between
Iran and Germany has gone through periodic crises.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that there was a tacit
agreement between Iran and Germany that Bonn would no longer talk
about Iranian involvement in the killing of the four Kurds in
exchange for the release of a German national accused of spying
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1994, the German national Helmut Szimkus, who was
sentenced to death by an Iranian court on charges of spying for
Iraq, was released by Iranian authorities after appeals by German
Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here said that the issue will undoubtedly
affect the good relations enjoyed by the two countries. But they
ruled out that the issue would ever trigger a full-scale war of
words between Tehran and Bonn, because of extensive multi-billion
dollar commercial links.

<HEADLINE> PLA Reforms Military Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) has carried out an all-round reform of military
training, which has greatly improved the PLA's capabilities in
weaponry, military quality, and defence and fighting capabilities
in modern war situations.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of a set of war exercises conducted by
the PLA since last year was a clear proof of the success of the
reforms, said a senior army officer.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, started in 1993, were initiated and led by the
Central Military Commission (CMC) aiming to raise the defence and
fighting capability of troops in modern wars.
</P>
<P>
Many CMC leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing and Zhang
Zhen, were frequent observers of military training by the three
forces, and offered their directions.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 army units were designated as pilots for the
reforms, which covered the science of campaigns, tactics and
grouping.
</P>
<P>
Research on tactics was the focus of military training. The
land, naval and air forces of the PLA, the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense, the Second Artillery
Force and the Armed Police Force have compiled new training
programs. Curriculums of the military institutions have now been
renewed.
</P>
<P>
In the process of reform, more high technology has been used in
military training, and efforts are being made to optimize the
combination of men and weaponry. The army's ability in field
fighting, mobility and coordinated action have been strengthened.

<HEADLINE> New Railway to Boost Regional Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A 900 kilometer rail link,
spanning regions of southwest China, is already providing a major
boom.
</P>
<P>
And officials are convinced that the coming of the trains will
mean even greater fortunes.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning-Kunming Railway, currently under construction, will
greatly boost the regional economies of Yunnan, Guizhou provinces
and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The railway, running almost 900 kilometers from the Guangxi
capital of Nanning to Yunnan capital's Kunming, will be able to
transport up to 30 million tons of goods a year. It will also
provide the resource-rich southwest with a convenient outlet to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Work started on the rail link in 1990 but the whole railway
will not become operational until 1997. However several sections
have already opened to rail traffic.
</P>
<P>
The Pingguo Aluminum Plant about 100 km to the northwest of
Nanning is one of the first companies to benefit from the railway.
</P>
<P>
In past few years, the plant was able to transport 400,000 tons
of construction materials along a section of the railway which
became operational in 1993.
</P>
<P>
With the recent completion of the first-phase work, the plant
is now able to produce 3.65 million tons of bauxite and 400,000
tons of aluminum. It is expected that when the second and the
third phase work are completed the plant, with an estimated
bauxite reserve of eight billion tons, will become the largest
aluminum producer in China, and possibly even in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the middle-section of the railway in Panxian County of
Guizhou Province, one of the largest coal mines in south China is
situated. The area has a known reserve of 9.6 billion tons quality
coal, but production has remained at a low level, due to the lack
of transport.
</P>
<P>
Now that the railway is coming, the local government is
determined to take advantage. It has moved the county seat to
Hongguo Town, which will soon become a railway stop.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the railway in Yunnan Province, the Kunyang
Phosphate Mine, the largest in China with a reserve of four
billion tons, is based.
</P>
<P>
The mine now has an annual mining capacity of seven million
tons, and supplies its products to more than 300 chemical plants
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities believe that the operation of the railway
will greatly boost the mining industry that has until now been
held back by a bottleneck in the transport system.

GUIYANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- It's a thousand miles away from
China's dramatic reform drive. Peasants in this tract of land do
not even own a presentable quilt, and their per capita bank
savings is less than eight yuan (about one US dollar) a year.
</P>
<P>
A businessman visited Bijie Prefecture of southwest China's
Guizhou Province in 1994 and saw for himself the conditions of the
local people.
</P>
<P>
It led to the formation of the "Glorious Program" aimed at
providing enough food and clothing for the local people.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mingxing, chairman of Fujian Gangxing Industrial
Corporation, and vice-chairman of the provincial Commercial
Chamber, is the businessman who launched the program after his
eye-opening visit.
</P>
<P>
As sponsor he has been to Bijie 18 times since 1994, taking
more than 70 overseas and domestic business people to the region
to investigate investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
As a part of his "Glorious Program", Wang and several
enterpreneurs from Singapore bought a number of state-owned
loss-making enterprises, such as Bijie Leather Shoes Plant and
Zhijin Cement Plant, and after technical renovations, the
enterprises became profitable.
</P>
<P>
An economic development zone is now scheduled for construction
in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
And an education project is set to train 1,000 personnel,
develop ten resources, and implement 100 projects annually until
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hearing about the efforts of Wang Mingxing and his supporters,
the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee
arranged for a group of 12 well-known entrepreneurs to investigate
the mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Later nearly 200 enterprises from Shanghai, Tianjin, Hainan,
Taiwan, Singapore, and Indonesia sent executives to negotiate
projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 17 economic projects have been agreed by the
prefectural government and business people from other places,
involving a total investment of nearly 60 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the projects is being speeded up, and some have
already started operation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mingxing, the businessman who is now loved by Bijie
people, told Xinhua that he had "a big wish to help others when
walking in the poverty-stricken area".

<HEADLINE> China Space Telescope Will Be "Out Of This World" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China is to carry out a solar
space telescope project, described as unprecedented in the world.
</P>
<P>
The project is being led by Ai Guoxiang, chair scientist of the
Huairou Observation Station at the Beijing Observatory, under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The telescope, with a calibre of one meter, is estimated to
cost 45 million US dollars, which will be spent on providing
rockets and crucial technical backup.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to become one of the major astronomical
breakthroughs in the world in the next century.
</P>
<P>
At present, Germany is seeking to cooperate with China in
preparatory research work.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is aimed at research into the magnetic field
processes of the Sun. In comparison with other astronomical
telescopes, it will be able to observe celestial bodies of strong
luminosity at the same space measurement of 0.1 angular second.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1.5 million US dollars have been set aside for the
project to build a sample. The first flight experiment will be
held with a balloon this June.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Indian MP Quits Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Member of Parliament
Shailendra Mahato Monday resigned from the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), criticizing the party for "exploiting" him through a "dirty
conspiracy" targeted at Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mahato, a former Jharkhand Mukti Morcha member who had joined
the BJP in January, had caused a sensation on February 26 by
claiming that he had received four million rupees (about 116,000
US dollars ) payoff from the prime minister for voting against a
no-confidence motion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Three days later, however, he made a volte-face on the matter,
much to the embarrassment of the BJP, the largest opposition in
the country.
</P>
<P>
At a hurriedly-convened press conference Monday, Mahato accused
senior BJP leader A.B. Vajpayee of "using" him to tarnish the
image of Prime Minister Rao.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that Mr. Vajpayee will use me as a scapegoat
to fulfill his dream of becoming the next prime minister," he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mahato alleged that he had been "dragged" by the BJP leadership
to a "prearranged press conference" on February 26 and "made to
read a written statement."
</P>
<P>
The MP declared that he would not join any party and would be
fighting the next elections as an independent.

<HEADLINE> No "Immigration" to Tibet: Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A new census in the Tibet
Autonomous Region has rejected the charge made by some western
human rights organisations that China has engaged in "mass
immigration" to the region.
</P>
<P>
A sample population survey conducted in late 1995 reveals that
the number of Chinese Han people in Tibet fell to account for 3.3
percent of the total in Tibet in 1995 from 3.7 percent in 1990, to
just 79,000.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out by the Tibet Autonomous Region last
year, and the major data gained have now been published in a
report by the Regional Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report says that according to figures based on the results
of the survey conducted on October 1, 1995 -- the total population
of Tibet Autonomous Region was 2.389 million, up 193,000 or 8.8
percent from the number in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The average population growth rate was 1.6 percent annually. In
1995 alone, the net increase of population of the region was
38,000.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the population of Tibetans and other
ethnic groups was 2.31 million, while population of Han People was
only 79,000. Compared with the figure in 1990, the percentage of
Han people in the total population dropped to 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that China has not engaged in "mass
immigration" to the Tibet Autonomous Region at all. Actually, the
percentage of Han population in the total population of Tibet has
continued dropping year by year, because the central government
has adopted a policy of encouraging the population growth of
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the birth rate in Tibet was 24.9 per
thousand in 1995, equivalent to 59,000 babies in the year.
</P>
<P>
Based on a decision of the State Council, the population survey
was part of a national sample survey into one percent of its total
population. In the Tibet Autonomous Region, a total of 5.5 percent
of its population, or 131,000 in number, were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the level of education received by
people in Tibet has been raised. The percentage of illiterate
people in the total population has dropped from 44.4 percent to 40
percent. The proportion of people living in cities and towns has
risen by 1.8 percentage points, and the employment rate was 52.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Top Marks for Beijing's Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has scored top
marks for making massive improvements in its education system.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has become the first city in China to implement
nine-year compulsory education for children.
</P>
<P>
It meant that during the eighth five-year plan period, which
ended last year, all of the city's school age children went to
school.
</P>
<P>
And almost 85 per cent of Beijing's toddlers, aged three or
over, were given places at nursery schools.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's education has been developed in a smooth and
coordinated way, thanks to the implementation of reforms by city's
education authorities.
</P>
<P>
More school buildings, the opening of more teacher-training
courses, more investment and an improvement in the living
standards of teachers, all have helped the sound development of
Beijing's education.
</P>
<P>
Praise came in today's "Beijing Economic Information", which
highlighted the remarkable achievements Beijing made in the Eighth
Five-Year Plan Period between 1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that by expanding school buildings and adjusting
the distribution of primary and secondary schools, all of the
city's children of school age were found at school places.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Beijing became the first city in China to implement
nine-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, Beijing tried new ways to manage
higher-learning education. A combination of Beijing-administered
universities and colleges resulted in improvements in teaching
quality and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
There were also changes in adult education, which centered on
work-place training, further education and professional training.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that from 1991 to 1995 Beijing had 50,000
college graduates, post-graduates and graduates from professional
training schools; polytechnic school graduates numbered 65,000;
there were 88,000 from senior vocational schools and 45,000 from
various technical schools. Senior middle school graduates stood at
148,000.
</P>
<P>
The city invested 10.9 billion yuan on the expansion of old and
build new school buildings in the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Residential houses with a total floor space of over two million
square meters have been, or will be built, for the city's
teachers. The city is building two residential zones specially for
teachers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Once it was a vast area of
farmland. Now Pudong has become China's largest economic and
technology zone.
</P>
<P>
And the massive growth of Pudong, part of Shanghai, is set to
continue. The focus between now and the end of the century will be
firmly fixed on building more infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
When Pudong officially opened its doors to the outside world in
April 1990, most of its 527 square kilometers were farmland.
</P>
<P>
Now the area is home to 3,501 foreign-funded enterprises that
have invested 14.2 billion US dollars in foreign currency. There
are also over 3,000 domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is now building the second phase of massive
infrastructure facilities, including an airport, information
service and transport projects, costing a total of 20 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that Pudong will develop its foreign
trade presence, and set up foreign-funded banks and insurance
institutions on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will speed up the development of the Lujiazui
Banking and Trading Area, and the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, while
encouraging markets in securities, foreign exchange, insurance,
transit trade and real estate trade.

Earlier, the authorities concerned had said that the port
returned to normal operation Sunday as navy was deployed to
maintain the security of the port.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said that cargo handling and delivery
of goods at the port could not be resumed Sunday as an all-party
action committee imposed a "people's curfew" around the port area.
</P>
<P>
Army personnel were not deployed in the port Sunday as planned
earlier though navy remained on duty for the 3rd consecutive day,
sources concerned said.
</P>
<P>
The lingering political crisis created odds for more than
22,000 employees of the Chittagong Port Authority in their works

a crippling blow to the economy of the country.
</P>
<P>
About 20 ships loaded with imported cargo now are struck-up at
the port's existing 15 jetties and moorings and 34 more ships are
also anchored at the outer sea for berthing into jetties, it was
reported, adding that the deadlock in the port operation now
deprives the port authority of a revenue of tk 8 million (200,000
US dollars) and the port custom of tk 60 million (1.5 million
dollars) per day. In the last 24 days, the port had operated only
for 5 days.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Disco Fire Claims 150 Young Lives  (by Ding Zhaolin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A fire in a disco house here early
this morning killed at least 150 people, mostly teenagers, in one
of the awful tragedies in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The fire started at 00:35 a.m. (GMT 18:35 Monday) today after a
gas tank blew up in the kitchen from a disco pub house in Quezon
city, northeastern Manila.
</P>
<P>
The disco pub's logbook showed that there were 350 guests
inside the house, most of them students celebrating school break
and graduation.
</P>
<P>
According to Denny Yu, a volunteer of the Chinese Fire Brigade,
who is helping the police, witnesses told him that there was a gas
tank explosion before the fire which trapped the students inside
the disco house.
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out from the kitchen, there was a stampede
among the panic disco-goers. The chairs and tables blocked their
way out. Meanwhile the ceiling collapsed and buried many a
disco-goer, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
At press time, the policemen only counted 150 bodies stuck to
one another, which were burned beyond recognition. About 50 people
have been admitted to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The disco house was renovated a few months ago and there were
some tables stored above the ceiling, which fell down after the
fire spread out from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
As the disco-goers were desperately fighting their way out of
the "inferno", they could hardly find the fire exits, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
In a live interview with the local radio, Manual Badorio, fire
marshal of Quezon city of Manila, said the death toll could go up,
but he denied the report that the disco house has no fire exit.
</P>
<P>
He is the one responsible to check the fire prevention device
of commercial disco houses before they are allowed to open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
But an employee of the disco house said to the local radio that
there was really no fire exit in the disco house.
</P>
<P>
According to an updated report, the Philippine army has set up
a mobile hospital near the fire scene. More than 50 have been
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the victims were rushing to the burned disco house
expecting their beloved ones would survive the fire, which lasted
for almost two hours before it was put out at around 2:00 a.m.
(GMT 18:00 Monday).
</P>
<P>
The radio described the fire as "one of the tragedies of the
Philippine nation."
</P>
<P>
The injured were brought to the Capital Medical Center, Quirino
Memorial Medical Center and other hospitals. Most of the survivors
suffer second- to third-degree burns.
</P>
<P>
Quezon City Mayor Ishmael Mathay said that an investigation
into the incident has started. He said a criminal case will be
filed against the disco's owners for failing to install more fire
exits.
</P>
<P>
Disaster teams trained to treat fire victims have been
dispatched by the Department of Health to different hospitals in
Quezon city and Manila city of Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
At 1:00 p.m. (GMT 05:00), President Fidel Ramos visited the
fire scene. He condoled with the victims and their families. He
said he will order an investigation into those persons who are
responsible for the tragic incident.

<HEADLINE> China's Poverty-stricken Population Falls by Five Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of people living in
poverty in China fell by five million last year.
</P>
<P>
It still lives 65 million poverty stricken rural people in a
country of 1.2 billion, the country's State Statistics Bureau said
today.
</P>
<P>
China reduced the number of poverty-stricken rural people by
five million last year, making the total rural population
suffering from poverty to 65 million, announced the State
Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau revealed the figures after studying the results of a
sample nationwide survey. The bureau designated 530 yuan - just
under 64 US dollars - in per capita annual income as the absolute
poverty line for last year.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is categorized into absolute poverty and relative
poverty. China has always adopted the definition of absolute
poverty, that is, the lowest living standard acceptable to society
for people or a household, in a set social mode and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers each averaged 1,578 yuan last year, a rise of
5.3 percent in real terms over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China's poverty-hit population has been falling since 1978,
when 250 million people, or 30.7 percent of the total national
population, suffered from poverty.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, only 7.1 percent of the Chinese
population were living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
China plans to alleviate all the poverty-stricken population by
the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fisheries Team Fails to End U.S. Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Thai fisheries delegation has
failed in its bid to exclude Thailand from a U.S. list of
countries to be banned from exporting shrimps and shrimp products
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government still insisted on following a court order
banning imports from Thailand and other 51 countries beginning on
May 1, said Plodprasop Suraswadi, Director-General of the
Fisheries Department, after he returned from the United States on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
His mission was unsuccessful, conceded the official from the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, who led a joint
public-private sector delegation last week to the United States in
an attempt to extricate the country from the US list.
</P>
<P>
According to Local newspapers, a U.S. appeals court earlier had
made an order for the ban after an American conservation group,
the Earth Island Institute, filed a lawsuit claiming that shrimp
fishing fleets belonging to the blacklisted countries were
responsible for killing over 150,000 sea turtles in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
To be taken off the list, the blacklisted countries must ensure
their shrimp fishing trawlers are equipped with sea turtle
excluders, but Thailand believed that the excluders are not cost
effective and practical.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials would appeal to the court to postpone the date
for the implementation of the ban to allow the listed countries
time to comply with the order, Plodprasop said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Region is
going to be the largest economic region in the world in the near
future, Robert Rubin, the United States Secretary of Treasury,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a breakfast gathering in Hong Kong this morning,
Rubin said that the figures on Asia are compelling. In just
fifteen years, Asia's economy is likely to be larger than those of
the United States and Europe combined.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States already exports one-third more
across the Pacific than across the Atlantic, adding that his
country's Asia exports are up nearly 65 percent in just five
years.
</P>
<P>
Rubin arrived here Monday after attending the two-day meeting
of the finance ministers of the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation (APEC) forum in Japan last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said "I was struck as I looked around the table at last
weekend's meeting that almost all the 17 economies were
impoverished 25 or 30 years ago, and virtually all are today
rapidly growing, and many have achieved real prosperity."
</P>
<P>
He said that the challenge now is to continue this into the
21st century and that has been the principal focus of APEC,
including last weekend's meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of Hong Kong and China, Rubin said that Hong Kong
has been a driving force for growth in Asia and the Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations between the United States and China are
of great importance to the economic well-being and peace of the
region and the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States seeks a productive relationship with a
strong, stable and increasingly open China that integrates itself
into the international system, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is in China's interest and ours for U.S. to learn
to work together on our shared issues."
</P>
<P>
Rubin will leave Hong Kong for the Philippines today.

<HEADLINE> Citic to Expand Business Scope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Council's major
investment arm, the China International Trust and Investment Corp
(Citic), is aiming for sustained expansion and improved efficiency
during the 1996-2000 period, "China daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth of its annual profit, which hit 2.04 billion yuan
(245.7 million US dollars) last year, is expected to surpass the
growth of asset value over the next several years, said Citic
President Qin Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Total assets of Citic, established in 1979, stood at 166.7
billion yuan (20.1 billion US dollars) at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that his company will set its eyes on adjusting its
business structure to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Citic will stress its development in the financial sector while
becoming more selective in industrial investment, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Full support will be given to the expansion of Citic Industrial
Bank, one of Citic's wholly-owned subsidiaries which is poised to
become a joint stock bank in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The bank's reminbi deposits are expected to exceed 50 billion
yuan by the end of this year while its profits this year are
expected to surpass 1.2 billion yuan, up 20 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the company hopes to set up a life insurance company
and has been seeking its approval since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the company launched a securities company
engaged in securities trading brokerage, stock issue underwriting,
fund management and finance consultancy.
</P>
<P>
He said Citic will also adjust its investment structure to
concentrate on projects in the telecommunications, raw-material,
energy, transportation, automobile, and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Citic is expected to start operating a mobile
telecommunications network in Tianjin, Qingdao, Wuhan and Shenyang
this year while preparing to launch the Asiasat III.
</P>
<P>
In the automobile sector, the company will complete the design
for the restructuring of Zhengzhou Automobile Corp and Beijing
Light Automobile Corp this year, while seeking approval for a
diesel engine project.
</P>
<P>
The investment in energy will involve the construction of
Jiaxing Power Plant and Ligang Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
Besides the financial sector and industrial investment, Qin
said, his conglomerate will strive to expand the export of
complete sets of machinery and electronics products.
</P>
<P>
The total export value this year is targeted at 200 million US
dollars while imports is expected to hit 150 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Duma's Move Damages Russia's Interests: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said on Monday that the State Duma's resolutions
nullifying the 1991 accords which dissolved the Soviet Union were
damaging Russia's foreign policy interests.
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos, Primakov told reporters that "The development of
relations between Russia and the former Soviet republics is
undoubtedly a priority area today.
</P>
<P>
"The State Duma's decisions practically cross out the
sovereignty of these countries while the preservation of
sovereignty is a prerequisite for laying the foundation for new
integration processes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that all the leaders of the former
Soviet republics with whom he talked had said that they now led
sovereign states and would consider super-national structures only
if that sovereignty was preserved.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Duma's move negated not only the sovereignty
and existence of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) but blocked the ongoing integration process among
them as well.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also pointed out that Moscow is "now
waging a serious battle against attempts to expand the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which is creating a new
geopolitical and military situation not very favorable to Russia."
</P>
<P>
Advocates of NATO expansion argue that central and east
European countries want to join the alliance because they fear a
restoration of the Soviet Union and the unpredictability of
Russian foreign policy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Duma's decisions lend additional arguments to the
supporters of NATO expansion," Primakov said.

<P>
The Duma's resolutions would also strengthen the position of
those in the three Baltic nations who aspire to join NATO, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the resolutions had practically
undermined the legal basis of the present Russian state and caused
a legal vacuum in Russia's foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, the lower house of the Russia parliament,
approved two resolutions last Friday denouncing the 1991 accords
which dissolved the Soviet Union and created the CIS.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin blasted the resolutions as
"scandalous" and "unconstitutional."

<HEADLINE> France to Adopt Measures to Prevent Police Suicides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre today pledged to adopt a series of measures aimed at
preventing more suicides among police officers, a problem of great
concern for the nation lately.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the southwest town of Montbeliard in Doubs
Department, where two officers have taken their own lives since
January, he promised to strengthen medical and psychiatric support
for those under pressure of "a social and moral crisis."
</P>
<P>
Debre ordered an increase in the number of police psychiatrists
as well as setting up a hot-line telephone service to help them.
</P>
<P>
A national coordination body would also be activated, he
pledged, with specialists teams at the disposal of individual
police stations across the country on request.
</P>
<P>
Police suicides have claimed 14 lives since January 10 when a
Paris officer finished himself with a service pistol.
</P>
<P>
The suicide rate for officers aged between 25 and 55 stands at
42 yearly since 1988, higher than any other social stratum,
according to a sociologist research report released in February.
</P>
<P>
Police unions attribute high suicide rates to personal reasons,
such as housing problem and debt burden, as well as the job
itself, which exposes officers to endless social tragedies.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A fresh round of talks on Bosnian
disarmament started here today, with the aim of reaching a weapons
reduction accord among the formerly warring parties and ultimately
a regional disarmament pact by June.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian general Vigleik Eide, representing the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe at the talks, said that a
limit will be set for the number of heavy weapons each side in
Bosnia is allowed to have in its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
All the parties will have the freedom to modernize their
armories if they respect the ceilings, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the U.S. initiative to provide military
assistance to the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia did not
contradict the aim of reducing the amount of weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States on March 15 said it would provide 100 million
dollars in military aid to the Moslem-Croat federation, a move
strongly opposed by the European Union which accused the U.S. of
sending a "negative signal."
</P>
<P>
This round of disarmament talks is to end on March 29.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for More Forest Plantations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister for Forestry
Lieutenant General Chit Swe called for more forest plantations in
the country in order to relieve the pressures on Myanmar's
natural forests.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at the opening of an forestry
research seminar on Monday, according to today's state-run paper
"the New Light of Myanmar".
</P>
<P>
The minister said Myanmar's forestry management concepts have
been focused mainly on the management of natural teak forests,
resulting in partly neglecting the other forest types.
</P>
<P>
In harvesting also, Myanmar's extraction methods have been
based on teak, resulting in the decaying and wastage of the other
species, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that many potential foreign investors are
proposing the establishment of large plantations with fast growing
species for industries such as pulp and paper manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed that Myanmar has been negotiating
with many international organizations, friendly countries and
non-governmental organizations to assist in upgrading and
promoting forestry research in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has a forest cover of about 33 million hectares or 51
per cent of the total land area, of which 6.1 million hectares are
covered by teak with over 8,000 different plant species. Annual
plantation target is set at 32,400 hectares, of which 40 per cent
are for commercial plantation.
</P>
<P>
In 1994-95, the reserved forest area of Myanmar totaled 103,312
square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar being held, papers on forest conservation,
management and utilization are presented. The seminar is attended
by representatives of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), consultants of
forestry projects and experts of the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency as well as officials from the Myanmar Ministry
of Forestry.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares reiterated today his country's willingness to
administer the Panama Canal after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The Panama Canal Treaty will, without a doubt, be complied with
in their entirety," Perez Balladares said at the opening of a
meeting of Central American deputy agriculture ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The canal and all the areas handed over will be administered
100 percent as Panamanian property beginning on January 1, 2000,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The interoceanic waterway is about 82 kilometers in length from
deep water to deep water and it is one of the two most strategic
artificial waterways in the world. At present, the canal is owned
and operated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that there was some confusion over
compliance with the Panama Canal Treaty and the possibility of a
renegotiation over the presence of the U.S. military in the Canal
zone beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares said that Panama, as a sovereign country,
could hold talks with the United States on renegotiating the terms
of the U.S. military presence in Panama.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Helms-Burton Bill tightening sanctions against
Cuba, the Panamanian president said that the bill should be
rejected by the international community as it violates
international laws.

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A barge carrying more than
714,000 gallons of oil broke open just outside a ship channel in
southern U.S. today, leaking hundreds of gallons the oil into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
The oil barge, owned by the Buffalo Marine Service Inc.,
buckled and ruptured at about 1:00 p.m. (local time) amid strong
winds and rough seas just outside the Houston Ship Channel in
Galveston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Galveston said televised images showed the vessel
sunk in the middle and apparently on the verge of breaking into
two pieces.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lt. Greg Delong said up to 210,000 gallons of No. 2
crude oil had spilled by about 5 p.m. (local time), leaving a
ribbon of oil at least three kilometers long into Galveston Bay,
about 50 kilometers southeast of Houston.
</P>
<P>
Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro said commerce, wildlife and
tourism may suffer serious damage from the spill, because high
winds and rough seas complicated cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
The channel was closed temporarily, but reopened by early
evening.
</P>

In one of the worst shipping accidents in the area, Mega Borg,
a Norwegian tanker, leaked 4.3 million gallons of crude oil near
Galveston in June, 1990.

MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Russian
Federation Council (the upper house of parliament) was opposed to
the State Duma's resolution aimed at restoring the Soviet Union, a
Kremlin source said today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Yegor Stroyev met Russian President Boris
Yeltsin today and that the two "noted the negative consequences of
the decisions passed by the Duma (the lower house of parliament)."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Stroyev considered the possibility of discussing
the (Duma) decisions at an upper house session to be held on
Tuesday, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night Stroyev made upper house leaders work out for
Tuesday's session a draft resolution based on "broad

figures.
</P>
<P>
The Duma approved two resolutions last Friday denouncing the
1991 accords dissolving the Soviet Union and forming the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Constitution entitles the upper house to consider
all federal laws concerning the ratification or cancellation of
international treaties.

<HEADLINE> Double lifespan for Chinese kiwifruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese food scientists have
invented a new way to prolong the life of the kiwifruit -- known
in China as the yangtao.
</P>
<P>
It will increase the shelf life of the popular fruit from
between two and three months to six months.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a boom in the market for the fruit which
has become increasingly popular in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese in origin, the fruit was called the yangtao. It was
introduced to New Zealand in 1905 and was given the English name
of "kiwifruit."
</P>
<P>
The olive-green colored fruit is nutritiously rich and has
become a best seller on both domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
China's planting of yangtao has thrived only in recent
years. Now 50 million kilograms are grown every year in China, but
storage has always been a big problem.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Henan Province alone, farmers suffer from
economic losses of over 30 million yuan annually, due to poor
techniques in storing the fruit.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 China's State Science and Technology Commission
listed the technology of kiwifruit storage among China's major
scientific research projects.
</P>
<P>
After lengthy experiments researchers in Henan Provincial
Academy of Sciences found that the major reason why the fruit
decays so easily is the existence of large amounts of ethylene gas
in the air. In the process of decaying, the fruit also releases
large amount of ethylene gas. The new storage technique prolongs
the life of the fruit by avoiding the accumulation of the gas.

KIEV, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher is to arrive here Tuesday for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's visit continues a high-level dialogue on
cooperation between the United States and Ukraine, U.S. Ambassador
William Miller told a news briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The visit was planned when Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
met Christopher in Helsinki earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will hold talks with Kuchma, Ukraine's
Parliamentary Speaker Alexander Morotz, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Marchuk and Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's strategic status and its vast territory, only second
to Russia in the region, are the factors behind U.S. support of
the country, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington is ready to help Kiev and Moscow to resolve
their dispute over the division of the Black Sea Fleet, with the
approval of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Information News Agency quoted the
U.S. ambassador as saying that Washington will grant Kiev 225
million U.S. dollars in technical aid.
</P>
<P>
The United States also plans to assist Ukraine in pushing
forward reforms, particularly its macro-economic reforms, Miller
added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Washington is trying to balance
Russia's enormous influence over its neighbor by taking measures
to strengthen U.S. ties with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is scheduled to visit Kiev
early next month and sign a wide-ranging political treaty.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk will leave for Moscow Wednesday to arrange for
Yeltsin's visit, which has been delayed several times due to
the row over the division of the Black Sea Fleet.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Seven million more Americans
will be eligible to vote in November general election than four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The voting-age population of the United States is expected to
reach 196.5 million by November 1, the Census Bureau reported
Monday. The presidential election will be held on November 5.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, there were 189.5 million Americans who were eligible
to cast ballots. An eligible voter should be an American who is at
least 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
But the number who register and vote is always well below the
total, the Census Bureau said, adding that as many as 14.8 million
of the voting-age total are not citizens.
</P>
<P>
There will be 102.2 million women of voting age, 52 percent of
the total, outnumbering men by 7.9 million.
</P>
<P>
White people comprise 165.2 million, or 84 percent of the
total. Some 12 percent of the voting-age population, or 22.9
million, are black.
</P>
<P>
There will be 8.4 million, 4 percent, of other races, including
Asian and Pacific Islander, American Indian, Eskimo and Aleut.
</P>
<P>
Hispanics, who can be members of any race, will constitute 18.6
million, or 9 percent, of the potential electorate.

<HEADLINE> Russia Looks for New Naval Bases in Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia is looking for new naval
bases along its Black Sea coast due to its Black Sea Fleet dispute
with Ukraine, a government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
had signed a document today on setting up a government commission
to study the naval base issue.
</P>
<P>
The commission, headed by State Property Committee chief
Alexander Kazakov, is to submit its proposals of the transfer to
the Navy of a part of the port facilities at Novorossiisk, Tuapse,
Sochi and Gelendzhik.
</P>
<P>
The Russian navy's commander-in-chief, Admiral Felix Gromov, is
the deputy head of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Russia had tried in vain to persuade Ukraine to allow its navy
to use the port facilities at Sevastopol, the headquarters of the
Ukrainian Navy.
</P>
<P>
The issue of port facilities had therefore been preventing the
two countries from solving their dispute over the Black Sea
Fleet.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The State Science and Technology
Commission (SSTC) has Commended one hundred Chinese counties for
their efficient application of science and technology last year,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Better-developed eastern areas and counties dominated the
rankings, with 32 of the top 100 counties in Jiangsu Province, 30
in Shandong Province and 10 in Zhejiang Province, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The appraisal, the first ever conducted by the country's
science and technology authorities, was designed to further
strengthen awareness among government leaders of driving economic
and social development through modern science and technology, and
to encourage labourers to upgrade their skills by learning more
techniques, said Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of the SSTC.
</P>
<P>
Authorities will make similar rankings annually in the future,
said Xu.
</P>
<P>
The '95 appraisal included such factors as gross domestic
products (GDP) and per capita GDP, per capita net income of rural
residents, export volume proportion of GDP, the contribution of
science to the local economy, funds for scientific and
technological programs, annual per capita educational funds and
the implementation situation of the nine-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The top 100 counties were selected according to their total
scores based on these factors.
</P>
<P>
From this year, in co-operation with local governments, the
SSTC will try to speed up science and technology development in
Mid-western regions, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> More Trees in Beijing Mean Less Sand, Wind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- While Beijing residents in the
1970s often found themselves facing fierce winds and sand storms,
today they enjoy a healthier environment, the "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has a forest coverage rate of 36.26 percent,
according to a recent report on forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
People now must endure an average of only 18 days with gales
annually, compared with 27 days during the '70s.
</P>
<P>
The environment will continue to improve, said experts who
attributed the improvement to afforestation around and within
Beijing. Beijing hopes to have a 40 percent coverage rate by the
year 2000, compared with a present 36.3 percent and a rate of 16.6
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Seedlings will be planted on more than 400,000 hectares in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Beijing will have some 12 million mu(800,000
hectares) of forestry areas.
</P>
<P>
To finance the afforestation, a total of 500 million yuan(60
million US dollars) will be needed.
</P>
<P>
The shelter belt will be strengthened around Miyun and Huairou
reservoirs, the barren Taihang will be afforested, sand along the
Kangzhuang, Yongding and Chaobai river banks put under control and
the city planted with more trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Favourable policies will continue for those who afforest barren
hills. They will be exempted from three-year agricultural
taxation, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Some 11 orchards will be set up, with more than 60,000 hectares
of apples, pears, peaches and grapes planted.
</P>
<P>
So far nearly 129,000 hectares of fruit trees have been
planted. By selling the fruits, farmers in the mountainous suburbs
earned 96 US dollars per person last year.
</P>
<P>
To make the city more beautiful, Beijing will further develop
flower production. Annual production of six million flowers and
650,000 potted flowers is expected by 2000.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the forestry resources, Beijing will limit chopping
of trees to within 182,000 cubic metres in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
A surveillance system is expected to cover more than 80 percent
of the woods, protecting them from harmful diseases and
pests. Also included are networks of communication, observation
and quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has forest acreage of more than 10.25 million
mu(683,000 hectares).

NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman of Chicago Bull,
the National Basketball Association's leading rebounder, was
suspended for six games and fined 20,000 U.S. dollars by the
league Monday for head-butting a referee after being ejected from
a game.
</P>
<P>
Rod Thorn, NBA's senior vice president of basketball
operations, said that such physical assaults on referees can not

</P>
<P>
Rodman also knocked over a water cooler, stripped off his
jersey and shouted obscenities after he was ejected during the
first quarter of Chicago's victory over New Jersey on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thorn explained that the suspension and fine reflect not only
the head-butting, but the totality of his actions on the court.
</P>
<P>
Under this suspension, Rodman won't be eligible to play again
until April 2, when the Bulls play at Miami. His absence could
hurt Chicago's bid to become the first NBA team to score a
consecutive 70 victory run.

<HEADLINE> Colombian FM Refuses to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Pardo Garcia-Pena said today that he would not
quit his post because his resignation was likely to be taken as an
admission of guilt in the scandal over the alleged use of drug
money to finance President Ernesto Samper's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he had already discussed the matter with
the president, who does not want "to send signals that are
interpreted as an admission of a guilt that I do not feel."
</P>
<P>
Pardo added that "the prosecutor's decision to open a criminal
investigation against me cannot be used by the president's
enemies to proclaim victory against him."
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the National Radio Network RCN, the minister
described as "a terrible fact" the possibility that drug-related
funds had infiltrated the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said he was anxious to learn the truth of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Samper's former campaign director Fernando Botero said on
January 22 this year that the president knew that the Cali drug
cartel contributed funds to his 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Samper has repeatedly denied the charges and said if any drug
money was used in his campaign, it was done behind his back.

HAIKOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat has
suggested that Hainan Province, China's largest special economic
zone, has great potential for economic co-operation with Canada.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yijun, China's ambassador to Canada, said the island
province in south China has made great progress in upgrading
infrastructure facilities and should further promote co-operation
with foreign countries such as Canada.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who visited Hainan recently, suggested that Hainan
introduce Canadian technology to build power grids and to tap
fisheries resources in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The province can attract Canadian businesses to invest in
hi-tech industry in the Yangpu area by drawing up preferential
policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a leading tourist destination, Hainan could profitably
introduce some advanced amusement facilities, such as stereoscopic
cinema screens, from Canada, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Most Major Roads in Bosnia Ready to Open: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said here today that as of Tuesday, 80 percent of major
roads in Bosnia will open for use.
</P>
<P>
He said that three months after its deployment in the war-torn
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the NATO-led IFOR's implementation process in
the region is "right on track."
</P>
<P>
Solana made the remarks at a press conference jointly held with
NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General George A. Joulwan,
at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Solana called the open of most major roads an "tremendous
asset" for free movement, and said that it was also important for
the restart of economic activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO, working with the World Bank and other
international organisations, had identified more than 200 projects
which could use NATO's security investment program for those
essential to IFOR missions, namely reconstructing bridges,
repairing roads, re-establishing telecommunication, and supply of
water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
General Joulwan told the press conference that IFOR now had
accomplished a 10 kilometer-wide separation zone on a
1,000-kilometer front where the former warring factions had
separated and that the IFOR would maintain that separation.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO was "extremely concerned" about the situation in
the five Serb districts being transferred to the Muslim-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that IFOR would do the best it could to prevent
the arson and looting sweeping through the districts, adding that
IFOR would work closely with the International Police Task Force
and police of the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
According to General Joulwan, the IFOR commanders in the field
would intervene more frequently in non-military matters, in
support of the civilian sector.
</P>
<P>
But he once again stressed that all this would be done "on the
condition that the IFOR's primary mission is not harmed." enditem

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sets Goal for Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- This year's housing reform in the
capital will be centered on collecting accumulated fund and rent
and the sale of publicly-owned houses, sources at the Municipal
Housing Reform Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the policies set by the State Council, the state
will sell publicly-owned houses at market prices to high-income
families, at cost price to middle- and lower-income ones and at
a special price to people who have real difficulties in buying
houses at cost price.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has accelerated the process of setting up accumulation
funds for housing in the past year. The total population
participating in such funds reached 1.9 million here last year,
accounting for 60 percent of the total number of employees in work
units under its administration. The number of people participating
in the fund is required to top 2.3 million in order to collect 1.2
billion yuan this year, as compared with 600 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also promote reform in renting houses. Last year,
the rent was 0.87 yuan per sq m, but it will be raised to 1.3 yuan
this year.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Badminton Qualifying System Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- England manager Ciro Ciniglio is
pressing for an overhaul of badminton's Olympic qualifying
process, according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Ciniglio has been disturbed by the number of players from
various countries withdrawing from recent tournaments at short
notice as the March 31 Olympic qualifying deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
At present, players who feel they probably have sufficient
qualifying points may be tempted to miss tournaments, thus
avoiding defeat and losing points.
</P>
<P>
"The International Badminton Federation (IBF) must look again
at their qualifying system after the Olympics," Ciniglio said. "I
believe in future they should nominate 10 worldwide tournaments
and count players' best results from eight of them.
</P>
<P>
"There is little incentive for people to play at the moment."
</P>
<P>
A spate of withdrawals has hit recent events on the badminton
calendar.
</P>
<P>
IBF chief executive David Shaw said on Monday: "We are
totally committed to constantly looking at the qualifying
system." The problem is all set to be aired at the federation's
annual general meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
Badminton became an Olympic sport at the Barcelona Games in
1992.

<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- German National squad head coach
Berti Vogts hinted Monday that Lothar Matthaeus may not play a
part in the European championship finals slated in June in England.
</P>
<P>
Vogts left the country's most capped player out of his
27-member line-up for next week's soccer friendly against Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"There is no place for Lothar in the team at the moment. He
first has to get fit again," said Vogts.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus, 34, a member of the 1990 World Cup winning team, has
won 122 international caps, but he has not played for Germany
since December 1994 after rupturing his achilles tendon early last
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Matthaeus' place is taken because Vogts regards
Matthias Sammer as his No.1 sweeper.
</P>
<P>
Vogts will make his final selection of 18 to 20 players
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Briefed on Recent Disputes With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq blocked U.N. arms
inspection teams five times over the past 10 days from access to
sites suspected of containing weapons and related materials.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission,
who reported the recent incidents to the Security Council today,
said that the experts were searching for ballistic missile
components and related documents in all five inspections.
</P>
<P>
The first two incidents took place on March 8 and March 11 when
the arms experts tried to enter a building to the Ministry of
Irrigation and an underground site used as a President Guards
training center. They were widely reported.
</P>
<P>
The other incidents were: a three-hour delay at a vehicle
repair site belonging to President Saddam Hussein's Republican
Guards on March 14; an almost three-hour delay at another site
associated with the Republican Guard known as headquarters of the
Special Guards on March 14; and a five-hour delay at the command
center of the Republican Guards on March 15.
</P>
<P>
According to Security Council resolutions, Iraq is bound to
disclose and destroy all stocks and facilities relating to
nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missile programs.
</P>
<P>
The council also demanded that Iraq allow the Special
Commission, the International Atomic Energy Agency and their
inspection teams immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access
to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of
transportation which they wish to inspect.

<HEADLINE> 50 Manila Fire Victims Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 victims of a disco
house fire today have been admitted into a mobile hospital set up
by the Philippine Army here today.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 people have been confirmed killed by the fire
which started at 00:35 in Quezon city of Metro Manila, police
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Denny Yu, a volunteer of the Chinese Fire Brigade
helping the police, the firemen could only count 150 badly burned
bodies which stuck to one another.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a gas tank explosion before the fire when
about 350 people, most of them students, were celebrating school
break inside the disco house.
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out from the kitchen, there was a stampede
among the disco-goers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the ceiling fell and buried many people.
</P>
<P>
The disco house was renovated a few months ago and there were
some tables stored above the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
As the young people were trying to flee the hell of fire, there
were just not enough fire exits, according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
In a live interview with the local radio, Manual Badorio, fire
marshal of Quezon city, said the death toll could go up, but he
denied the report that the disco house has no fire exit.
</P>
<P>
He is the one responsible to check the fire prevention device
of commercial disco houses before they are allowed to open to
public.
</P>
<P>
But an employee of the disco house told the local radio that
there was really no fire exit in the disco house.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine army has set up a mobile hospital near the fire
scene. More than 50 have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the victims are still rushing to the charred disco
house in hopes that their beloved ones would survive the fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire lasted for almost two hours and was put out at around
02:00 local time (GMT 18:00).
</P>
<P>
The local radio described the fire as "one of the tragedies of
the Philippine nation."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali will begin an official visit to China, South
Korea and Japan on March 24, a U.N. spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa, the chief spokesman of the secretary-general, said
that Boutros-Ghali will visit China from March 24 to 28. He is
going to meet Chinese leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to South Korea from March 28 to April 2, the
U.N. chief will meet President Kim Young Sam, Foreign Minister
Ro-Myung Gong and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
In Japan from April 2 to 6, the secretary-general will have an
audience with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. He will also
meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Foreign Minister
Yukihito Ikeda.
</P>
<P>
Before his visit to the three Asian countries, Foa said
Boutros-Ghali, who is now in Geneva, will also pay a three-day
visit to France.
</P>
<P>
The top agenda of his visit will be on the financial situation
of the United Nations, Foa said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations was owed 3.1 billion U.S. dollars by member
states. It is estimated that it will totally run out of cash this
December unless the United States, the biggest debtor, surrenders
a considerable amount of money owed.

<HEADLINE> New York Port Choking in Mud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Rising shoals of mud are
threatening the survival of New York Harbor, where 4,500 ships
yearly carry 60 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods and generate
tens of thousands of jobs, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Each day thousands of tons of riverborne silt shifted into the
harbor's shipping channels and the Army Corps of Engineers scooped
up the mud and dumped it in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
But the routine dumping operation was banned as most of the
harbor mud failed to meet new standards covering contaminants and
toxicity, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, less than half of the annual accumulation of four
million tons of mud was cleared from harbor channels and berths
last year and only one third of the silt is expected to be removed
this year.
</P>
<P>
And port officials, desperate to clear channels, have remained
locked in debate with beachfront communities, fishermen and
environmental groups who oppose any further disposal of silt in
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Signs of trouble are growing in harbor's economy. More and more
New York-bound ships, unable to sail directly to the harbor
terminals, called at the deeper port of Halifax, Noya Scotia.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the New York Petroleum Council, close
to 1 billion gallons of the annual 30 billion gallons total is
now being handled by barges shuttling between tankers and the
shores.
</P>
<P>
Shipping experts and harbor officials said only a comprehensive
plan to find places for dredged mud will provide enough
reassurance to keep ships coming.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind: Referendum Decision Some Weeks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind said today that his government would make a final decision
on whether to hold a national referendum on a single European
currency over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee this
afternoon, Rifkind said he expected that the government would
decide in "weeks rather than months" whether to promise a
referendum if Britain should accept a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who is drawing up a document examining all the issues
in connection with the referendum, said, "I think sometimes a
referendum may be the most appropriate way of resolving an issue
of extreme importance."
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the British government would accept the
outcome of the national referendum.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll, published in the Sunday Times newspaper,
showed that 80 percent of the British people wanted to have a
national referendum on the single currency and 67 percent of those
questioned would vote against a single currency.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iraq End 2nd Round of Oil-for-Food Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
Iraqi representatives concluded their second round of oil-for-food
talks without reaching any agreement here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, announced that the delegation has achieved
considerable progress during the second round of talks and that
they will report to their principals.
</P>
<P>
After today's talks, Iraq's chief negotiator Abdul Amir
Al-Anbari said that how to organize distribution of food and
medicine remains an issue to be further discussed.
</P>
<P>
Hans Corell, the U.N. under-secretary-general, said that the
negotiators have made great progress during the second round of
talks. He was confident the remaining issues will be solved in
coming talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief had talked by telephone with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz earlier this morning. They agreed that the
third round of talks will begin on April 8 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali also expressed his concern for the suffering of
the Iraqi population. However, the level of the third round of
talks has not been decided yet.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. As the economic sanctions have
crippled the Iraqi economy, Iraq is running short of food,
medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 986 on April 14, 1995.
According to the resolution, Iraq is allowed to export oil worth 2
billion dollars over six months so as to purchase food and other
supplies. Iraq had refused to accept the offer until mid-January
this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Iraq held the first round of oil-for-food talks
from February 6 to 19. The second round of talks started on March
11.

<HEADLINE> Federal Police to Enter Grbavica Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Federation police will
enter Grbavica, the last Serb-controlled suburb of Sarajevo to be
reverted to the Muslim-Croat side, Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the UN-led
international police, about 100 policemen, who are mostly Muslims,
will cross the former confrontation line to take over the
authority beginning 6:00 am (local time).
</P>
<P>
Grbavica is the last of the five Serb-controlled suburbs which
should be handed over to the federation under the terms of the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a tour of Grbavica this morning, this reporter saw an erring
quiet in the region, with few people on the streets except those
waiting for buses to other Serb-controlled towns.
</P>
<P>
Nothing has been left in the apartments abandoned by fleeing
Serbs, who had even stripped rooms of toilets and heating bars.
Several apartments have been set on fire, with flames licking out
of the windows and a heavy smoke hovering in the sky.
</P>
<P>
This reporter saw three arsonists being caught on the spot by
the Italian soldiers of NATO and turned over to the Serb police
who would maintain order in Grbavica until the Bosnian takeover
Tuesday. But a U.N. police officer suspected that the trio would
be immediately set free by the Serb authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, there were
about 70,000 residents in Sarajevo suburbs, but the number
dwindled to 11,000 by March 16.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a NATO spokesman said the region of Sarajevo, which
must be demilitarized by Tuesday, will be "clean" from the Bosnian
Croat militia and Serb forces but the Bosnian Muslim army has
still not complied with demilitarization provisions.
</P>
<P>
Major Simon Haselock, the spokesman, said the Bosnian army has
not yet been relocated from the Marshal Tito barracks in the
center of Sarajevo and some other facilities. He stressed that the
IFOR is not going to allow either side to prolong the
implementation of the peace treaty.

LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian minister said today
that the massive turnout of voters in Saturday's local government

<HEADLINE> US, Russia Collaborate on Civil Supersonic Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
are collaborating on a research program for a possible supersonic
passenger plane for the 21st century, according to a report of
the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The unusual flight experiments are being carried out in Russia
between the Tupolev Design Bureau, a leading Russian warplane
manufacturer, and major American aerospace industries.
</P>
<P>
The sleek supersonic Tu-144, manufactured by the Tupolev Design
Bureau, was officially unveiled Sunday at the heavily guarded
military airfield in Zhukovsky, Russia, an hour drive from the
Russian capital of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The American-Russian collaboration may compete with the French
and the British, who have already produced the Concorde supersonic
planes.
</P>
<P>
The American and Russian companies hope that they can build a
new civilian plane that can travel more than twice the speed of
sound.
</P>
<P>
The first supersonic plane was developed under the guidance of
Andrei Nikholayvich Tupolev and his son Alexei Andreevich Tupolev,
who was at the unveiling Sunday. The first Russian supersonic
plane conducted its maiden flight on December 31, 1968.
</P>
<P>
But Russians later found that the planes were uneconomic and
phased them out of service after producing a total of 17 such
planes.
</P>
<P>
Although some experts still believe that the glory days of the
supersonic transport are not at hand, the U.S. and Russian
companies involved are determined to launch their research
programs on the high-speed civilian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The United States is reportedly planning to spend 1.9 billion
U.S. dollars on the research by 2001.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Adopt Common Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government will push
the European Union to forge a common foreign and security policy
during this month's commencement of the Intergovernmental
Conference (IGC) to revise the Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis told the Greek parliament today
that Athens' positions at the IGC would revolve on four axes:
formation of a common foreign and security policy, reinforcement
of European integration, confronting the lack of social solidarity
and an effort to minimize or eliminate the distance separating
ordinary citizens and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Yugoslav and Imia crises, Simitis said Athens would
push to enlarge the scope of common foreign and security policy
to cover the protection of external borders and incorporate rules
of solidarity, mutual assistance and timely intervention.
</P>
<P>
To serve this purpose, the prime minister added, a framework
for peace missions should be adopted and the Western European
Union incorporated into the EU.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our vital interests are not ensured by respective
commitments at an EU level, Greece's right to veto will always
remain active," Simitis said. He added that Greece aimed to "blunt"
the current regime of decision-making where understanding was
reached between a few powerful nations.

African states overlooking the great lakes.
</P>
<P>
The participants include Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko,
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, Burundi President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, as well as
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere and former Mali President Amadou Toumany Toure.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian news agency quoted the Tunisian presidential
spokesman as saying that President Ben Ali had discussed with his
guests the current efforts to restore peace and stability in the
great lakes region, spelling out the necessity of focusing
attention on the objective factors and the deep-rooted causes that
underline the dangers of dissension and struggle.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian President had also asserted the need to coordinate
all efforts in search of practical solutions, taking into
consideration the gravity of the crisis and its

the region and will enable all African peoples to turn to their
basic causes of development and to ensure their progress and
prosperity, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Reaches 5 Miles Into Mexican Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A ribbon of oil from a
ruptured barge in the Galveston Bay spread for at least five miles
into the Gulf of Mexico today as hundreds of workers tried to
clean up the spill.
</P>
<P>
The 275-foot oil barge ran aground and broke open in the
Galveston Bay just outside the Houston Ship Channel Monday,
spilling at least 5,000 barrels of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Galveston, Texas, said globs of oil were reported
along about 2,000 yards of shoreline on the east end of the
Galveston Island today. Oily birds had also been spotted in the
area.
</P>
<P>
To clean up the spill, at least six skimming vessels and 300
workers were working at the scene this morning. By midmorning,
crews had pumped all but about 2,000 barrels of oil from the
ruptured barge to an empty vessel.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guards commander Dean Kutz said that while a sheen of oil
remained on the water around the barge, no more heavy oil was
leaking.
</P>
<P>
Crews placed protective booms around the barge and along nearby
environmentally sensitive shorelines, but initial efforts to
recover the oil were hampered by high winds.
</P>
<P>
Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro said Monday that commerce,
wildlife and tourism were expected to suffer serious damage from
the spill.
</P>
<P>
In one of the worst shipping accidents in the area, Norwegian
tanker Mega Borg leaked 4.3 million gallons of crude oil near
Galveston in June 1990.

<HEADLINE> Americans Send Checks, Letters to Support UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 American
people have sent 462 checks with a total of nearly 6,500 dollars
to express their support for the United Nations and protest
against the failure of the U.S. government to pay its
contributions, according to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general,
also read two letters to the U.N. chief at the noon news briefing
here today.
</P>
<P>
An open letter to the U.N. secretary-general signed by 31
individuals from New Canaan of Connecticut read, "The undersigned,
residents of New Canaan, Connecticut, enclose their checks to the
United Nations covering their share of the funds owed the U.N. by
the United States, which we understand amounts to 4.4 dollars per
American citizen."
</P>
<P>
"We make this gesture in protest against the failure of the
U.S. to fulfill its Treaty obligations from its membership in the
United Nations. Through our individual protests we hope to send a
message and to set a small example which we hope our Government
will follow," added the letter.
</P>
<P>
The other letter from North Carolina said, "I read that the
United States debt to the U.N. amounts to 4.40 dollars for each
American citizen. Enclosed is a check for 8.80 dollars to cover
the share for my wife and me."
</P>
<P>
"I may not always agree with the U.N. as I do not always agree
with the United States government. I am proud of my country, yet I
cannot but feel shame at its being a dead beat by failing to honor
its financial obligations. I would expect my tenants to pay their
rent or my poker companions to pay their gambling losses even if
they disagree with me about politics or religion or whatever," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi said that though the sum sent by the individuals is a
drop in the ocean of the U.S. debt of over 1 billion dollars, the
U.N. much appreciates their efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, outstanding contributions to
the U.N. amounted to 3.1 billion dollars, including 1.2 billion
dollars of regular budget and 1.9 billion dollars for
peacekeeping. The United States alone had arrears of 1.6 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> S.African IFP Firm On Zulu Status Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) of South Africa would not return to the
constitution-writing process unless the promise of international
mediation on Zulu status was met, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Buthelezi said there was
now more need for international mediation than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitutional assembly early last
year in protest against the failure of the African National
Congress (ANC) to honour an agreement on international mediation
on Zulu automony in Kwazulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the ANC, IFP and National Party
before the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said despite his highest respect for President
Nelson Mandela, the president had not met promises in their
signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If he's made up his mind as president of South Africa, then
there is no way we can return to the constititional assembly,"
said Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Mandela's threat of action in Kwazulu/Natal if
problems in the province were not sorted out, Buthelezi said
Mandela had the right to initiate steps to ensure law and order
in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African Foreign
Ministry is expected to issue passports on May 22 in an effort to
eliminate forgery in various security features.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi announced that the
features included an invisible line drawing of the union
buildings and invisible security fibers and dots which would show
up under an ultra-violet light.
</P>
<P>
"A mini-printed security thread will appear on every page and
while the sewing thread will appear as ordinary white cotton to
the eye it will fluoresce in two colors," said Buthelizi.
</P>
<P>
The new passports have three forms: the standard passport for
citizens going overseas, an official passport for government
officials and a travel document for permanent residents who do not
have citizenships of another country.
</P>
<P>
An emergency passport would be available for a person who lost
his travel document abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
And a passport for children under the age of 16, and who are
South African citizens, would be available for the first time.
</P>
