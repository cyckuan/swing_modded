<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cotton Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Cotton Growers
Association (CGA) Thursday said cotton production for the just
ended season was down by between 15 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
CGA chief executive Doug Pascoe told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that picking was almost complete and a survey of all regions
showed that yields were not as expected.
</P>
<P>
He said the symposium to be held on August 6 in Harare would
attempt to identify the reasons for the disappointing yields this
season, adding the exact reasons for the fall in yields would be
dealt with in detail.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which in a good season produces an average 270,000
tons of seed cotton, is regarded as the largest producer in the
region, earning about three billion Zimbabwean Dollars (170
million U.S. Dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Pascoe said final statistics on the season's production were
not yet out, but output would be less than last year's 270,000
tons.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government to Pay Billions for Pay-Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government has
underpaid nearly 200,000 current and former employees for the past
13 years, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled in a judgement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In return, the tribunal has ordered the government to pay at
least 3 billion Canadian dollars for the pay-equity bill.
</P>
<P>
Even at a low estimate, the decision would mean the workers,
mostly clerks and secretaries making less than 30,000 Canadian
dollars (20,429 U.S. dollars) a year, could get 13 years of back
pay amounting to an average of 15,000 Canadian dollars (10,210
U.S. dollars) for each person.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of workers who will receive the money are
women.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal said the underpayment by the government to female
workers, compared with their male counterparts for the past 13
years, violates the 1978 Canadian Human Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
The government has 30 days to appeal the tribunal's ruling to
the federal Court.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Calls for Fight Against Gender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The signing of international
conventions deploring violence against women has not achieved its
intended purpose, the United Nations Fund for Women Regional
Director for Southern Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gita Welch said many African governments had ratified
international conventions such as the African Charter on Human
Rights, but very little had been done on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Zimbabwe Women's Human Rights Tribunal, Welch
said, ''the rights of women and children are still being denied
50 years after the signing of the universal declaration of human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
She said it was against this background that U.N. Fund for
Women launched a campaign on the elimination of violence against
women in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government would be lobbied to implement all
its policies against gender violence as a matter of priority.
</P>
<P>
Welch said more pressure groups should be formed to counter
some conservative traditions and religious fundamentalists
violating human rights.
</P>
<P>
The one-day tribunal was organized by Zimbabwe Women's
Resource Center and network to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the universal declaration of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Central Vietnam Hit by Severe Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Central Vietnam is suffering from a
severe drought, local reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 55,000 hectares of rice in five central provinces will be
damaged by the drought if no rain comes in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand hectares of rice, 3,000 hectares of subsidiary
food crops and 4,000 hectares of short-term industrial crops in
the region have already died.
</P>
<P>
The drought is a result of continuous dry weather from early
June and a long hot spell from July 15, with temperatures staying
over 38 degrees celsius in the region and reaching 41 degrees
celsius in some places.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.1 million local inhabitants are suffering from
serious shortages of water for daily use. Water has to be
transported by tanks to some localities.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in rivers and reservoirs in the region have
dropped below the dead level, with some rivers having dried up.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have inspected the situation in the
hardest hit provinces and discussed with local administrations
solutions to reduce the losses.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to give priority to supplying water for domestic
use and saving the farm areas that still have a chance to
survive.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Parliament Sets Date for Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament Saturday
overwhelmingly approved April 18, 1999, as the date for holding
early elections one year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In a vote of 448-12, the parliament also decided that the 21st
parliamentary general elections and the provincial elections will
be held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the date of the elections was changed from
the originally proposed April 25 because the National Sovereignty
and Children Festival will be held on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who is leader of
Motherland Party, bridged his gaps with two partners, Democratic
Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit and Democratic Turkey Party leader
Husamettin Cindoruk, by reaching agreement to hold the elections
on April 25 of next year.
</P>
<P>
Before the agreement, Ecevit had insisted that the elections
should be held in November or December of this year, while
Cindoruk requested that the elections be held later than April
1999.
</P>
<P>
Having reached consensus with Republican People's Party leader
Deniz Baykal, who supports Yilmaz's minority coalition despite
being in the opposition, Yilmaz decided to hold the elections in
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
At Baykal's request, Yilmaz's coalition is expected to resign
at the end of this year and a "low profile election government"
will be formed to handle the state affairs during the transition
period.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Iraq Rages at U.S. Position on Nuclear File </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 30 (Xinhua)-- Iraq on Thursday condemned the
U.S. for its "arbitrary and aggressive" position that prevented
the U.N. Security Council from taking a "just and fair" position
on Iraq's nuclear file.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was included in a statement issued after the
joint meeting of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council and the
ruling Baath Party, which was chaired by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported that the joint meeting was
convened after the Security Council failed to reach an agreement
Wednesday on Iraqi nuclear weapons inspection after reviewing a
report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and France proposed that Iraq's nuclear file
should be closed, and the inspection be shifted to the long-term
monitoring from the present intrusive monitoring.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain were opposed to any actions
taken by the the Security Council to scale back the nuclear
inspection on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi statement said that "the way of dealing with
(Iraq's) nuclear file... gives a flagrant example of the
arbitrary dealing with Iraq's legitimate issue."
</P>
<P>
"All the IAEA reports... have shown that its tasks have
been fulfilled, and that it has actually been exercising only
monitoring and verification activities," says the statement.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the statement criticized the U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, for working for the
benefit of the American scheme by deliberately prolonging its
mission in Iraq and the U.N. sanctions as well.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests U.N. Envoy's Meeting in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said Thursday that it has
lodged a protest to the U.N. against U.N. Resident Representative
in Cyprus Ann Hercus' meeting with a senior official of the
self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said at his daily
press briefing here that the Cypriot government pointed out to the
U.N. that meetings the U.N. envoy holds with the two sides in
Cyprus "should always be in line with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions on the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that the U.N. response was that the
recent meeting that Hercus held with the so-called foreign
minister of the northern Cypriot regime "does not in any way
constitute recognition of the illegal entity unilaterally declared
in the Turkish-occupied areas."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has called upon all states "not to
recognize the purported state of the 'Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus' set by secessionist acts" and "not to facilitate
or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity,"
Stylianides added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Greece coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally a breakaway entity
in 1983, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ann Hercus came to Cyprus early this month to replace his
predecessor Feissel, who retired after 15-year service in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Scholar Stresses Importance of Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan scholar Thursday
stressed the importance of trade to attain sustainable growth,
saying it is essentially fundamental to put in place various
liberalization measures to this end.
</P>
<P>
In a presentation on ''Trade and Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA)'' at the U.N. Conference Center here, Njuguna Ndungu said,
''evidence has shown that developing countries which have
successfully achieved high sustained growth have also taken
advantage of trade opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
He stated that ''SSA countries have shifted more to outward
orientation through trade liberalization with encouraging results
in 1995 and 1996.''
</P>
<P>
According to him, export growth for the African region in the
1995-96 period has accelerated and export earnings grew on
average at 8 percent during the two years.
</P>
<P>
''This perhaps marks the start of rewards from policy reforms
to growth and thus break the vicious circle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndungu believed the importance of enhancing policies on export
and overall growth, and said, ''but a more prominent role is
played by macro-economic policies; the prominent ones are
exchange rate policies, reduction in exchange controls and price
stability.''
</P>
<P>
''A major drawback in strengthening the virtuous circle from
reforms to growth and export performance is the debt service
burden which crowds out domestic expenditures needed for
supporting expansion of productive capacity and infrastructure
for growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''Another bottleneck is the underdeveloped state of human
capacity which stifles absorption of technological competence
availed through interaction of openness and foreign direct
investment,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
Referring to global trade in sub-Saharan Africa, he said the
African share in global trade has dropped from 3 percent in 1950s
to one percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the SSA's ''increasingly marginalized in world
trade'' to the fact that ''Africa does not trade enough - trade
shares are low'' and ''trade policy is much to blame for this
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
The two-hour lecture was organized by the economic and social
policy division of the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA).

to promote employment.
</P>

The policies and programs of the government's employment
strategy would also be used to bring about employment in a
coherent, co-ordinated and effective manner, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Puts Priority on Coop with South: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian President
Mahathir Mohammed said Thursday his government has decided to put
priority on cooperations with the developing countries as an
approach to dealing with the crisis facing Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said this at the opening ceremony here of a new
Malaysian bank, the International Commercial Bank, in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The financial cooperation between Malaysia and Mozambique has
shrunken in the wake of the crisis in Southeast Asia, Mahathir
noted, adding that the two countries will surely find better ways
to push forward their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian president believed that the financial crisis
across East Asia has been the result of the selfishness and
indifference of the rich and industrialized nations, which frown
on South-South cooperation among the developing nations.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration of the new Malaysian bank, Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano pointed out that the opening of the
the Bank has demonstrated the confidence of the Malaysian
entrepreneurs, and financiers in particular, in the future
development of the Mozambican politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
Chissano hoped that the bank will operate beyond the capital
Maputo to better serve the Mozambican people.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the potential investors both at home and
abroad and other business people to actively participate in the
development of this southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Since September 1997 when Mahathir paid a visit to Mozambique,
the Malaysian investment started coming into Mozambique and
cooperation between industrialists of the two nations has been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the large number of private industrialists who
"are accompanying me in this visit," the Malaysian president
said, "they are paving the way for their return to the region
after the Asian crisis."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the direct trade between Mozambique and
Malaysia is less than 10 million U.S. Dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mozambican officials believe that through
Mahathir's visit and the efforts of both sides, the trade volume
between the two nations will expand up to 50 million U.S.
Dollars in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a three-day
visit to Mozambique after attending the second Southern African
International Dialog which was aimed at generating wealth through
the smart partnerships.

<HEADLINE> BMW to Build New Rolls-Royce Model in 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker BMW said Thursday it
would build a new Rolls-Royce model at a planned new plant in
England as of the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Munich-based company said: "As of the year
2003 a new Rolls-Royce model will be launched on the market."
</P>
<P>
The new plant, he added, would be "an exclusive production site
for high-tech vehicles."
</P>
<P>
The recently-launched Rolls-Royce model, the Silver Seraph,
would also be produced at the new plant since 2003, according to
him.
</P>
<P>
But the main bodywork of the cars would continue to be
manufactured at the Rolls-Royce plant in Crewe, England, which
would be taken over by German carmaker Volkswagen (VW).
</P>
<P>
BMW was outbid by VW in purchasing British luxery carmaker
Rolls-Royce weeks ago. But under a latest deal, it will pay 40
million pounds for the rights to the Rolls-Royce name as of 2003,
compared to the 340 million pounds it offered in bidding.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, VW will surrender the rights to the
Rolls-Royce name as of 2003 and be left with the rights to the
name and production of the Bentley versions of Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
VW should also rename the Rolls-Royce headquarters in Crewe as
Bentley Motor Cars Ltd, while BMW will set up a new subsidiary,
which will carry the traditional name Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce had been insisting on awarding the name only to
BMW, which has long been producer of Rolls-Royce engines.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Completes Final Procedure on Ratifying EU Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland has
completed the final procedure on ratifying the European Union's
(EU) Amsterdam Treaty by handing over the formal document to the
Italian government.
</P>
<P>
Irish ambassador to Rome Joseph Small Thursday handed over the
instrument of ratification, signed by Irish President Mary
McAleese, to the Italian authorities who regulate such matters,
press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said in a statement issued

nearer, the Treaty of Amsterdam will better equip the European
Union to meet the challenges ahead."
</P>
<P>
Irish voters approved the Amsterdam Treaty with a 61.7 percent
majority in a national referendum held in May, committing the
country to closer cooperation on issues such as crime, employment,
and foreign and security policy within the 15-nation EU bloc.

<P>
The new EU treaty comes into effect on the first day of the
second month after the last country formally ratifies it, the
Irish government said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Azerbaijan to Agree on Delimitation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- In a joint statement circulated on
Thursday Russia and Azerbaijan said that they intend to sign an
agreement on the delimitation of the Caspian Seabed, according to
the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued following talks between the
Russian delegation headed by First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris
Pastukhov, who arrived in Baku on Tuesday, and the Azerbaijani
delegation headed by Foreign Minister Tofik Zulfugarov.
</P>
<P>
The statement says both Russia and Azerbaijan are confident
that "all problems pertaining to the status of the Caspian Sea
will be based on the consensus of all Caspian states".
</P>
<P>
The sides exchanged views on the utilization of the water and
bed of the Caspian Sea, and analyzed two options: joint use of the
water and the division of the seabed on the one hand, or the
division of the water and seabed into national sectors, on the
other, the document reads.
</P>
<P>
The two countries stated that before the definition of the new
legal status of the Caspian Sea, the agreements between the Russian
Federation and Persia of February 26,1921, and the agreement on
trade and navigation between the USSR and Iran of March 25, 1940,
should remain in force, including the long-established practice of
navigation, fishing and border protection.
</P>
<P>
They have confirmed that the Caspian Sea should be divided into
sectors by agreement with corresponding neighboring and opposite
states along the median line, modified on the basis of the
principles of fairness and mutual agreement and with due account
taken of the islands, geological features, and other factors.
</P>
<P>
The two sides emphasized that the ecological system of the
Caspian Sea and of its components must be preserved and protected,
and the Caspian states should sign an agreement on the biological
resources as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> IGC Estimates World Wheat Supply and Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) - Despite revisions to estimates for a
number of countries, world wheat production is forecast just 1 m.
Tons lower than last month at 597 m. tons, compared with the
record 610 m tons. in 1997, International Grains Council announced
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The main changes include higher figures for the EC, the United
States, Turkey, and Australia, and reductions for Argentina,
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
On the world wheat trade, IGC said the total number is 1 m.
tons higher at 95m. tons, but still 1 m. lower than last season.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline reflects the reduced level of commercial
imports into South Asia, especially Pakistan, the stagnation in
demand in Pacific Asia and the recovery in domestic crops in North
Africa, according to IGC.
</P>
<P>
The increase from last month is attributable to the
announcement that the US government will purchase wheat for
donation to food deficit countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast at 601 m. tons, 13 m. more
than in 1997/98. Weakening prices compared with other grains,
especially maize will boost feed use in both the EC and the US,
IGC estimated.
</P>
<P>
The figure for world wheat stocks is now 2 m. lower at 127 m.
tons. Smaller harvests mean that stocks are likely to be drawn
down in China, India and Russia, IGC said.
</P>
<P>
However, those in the five major exporters are forecast to rise
by an aggregate 7 m. to 48m. tons.

<HEADLINE> More People in UK Are Losing Houses, Says CML </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) - Home repossessions in Britain
increased in the first six months of this year for the first time
since 1995, according to the latest figures released by the
Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML).
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent jump in the number of repossessions to 17310 in
the second half of 1997 means that more than 600 people a week are
losing their homes.
</P>
<P>
The announcement coincided with the release of figures from the
Lord Chancellor's department showing repossession actions up 18
percent on this time last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the housing sector blamed the rises on several
factors including interest rate rises, the reduction in mortgage
interest tax relief, cuts in income support and a rise in marriage
break-ups.
</P>
<P>
Further gloom for home-owners came from Nationwide Building
Society's quarterly house price survey, which showed a slowdown in
the housing market in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to expectations, market activity faltered in the
first half of 1998," Nationwide, one of the biggest building
societies in Britain, said, citing sales figures 6 percent lower
than last year.
</P>
<P>
The CML and the housing charity Shelter were reported to lobby
for improved protection for mortgage borrowers to ward off the
threat of repossession.
</P>
<P>
Shelter wants to see mortgage insurance, also known as
accident, sickness and unemployment policies, to be compulsory.
</P>
<P>
"I agree that the cost might put a few people off taking out a
mortgage, but that is a small price to pay to prevent the
devastation that repossession can cause," said Chris Holmes,
director of Shelter.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu to Form Security Force at Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Committee for the
Business Community issued a statement here Thursday, calling for
the formation of an armed force to improve security around
markets in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Banditry activities are increasing day by day in the Somali
capital, ns lots of killings, abduction and armed robberies,
mainly against the minority individuals, have overshadowed the
area surrounding Mogadishu's main markets.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to this, the Supreme Committee for the Business
Community, the main telecommunications companies of Olympic and
Al-Barakat as well as the money transfer dealers of Sundus,
Dahabshil and Al-Wakil plus other interested emporium owners have
been meeting to find ways to cope with the increasing insecurity
especially around the main market of Bakara since mid July.
</P>
<P>
The committee has concluded that 100 strong and well-armed men
with four military officials should be recruited to guard the
security around the Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the security members to be
recruited should be healthy, aged between 25 and 40 with no habit
of smoking, khat chewing or alcoholic drinking, bring along with
his own gun and recommended by a known businessman.
</P>
<P>
Once he was dead or injured during operations, the committee
will compensate the family for the victims, while all other
damages caused by the market's security personnel against
innocent civilians will also be dealt with by the Bakara market
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 100 armed men will be given 15,000 Somali
Shillings or two U.S. Dollars per day while each of the four
commanding officials will be given 20,000 Shillings or 2.5 U.S.
Dollars everyday.
</P>
<P>
With four temporary telephone sets to facilitate
communications they will be divided into five groups in the five
main posts in Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohamed Ali Absiyeh from Al-Barakat Telecommunications
would be the general commander of this force.
</P>
<P>
The call for the formation of this force coincided with the
meeting of Mogadishu's main faction leaders including Ali Mahdi,
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto with Hussein Hajji Bod,
the new rival of Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which took place in Bod's residence is aimed at
resolving the difference between Ali Mahdi and Bod over the
formation of an administration for Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak "Pessimistic" over Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday said he began to feel pessimistic about the peace process
for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is not satisfactory at all," Mubarak said, "I am
not optimistic, as I used to be."
</P>
<P>
He said he had maintained an optimistic attitude and actively
involved in the mediation efforts, despite up and downs in the
peace march initiated by former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
But the president now sounded alarm against the danger of a
collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He told members of the Arab Journalists Union in the
Mediterranean city of Alexandria that the Middle East issue is
becoming more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks has run into its 16th
month and recent direct talks have so far failed to produce an
agreement on a further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned against exercising pressures on Palestinians,
pointing out that the Israeli hardline stance will not force
peoples to give up their rights.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people will not accept aggression on their
lands and the Lebanese will never accept the occupation of their
territories," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he advised against jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can predict what will befall the peace process until
it comes to an end," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Egyptian-French initiative on reviving the
peace process through holding an international peace conference,
saying it does not "alienate" the U.S. role but rather
"complements" it.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement of the initiative followed Egyptian and
French contacts with the U.S. administration," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is working to turn the proposal into a plan in case that
the U.S. mediation fails.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks were stalled after Israel began
construction of a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March
1997.
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed a treaty with Israel in 1979, becoming the first
Arab country to achieve peace with the Jewish state, which had
fought four wars with the Arabs since its creation in 1948.

<HEADLINE> Makerere to Admit 8,000 Private Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's number one university,
Makerere University, will admit 8,000 private students in the
coming academic year, four times the number taken under
government sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
A clerk in the Academic Registrar's Office told Xinhua
Thursday that the increasing enrolment of private students is in
response to a cut in the university's budget by the government.
But he did not mention the size of the budget cut.
</P>
<P>
The private students are to be registered in certificate,
diploma and degree courses, he added.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the private students have to live off campus
because the university's accommodating capacity is relatively
small. But most of the 2,000 government financed students are
offered accommodations on campus.
</P>
<P>
This year, although there are 15,630 students qualified to
join Makerere, financial constraints and facilities cannot allow,
he said. Some 8,277 places have been advertized in the various
courses.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1922, Makerere University is one of the oldest
and most famous universities on the Africandations continent. It
used to enjoy close relations with the University of London when
Uganda was under British rule.
</P>
<P>
With nine faculties, four schools and six institutes, the
institution of higher learning has 3,300 posts for academic,
administrative and support staff and some 20,000 registered
students.
</P>
<P>
It has exchange programs with many famous universities around
the globe and takes students from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
It has also been a cradle from which many famous people step
onto their respective ways to success. Former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere and the country's current President Benjamin
William Mkapa are both graduates of this university.

<HEADLINE> 1stld: Iraq Leadership Calls for National Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- As the hope for a speedy lifting
of U.N. sanctions diminishes, Iraqi leadership said Thursday it
will hold a national debate soon to discuss the critical situation
facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at Thursday's joint meeting of Iraq's
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party, which was
chaired by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting condemned the United
States for its "arbitrary and aggressive" position that prevented
the United Nations Security Council from taking a "just and fair"
position on Iraq's nuclear file.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the national debate would be "discussing the
position and measures that should be taken to protect the supreme
interests of our people, and the security and sovereignty of the
homeland."
</P>
<P>
It added the Iraqi leadership would urge its people to support
its decision "which will result from the subsequent circumstances
and discussions."
</P>
<P>
This call was believed to be a threat that the Iraqi leadership
might return to the collision course with the U.N. over the
prolonged inspection mission on its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting was convened after the U.N. Security Council
failed to reach an agreement Wednesday on Iraq's nuclear weapons
program after reviewing a report presented by the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and China believed that the nuclear inspection
mission in Iraq should be shifted to long-term monitoring from the
present intrusive monitoring.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. and Britain were opposed to any actions by the
Security Council to scale back the nuclear inspection at this
stage.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership's statement denounced the council's way of
dealing with its nuclear file as "a flagrant example of the
arbitrary in dealing with Iraq's legitimate issue."
</P>
<P>
It also attacked the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in
Iraq, or UNSCOM, for working for the U.S. benefit by deliberately
prolonging its inspection as well as the crippling U.N. sanctions
imposed since Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the U.N. sanctions hinges on the UNSCOM's report
on its inspection mission in Iraq which is to be presented to the
Security Council in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the UNSCOM was in fact fully aware that all
the requirements on disarmament had been fully fulfilled by Iraq
several years ago because all the weapons, factories and
equipments were already destroyed.
</P>
<P>
On the scheduled visit to Iraq by UNSCOM Chairman Richard
Butler on August 3, it warned him against continuing his "well
known methods of manoevering, misleading, arousing marginal issues
and prolonging its work indefinitely for the benefit of the
American criminal scheme."

MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A draft law banning all Nazi
symbols, literature and videos was approved by the Russian
government on Thursday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the banning law, Russian Justice Minister Pavel
Krasheninnikov stressed that the law will come up with explicit
regulations in that field, "and it will be a ban on the symbols of
the Italian national-working party and the German
national-socialist party."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the ban will spread to video and audio
production, except for the cases when those symbols are used in
films and literature advocating humanitarian ideas and denouncing
fascism.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the draft law was hailed by Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, who noted that the law must be introduced in the
State Duma as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass cited Kiriyenko as reporting that most of the
deputies support the project, and that such a bill is the most
civilized way of fighting fascism and neo-fascism in Russia.

JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President Festus
Mogae arrived in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia Thursday for a
three-day state visit to the country.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians See Hope for Early Israeli Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian diplomat said
here Thursday that Israeli opposition's latest victory in a
parliamentary vote on early elections might give a chance to the
stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Sobeih, Palestinian chief delegate to the Arab League,
told reporters that this move has demonstrated that the Israeli
government is lacking credibility among the Israeli public due to
its anti-peace approach.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition parties Wednesday won the preliminary
approval of a bill calling for dissolution of the Knesset
(Parliament) and early elections, a move seen as a blow to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But for before becoming a law, the bill should go through three
more parliamentary votes that many expected it to fail to pass. A
majority of 61 votes in the 120-seat Knesset will be needed to
pass such a bill.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said the voting results reflected a division among
Israelis as to where the incumbent government is taking them
because Netanyahu's intransigent policies threaten to return the
region to the cycle of tensions and violence.
</P>
<P>
"A large percentage of the Israeli people want peace and need
the support of several parties, especially the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that Israel withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for more efforts
by the Palestinian side to crack down on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinians have accepted the proposal, Netanyahu
has refused to do so citing security concerns. The direct talks
that were resumed on July 19 quickly broke down due to the Israeli
intransigence.

<HEADLINE> EU Finances Creation of 33 Energy Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
on Thursday that it is funding the creation and first three years
of operation of 33 energy agencies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
These energy agencies, 16 regional and 17 urban ones, will each
benefit from an EU funding of 150,000 ECU (165,000 U.S. dollars),
totalling 4.95 million ECU (5.44 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new additions will bring the total of European
Commission-financed energy agencies to 173.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the regional and urban energy agency
management is to define and implement a series of activities aimed
at improving demand management by promoting energy efficiency and
at ensuring better use of local and renewable resources while
facilitating growing awareness among local policy-makers of the
impact of energy on those other policies for which they are
responsible.
</P>
<P>
The energy agencies are expected to contribute to better
community integration in energy matters through a bottom-up
approach to energy problems, to boost the efforts of the regional
and local entities involved in the efforts to combat climate
change and to foster economic and social cohesion by reducing the
disparities between regions.
</P>
<P>
Of the 33 new energy agencies, one will be set up for the first
time in Norway that, along side Iceland, is a European Economic
Area country that is entitled to submit proposals and participate
on terms similar to those of the European Union member states in
EU energy programs.
</P>
<P>
The energy agencies will cooperate with one another and will
draw on the experience of the existing agencies.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes European Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Thursday welcomed a
European court ruling ordering Turkey to compensate a Greek
Cypriot woman for property deprivation.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told a press
briefing that the court decision will help find "a just, correct,
viable and workable solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Human Rights Tuesday ordered Turkey to
pay nearly 900,000 U.S. dollars in compensation to Titina Loizidou
for her properties in Kyrenia, in the north of the divided
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot who fled Kyrenia in 1974 when Turkey
landed troops there, began the legal battle in 1989 over her right
to the properties in now self-declared Turkish Cypriot state,
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Strasbourg-based court "confirms that
Turkey is an occupation force in Cyprus," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
"It is responsible for the violation of the right to property
and for depriving the right of freedom of movement, access and
enjoyment of property," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here sees the court decision as "setting a legal
precedent" that may open the way for more claims of properties
against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has rejected the decision, saying it lacks "the means of
applicability and implementation."
</P>
<P>
Some 180,000 Greek Cypriots escaped or expelled following the
Turkish intervention in 1974 in the wake of a failed coup by the
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has more than 35,000 troops in the north with the
claimed aim of protecting the Turkish ethnic minority.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Unhappy About Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian foreign minister
has voiced dissatisfaction with the foreign countries which had
meddled in the country's internal affairs, saying his government
will take measures against it.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying the countries, Jakaya Kikwete, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, said the
government has grown aware that some resident envoys "are poking
noses into the country's internal affairs," media reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, who was tabling the 1998/99 budget estimates
Wednesday for his ministry at the National Assembly in the
central city of Dodoma, said these countries have severely
violated diplomatic norms and the Tanzanian government will not
"condone the trend."
</P>
<P>
The government is considering how best to handle the
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister asserted that Tanzania would prefer
poverty in freedom to wealthiness in slavery.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete also renewed the country's commitment to regional
blocs like East African Co-operation (EAC), Kagera Basin
Organization, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and
Southern Africa Development Community.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is working closely with Kenya and Uganda, the
other two members of EAC, in defense, security,
telecommunications, road and transportation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said Tanzania will further cooperate with
other members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of
African Unity, the Group 77 and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Also on the occasion, Kikwete requested parliament to
endorse a budget of 13.06 billion Shillings (about 19.4 million
U.S. Dollars) for his ministry.

<HEADLINE> Study: Breast Cancer Deaths Reduced With High-Dose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian study has shown that a
specific high-dose chemotherapy compared to standard chemotherapy
can further reduce deaths by 19 percent in pre-menopausal women
with breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the same chemotherapy drugs can
reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 29 percent,
according to a news release issued Thursday by the Canadian Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
The findings are published in the August, 1998 issue of the
Journal of Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute of
Canada Clinical Trials Group, with funds from the Canadian Cancer
Society, and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc.
</P>
<P>
The clinical trial took place in 36 centres across Canada and
followed for at least five years all 710 participating women, who
were pre-menopausal and diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer:
cancer that has invaded the lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
In the study, 359 women were randomly assigned to the standard
chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and
fluorouracil (CMF) and 351 women received the high-dose
chemotherapy regime of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and
fluorouracil (CEF).
</P>
<P>
In the CMF group, 107 patients died compared with 85 patients
in the CEF group, and 169 patients developed recurrence of their
breast cancer compared with 132 CEF patients.
</P>
<P>
"Both relapse-free and overall survival were improved in women
who received CEF compared with CMF, with a 29 percent risk
reduction in recurrent breast cancer and a 19 percent reduction in
mortality," the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that there were more side effects such as
hair loss, nausea and a small increased risk of leukemia
associated with CEF therapy.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
congratulated Keizo Obuchi to be elected Japan's new prime
minister, and expected him to play a new role in relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have worked well and closely with Mr. Obuchi when he was
foreign minister," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
"We look forward to continuing that productive relationship in his
new role."
</P>

Commenting on Obuchi's choice of Kiichi Mayazawa, a former
prime minister, to be finance minister, Rubin said Miyazawa was a
widely respected figure in the United States. The administration
expected to continue a constructive relationship with him, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Obuchi's government would to do better with
Japan's economic problems than his predecessor, Rubin said: "We
want to judge Japan on its actions, and we want them to deal with
these challenges as soon as possible."

Japan's new government to move rapidly and effectively to reform
its recession-mired economy.
</P>

new Prime Minister Obuchi has to address is the need for "an
aggressive infusion of public funds" to resolve the banking crisis
and boost the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
"These economic imperatives remain present with the political
changes. We hope the new Japanese government will move rapidly and
effectively in each of these areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is counting on Japan to get its
financial house in order so it can help efforts to rescue other
faltering Asian economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers told reporters that Washington would remain in close
contact with the news Japanese government on the areas of
economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Strengthen Defense Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani vowed Thursday to continue efforts to strengthen its
defense capability despite the U.S. pressure over its missile
development program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a program on the state-run television, Shamkhani
said Iran's defense policy was to produce weapons according to its
needs and it would continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks came after U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday signed an executive order to impose sanctions on seven
Russian firms and institutions for providing Iran with missile
technology.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Shamkhani confirmed the test of the Shahab-3
missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers on July 22 after
U.S. intelligence reports revealed the secret.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the U.S. allegation that Russia had transferred
missile technology to Iran, Shamkhani said the Shahab-3 missile
was produced by Iranian experts who have the capability of
producing surface-to-surface, surface-to-air and other kinds of
missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister stressed that the balance of defense
capability was the only factor to maintain peace and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran could not abandon its present defense policy
as long as Israel, Iran's archrival, spares no efforts to
stockpile weapons.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Iran's policy was aimed at reducing tensions,
he voiced Tehran's readiness to expand security cooperation with
regional countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed and
four others wounded Thursday in south Lebanon by a roadside bomb,
Lebanon's Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blew up when an Israeli patrol passed by the village
of Rihan in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied area, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying that one of its units detonated the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The fresh death toll raised to nine the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon this year, during which some 23
Hezbollah guerrillas have also been killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
towns from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war against 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia in the
self-styled security zone.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel offered to withdraw from south Lebanon under
the condition that Lebanese government guarantee the security of
Israel's border areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the proposal, insisting that the
withdrawal be unconditional, as called for by the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425 approved 20 years ago.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
played down opposition allegations of serious vote counting
irregularities in last Sunday's Cambodian elections.
</P>
<P>
"Highly respected Cambodian non-governmental organizations
indicated these complaints are not widespread and should not
fundamentally alter the outcome of the election," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
have accused Cambodian Second Premier Hun Sen of stealing the
election.
</P>
<P>
"The charges of fraud and irregularities are serious
allegations. We are encouraged that the Cambodian authorities
are investigating these charges," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has proposed a three-way coalition with the opposition
leader Prince Ranariddh. But the latter, who was overthrown as
the first premier by Hun Sen last July, said his party wanted
its allegations of election fraud dealt with before considering
any coalition arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it was the responsibility of the leaders of
Cambodia's political parties to peacefully establish a new
government in accord with the election results.
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian people will best be served by a calm,
deliberate, nonviolent process in which new democratically
elected government is put in place," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia, U.S. Agree on Closer Defense Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the United States
said here Friday they would strengthen their military ties, such
as facilitating Australia's access to some U.S. technologies
important to the effectiveness of the Australian armed forces, and
intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique released here Friday by U.S. and
Australian foreign and defense ministers, both sides described
their defense cooperation under the alliance as "vibrant and
forward-looking."
</P>
<P>
"Australia also made it clear that it would continue to support
this U.S. posture (U.S. alliance ties with Japan, South Korea,
Australia and the forward deployment of the U.S. forces) in
practical ways, including through access to Australian ports and
airfields and providing areas for joint and unilateral training,
exercises, and tests of new capabilities."
</P>
<P>
The ministers, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen and their Australian
counterparts Alexander Downer and Ian McLachlan, expressed
"satisfaction with the progress being made on developing training
areas in Northern Australia to allow large-scale exercises by U.S.
ground forces."
</P>
<P>
"Ministers also agreed to simply the procedures for providing
diplomatic clearance for visiting naval vessels to reflect the
importance of ship visits to the relationship."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Friday, Australian Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan announced that his talks with U.S. foreign
and defense ministers produced a number of valuable outcomes for
the Australian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Among the outcomes is an agreement to further develop the
ability of the Australian and U.S. armed forces to operate
together, which includes steps to take advantage of the
far-reaching technology changes resulting from the information
revolution, and developing more effective planning on how
Australian and U.S. forces can operate together with this new
technology, McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to build a long-term partnership in the field
of wide-area surveillance, which involves projects such as
Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft, and Operational Radar
Network.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized on the understanding of technology-sharing in
areas of central importance to the effectiveness of the Australian
armed forces and its capacity to contribute to coalition
operations, including submarines, Airborne Early Warning and
Control, and combat aircraft capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Australia has been modernizing its armed forces during the past
two years by introducing advanced weapons and equipment in a bid
to defend its vast land and territorial water and project its
power outside Australia.
</P>
<P>
The communique said both sides agreed on the centrality of the
"knowledge edge" to the successful conduct of military operations,
saying the ministers observed the intelligence was one critical
factor in the edge and that the two countries continued to enjoy a
particularly close and productive partnership in this area.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has set up powerful intelligence collecting facilities
in Australia, including the missile tracking facilities which
helped the American troops intercept missiles launched by Iraq
during the Gulf War in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Australia also endorsed a program of cooperative
research in new capabilities for wide-area surveillance, a
proposal to establish a new committee to coordinate and promote
cooperation in equipment acquisition, technology and support, said
the communique.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Related Death Toll in Bangladesh Rises to 242 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's flood-related death
toll has risen to 242, with 44 people killed in the current flood
overnight as gushing waters from the upstream made the situation
grave in the capital of Dhaka and other central districts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Most deaths were caused by drowning and boat-capsize while
other reasons included snake-bite, house collapse and diarrhea,
the national BSS news agency Friday quoted disaster management
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Buriganga and Turag rivers are flowing much above their
danger marks around Dhaka city, and they continue to rise,
according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC).
</P>
<P>
The situation in five sub-districts of the capital and the
adjoining areas deteriorated "severely," the disaster management
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They added that 28,000 people of Dhaka were forced to take
refuge in 50 flood shelters while many others shifted to safe
places on their own.
</P>
<P>
Boats, instead of automobiles and rickshaws, took over the
streets in many low-lying areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains downpoured in Bangladesh in the past 20 days
already affecting over 17.5 million people in the 37 districts of
the total of 64.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 kilometers of roads, 1,722 kilometers of embankments
and 2,215 bridges and culverts have been damaged and about 200,00
hectares of crops washed away by the flood.
</P>
<P>
The present flood situation in the country is improving slowly,
with the situation having returned normal in 11 districts and
improved in nine districts. But the flood situation in Dhaka and
its adjoining areas as well as in Bangladesh's central districts
has turned for the worst, the FFWC said.

<HEADLINE> New Test May Reduce Breast Cancer Surgeries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new technique of telling apart
benign and cancerous lumps in the breast could save women from
unnecessary surgeries, doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
An international research, co-ordinated by the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund in the UK, has found that an equipment called the
Biofield Diagnostic System could reduce the number of biopsies
needed to diagnose breast cancer by more than half.
</P>
<P>
Developed by U.S. Biofield Corp, the non-invasive technique
measures electrical changes on the skin surface associated with
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
A study of 661 women published in The Lancet medical journal
showed it was effective in distinguishing the different types of
tumours.
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis of breast cancer usually needs physical
examination and biopsy to remove cells or tissues, which can be
time consuming and painful for women.

WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton might
hold his first meeting with Japan's new Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi this fall, the White House said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The president... would like to find an early and mutually

Clinton plans to call Obuchi in the next day or two to wish him
congratulations, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration was impressed with Obuchi's quick
start, the spokesman said. Obuchi set to work on Friday on the
country's pressing economic problems, convening his Cabinet only
hours after being elected. He vowed to plow ahead with reforms and
a stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's quite important for the new Japanese government
to expeditiously implement a reform and modernization package
along the lines that we had discussed with them," McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Insists Not to Relocate Railway Checkpoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia insisted Friday that
it will not relocate its railway checkpoint with Singapore and
said it is up to Singapore to defuse the dispute over travel
procedures.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that there will be no problems (for railway
travelers) as it is well within Singapore's means and competence
not to create problems," Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Abdul
Kadir Mohamad said at a news conference here Friday on the eve of
the deadline set by Singapore for the relocation.
</P>
<P>
Singapore set August 1 as the deadline for Malaysia to relocate
its customs, immigration and quarantine formalities for rail
passengers from the Tanjong Pagar railway station in central
Singapore to Woodlands which is closer to the border with
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Kadir said "It is up to Singapore to decide whether the trains
will flow as usual. Of course they have the rights to do all the
checks."
</P>
<P>
A six-page statement, released by kadir at the press
conference, on the dispute and how talks between the two countries
to resolve it had broken down, said the dispute could be defused
if Singapore did not to carry out its decision to relocate the
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
here Friday Malaysia and Singapore should settle their dispute
over the relocation of the checkpoint for railway passengers
without hurting the feelings of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The issue should be settled by returning to the negotiating
table, he told reporters here after opening an exhibition here,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Kills 3 in Algiers Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- In the second terror attack in two
days, a bomb blast ripped through a market in Algiers Friday
morning, leaving three dead and 23 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said that the bomb exploded in the crowded
market near Kouba, in the southern outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
After the blast, Interior Minister Mustefa Benmansour rushed to
the site accompanied by local police and officials.
</P>
<P>
Police combed the area to conduct investigation into the blast,
for which no one has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
This was the second blast in Algiers in the past two days after
a bomb blew up a bus in a suburb of the capital Thursday, killing
one passenger and wounding 13 others.
</P>
<P>
The bombings were launched at a time when a United Nations
fact-finding mission is currently in the violence-torn country to
seek ways of settling the six years of Islamic insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Over 75,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed since
1992 when Islamic militants launched terror attacks to protest the
government's cancellation of the parliamentary elections in which
an Islamic party was expected to win.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unveils New Energy Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Friday announced a
new power policy to ensure cheap electricity generation through
indigenous resources, competitive bidding and minimum tariffs.
</P>
<P>
In a departure from the past policy, based on thermal, the new
policy envisages a proactive role for the government to promote
the use of indigenous coal and hydro-electric resources in power
generation, Minister for Water and Power Raja Nadir Pervez said at
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan has 40,000 megawatt of hydel resources
which have remained untapped and coal reserves are estimated at
200 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The new policy, he said, is based on exploitation of coal and
hydel reserves and conversion on gas wherever available also form
part of the policy.
</P>
<P>
The basis for private power project will be minimum levelized
tariff through international competitive bidding, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, private power producers must implement
the project within the applicable tax laws of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The new policy provides for 90 percent First Year Allowance for
hydel power plant and power plants based on indigenous coal.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, the companies are allowed to import plant and
 equipment on payment of customs duties, sales tax, food relief
and other surcharges as well as import licence fee.
</P>
<P>
The New policy also permits power generation companies to issue
corporate bonds, both bearer and registered. These companies are
also allowed to issue shares at discounted prices to enable
venture capital to be provided at higher rates of returns and
proportionate to the risk.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks have been allowed to underwrite the issue of
shares and bonds by the private power companies.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judiciary Chief Slams U.S. Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's judiciary chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi Friday slammed the United States for imposing
sanctions on seven Russian companies alleged to have provided Iran
with missile technology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation at Tehran
University, Yazdi said the instrument of threat was an out-of-date
ploy and trick and economic sanctions would boomerang on the U.S.
proper.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided last Tuesday to bar government aid to and all
trade with seven Russian companies for their alleged transfer of
missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran conducted a successful test last Wednesday of the Shahab-3
missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers. The U.S. has voiced
concern about the test, because the missile could hit Saudi
Arabia, Israel or its forces stationed in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Iran has stressed that its missiles are only for defense
purpose and that the test was carried out by Iranian experts
"without any assistance from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said that Washington made hue and cry over the missile
test in a bid to compensate for a political humiliation, referring
to a snub by Iran to an American overture last month for a
rapprochement between the two rivals.
</P>
<P>
He said the medium-ranged missile is a strategic weapon to
guarantee the defense of Iran against any possible threat, adding
that it is definitely not meant to threaten any country.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of holding double standards by showing
indifference toward Israel's weapons of mass destruction. He noted
that Washington is not even willing to make any reference to such
a looming and impending threat of Israel to the world, and the
region in particular.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy Pauses for Second Month in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy paused for a
second consecutive month in May, edging down 0.2 percent from
April, Statistics Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in over two years that the economy has
failed to grow for two consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness in May fairly widespread, with the most significant
declines occurring in the finance, manufacturing, mining,
construction and transportation services industries," the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The real estate industry advanced, while retailers and
wholesalers had a flat month, it added.
</P>
<P>
Canada's economy began to slow in late 1997 after putting in a
solid performance since the middle of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In May, the finance industries, which comprise banks, credit
unions and other financial institutions, fell 1.7 percent as
volume of share trade fell substantially.
</P>
<P>
Total manufacturing output dropped 0.3 percent in May, after a
0.9-percent slip in April.
</P>
<P>
Declines were recorded in 13 of 22 major industry groups,
accounting for about 60 percent of total manufacturing production,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Activity in the mining sector fell 1.4 percent in May, the
fourth decline in five months.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, construction fell 0.8 percent, and the
transportation, pipeline and storage industry declined 1.0 percent
in the month.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale sales decreased 1.0 percent, while real estate
services industry advanced 0.3 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Diplomatic Expulsion Row Still Plagues Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said here Friday that it
has discussed the issue with Russia on whether or not to allow an
expelled Russian diplomat to return to Seoul, which is apparently
different from an earlier statement.
</P>
<P>
During meetings between the foreign ministers of South Korea
and Russia in Manila, the Philippines, earlier this week, South
Korea agreed to consider the issue of allowing the expelled
diplomat to re-enter Seoul on humanitarian reasons, said Sun
Joun-yung, deputy minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Sun's remarks are completely different from the announcement
made by a spokesman of the ministry Wednesday that South Korean
Foreign Minister Park Chung-soo and his Russian counterpart
Yevgeny Primakov did not discuss the issue when they met in Manila
during an ASEAN Regional Forum conference.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been pressing South Korea to allow expelled Oleg
Abramkin, councillor of the Russian Embassy to return to Seoul.
South Korea claimed Abramkin as a "persona non grata" and ordered
him to leave Seoul on July 8, in retaliation for Russia's
deportation of Cho Sung-woo, a councillor of the South Korean
Embassy in Moscow, on spy charges on July 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, South Korea said it will reduce its diplomat number
in Russia by calling back five more diplomats under the demand of
the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"Seoul will be able to settle the diplomatic issue with Russia
if it allows Abramkin to return to the Russian Embassy in Seoul,"
Valery Suhinin, minister-counsellor of the Russian Embassy in
Seoul, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Park denied media reports that South Korea has
agreed to permit the return of the Russian diplomat to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Park made the denial after Primakov said South Korea had agreed
to allow Abramkin to return to the Russian Embassy in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, Park and Primakov reportedly met two times to seek a
quick solution to the diplomatic row, that has soured their good
bilateral relations, which the two nations have enjoyed since the
establishment of diplomatic ties in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Minister Park told Primakov he would consider allowing
Abramkin to return to Seoul for a temporary visit," said Cho
IL-whan, director general for European affairs of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, who was accompanying Park in Manila
during the ASEAN Regional Forum conference.
</P>
<P>
The director general also said when Park promised to consider
Abramkin's return, Primakov said such permission would make it
possible for Russia to allow more South Korean intelligence
officers with diplomatic status to be stationed in Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, after his meeting with Park Tuesday, Primakov said
Abramkin will go back to Seoul and stay there until his
replacement arrives in September this year, while Cho will not be
allowed to return to Moscow since "he was caught red-handed."
</P>
<P>
No clear explanation could prove why the two foreign ministers
made contradictory remarks on the alleged reinstatement of the
expelled Russian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it was inferred that Primakov was
either "telling a lie or disclosing a secret agreement" with his
South Korean counterpart on Abramkin's reinstatement, some people
said.
</P>
<P>
Media reports, which alleged that the two ministers have
already reached a secret agreement on Abramkin's return, said Park
must be held responsible for what is seen as a heavy blow to the
face of South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
South Korean opposition Grand National Party has accused the
Kim Dae-jung government of engaging in humiliating diplomacy,
which required Park to resign as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Informed government officials said the expelled Russian
diplomat could be allowed to return to Seoul under the status of a
Russian citizen, not a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
However, media reports said the return of the expelled foreign
diplomat, regardless of what status he will have, would hurt the
nation's pride by reversing the decision it made earlier as a
sovereign state.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Leaders Call for Cooperation in Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Asian countries Friday
agreed to strengthen their cooperation in meeting the challenges
and opportunities resulting from the world's fast changing
economic environment, as manifested by globalization and the
financial turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven-member South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), at their summit which ended here
Friday, discussed the impact of the current global economic
developments on the economies of Southeast Asian countries and
other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration adopted at the end of their three-day summit,
the leaders expressed serious concern over the severe distortions
produced by unrestrained globalization, as has been evidenced in
the downturn of the economies of several Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil flared up in Southeast Asia last July,
causing stock markets to plunge and regional currencies to devalue
sharply. Many economies in the region have contracted considerably
as a result of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
South Asia, one of the poorest regions in the world, has been
less affected by the financial and economic crisis in Southeast
Asia, but its leaders are showing no less concern at it.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said last week
ahead of the summit that the crisis is happening so close to South
Asia that "it is a natural concern for all of us."
</P>
<P>
He said South Asian leaders would discuss the region's
"collective response towards global economic changes."
</P>
<P>
"The challenges and opportunities inherent in these fast
evolving developments," the Colombo Declaration said, "could best
be met and the full potential of South Asia realized through
effective, practical, regional and bilateral cooperation among
member states."
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the beneficial effects of globalization, the
leaders stressed that these crises are becoming unpredictable with
increased globalization, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern about the shortcomings of the existing
international monetary and financial system, and "its tardiness in
anticipating impending financial market crises sufficiently in
advance, so that pre-emptive remedial action be adopted," it said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the problem would not be confined to Asia or
emerging economies, and that it can have global ramifications
unless more fundamental reforms are put in place.
</P>
<P>
They said that the individual financial systems of SAARC member
countries must be strengthened through enhancing institutional
capacity, surveillance mechanisms as well as through closer
consultations and coordination with regard to macro-economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed on the need for strengthened cooperation
among SAARC member countries to "identify, analyze and effectively
contend with the complex multi-faceted challenges inherent in the
global economic environment" that has been changing so radically
in the 1990s, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said they would sign a convention on combating the
crime against women and children in the region at their next
gathering in Kathmandu, Nepal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that they welcome the finalization of the
draft text on the Regional Convention on Combating the Crime of
Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The leaders at their Colombo summit also decided that the
convention be broadened to cover other purposes of trafficking in
women and children other than prostitution, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
They also called for exploring the feasibility of establishing
a regional fund for rehabilitation of the victims of trafficking
in women and children on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided to establish a South Asian Cultural Unity
to promote the distinctive arts of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was based on the rich, complex and varied
plurality of cultural and religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pointed out that the SAARC process could draw more
deeply from the vitality and strength of South Asia's shared
cultural heritage as a source influencing and enhancing creative
energies in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that their countries continue to face the
serious threat of terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated their firm commitment to combat these
activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders recalled the adoption of the 1996 U.N. Declaration
on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism and urged all
member states to work towards its implementation.
</P>
<P>
They also called for international action to prevent the abuse
of refugee conventions and to halt activities which help
terrorist groups to collect funds for their activities in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pointed out that two SAARC conferences on
cooperation in police matters had been held since 1996. The first
conference was held in Sri Lanka in July, 1996. The second was
held last year in the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
They called for the continued sharing of expertise with regard
to the different areas of police investigation, and investigation
of organized crimes and drug related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated their commitment to the eradication of
poverty in the region as early as possible, preferably by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the need to encourage maximum participation by
target groups in the formulation and implementation of poverty
eradication programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also pointed out that Human Resource Development
was a key element in any poverty eradication program.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly they agreed that once the SAARC Center for Human
Resources Development was established in Islamabad it could look
into the possibility of its contributing to the strengthening of
the human
resources development components of the regional poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided that discriminatory practices and
non-tariff barriers should be simultaneously removed on items in
respect of which tariff concessions are granted or have been
granted earlier.
</P>
<P>
Measures to remove structural impediments should also be taken
in order to move speedily towards the goal of the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) which was agreed at the last summit in Male to
be established by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) in December 1995 marking its first step towards the
creating of SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated the importance of achieving SAFTA and
towards achieving this, they decided to draft a comprehensive
treaty regime for creating a free trade area which will
incorporate binding time frames for freeing trade, measures to
facilitate trade and provisions to ensure equitable distribution
of benefits of trade to all states.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of finalizing the text or
regulatory framework by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the benefits of economic liberalization would
be more extensive through the promotion of trade creating joint
ventures, investment and trade in services such as tourism.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven member SAARC met in Colombo on July 29
to 31.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital's Blood Donation Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Beijing Municipal People's Congress passed a Voluntary Blood
Donation Regulation today, which will take effect on October 1.
</P>
<P>
It will replace the city's blood donation regulations that
demand blood donations from healthy residents of a certain age and
is based on a national law, passed by the National People's
Congress Standing Committee in 1997, on voluntary blood donations.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 180,000 people in the Chinese capital donated blood,
compared with 130,000 in 1992, but these donations only cover half
of the city's yearly demand of 60 tons. The rest is covered by
bringing blood from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The new rules institute a voluntary blood donation system and
say that the municipal and county governments should issue annual
donation quotas and the city government will give awards to anyone
who donates a total of 2,000 ml or more, and any unit that donates
20 percent more than the quota for five successive years.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, units that fail to live up to the quota will
be officially reprimanded by the city government.
</P>
<P>
And illegal sales of blood will mean forfeiture of any income
from the illicit trade and a fine of 100,000 yuan or more.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Faction Leaders Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The main faction leaders in
north Mogadishu, in their first face-to-face meeting, have
finally concluded a five-point deal over the long-awaited
formation of an administration in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended Thursday night was held between Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and his main rival within his faction, Dr Hussein Hsjji
Bod, with the attendance of south Mogadishu's main faction
leaders including Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the
two sides had agreed upon the settlement of the difficulties
created by the different kinds of money circulating in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu people use the money known as Bal-yar printed
in 1992 during the civil war, while Bal-Weyn is used in the
South of the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, the two kinds of money are inter-changeable as money
dealers transfer them to benefit from their exchange rates as
they do to the hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed to jointly name a technical
committee with the knowledge of law administration for the
completion of the regional laws.
</P>
<P>
The accord between Mahdi and Bod also includes the
establishment of Mogadishu's administration and the opening of
the airport and sea ports which remained out of use since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another item also agreed upon is the reimposition of the
Islamic Sharia Law under the leadership of knowledgeable Moslem
scholars.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a total success as it has brought about the
full collaboration of Mahdi and Bod over decision making for the
North Mogadishu faction, the technical and mediatory group from
both sides said.
</P>
<P>
However, even though many people have applauded the pact,
there are still hundreds of people who characterized it as just a
political joke.
</P>
<P>
One politician who asked to remain anonymous, noted that it is
impossible to settle the money difficulties until a government of
national unity is formed to unify the currency by collecting one
kind of money without damaging the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, many people have noticed that the joint nomination of
a new technical committee is significant for the completion of
Mogadishu's administration, as everything should be restarted
again from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
As the politicians keep arguing over the formation of an
administration for the capital, the banditry activities and
lawlessness are increasing day by day, despite the formation of
an independent security force in several pockets of the capital
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a 100-strong security force had been agreed
upon by Mogadishu's business community in collaboration with the
gigantic telecommunications companies for the main Bakara market
and its surrounding areas.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing S. African Minister Mum on Sacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing South African
Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela remained mum Friday
about his dismissal from the cabinet, South African Press
Association SAPA reported.
</P>
<P>
"The minister is today (Friday) still not commenting on the
matter until he discusses it with the president (Nelson
Mandela)... We are not sure when this meeting will take place,"
Mzimela's spokesman Bert Slabbert said.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela tendered his resignation in writing to Mandela
Wednesday after Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi blocked a desperate last-minute bid by the outgoing
minister to retain his cabinet post until the end of the current
parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Mzimela, an IFP member, follows his
repeated clashes with his party over his calls for unity between
the IFP and the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
Mzimela first suggested an IFP-ANC merger at the end of last
year. In January the IFP's national council adopted a formal vote
of no confidence in Mzimela and earlier this month the party
removed him as its national deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear whether MzimelapwHUX5%\
 IFP
member.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition parties welcomed the departure of Mzimela,
saying the controversial minister had failed to deliver on key
elements of prison management or to build the facilities needed
to house the growing prison population.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP) and the Democratic Party (DP)
criticized Mzimela for two mass releases of prisoners this year,
first of juveniles and second, earlier this month, the release of
9,000 prisoners to mark Mandela's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The more recent release has allegedly resulted in three
murders, a number of robberies and rapes.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front (FF) also slashed at Mzimela, saying he was
obsessed with affirmative action and consequently gave rise to
corruption and mismanagement in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ben Skosana, IFP caucus chairman and its chief foreign affairs
spokesman, has been appointed as the new Correctional Services
Minister. The appointment will take effect as soon as the
formalities have been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Skosana was IFP representative in the United Kingdom from 1987
to 1994, when he became a member of parliament. He has been a
member of the IFP central committee since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Urges U.S. to Publicize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat Friday urged the United States to publicize its peace
initiative on a long overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio, Erekat once
again accused Israel of failing to put forward new ideas in the
recent talks on the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that the U.S. administration goes public with
its initiative," he told the radio.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and Israel resumed first high-level talks in months on July 19 to
discuss the withdrawal, but the talks quickly hit a snag due to
Israel's refusal to accept the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly called on Israel to withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for PNA's
tougher crackdown on Islamic militants. The PNA has accepted the
proposal, but Israel is balking at it citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. first proposed its peace plan, the Palestinians
have been urging Washington to make public the plan so to put
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is also the PNA minister of local government, said
the Palestinians and Israel would continue talks next week on the
long-delayed Israeli troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian leadership will meet after the return of (PNA)
President (Yasser) Arafat from abroad in order to determine
whether it is viable or not to continue these talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is visiting Turkey to seek support for the Palestinian
stand on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> S. African Game Park to Control Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's largest
nature reserve, the Kruger National Park, will adopt new measures
to deal with problems caused by growing elephant population, a
park official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The park would be divided into six regions, each having its
own priorities, so that the elephant population growth in
different areas would be monitored and controlled, the park's
conservation development manager Leo Braack said.
</P>
<P>
The extreme north and the southwestern regions of the
century-old park would become botanical reserves where particular
attention would be given to the conservation of the unique
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 80 percent of the park will be divided into four
zones, two high elephant impact zones and two low elephant impact
zones.
</P>
<P>
In the high impact zones, elephants would be left to multiply
and consume vegetation without interference.
</P>
<P>
In the low impact zones, the elephant population would be
reduced annually by seven percent by relocating and culling
so-called problem animals.
</P>
<P>
Braack said the park reserves the right to using lethal
methods as the park has to ensure its wide bio-diversity is
conserved.
</P>
<P>
The Kruger park covers more than 19,000 square kilometers
along the country's northwestern border with Mozambique. It is
South Africa's biggest eco-tourism attraction with more than
800,000 visitors coming each year.

<HEADLINE> Treaty on Combating Crime Against Women to Be Signed at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders, ending their
summit here on Friday, said they would sign a convention on
combating the crime against women and children in the region at
their next gathering in Kathmandu, Nepal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the seven-member South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) said in a declaration that they
welcome the finalization of the draft text on the Regional
Convention on Combating the Crime of Trafficking in Women and
Children for Prostitution.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the convention is to be signed at the 11th
SAARC summit next year.
</P>
<P>
At their Male summit last year, the South Asian leaders
expressed serious concern at the trafficking of women and children
within and between member countries, and pledged to coordinate
efforts of the member states to take effective measures to address
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The leaders at their Colombo summit also decided that the
convention be broadened to cover other purposes of trafficking in
women and children other than prostitution, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
They also called for exploring the feasibility of establishing
a regional fund for rehabilitation of the victims of trafficking
in women and children on a voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The leaders in their Colombo Declaration noted that many groups
of women and girl children in South Asia remain in disadvantaged
positions and lack equal opportunities for economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided to establish a South Asian Cultural Unity
to promote the distinctive arts of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was based on the rich, complex and varied
plurality of cultural and religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pointed out that the SAARC process could draw more
deeply from the vitality and strength of South Asia's shared
cultural heritage as a source influencing and enhancing creative
energies in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that their countries continue to face the
serious threat of terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated their firm commitment to combat these
activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders recalled the adoption of the 1996 U.N. Declaration
on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism and urged all
member states to work towards its implementation.
</P>
<P>
They also called for international action to prevent the abuse
of refugee conventions and to halt activities which help
terrorist groups to collect funds for their activities in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pointed out that two SAARC conferences on
cooperation in police matters had been held since 1996. The first
conference was held in Sri Lanka in July, 1996. The second was
held last year in the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
They called for the continued sharing of expertise with regard
to the different areas of police investigation, and investigation
of organized crimes and drug related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated their commitment to the eradication of
poverty in the region as early as possible, preferably by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the need to encourage maximum participation by
target
groups in the formulation and implementation of poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also pointed out that Human Resource Development
was a key
element in any poverty eradication program.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly they agreed that once the SAARC Center for Human
Resources Development was established in Islamabad it could look
into the
possibility of its contributing to the strengthening of the human
resources development components of the regional poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided that discriminatory practices and
non-tariff barriers should be simultaneously removed on items in
respect of which tariff concessions are granted or have been
granted earlier.
</P>
<P>
Measures to remove structural impediments should also be taken
in order to move speedily towards the goal of the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) which was agreed at the last summit in Male to
be established by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) in December 1995 marking its first step towards the
creating of SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated the importance of achieving SAFTA and
towards achieving this, they decided to draft a comprehensive
treaty regime for creating a free trade area which will
incorporate binding time frames for freeing trade, measures to
facilitate trade and provisions to ensure equitable distribution
of benefits of trade to all states.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of finalizing the text or
regulatory framework by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the benefits of economic liberalization would
be more extensive through the promotion of trade creating joint
ventures, investment and trade in services such as tourism.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven member SAARC met in Colombo on July 29
to 31.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with Richard Butler, executive chairman of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) today, said that China, as a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has
closely followed the Iraqi weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China is ready to play its role with other
Security Council members for a comprehensive implementation of the
UN Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
China and the international community have made a great effort
to find a peaceful solution in the weapons inspection crisis in
Iraq, Qian said, and that China has always held that Iraq should
follow the UN Security Council resolutions completely and fulfill
its obligation to destroy the weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The international community should assess Iraq's efforts at
implementing the resolutions fairly and in an objective way, he
said, and reach a factual conclusion on progress in the weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
China is in favor of a gradual easing of economic sanctions on
Iraq and finally lifting them, depending on how Iraq implements
the resolutions, Qian said, pointing out that the UN Special
Commission has made progress in its weapons inspection in its 7
years of existence.

<HEADLINE> New Japanese PM Vows to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- New Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi vowed Friday to bring together "every possible force" to
rebuild Japan's troubled banking system and revitalize the ailing
economy.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, speaking at his first press conference since the
formation of his cabinet Thursday, said he has formed the "best
cabinet" for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Top priority for the new cabinet is to lead Japan out of the
prolonged economic stagnation, Obuchi said. He added that he was
confident the cabinet was capable of accomplishing the task.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister hopes more business persons and journalists
will help assist the cabinet in its efforts to overcome the
current economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi planned next week to launch a new economic advisory
panel that could draw up proposals quickly in order to help the
cabinet get through the current recession.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also pledged a cut of six trillion yen (about 41.8
billion U.S. dollars) in permanent income and corporate taxes, and
to implement a 10 trillion yen (about 69.6 billion dollars)
additional supplementary budget for fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of bonds is under consideration to finance the new
measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Given the emergency need for the measures, the 1997 Fiscal
Structural Reform Law may have to be frozen, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By making every possible measure comprehensive, I hope the
economy will pick up and the (recovery) pace will double within a
year or two," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also said his government and the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) will seek cooperation from opposition
parties on an issue-by-issue basis to pass economy-related
legislation through the opposition-dominated House of Councillors,
the upper house.
</P>
<P>
The new Japanese leader rejected the opposition's demand to
dissolve the House of Representatives, the lower house, and to
hold a general election after the LDP's major setback in the July
12 upper house election.
</P>
<P>
If the lower house is dissolved for the election, it will
create a political vacuum for two or three months, Obuchi said,
adding that no time should be wasted in preventing a further
deterioration of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Women Demand Peaceful Resolution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
Ethiopian women went on streets Friday and held a mass rally at
Masqual Square at central Addis Ababa, strongly demanding a
peaceful resolution to the Ethio-Eritrean crisis.
</P>
<P>
They want to urge the consolidation of efforts being deployed
to end the conflict peacefully, said Taddelech Hailemichael, Head
of Women's Affairs in the Ethiopian Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, Hailemichael said the Ethiopian women
stand for peace and condemn attacks on innocent and defenseless
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful citizens, children and women should never be
targets in the war, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Hailemichael said the recent conflict "has not only disrupted
peace and development efforts," but "also placed an undue burden
on the civilian population and in particular women and children."
</P>
<P>
"During the first bombing raid, four pregnant women in labor
have lost their lives, 200,000 people have been displaced of
which three quarters are women and children," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"At the bombing in Mekele," she continued, "24 children under
the age of 18 died and 64 others were injured."
</P>
<P>
Friday's nationwide demonstration of women in Ethiopia was
organized by the newly-established National Steering Committee
for Women and Peace with aims to continue to seek peaceful
resolution to the crisis and solidarity with Eritrean women in
their support for peaceful resolution to the Ethio-Eritrean
border conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea, former Horn of Africa allies, fought a
bloody ground and air war between May and June 11 over the
disputed border territory of Badme and Sheraro.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has resisted a clause in a peace plan sponsored by the
U.S. and Rwanda, endorsed by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) to withdraw to territory it held before the conflict began
on May 6, and calls for international arbitration to settle the
border dispute with Addis.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the steering committee said that the
women in both Ethiopia and Eritrea should view the conflict as a
direct threat to their ability to live, work and ensure the
survival of their children.
</P>
<P>
"They have lost children, spouses, brothers and sons. If the
current conflict continues, their suffering will have been in
vain," the release added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the committee called upon the women in Ethiopia and
throughout the world to participate in the demonstration for a
peaceful resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"At this historic juncture, women should focus their energies
on the future," the committee stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OAU and African leaders will hold a
consultative meeting on the Ethio-Eritrean border crisis on
August 1-2 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

a greater effort to build a society of law in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
And, a greater effort should be made to increase public
awareness of the law among farmers and to get local officials and
law-enforcement departments to work in conformity with the law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jiang took a close look at the embankments of

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urged to Attend Genetics Conference in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A group of Canadian geneticists are
urging their colleagues to attend a major genetics conference in
China next month, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 18th International Genetics Congress will begin in Beijing
on August 10. Some countries' scientists are boycotting the
congress because of their disapproval of China's three-year-old
genetics law.
</P>
<P>
Canadian geneticists, however, insist that communication goes
further than a boycott in fostering change, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The law seems to have things about it we dislike, but we
weren't so smart ourselves not so long ago, and the situation
there is quite different, so we shouldn't be so judgmental," said
Dr. Clarke Fraser, chairman of ethics and public policy for the
Canadian College of Medical Geneticists and Biology at McGill
University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the forced sterilization of some people
declared mentally insane during this century, which occurred in
some Western countries, including Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral obligation to share our historical experiences
with social policies," said Dr. Patrick MacLeod, chairman of the
Canadian College of Physicians and Surgeons Liaison Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We should be talking, not walking away from the issue," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Genetic associations in Britain, the Netherlands and Argentina
have sent official notice that they will boycott the gathering,
and they are encouraging other associations to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in other countries, including the United States,
have not taken an official stand, according to the Canadian
newspaper.

Yangon, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's foreign exchange reserves
totaled 272 million U.S. dollars at the end of September 1997,
decreasing by 96 million dollars as compared with that at the end
of March of the previous year, according to a latest official
review of the country's financial, economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Of the total reserves of 272 million dollars, 77.78 million

<P>
The reserves also showed the lowest record in seven years since
March 1990 when it registered as 586 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Stops Nationwide Finance, Tax Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China will stop its nationwide
inspections of financial affairs, taxation and commodities prices
beginning this year, according to the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
As the socialist market economy expands, a daily monitoring
network consisting of financial, taxation, auditing and other
social auditing organizations has been formed, standardizing daily
supervision.
</P>
<P>
This also makes it possible to stop nationwide inspections, a
ministry official explained.
</P>
<P>
Halting nationwide shock inspections does not suggest any
weakening or stopping of financial supervision, said the
official. "This meets the demand for improving the daily
supervisory network and increasing government's monitoring
functions to achieve the goal of tightening financial and economic
supervision with fewer repeated inspections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inspection campaign, which has been practiced
annually across the country since 1985, was a special economic
supervisory tool used to ameliorate the financial chaos which
occurred in the early years of China's economic reform when the
old financial and taxation system was undergoing reform, and new
management mechanisms were yet to be established.
</P>
<P>
The past 13 years of nationwide inspections has saved
China 130 billion yuan in potential losses.

<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China exported 3.7 billion
U.S. dollars worth of leather products in the first five months
this year, according to today's International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
This volume was a 6.4 percent growth over the same period last
year, when the nation's gross exports increased 8.2 percent during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The nation's exports of footballs, volleyballs and basketballs
saw a year-on-year growth of 17.3 percent in terms of export
volume, highest among all its leather products, but exports of
leather-shoe parts and similar products declined.
</P>
<P>
However, the average unit price of the sports balls was 0.18
dollars lower than a year ago, as was that of leather shoes, while
leather clothing and scarfs were sold well overseas.
</P>
<P>
Importing 35.9 percent more products from the mainland than

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister on New Guidelines Set for PLA Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian today
urged the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to keep pace with modern
military development trends and national reform, earnestly
implement the principles of military strategy in the new period,
and effectively increase defensive hi-tech combat capabilities.
</P>
<P>
General Chi, who is also member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Commission, and state councillor, made the
remarks during the reception marking the PLA's 71st founding
anniversary today.
</P>
<P>
He said the army should achieve the target by accelerating
institutional and organizational restructuring and reform.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the whole army should proceed in accordance with the
principles of "downsizing, strengthening capabilities and
improving efficiency."
</P>
<P>
The PLA should work hard to further optimize its structure and
organization, while at the same time realigning relationships in
order to transform itself into an elite force well-versed in
advanced military theory, he noted. The PLA should strive to
attain an appropriate staffing level, reasonable structure and
efficient organization capable of providing effective logistical
support for highly trained and well-equipped officers and men with
a strict sense of discipline.
</P>
<P>
Chi underlined that the PLA units should attatch importance to
quality army-building, persevere in using science and technology
to achieve high-quality modernization and enhance military
capabilities. Moreover, he said, the army should pay great
attention to educating and training talented people and further
expand the program to greater expertise in high technology.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is a staunch force for the maintenance of
regional and world peace, he said: "Its development is an
important contribution to human progress. We have resolutely and
continuously followed an independent foreign policy of peace, and
have all along pursued a defensive defense policy.

Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. We have been active in
keeping contacts and cooperation with the armed forces of various
countries in the world and made unremitting efforts in promoting
world peace and development."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, to resolve the Taiwan question and
accomplish national reunification are the common aspirations of
the people of all ethnic groups in China, including the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The PLA will continue to unswervingly adhere to the basic
guidelines of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems", and make its due contribution to promoting the great
cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland, Chi said.

Chi offered the following retrospect of military modernization
over the past year. He said the overall progress has been achieved
in revolutionizing, modernizing and standardizing the PLA under
the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military
Commission with Jiang Zemin at the core, upholding the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and firmly implementing the general
requirements for "attaining political qualifications and military
competence based on diligent work ethics, strict disciplines and

<HEADLINE> More Asian Banks Face Insolvency as Economies Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The banking systems in the
troubled economies of Asia face insolvency as the countries' real
economies shrink in the aftermath of last year's financial crisis,
an international rating agency warned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a comprehensive review entitled the Outlook for Asian
Banking, Fitch IBCA said non-performing loans (NPLs) are growing
so rapidly that banks in the hardest hit economies are reporting
losses on such a scale that they will become insolvent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the countries' governments, the international
relief agencies and the world's capital markets will have to
provide in excess of 100 billion U.S. dollars to recapitalize
their banking systems, said the agency which is formed from the
merger in 1997 of Fitch Investors Service, L.P. of the United
States and Europe's IBCA Group.
</P>
<P>
David Marshall, managing director of financial institution,
Asia for Fitch IBCA, said, "We are now in the middle of the
economic recessions that have followed last year's financial
crisis in Asia. This is causing the banking systems of the most
vulnerable economies to collapse under the weight of
non-performing loans."
</P>
<P>
"Governments are being forced to step in to rescue them," he
told a press conference here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The economic cost of the banking crises could be very
high. Indonesia faces an economic cost equivalent to 35 percent of
its GDP to recapitalize its banking system. In Thailand and
South Korea the cost could be between 25 percent and 30 percent
of their respective GDP.
</P>
<P>
The analyst pointed out, however, Hong Kong and Singapore have
both benefited from a high degree of government supervision and
prudent management of their banking systems.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA expected NPLs in Hong Kong to remain below 10
percent of total lending by banks, a level that at worst will
result in a reduction in earnings. Singapore's banks should
tolerate a similar level of NPLs without announcing losses.

<HEADLINE> State Bank Promises Six Billion Yuan More in Railway Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank (SDB)
has decided to grant more loans to railways by six billion
yuan this year, pushing the annual credit line for railways up to
22.27 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The SDB raised the loan quota for railways construction mainly
to echo the national call to increase support for the
infrastructure sector and thereby stimulate the economy, according
to SDB officials.
</P>
<P>
The increased loans will be used to meet the capital shortfalls
in railway construction involving some key railways projects such
as the Baocheng (Baoji-Chengdu) Double Track Railway, Nankun
(Nanning-Kunming) Railway, and Neikun Railway (Neijiang-Kunming).
</P>
<P>
The SDB has also utilized several ways to facilitate
project-appraisal work in order to ensure timely loans for key
projects. By the end of July, the bank had finished evaluating
nine railway projects and promised loans worth 24.58 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a policy-oriented bank supporting the infrastructure sector
and basic industries, the SDB has set its annual credit line at
122.8 billion yuan, up 11.6 percent from 1997.

<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists suggested here
today that China should draw further lessons from the Asian
financial crisis and take counter-measures.
</P>
<P>
Established scholars from the prestigious Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences and other institutes pointed out at a forum that
these lessons relate to such issues as raising loans, dealing with
international capital, the export-oriented economy, and privatization
and liberalization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the government further tighten control
over the banking system, increase macro-control of the economy,
and focus on the quality instead of mere the quantity of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Their views are specified in a report titled "Asian Financial
Crisis: the Latest Analysis and Counter-measures", which has been
published by the Social Sciences Documentation Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
This book is one of the most systematic and profound on the
Asian financial crisis which began in July last year and is

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday accused an American
working on the U.N. arms inspection team of spying against Iraq
during visits to suspected weapon sites.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency said Baghdad strongly protested
against the conduct of espionage under the cover of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which is in charge of overseeing
the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate
official as saying the American, Jason Gilbert, was caught
red-handed taking picture of subjects unrelated to his inspection
mission.
</P>
<P>
The source said that on July 28, while a group of
U.N. inspectors were on a diving mission in the Tigris riverside,
Gilbert, who supervised the operation, stealthily took a picture
of a passing train carrying military equipment, from behind a
large U.N. vehicle, using his own camera.
</P>
<P>
The source said the Iraqi escorts were witnesses to the
incident. Gilbert was asked to expose the film, a request he
immediately complied with.
</P>
<P>
The official called for an end to such espionage and
intelligence acts, and acts that have nothing to do with the work
of inspection, INA said.

<HEADLINE> Two Taiwan Compatriots Kidnapped in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The public security department of
northeast China's Liaoning Province is now investigating the case
of two Taiwan compatriots who were kidnapped in Liaoning's
Haicheng city on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Wei Tein-kang, a Taiwan businessman who was kidnapped while on
a business trip in Liaoning, managed to escape and reported to the
local police after being held for two days.
</P>
<P>
Acting on information provided by Wei, the police conducted a
search and investigation and discovered that Lin Ti-chuan, the
other kidnapped Taiwanese, was dead in a hospital in Haicheng
yesterday. Doctors said Lin was already dead when she was brought
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation shows that Wei, a deputy general
manager of a Taiwan trade company, maintains business connections
with a Haicheng company, and that Wei's company has owed more than
700,000 U.S. dollars to his Haicheng business partner since April.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of his business partner, Wei came to Dalian,
port city in Liaoning, with his girlfriend Lin Ti-chuan on
Monday. They were both kidnapped upon their arrival in Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Local police, already having some ideas about the
identification of the kidnapper suspects, are now searching for
them. The Ministry of Public Security has dispatched personnel to
Liaoning to supervize the investigation of the case.

<P>
WUHAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Immense summer flooding has turned
Hukou, a small town adjacent to the mighty Yangtze River and
Poyang Lake, into the Venice of the Orient.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Hukou in east China's Jiangxi Province
climbed to around 22.5 meters on Thursday, 1.7 meters above the
town's ground level, said Zhou Xinhua, head of the Hukou
Hydrological Station.
</P>
<P>
All the town's streets have become water courses on which over
100 rubber rafts and wooden dinghies shuttle about. The
three-km-long Dazhong Road, the main avenue, is now the main
stream.
</P>
<P>
Floodwater flowed into the first floor of buildings along
Dazhong Road up to waist level, forcing residents to higher
floors. Out of curiosity, some children leaned out of windows on
the second and third floors to see what was happening outside.
</P>
<P>
State-owned grain stores have moved to a commanding height at
the western part of Dazhong Road, providing locals with rice and
noodles.
</P>
<P>
"We sold two or three kilos of rice at a price under the
government ceiling yesterday," said Zhang Yan, a saleswoman at
Ximen Grain Store.
</P>
<P>
Flooding has submerged two of the three vegetable markets in
Hukou, leaving only one partially operating. A dozen individual
peddlers sell seasonal vegetables such as water spinach, Chinese
wax gourd, tomatoes and potatos, and vegetable prices remain
roughly the same as before.
</P>
<P>
Dried-vegetable vendor Tang Renzhuang said, "I can earn more
than 100 yuan a day since floods hit the area, doubling the daily
income of ordinary days."
</P>
<P>
Local residents have replaced bicycles, the most popular means
of transport in China, with boats when they go to buy vegetables
and grain. Many boats are propelled by two people, with one
polling the boat and the other pulling oars. In narrow streets,
they have to strike the boat forward by pulling along the walls of
buildings on both sides.

"The phones are working in homes and electricity and drinking

teacher who stayed behind to take care of the residential
building. All the people in her 15 neighbor households have been
evacuated to safer places.
</P>
<P>
Liao Kaibo, secretary of the Hukou County Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), and county magistrate Wang Ruzhuo
inspected the flood-affected areas by boat.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the Hukou County Government sign standing at the
entrance to the government building is submerged in water, but all
government functionaries are standing fast at their posts.
</P>
<P>
The local post office built a barrier in front of its entrance
to keep the water away, and drained off the water inside with a
pump. All kinds of telecommunications services are working
normally.
</P>
<P>
A local resident said, "Daily life here is passable but far
from comfortable. We have no fear but feel agitated." This
reflects the minds of the 30,000 residents of Hukou.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 90 percent of the town seat has been
inundated, and more than 98,400 people have already been evacuated
with no reports of casualties, said Pei Muchun, deputy head of the
county flood control headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has brought about direct economic losses of 380
million yuan to Hukou so far this month, seven times the county's
entire revenue in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs show that floods
have killed more than 1,000 people across China this year. They
have also destroyed 2.9 million houses and decimated 9 million
hectares of crops, causing direct economic losses estimated at
over 84 billion yuan (10 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> High Technology Creates 2.87 Million Jobs for Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- While "laid-off" has become one of
the most popular words among urban Chinese and the media,
fast-growth high-tech ventures in China have created over 2.86
million jobs for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, vice-minister of Science and Technology, said at a
news conference here today that his ministry is discussing with
banks and the Ministry of Finance the proposal for establishing a
risk investment system for high-tech ventures in a bid to
encourage their development.
</P>
<P>
China's 53 high-and new-technology development zones have
created 1.47 million jobs, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Torch Program Office of the Ministry of
Science and Technology said another 1.47 million people are
working in high-tech ventures in state-level high-tech zones that
were designated by the science and technology commissions at the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more high-tech ventures than any other city in
China. Statistics indicate that Beijing has registered more than
3,000 high-tech ventures employing 120,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The official said electronics and information ventures rank
first among China's high-tech enterprises, followed by biological
technology, new materials, energy saving and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 28 percent of the employees in
high-tech ventures have a college education.
</P>
<P>
The Torch Program is aimed at the commercialization and
industrialization of scientific discoveries.
</P>
<P>
So far, 13,400 high-tech ventures have been registered in the
country's 53 high-tech development zones. Their 1997 income from
industrial production and trade reached 338 billion yuan (nearly
40 billion U.S. dollars.) in 1997, 47 percent more than 1996.
</P>
<P>
A high-tech fair in Beijing is being arranged by the Ministry
of Science and Technology from August 6-10 to display China's
10-year achievements in high-tech development.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Ties Vital:  U.S.-Aussie Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the United States
said here Friday they acknowledged the profound importance of the
Sino-U.S. relationship to the Asia Pacific regional security and
prosperity with both sides agreeing a "one-China" policy best
served the region's interest in stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique released here Friday, U.S. and
Australian foreign and defense ministers said Australia and the
U.S. "emphasized the essentiality of comprehensive and practical
engagement with China, and of supporting China's development as a
stable, open and prosperous power, and a strong and constructive
partner in the international community."
</P>
<P>
The document, which focused on the Asian financial crisis and
recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan and their implications
for regional and global stability and security, was released
following two-day annual Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was led by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Australia were
represented by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
"Both (U.S. and Australian) governments agreed that a
'one-China' policy best served the (Asia Pacific) region's
interest in stability and prosperity," said the communique, which
does not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
"One China" policy refers to the policy of recognizing the
government of the People's Republic of China as the sole and
legitimate government of China and Taiwan as part of China.
</P>
<P>
"Australia welcomed the successful visit of (U.S.) President
Clinton to China in June-July 1998, and congratulated the United
States and China on recent progress made in their relationship,"
said the document.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Australia welcomed recent positive
developments in relations between Japan and China, and between
Japan and Russia, as important steps in fostering the Asia
Pacific's growing sense of community and cooperative endeavor."
</P>
<P>
AUSMIN has been held regularly since 1985, but the AUSMIN held
here in 1996 saw the political and military relations between the
United States and Australia improving substantially following
Australian Prime Minister John Howard took power in March, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Floods Caused by Abnormal Movement of Rain Front: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- This year's serious swelling of the
Yangtze River has been caused by abnormal movement of the rain
front in the areas along the middle and lower reaches of the
river, according to a senior Chinese hydrologist.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, a senior engineer with the Hydrological Bureau of the
Yangtze River Water Control Committee, said due to the abnormal
movement of the rain front, the rainy season has remained longer
than usual in the valley along the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze. Consequently, torrential rains simultaneously hit most of
the valley, bringing the floods to the Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
The major floods of 1931 and 1954 were of the same type as this
year's, said Wang. But the floods on the Yangtze in 1935 and 1981
belongs to a different type, caused by concentrated torrential
rains in particular regions, and causing floods on the river
within those regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, flood waters on the middle and lower reaches
of the Yangtze mostly come from areas upstream from Yichang City
where a gigantic water control dam is being constructed.
</P>
<P>
As the flood-discharging capacity of the region's rivers are
limited, the valley along the middle and lower reaches has become
a key region for flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Yangtze River Water Control Committee show
that embankments with a total length of about 40,000 kilometers
have been constructed along the main stream of the Yangtze and its
many tributaries to hold back swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
Included among the embankments are 3,500-kilometer-long dikes
built along the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
While preventing floods, it is equally important to combat
waterlogging in harnessing the Yangtze River valley, said Luo
Xulu, another senior engineer with the same Yangtze River Water
Control Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo, about 4.67 million hectares of farmland are
prone to waterlogging in the Yangtze River valley, 93 percent of
which are in the plains and the many cities situated along the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces along the Yangtze have been affected by this
year's floods which began in June, inundating a vast farmland
area. Many cities were waterlogged because of limited water
drainage facilities.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task for combating waterlogging in the Yangtze
River valley is to improve the drainage capacity of flooded fields
by working out appropriate standards and plans in accordance with
the specific features of the waterlogged areas, said Luo.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Calls on Crisis Meeting on Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The president of International
Olympic Committee (IOC) Juan Antonio Samaranch Friday called on a
crisis executive board meeting for next month to discuss doping
issue in sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the IOC said the meeting will be held
on August 20 "with a single item on the agenda: the fight against
doping in sport."
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss preparations for an
international conference on doping which would be held in January
in Lausanne, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The decision came amid the drug-plagued Tour de France,
whereas couples of teams and riders are under investigation and
six teams have pulled out of the race by now.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch caused more roars when he was quoted in a Spanish
newspaper as saying that the list of banned drugs authorized by
the IOC should be drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
But the president denied that the IOC withdrew their stand in
fighting against doping in sport, reassuring that the IOC will
carry on their task against performance-enhancing drugs in the
2000 Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Grant Two More Cell Phone Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will grant two
more cellular communications licenses, possibly in early 1999,
the country's telecommunications authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo welcomed a
recommendation by the South African Telecommunications Regulatory
Authority (SATRA) that two new cellular phone licenses be issued,
saying the move would bring about more competition and benefit
the consumers.
</P>
<P>
SATRA said in a notice published in the government gazette
dated July 31 that South Africa could sustain another two
networks.
</P>
<P>
There are currently two mobile phone operators in the country,
Vodacom and MTN. They strongly oppose the awarding of more
cellular phone licenses, saying the market is saturated.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo, who was handed the SATRA report earlier this month,
said in a statement Friday that the ministry accepted the
recommendations, which is "comprehensive and balanced."
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the two new operators in the market as
soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will soon issue invitation for tenders, and then
it is SATRA's responsibility to select the best operators, Naidoo
said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize that SATRA will be responsible for
evaluating the tenders and for awarding the licenses," the
minister said, adding that it would take a few months to evaluate
the bid.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will establish a more efficient management information
system (MIS) which will operate through computer networks by the

</P>
<P>
The CAS will spend 8.5 million yuan (about one-million
U.S. dollars) to build 15 comprehensive information systems and
management resources data banks, and ten management systems for
various departments, Lu told a CAS meeting on MIS in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the funds will be used in developing a multimedia

<HEADLINE> South Asia to Enhance Cooperation Against Terrorism, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Asian leaders said here
Friday that their countries continue to face the serious threat of
terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Ending a 3-day summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here, the leaders of the seven member
countries reiterated their firm commitment to combat these
activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
A declaration issued at the end of the summit urged all SAARC
member nations to complete enabling legislation in order to
implement the SAARC Regional Conventions on Suppression of
Terrorism and on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
</P>
<P>
The leaders recalled the adoption of the 1996 U.N. Declaration
on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism and urged all
member states to work towards its implementation.
</P>
<P>
They also called for international action to prevent the abuse
of refugee conventions and to halt activities which help
terrorist groups to collect funds for their activities in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pointed out that two SAARC conferences on
cooperation in police matters had been held since 1996. The first
conference was held in Sri Lanka in July, 1996. The second was
held last year in the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
They called for the continued sharing of expertise with regard
to the different areas of police investigation, and investigation
of organized crimes and drug related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated their commitment to the eradication of
poverty in the region as early as possible, preferably by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the need to encourage maximum participation by
target
groups in the formulation and implementation of poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also pointed out that Human Resource Development
was a key
element in any poverty eradication program.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly they agreed that once the SAARC Center for Human
Resources Development was established in Islamabad it could look
into the
possibility of its contributing to the strengthening of the human
resources development components of the regional poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided that discriminatory practices and
non-tariff barriers should be simultaneously removed on items in
respect of which tariff concessions are granted or have been
granted earlier.
</P>
<P>
Measures to remove structural impediments should also be taken
in order to move speedily towards the goal of the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) which was agreed at the last summit in Male to
be established by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) in December 1995 marking its first step towards the
creating of SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated the importance of achieving SAFTA and
towards achieving this, they decided to draft a comprehensive
treaty regime for creating a free trade area which will
incorporate binding time frames for freeing trade, measures to
facilitate trade and provisions to ensure equitable distribution
of benefits of trade to all states.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of finalizing the text or
regulatory framework by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the benefits of economic liberalization would
be more extensive through the promotion of trade creating joint
ventures, investment and trade in services such as tourism.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven member SAARC met in Colombo on July 29
to 31.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Runs Out of Steam: Congress Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, president of
Congress, India's biggest opposition party, Friday stepped up her
attack on the BJP-led government, which, she asserted, has run out
of steam.
</P>
<P>
This is the second attack on the Vajpayee coalition government
by the Congress leader this week. She made her first attack on the
government when she addressed a massive rally of Congress workers
here on July 28.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of national executive and state
presidents of the Indian Youth Congress, Sonia said the
government's five-month rule had resulted in a directional
paralysis as it had run out of steam intellectually, morally and
financially. She charged the Vajpayee government with failure on
all fronts, especially in containing the prices and maintaining
law and order.
</P>
<P>
Crime had reached alarming proportions and that even physical
security for the ordinary citizen has been in jeopardy. The rule
of the government has witnessed skyrocketing prices of essential
commodities and vegetables, she further said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress president asked the Youth Congress to launch a
campaign against the coalition government at the Center.

concerned would maintain a separate budget for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that preventive measures to reduce the impact
of calamities would be strengthened with research and studies on
possible calamities, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Trade Surplus in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa notched up a
higher-than-expected trade surplus of 1.07 billion Rand (175
million U.S. Dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
This was half of May's exceptionally high surplus of about 2
billion Rand (328 million Dollars), but much better than
expectations of about 500 million Rand surplus.
</P>
<P>
Imports rose from 10.3 billion Rand (1.69 billion Dollars) in
May to 11.3 billion Rand (1.85 billion Dollars) in June while
exports remained static at 12.3 billion Rand (2 billion Dollars),
the South African Revenue Service said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Economists had not expected another surge in exports after
May's spectacular rise, and were pleased that the trade balance
had continued in a respectable surplus after deficits in March
and April, according to reports of South African newspapers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On a cumulative basis, the trade surplus for the first six
months of the year was about 3 billion Rand (492 million
Dollars), down from about 4 billion Rand (656 million Dollars)
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Machinery imports were once again the main driving force
behind import growth. Machinery imports excluded, import growth
was soft, at only 4.6 percent year on year in the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
But economists said the strong growth in machinery imports is
not cause for concern, as they would add to gross domestic fixed
investment, which is necessary to improve the productive capacity
of the economy and enhance growth potential.
</P>
<P>
Export growth was being hampered by the poor performance of
gold and diamond exports. The category containing these exports
had fallen 8.4 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
Barring chemical products, exports in other categories were
showing very respectable growth, with machinery and transport
exports recording the highest growth of about 20 percent year on
year.
</P>
<P>
Excluding gems and precious metals, export growth had been
14.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the outlook for the trade surplus in the second
half of this year was fairly positive due to the sharp
depreciation in the Rand in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Rand, which has lost over 25 percent its value against the
Dollar this year, would help to raise revenues from commodity
exports even if volumes remained flat, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Power Imports Could Stave off Price Hikes in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The recent deals sealed by
South Africa's state power utility, Eskom, to import power from
Mozambique and Zambia could stave off local power price hikes in
the medium term, Business Day paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eskom signed agreements this month with Cahora Bassa in
Mozambique and the Zambian Electricity Supply Corporation (Zesco)
to buy their electricity.
</P>
<P>
Both deals reduced the pressure on Eskom to build new power
stations, which would require a lot capital investment, Eskom
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The company said Thursday that the move would not adversely
affect the local price of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Eskom officials said earlier that power prices might be
increased to help fund its commitment to provide power to more
people in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming commercialization of the utility, which means
it would have to pay taxes and dividends in the future, could
also push up the prices.
</P>
<P>
Eskom reportedly bought 900 MW of uninterrupted power from
Cahora Bassa at 3 cents (0.5 U.S. cents) a kilowatt hour for this
year and 4 cents (0.66 U.S. cents) for 1999. After that the deal
would be revised.
</P>
<P>
The deal with Zesco is understood to be similar, but involving
only 120 MW, the paper said. These power figures were
comparatively small in terms of Eskom's total capacity of nearly
40,000 MW.
</P>
<P>
Concern was expressed that Eskom was to import power at a
higher price than it cost to produce locally.
</P>
<P>
Eskom's raw material cost is estimated at 2.5 cents, although
it sells electricity at 20 to 30 cents to retail consumers after
provision for overheads and growth.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has one of the cheapest power prices in the
world, at 17.5 cents (2.9 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour,
according to a survey released earlier this month.

<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
return home Friday morning from a high-profile visit to France and
Morocco in an attempt to rescue the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
He was in Paris to substantiate a Franco-Egyptian initiative on
an international conference on the Mideast peace process in case
current effort to restart the peace wheel fails.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also attended the 17th session of the Al Quds
(Jerusalem) Committee of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference which wound up in Casablanca, Morocco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat told reporters upon arrival that he
will submit a detailed report to President Hosni Mubarak on the
outcome of the Committee's meetings, and the results of talks he
has held with Iraqi, Syrian, Moroccan, Iranian and Palestinian
counterparts on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen foreign ministers of the Islamic and Arab world issued
a final communique, urging rethinking relations with Israel, and
considering closing their missions and bureaux until the Jewish
state fulfills peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to set up a special fund to support
Palestinians in East Jerusalem to counter the expansion of Israeli
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that his report also involves details of
his visit to Paris, his meeting with French President Jacques
Chirac and with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine on the
developments of the peace process and the Egyptian-French
initiative to salvage the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's trip to Paris has reportedly turned the initiative
into a plan and thrashed out details of a viable option to the
ongoing U.S. mediation bid.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Early gains inspired by rises on
United States and Japanese markets were tempered by late selling
of shares of News Corp. and BHP to leave Australian shares only
marginally higher Friday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 3.3 points to 2,704.6 off an
early high of 2,735.2 points, with volumes unusually strong.
</P>
<P>
General sentiment was also seen improving as the Japanese
reform process began and overnight U.S. wages numbers provided
further indications of a strong growth, low inflation economy.
</P>
<P>
"There was a very positive reaction to the economic numbers
that came out of the U.S. market Thursday night that allayed fears
we may see an interest rate rise any time soon," Hartley Poynton
broker Ned Shamay said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 12.7 points to 4,777.8 with most
leading stocks solid and some good gain among the mid-range
companies.
</P>
<P>
Insurance giant AMP, which roared ahead this week prior to
Monday's inclusion in market indices, posted a more mild rise
Friday, closing 15.1 cents higher, on a volume of 13 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Of the major banks, ANZ was the improver after missing out
Thursday, adding 17 cents, Commonwealth Bank rose 12.2 cents,
National Australia Bank edged five cents lower and Westpac dropped
ten cents.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 5.3 points lower at 1,027.2
despite a strong gold sector.

Diversified giant BHP dropped 26.4 cents amid reports of
offshore institutional selling.

Of the other diversifieds North gained three cents, Rio Tinto
was 13 cents lower and WMC finished steady at 4.94 Australian

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slipped
lower Friday in light trade ahead of a Monday banking holiday in
some states.
</P>
<P>
Trapped in a tight range of 61.00 to 61.20 U.S. cents, the
currency settled into the close at 61.14, down from 61.36
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia treasury manager Paul Macarounas said
despite the quiet dealings in terms of range for the currency,
there was good interest from both sides of the market.
</P>
<P>
The unit received a scare when the Japanese yen fell against
the U.S. dollar overnight after new Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa said market forces should determine the level of
the yen, downplaying the prospect of further central bank
intervention to support the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa said intervention was only appropriate in "extreme"
cases. He Friday tempered those comments by saying they were just
a statement of "a general principle."
</P>
<P>
Japan is Australia's major export destination and the
Australian dollar has been monitoring events to resuscitate the
Asian country's struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session here the Australian dollar was buying
87.76 yen from 87.32 on Thursday, and 1.0872 German marks from
1.0862.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases New Guidelines for Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
approved new guidelines for exporting crude oil in an apparent
move to check abuse in the export of the country's major foreign
currency earner.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines, approved by Head of State, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar, was issued Thursday in Abuja, the federal
capital. It will take into immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines recognize four categories of companies as
qualified to export crude oil from Nigeria:
</P>
<P>
Upstream investors who have acquired an Oil Prospecting
Licenses and must have completed a minimum amount of the work on
the concession;
</P>
<P>
Companies that have built an export oil refinery in Nigeria;
</P>
<P>
Bonafide end-users who own a refinery and retail outlets
abroad;
</P>
<P>
Established and globally recognized large volume traders.
</P>
<P>
All the applicants must have a minimum annual turnover of 100
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
They must also have committed to the development of the
Nigerian economy by inverting in any number of investment
opportunities in the oil industry or other sectors, or as an
alternative, have meaningful investment in oil producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Successful applicants as end-users and large volume traders
are required to post a one million Dollar performance bond
through a reputable Nigerian bank in addition to satisfying the
regular crude oil contract provision.
</P>
<P>
The bond will be forfeited to the Nigerian government, if
after six months of the signing of the crude oil contract, the
investment has not been made or there is no evidence of a
commitment to do so. Besides, the oil contract will automatically
terminate.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines stipulate that crude oil export shall now
be on the basis of confirmed irrevocable letters of credit only.

<HEADLINE> Kluivert Transfer to Man United Agreed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Kluivert and his team of
financial advisers will fly to England within the next two days to
discuss personal terms after Manchester United and AC Milan agreed
a fee of nine million pounds (14.8 million U.S. dollars) for the
Dutch World Cup striker.
</P>
<P>
The deal would take United manager Alex Ferguson's summer
spending spree to 24 million pounds, but there remains a question
of Kluivert's wage demands, which is believed to be in the region
of 50,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
But to clinch the player's signature, United manager Alex
Ferguson will almost certainly have to break the rigid wage
structure at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has operated a 20,000 pounds a week ceiling to avoid
dressing room jealousy but this may have to go to persuade
Kluivert to play in the English premier league.
</P>
<P>
The imminent arrival of Kluivert will not end Ferguson's
interest in Dwight Yorke, the Aston Villa forward.
</P>
<P>
Martin Edwards, the United chairman, revealed that the club
hoped to bring in the two players before the start of the Premier
league on August 15.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean our interest in Yorke has dropped...it just
means we can be a bit more relaxed about the situation now.
</P>
<P>
"Our bid for Kluivert has been accepted but we have not had an
opportunity to speak to the player because he went on holiday
after the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he will want to speak to Alex Ferguson and the two
of them will get together as soon as possbile," he said.
</P>
<P>
If United complete the Kluivert deal, Ferguson will have
sufficient striking power to use Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole or
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as bait in a player-plus-cash offer for Yorke.
</P>
<P>
Villa manager John Gregory has put a 16 million pounds price
tag on the Trinidad and Tobago international.
</P>
<P>
United have offered David May, Denis Irwin, Teddy Sheringham
and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, plus cash, at different times to try to
tempt Gregory to sell and now they are reported to be ready to
offer Andy Cole plus five million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "I always thought that if United were to sign a
top class striker then the chase for Dwight Yorke would end.
</P>
<P>
"But my view now is that Alex Ferguson probably sees Kluivert
and Yorke playing together.
</P>
<P>
"Kluivert is what you would consider to be a number nine and so
is Andy Cole. They seem too similar to me to be playing alongside
each other," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Progress at Indo-Pakistan Talks on Resumption of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Senior Pakistani and Indian
officials have failed to make any progress at their talks in
Colombo. Sri Lanka, on the possible resumption of the dialogue
between the two countries, a Pakistani spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Pakistan-India dialogue remains stalemated and no progress
has been made in Colombo," spokesman Tariq Altaf told a press
conference, adding that Pakistan hoped to keep in tough with India
"through diplomatic channels" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
At their talks Wednesday on the sidelines of a summit of South
Asian leaders in the Sri Lankan capital, Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who
would meet again next month during a Non-Aligned Movement summit
in South Africa's Durban, agreed that the dialogue, which broke
off last September in New Delhi, should be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' foreign secretaries were asked to meet
Wednesday and Thursday here to work out the "modalities" for the
resumption of the dialogue, Vajpayee told a press conference
shortly after his meeting with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India have met twice
on July 29 and 30 to overcome the procedural as well as
substantive impediments to the resumption of Pakistan-India talks.
It has not been possible for them to reach an agreement," Altaf
said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have failed to reach any agreement on the
resumption of the dialogue due to their deep differences over the
issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir, according to
the Pakistani spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their dialogue at the foreign
secretary level in March last year after a three-year hiatus. But
the dialogue broke off again last September.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan now wants the dialogue to be resumed on the basis of
an eight-point agreement reached between the two sides in
Islamabad on June 23 last year. The first two points, or agenda
items, deal with the issues of peace and security and Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The first two items in "the sequential order of the agreed
agenda" must be dealt with "specifically and substantially" on a
priority basis, particularly in view of the worsening security
situation in the region in the aftermath of the nuclear tests
carried out in May this year by India as well as by Pakistan,
which did so in a tit-for-tat manner, according to Altaf.
</P>
<P>
India, on the other hand, insists that the dialogue should
start afresh. Altaf accused India of having "resiled on the
understandings" reached in Islamabad and said no basis therefore
exists for the resumption of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
No Indian officials in Colombo were available for comment on
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani spokesman pointed to the nuance of the wording
the two prime ministers used in their respective statements issued
at their separate press conferences Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian prime minister unilaterally announced that the two
sides had agreed on the resumption of talks," whereas "the prime
minister of Pakistan said that the two sides had agreed to
continue the talks at the next available opportunity," Altaf
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of the problem lies the rigid and inflexible
position which India continues to maintain in its refusal to
address the issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir
dispute," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani spokesman also said his country remains ready for
talks on the resumption of the dialogue "whenever India is willing
to do so," and expressed the hope that the two sides would remain
in touch "through diplomatic channels to overcome the
difficulties" standing in the way of the resumption of the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Island newspaper published
Friday, Sharif said the outcome of his talks with his Indian
counterpart was "zero."
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister was not willing to focus on Kashmir
prominently nor did he want Kashmir to figure prominently in a
joint communique, according to Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"If that was the position, what is the point in having these
talks because Kashmir was the root cause of all the conflicts
between India and Pakistan. We did not want to hold talks for the
sake of talks but for the talks to succeed," Sharif was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of Pakistan and India, as the spokesman
announced, would have their next meeting on the sidelines of a
summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) scheduled for August this
year in Durban, South Africa.

<P>
SYDNEY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the United States
issued a joint communique here Friday focusing on the Asian
financial crisis and recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan
and their implications on regional and global stability and
security.
</P>
<P>
The document, released following the two-day Australia-U.S.
Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) between the two countries'
foreign and defense ministers Thursday and Friday, reaffirmed
their well-known positions on the Asian financial crisis and the
recent nuclear tests in South Asia, and the relations between the
U.S. and Australia, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said the talks (between Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer and himself and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen) produced a number
of valuable outcomes for the Australian Defense Force, including
agreement to further develop the ability of the Australia and U.S.
armed forces to operate together.
</P>
<P>
"This (the agreement) includes steps to take advantage of the
far-reaching technology changes resulting from the information
revolution, and developing more effective planning on how our
forces can operate together with this new technology," McLachlan
said.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the Australian and U.S. governments
expressed confidence that the fundamental regional strengths which
had generated prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific would
provide the basis for regional recovery over the longer term.
</P>
<P>
"Sound macroeconomic policies, stronger and more transparent
financial systems, structural reform and more open markets are the
key to restoring financial stability and confidence in the
economic health of countries affected by the financial crisis,"
the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed "implementation of economic reform programs
supported by the international financial institutions will
continue to have a central role in helping to restore financial
and monetary stability in the region, and in alleviating the wider
social impact of the crisis".
</P>
<P>
But it said "Australia and the United States agreed that
international assistance to support economic reform in (Asian
countries) should continue to be based on progress in implementing
economic adjustment goals".
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, the U.S. and
Australian ministers considered the tests "a source of deep and
lasting concern, coming at a time when the commitment of the
international community to nuclear non-proliferation and its
confidence in effective progress on nuclear disarmament has never
been stronger", the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Australia "both expressed the strong hope that
India and Pakistan would decide not to take the fateful further
step of deploying nuclear armed weapons systems".
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to continue to work closely together and with
others to prevent an accelerating nuclear and missile arms race in
south Asia, to strengthen the international non-proliferation
regime, and to promote reconciliation and peaceful resolution of
differences between India and Pakistan," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It concluded by saying the next annual Australia-U.S.
Ministerial Consultations would be held in the United States in
1999.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on European Countries to Prevent Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) has called on European countries to
prevent forest fires by improving management of forests.
</P>
<P>
"These fires do not break out only by chance or due to ill
will," Jorge Najera, forest fire expert in the Timber Section of
the UN/ECE, said here Thursday. "It is, above all, a social
phenomenon closely related to land use issues."
</P>
<P>
Fires due to natural causes, such as those caused by lightning,
only represent 2.1 percent of all fires in France and 4.3 percent
in Spain, according to the UN/ECE.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fires are still man made, due to negligence, said
the organization.
</P>
<P>
There is therefore an urgent need to intensify the education
campaigns and to sensitize the public, especially children, so
that they learn to respect and protect their inheritance.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason it is of vital importance to be able to better
manage forest fires, which every year provoke damage to this
unique natural resource and cause human losses, especially among
those fighting fires," he added.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Leaders Target Poverty In South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) decided Friday to
target
poverty in the region through human resources development.
</P>
<P>
In its Colombo declaration at the end of the 10th SAARC Summit,
the
leaders reiterated their commitment to the eradication of poverty
in the
region as early as possible, preferably by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the need to encourage maximum participation by
target
groups in the formulation and implementation of poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need for the effective utilization of the
SAARC
Three-Tier Mechanism on Poverty Eradication.
</P>
<P>
They noted that their countries had provided leadership in
developing
Micro Credit Programs, which have immense potential to contribute
to the
eradication of poverty
</P>
<P>
The leaders also pointed out that Human Resource Development
was a key
element in any poverty eradication program.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly they agreed that once the SAARC Center for Human
Resources Development was established in Islamabad it could look
into the
possibility of its contributing to the strengthening of the human
resources development components of the regional poverty
eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
The leaders decided that discriminatory practices and
non-tariff barriers should be simultaneously removed on items in
respect of which tariff concessions are granted or have been
granted earlier.
</P>
<P>
Measures to remove structural impediments should also be taken
in order to move speedily towards the goal of the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) which was agreed at the last summit in Male to
be established by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) in December 1995 marking its first step towards the
creating of SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reiterated the importance of achieving SAFTA and
towards achieving this, they decided to draft a comprehensive
treaty regime for creating a free trade area which will
incorporate binding time frames for freeing trade, measures to
facilitate trade and provisions to ensure equitable distribution
of benefits of trade to all states.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of finalizing the text or
regulatory framework by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the benefits of economic liberalization would
be more extensive through the promotion of trade creating joint
ventures, investment and trade in services such as tourism.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven member SAARC met in Colombo on July 29
to 31.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Labor Tries to Settle Orr Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to defuse the
crisis caused by the derogatory remarks about Sephardic Jews by
its member Ori Orr, Israeli opposition Labor party has decided to
suspend Orr from all his official party positions.
</P>
<P>
During a special meeting Thursday night, Labor leader Ehud
Barak told the party's Knesset (parliament) members that Orr would
not be allowed to speak on behalf of the Labor faction in the
Knesset plenum.
</P>
<P>
And Orr would be permanently removed from the Knesset's Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee and from its subcommittee on the
security services, as well as from the Labor faction leadership
and a forum of senior party officials, Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Orr, an Ashkenazi Jew and ex-army general, said that he
accepted the party decision.
</P>
<P>
Orr set off a public outcry Wednesday in an interview he gave
to local daily Haaretz, in which he said that some Sephardic Jews
"are not curious about their surroundings," are not "Israeli in
their character" and cannot be talked to like other people.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Jewish population is roughly split among Sephardic
and Ashkenazi Jews. Sephardic Jews with middle eastern descent
had suffered discrimination after arriving in early 1950s at the
hands of the ruling Ashkenazi Jews of European descended elite.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman expressed anger and "terrible
sorrow" over Orr's statements, saying that Orr should do some
serious soul-searching and consider whether he is suitable for
political life.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used Orr's remarks to blast
the entire Labor party and make political gain. He noted that
some Labor members continued to run counter to the principle of
"equality and unity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orr's statement are perceived in Labor to have
caused grave damage to the party, which has been making intensive
efforts to rehabilitate its relations with the Sephardic
communities.
</P>
<P>
Labor hopes to win some support from Sephardic communities,
which traditionally voted for Likud, in order to ascend to power
in the 2000 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision to suspend Orr did not satisfy all the
Labor members, who also demanded Orr's resignation from the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
They said that as long as Orr is in the party's leadership, his
statements can be used against Labor in the election campaign and
cause serious damage.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to say whether he had asked Orr to resign. But he
is due to convene a Labor central committee meeting on Sunday to
decide what further measures should be taken against Orr.
</P>
<P>
His associates indicated that it is very difficult for Barak to
resolve the crisis without Orr's quit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Publish Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat Friday called on the United States to make known its
initiative on Israeli redeployment in order to save the faltering
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Since Israel had come up with nothing new to push forward the
peace process, it is high time that the U.S. administration went
public with its initiative," he told the Egyptian Voice of Arabs
radio station.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the Palestinian-Israeli direct talks failed
to produce an agreement on the U.S. proposal, which calls for a
further 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in
return for Palestinian security guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Erekat added the two sides would resume talks next week and
their contacts were under way. "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is trying to exploit these meetings to claim there is
something new in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace-making has been stalled since
March 1997 over Israel's construction of a new settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem and long-delayed withdrawal from the Palestinian
land.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian leadership will meet after the return of
President (Yasser) Arafat from abroad in order to determine
whether it is viable or not to continue these talks," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
European and U.S. moves were afoot to put the Middle East peace
process back on track, he said, asking Washington to come up with
a full report on the fate of its initiative and say who has
accepted it and who has not.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has been resisting the U.S. proposal,
which has been accepted by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the Egyptian-French call for an international
conference on the Middle East peace process should complement the
U.S. initiative in helping reach a final solution.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President Jacques
Chirac put forward the overture to rescue the peace process during
their talks in Paris in May.

<HEADLINE> No Progress at Indo-Pakistan Talks on Resumption of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Senior Pakistani and Indian
officials have failed to make any progress at their talks in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, on the possible resumption of the dialogue
between the two countries, a Pakistani spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Pakistan-India dialogue remains stalemated and no progress
has been made in Colombo," spokesman Tariq Altaf told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
At their talks Wednesday on the sidelines of a summit of South
Asian leaders in the Sri Lankan capital, Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee
agreed that the dialogue, which broke off last September in New
Delhi, should be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' foreign secretaries were asked to meet
Wednesday and Thursday here to work out the "modalities" for the
resumption of the dialogue, Vajpayee told a press conference
shortly after his meeting with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India have met twice
on July 29 and 30 to overcome the procedural as well as
substantive impediments to the resumption of Pakistan-India talks.
It has not been possible for them to reach an agreement," Altaf
said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to reach any agreement on the
resumption of the dialogue due to their deep differences over the
issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir, according to
the Pakistani spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their dialogue at the foreign
secretary level in March last year after a three-year hiatus. But
the dialogue broke off again last September.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan now wants the dialogue to be resumed on the basis of
an eight-point agreement reached between the two sides on June 23
last year. The first two points deal with the issues of peace and
security and Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India, on the other hand, insists that the dialogue should
start afresh.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani spokesman pointed to the nuance of the wording
the two prime ministers used in their respective statements issued
at their separate press conferences Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian prime minister unilaterally announced that the two
sides had agreed on the resumption of talks," whereas "the prime
minister of Pakistan said that the two sides had agreed to
continue the talks at the next available opportunity," Altaf
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the prime ministers of Pakistan and
India are scheduled to have their next meeting on the sidelines of
a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to be held next month
in Durban, South Africa.

<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading British newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Directly elected mayors with executive powers are to be
allowed in every English town and city under radical government
plans to restore public confidence and enthusiasm in town hall
politics.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government Thursday launched the most sweeping
overhaul of financial regulation for more than a decade by
publishing a draft bill to set up a single regulator with an
unprecedented range of powers and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair was accused Thursday night
of sidelining Parliament by delivering his first "state of the
nation" address to a hand-picked group of ministers and civil
servants in the garden of No 10 rather than to the Commons.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Agrees on Security Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have agreed on the
draft mechanism which provides for its intervention in the
internal affairs of its member countries.
</P>
<P>
A communique provided by the ECOWAS secretariat Thursday in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, stated that the body's intervention in
the internal affairs of member states will be a "fait accompli"
where "conflict in a country threatens to trigger a humanitarian
disaster and poses a serious threat to peace and security in the
sub-region".
</P>
<P>
There will also be such interventions when "threats to the
security in the sub-region erupt following the overthrow or
attempted overthrow of a democratically elected government", the
Guardian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not say when and where the communique was
signed.
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted the consensus is coming at the time
when calls that the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG be
sent to crisis-ravaged Guinea Bissau has reached a peak.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of defense and foreign affairs from ECOWAS member states
had earlier this month met in Cote d'Ivoire to work out the details
of ECOMOG's intervention.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Business Confidence Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand improved for the second month in a row in July, with
exporters particularly bullish, the New Zealand Press Association
(NZPA) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted NZ National Bank chief economist Brendan O'Donovan as
saying that optimists outnumbered pessimists 41 percent to 26
percent for a net balance of 15 percent expecting general business
conditions to improve over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
That beat last month's net 12 percent optimism shown by the
bank's survey of business opinion, O'Donovan told NZPA Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the standout feature was the buoyant outlook
among exporters.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate (for the NZ dollar) has fallen and firms
that export to anywhere except Asia are enjoying life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers were particularly optimistic with a net 54
percent expecting a lift in exports, the highest confidence level
for more than three years, O'Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
But the lower currency had a downside with a net 19 percent
expecting higher prices, the highest level for three years, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"When activity picks up there is a backlog of inflation
pressures to come through," the economist predicted.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise For Fourth Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose for the fourth
consecutive trading day Friday as pledges by the new Japanese
government of large income tax cuts and a "soft landing" for the
country's bad loan crisis fueled market optimism.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced 177.37 points, or 1.09
percent, from Thursday's close to finish at 16,378.97.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, rose 13.85 points or 1.11 percent to 1,262.04.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 379 million
shares from 365.09 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The first full day of trading following Thursday's launch of a new
cabinet under Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi got an early boost via
buybacks of big-name shares such as Nippon Steel, Hitachi and NEC.
</P>
<P>
The rise occurred amid a steep fall in the yen against the U.S.
dollar and a new backdrop of economic gloom. The government announced
Friday that Japan's jobless rate in June hit a record high of 4.3
percent since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said the gains were supported by newly appointed
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's comments that an income tax cut
exceeding 6 trillion yen (about 41.8 billion dollars) will be
implemented in order to boost consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 692 to 394, with 168 issues ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar stayed firmly over
143 yen after fears of intervention to prop up the yen were quelled by
Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 143.77-80 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), up from 143.55-57 yen at 9 a.m., but almost unchanged from
143.70-80 yen late Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa said late Thursday night that stock prices and foreign
exchange rates should be left to the market to decide. His remarks
pushed the dollar up by more than 1 yen in New York to as high as
143.88 yen.

"The solution we are thinking of," Plesu added, "is the same
proposed by the international community," -- a political solution
in Kosovo as soon as possible, the Rompres news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The developments in Kosovo are a matter of deep concern for
Romania. Worrying about the possible extension of the conflict in
the region, it backs the international efforts in solving the
crisis through political means.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Plesu will also discuss with his hosts
Romania-Albania ties with an emphasis on strengthening
South-East European stability and security, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Shows Slight Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market exhibited
a slight downward tendency this week, while the turnover was
sustained at last week's level, a market report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market review issued by Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO) said the CISCO All-Share Index closed
on Thursday at 419.1 points, with a weekly decline of 6.7 points.
</P>
<P>
The review said that investor psychology and investment
strategies this year seem to largely be driven by island's
political factors which have become a major impediment to a
further rise in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have escalated on the island since Cyprus signed a
deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy the S-300 anti-aircraft
missile system, which is scheduled to be deployed in Cyprus later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the review said the summer period which is by now
well under way, has traditionally proved an indolent period for
the stock market with the exception of the bull market run in
1989-90.
</P>
<P>
The total weekly turnover was 4.8 million Cyprus pounds (about
9.6 million U.S. dollars), up from 4.7 million pounds (about 9.4
million dollars) the previous week.

<P>
NANCHANG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- His neighbors considered Deng
Yong, 10, to be nothing more than a mischievous boy up until
Thursday, when they commented that he had "grown up overnight".
</P>
<P>
Deng, a resident of suburban Jiujiang City in east China's
Jiangxi Province, also said that he has been "a personal sense of
maturation."
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains over the past few days eased somewhat on
Thursday evening, providing Deng and his friends an opportunity to
go for a swim in a nearby river.
</P>
<P>
A short time later, however, the frolicking youngsters heard
the distant shouts of a person maintaining vigil on the river
dike. "I listened closely and heard the man say leaks had been
detected in nearby culverts and most men in the village kilometers
away are loading dirt to reinforce the dikes," Deng said. He
emphasized his statement with hand gestures.
</P>
<P>
The young men immediately returned to their village and joined
their mothers and sisters in collecting quilts to temporarily
patch cracks in the culverts.
</P>
<P>
"The quilts failed to stop the leaks, so we used sandbags as
reinforcement," said Deng. "We had to drag the heavy bags, but
managed to plug the leak in about an hour."
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact was that we would have been left homeless had
the embankments collapsed. This prompted me to forget my age and
join in the battle against flooding," said the young man.

<P>
Xia Jing, the female manager of a local bathhouse, and 50
female employees joined in the efforts to construct a new
cofferdam to ease pressure on a floodgate.
</P>
<P>
Xia, 22, contributed relief supplies and the use of vehicles
and equipment with an estimated value of 10,000 yuan. "I'll do
everything I can to help," she said.
</P>
<P>
A family of four also participated in the effort. The
wife and daughther hurriedly filled sandbags with crushed stones,
with the husband carrying the heavy bag to the floodgate.
</P>
<P>
"That's my wife and daughther, and my son's transporting stones,"
said the weary man as he wiped sweat from his dripping brow. "My
entire family is helping to protect the floodgate."
</P>
<P>
The couple erected a themporary shelter near the floodgate a
month earlier. "We have maintained a constant vigil in case of an
unexpected emergency," said his wife Yang Sijin.
</P>
<P>
"We prepare meals at home, and bring them to our parents. The
one-way trip takes about half an hour," according to their
daughther Yu Yangbao.
</P>
<P>
"Temporary losses are unimportant. The most important thing is
to prothect the floodgate," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The family estimates its expenditures in the effort have
exceeded 20,000 yuan. The husband explained that wealthier people
should pay their just dues to society. "The flood control effort
has reached critical point and we simply can't wait for the
government to allocathe relief funds," her husband said . Endithem

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The famous French cancer specialist
and medical ethicist Leon Schwartzenberg Friday judged the
treatment of cyclists in the Tour de France cycling tournament as
"scandalous."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with France 2 television, Schwartzenberg said
that even if people knew that some cyclists had been doped, they
should let them finish the tour before starting a debate on what
one should do about it.
</P>
<P>
"From the moment when all the people knew or claim to know that
these cyclists could be doped, they should give them peace and let
the Tour de France continue and, once it is completed, decide what
one should do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the president of the International Cyclist Union of
"clearing away by taking a vacation in India."
</P>
<P>
"By consequence, very clearly, there has been a scandal and the
scandal unfortunately is shown through the way in which the French
judicial authorities and police have acted, which is not very
shining for our country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Industry Picks up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Tourist Board Chairman
Eliud Mahihu says the tourism industry had substantially
recovered after one year slump.
</P>
<P>
However, campaign efforts to penetrate Germany was "still a
problem," he was quoted by Friday's Daily Nation newspaper as
saying. Germany is the main source of tourists to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the United Kingdom, Switzerland and French markets
are concerned, things have started to change for the better, but
we are still having problems with Germany," he told the ongoing
12th biennial ambassadors' conference in Mombasa Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the German market was jittery due to the intense
negative publicity the western media had subjected prospective
holiday makers to.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers
and Caterers show that between January and October last year, a
total of 394,880 beds in Kenyan hotels were occupied by Germans.
</P>
<P>
Mahihu said however that the board had launched a major
campaign drive in Europe, where it had placed advertizements in
35 leading travel magazines with a readership of about 45 million
people.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 outdoor posters had been placed at approaches
to towns and shopping malls in Switzerland while a similar number
of videos on Kenya had been sent to travels agents in Europe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahihu said some of the measures taken to help the industry
recover include educational visits for travel agents and dealing
with the international media on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The industry went into a free fall last year following the
Likoni clashes and was also affected by the collapsed
infrastructure following the El Nino-induced rains and the
outbreak of water-borne epidemics.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Prince Ranariddh Leaves for Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's ousted first-premier
Prince Norodom Ranariddh left here Friday for Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
His trip came after the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
claimed victory in the July 26 election, which Ranariddh regarded
as "unjust and unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Partial results indicated that the CPP would become the largest
party in the National Assembly, thus having the right to name
Cambodia's next prime minister. The CPP fielded co-premier Hun
Sen, Ranariddh's arch rival, as the candidate for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has said the CPP wants to form a coalition with
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP).
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the FUNCINPEC party and the SRP said
they would not take part in the coalition with the CPP or engage
in any negotiations related to the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
"To speak about power-sharing and the like is highly
inappropriate at this time. Those who threaten to govern outside
the structures of the Constitution... are undermining the
democratic will of the Cambodian people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC party and the SRP rejected the election because
of "fraud" and "irregularities" in the election process.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Ranariddh and SRP leader Sam Rainsy,
said the two parties would not accept the results of the election
unless "the serious irregularities reported are shown not to have
altered the outcome of the election".
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the neutral observers to "investigate
the evidence and assess the validity of the election results".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, international observers said the election was
"basically free and fair" and could be accepted.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian National Election Committee has set up a special
panel to look into reports of election fraud and intimidation.

<HEADLINE> Shootings on Namibia-Botswana Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Botswana Defense Force (BDF)
troops have shot and killed two Namibians close to the border
between the two countries, Business Day newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Namibian police confirmed Thursday that the anti-poaching unit
of the BDF, which has stationed troops around two disputed
islands in Chobe River in the Caprivi Strip, killed two alleged
Namibian poachers in the Kwando area 10 days ago, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The site of the shootings is in Botswana, about five
kilometers from the Namibian border.
</P>
<P>
News of the killings coincides with the current state visit to
Namibia by Botswana President Festus Mogae, who is scheduled to
discuss several issues, including growing tension between the
countries' troops over the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
Botswana authorities told Namibian police that Joseph Mukupi
and Lubata Mungowe, both from a village in Caprivi, had been
armed and were shot dead in "retaliatory fire."
</P>
<P>
Two other Namibians reportedly escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The incident is considered a serious blow to Mogae's three-day
visit to Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the BDF deployed troops along its border
with Namibia where the two disputed islands, Kasikili (called
Sedudu in Botswana) and Situngu, are located.
</P>
<P>
The move appeared to be in line with Botswana's initial plans
of erecting camps manned by its troops every 10 kilometers
stretching from the disputed island of Situngu to the border
located near the Mahangu Game Reserve in Botswana territory.
</P>
<P>
Namibian authorities feel that before occupying the islands
Botswana should have directed a request to the Organization of
African Unity, the United Nations or the Southern African
Development Community to mediate.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have subsequently set up a joint technical
committee to discuss the border issue and to demarcate the
stretch on the Chobe River.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest incident, Namibian President Sam Nujoma
was criticized Thursday by the official opposition party, the
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), which said his reaction to
the "Trigger-happy" Botswana troops had been lukewarm. DTA Vice
President Katuutire Kaura said Nujoma should take stronger action
to curb the actions of Botswana and preserve stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Kaura suggested that the timing of Mogae's visit to Windhoek
was good because it should encourage Nujoma to take up the issue
with him.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Leads Ladies Program in Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Kwan, world champion in
figure skating, performed almost perfectly tonight in the ladies'
short program of figure skating to excite the audience of 5,580 at
the Goodwill Games in Long Island, New York.
</P>
<P>
"It was so hard to concentrate because the people were cheering
so loud," said Kwan after her performance at the Nassau Veteran
Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, gold medalist at the 1997 and 1998 world figure skating
championships, got three 5.8 and four 5.9 points for technical
performance and six 5.9 points and one full 6.0 point for
presentation, topping all the eight skaters from four countries.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old American skater with Chinese origin made twists
and spins in a flying-like dance.
</P>
<P>
Her performance gained a loud applause right from the beginning
to the end.
</P>
<P>
"I know they probably watched Olympics on TV and all the
competitions I've been at over the years and they've watched me
grow," Kwan said on the reaction from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
"I was just there to do it again and I was going out there to
basically concentrate. You are very sure of yourself and you are
confident, said Kwan. "When I started off, I knew I was going to
do it."
</P>
<P>
The short program was part of the event and the final result
will not come out until the long program on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Following Kwan was Russia's Maria Butyrskaya, who finished
third at the world championships and fourth at the Olympics,
overtook her compatriot Irina Slutskaya.
</P>
<P>
The latter, who was the silver medalist at the world figure
skating championships, was fifth because of her fall in a
performance.
</P>
<P>
France's Victoria Volchkova, the world championships fourth
place finisher, ranked third tonight.
</P>
<P>
Before the ladies' program, original dance was held.
</P>
<P>
The standings after the dance maintained the order as in
Wednesday's compulsory dance.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov were still
leading and their teammates, Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh,
were second.
</P>
<P>
The third on the standings were Elena Grushina and Ruslan
Goncharov from Ukraine.

Representatives from the Interpol, the Organization of African
Unity, the U.N. International Drug Control Program and World
Customs Organization also attended the three-day meeting ending
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting recommended that member states of the United
Nations should be encouraged to establish bilateral and
multilateral agreements on drug law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Another resolution was that postal services personnel be
provided with adequate training to help in detecting drug
offenses and that drug enforcement units improve cooperation with
other relevant services such as immigration and customs.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the anti-narcotics police unit, other state
departments, like the customs and judiciary as well as importers
and distributors of chemicals, should be involved in control of
the drugs, the meeting suggested.
</P>
<P>
The conference also asked more opportunities to be created for
convening operational meetings in order to improve knowledge of
procedures and relationships, both at national and international
levels, between different law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
With strict measures effected in many western countries,
attention is now being focused on Africa and other regions where
there are still loopholes in the anti-drugs campaign, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Deports 75,000 Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania deported more than
75,000 illegal immigrants last year, the Minister of Defense and
National Service, Edgar Maokola-Majogo, has said.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants came from Rwanda, Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, who were causing unrest in the
northwest regions of Kigoma and Kagera, media reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maokola-Majogo, who was presenting his ministry's 1998/99
budget estimates in the central city of Dodoma at the National
Assembly on Thursday, said that the influx of illegal aliens
heightened crimes such as theft, poaching, harassment and murder.
</P>
<P>
He said the escalating banditry incidents created fear and
uncertainties among the local people, forcing the Tanzanian armed
forces to carry out a special operation to maintain law and
order.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said that Tanzania will continue
co-operating with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo so
as to maintain peace in the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister also reportedly said that the Tanzania
People's Defense Forces will take part in a military exercise to be
held in South Africa soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
The law court looked into and verified a great amount of
testimony, written documents and other evidence, and heard the
opinions of the public prosecutors, Chen's defence lawyers and
Chen himself.
</P>

obtained from official contacts with foreign parties from July
1991 to November 1994 while serving as mayor and Party chief of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Among these items were eight gold and silver products, six de
luxe watches, four expensive pens, three cameras and one video
camera.

According to the appropriate rules and regulations these gifts,
obtained on diplomatic occasions, should have been be handed over
to the state.

It was also established that Chen, in pursuit of a corrupt and
decadent life, had instigated and conspired with Wang Baosen,

Beijing suburbs with public funds for the use and enjoyment of
himself and Wang.

The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court said that as a
state employee, Chen took valuable gifts during contacts with
foreign parties, violating related state regulations.
</P>
<P>
The court said Chen should have turned over these gifts to the
state, but did not, and illegally took the gifts as his own. His
actions, involving extraordinarily huge amounts of money, was
actually graft and must be punished according to law, the court
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who failed to fulfill his duties correctly, incited and
conspired with Wang Baosen to embezzle funds. Their actions were
contrary to the examination and approval procedures set by the
state regarding capital construction projects, the court pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Using this money, they built two luxurious villas and spent
large amounts there without restraint on pleasure-seeking and
wining and dining, causing especially huge losses of public
property and betraying the interests of the state and the
people. His actions are regarded as dereliction of duty and must
be punished in accordance with law, the court said.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 people, including those from various social
circles in the Chinese capital and press people, heard today's
public court verdict. Chen's family members were also present at
the court today.
</P>
<P>
The verdict of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court is a
judgment of first instance. According to the country's Criminal
Procedural Law, Chen may appeal to the Supreme People's Court
within 10 days, beginning the day after he received the court
verdict, if he disagrees with the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Prices Plunge at New Zealand's Wool Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Prices plunged at a wool sale
held Thursday in Napier, an east coastal city on North Island of
New Zealand, with 40 percent of the wool sent to auction passed
in, a local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the Napier wool sale, the first of the season, the New
Zealand Wool Group market indicator slumped 48 cents to 408 cents
in a poor start to the new auction season, The Dominion said.
</P>
<P>
The strong wool indicator fell 42 cents to 357 cents, while the
indicator for lambs wool dived 73 cents to 390 cents.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,680 clean tons (14,238 bales) of wool on offer at
Thursday's sale. Compared with the Napier sale on June 25,
crossbred prices for wool of 37 micron were up to 10 percent
cheaper. For all other fiber diameters, they were generally 7.5
percent cheaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that before the sale, the Wool Group had reduced
its forecast price for the coming season to 450 cents despite the
drop in the exchange rate for the New Zealand dollar, because of a
deterioration in demand.
</P>
<P>
The next wool sale will be at South Island's Christchurch on
August 5 and 6.

NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Kwan, world figure
skating champion in 1996 and 1998, produced a flawless performance
to bring the local crowd to their standing ovation here Thursday
in the women's short program at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
The American beamed after ranking first with a big margin,
saying: "I felt remarkably good. It was hard to concentrate
because the people were cheering so loud. I just enjoyed myself,
let loose, and let it go."
</P>
<P>
The delicate-looking Kwan said it was fun to be able to change
tempo right in the short program. "I could be dramatic. I could be
soft. I could be all the emotions at once."
</P>
<P>
She had a fall when she made a triple lutz during the warm up,
but she finished the action perfect in the race.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a warm-up and anything I do in the warm up doesn't
really matter. The warm-up is just to clean your mind and start
from scratch again. If you land a triple axel in warm up, it
doesn't matter, you still have to do it in the program," said Kwan.
</P>
<P>
A cheering crowd backed up Kwan whenever she appeared on the
ice.
</P>
<P>
"I know they probably watched the Olympics on TV, and all the
competitions I've been at over the years and they've watched me
grow," she said.

About 3,000 people have suffered from viral fever and 500 from
diarrhea in the malaria-prone district of Sunamganj, 188
kilometers northeast of here, The Bangladesh Observer daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the fever are high temperature, muscular pain
and headache, according to physicians.
</P>
<P>
Many people die of malaria every year in the district, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In order to control the spread of the diseases, the health
department and the local government have already distributed over
4,700 mosquito-nets among the people in the district. At the same
time health workers have been working round the clock in the
malaria-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that no other effective steps
have been taken to combat viral fever and diarrhea due to the lack
of medicine and medical facilities.

<HEADLINE> Panel Begins Investigating Election Fraud in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A special commission set up
Thursday by Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) has begun
to look into reports of election fraud and complaints made by some
political parties, NEC announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Election Results Control Commission consisting of four
members of the NEC is chaired by Kassie Neou, vice chairman of NEC.

So far, the commission has received 50 complaints from
political parties and has begun to look into them, Kassie Neon

<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, who is in Colombo for a summit of South Asian leaders,
said the outcome of his talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee was "zero," the Island newspaper reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local newspaper, Sharif said he told
his Indian counterpart that Pakistan wanted the dialogue between
the two countries to be resumed just as much India wanted them to
be resumed.
</P>
<P>
At their talks here on Wednesday on the sidelines of the South
Asian leaders' summit, Sharif and Vajpayee agreed to resume the
dialogue between the two arch-rivals in the region. And the two
countries' foreign secretaries have been asked to hold talks to
work out the "modalities" for the resumption of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"So let us resolve the issue of Kashmir in a serious and
substantive manner so that we would be able to make progress,"
Sharif was quoted as telling Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian prime minister was not willing to focus on
Kashmir prominently or wanted Kashmir to figure prominently in a
joint communique, according to Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"If that was the position, what is the point in having these
talks because Kashmir was the root cause of all the conflicts
between India and Pakistan. We did not want to hold talks for the
sake of talks but for the talks to succeed," the Pakistan prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On May 11 and 13 this year, India carried out nuclear tests,
and late in that month, Pakistan also conducted nuclear tests in a
tit-for-tat manner, prompting fears of a nuclear arms race in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would describe the outcome of his talks as a
"stalemate," Sharif said: "Yes, it is a stalemate. We are not here
to waste each others' time."
</P>
<P>
But he added that he and Vajpayee did exchange views on matters
concerning the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that his visit to Colombo for the summit of
the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) was a success, particularly because he had been able to
make his proposal on peace and security for South Asia in his
address to the opening of the three-day gathering on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo SAARC summit ends on Friday.

<HEADLINE> SEBI Plans to Curb on Short Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) is considering several measures to
streamline the stock markets in the country including a possible
ban on short sales on the downtick and disallowing 'naked' short
sales-or short sales of a scrip without actual possession of even
a single share, official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market watchdog is also expected to lay down specific
parameters for the inclusion of stocks in the carry-forward list,
after considering the opinions of the stock exchanges in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the these measures are crucial policy decisions,
the SEBI is expected to take them up before a final verdict is
given, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The issues relating to short sales are being seen as crucial
for the safety of the market, since the regulator is keen on
clamping down on misuse of the carry-forward mechanism.
</P>
<P>
SEBI officials said that the inherent inadequacies of the
present system make it possible for a short seller to earn money
despite not having any shares. With stocklending now a reality, it
is felt that a measure where the short seller is made to borrow
the stocks would be in order. Naked short sales are completely
banned in developed markets.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Decides not to Seek Outside Aid for Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government in
principle has decided not to seek financial aid from abroad to
provide relief and succor to the victims of current flood.
</P>
<P>
The government had sufficient stock of food to feed the
flood-affected people, a media report Friday quoted an official as
saying here Thursday. "We'll try to manage the present situation
with internal resources, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had instructed an emergency stock
of 1.2 million tons of grains to face the flood and post-flood
situation in the country, the official stated.
</P>
<P>
The government had now one million tons of rice in its own
stock and it was procuring another 0.2 million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Ministry of Finance had allocated 15 million taka
(0.319 million U.S. dollars) apart from budget allocation for cash
relief.
</P>
<P>
Under the government supervision, the departments concerned had
already distributed 10.67 million taka (0.23 million dollars) and
26,112 tons of grains to the flood victims in the 37 flood-hit
districts.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) had been requested to send
some five million water-purifying tablets to ensure pure drinking
water for the marooned people and keep safe from the water-borne
diseases in the aftermath of flood, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since early this month, heavy rains have downpoured in this
South Asian country, and so far, over 17.5 million people living
in the 37 districts out of the total of 64 have been affected by
flood, with death toll rising to 188 as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 kilometers of roads, 1,722 kilometers of embankments
and 2,215 bridges and culverts damaged, and about 200,000 houses
and nearly 200,000 hectares of standing crops washed away by the
flood.
</P>
<P>
Diarrhea, dysentery and other flood-borne diseases have broken
out in some flood-hit districts as acute crisis of drinking water
was prevailing there, reports said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the flood situation has improved slowly, with the
situation having returned normal in 11 of the 37 flood-hit
districts and improved in nine districts, according to officials
of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.

go.

only listening for the bell to sound, clocked in 29 minutes 24.28
seconds for the title, while Kipsang was confused about what to do.

<P>
Kipsang recovered his composure quickly to secure the silver
medal in 29:36.80.

Management and Coordination Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The jump surpassed the previous high of 4.1 percent set in both
April and May. The number of unemployed has risen by 24 percent
since 1997, going up by 550,000 to 2.84 million, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate was a high for both men and women, with the

jobless rate breaking the previous record of 4.0 percent in April
to hit 4.2 percent, the agency said.
</P>

The agency said the number of unemployed men shot up 28 percent
to 1.69 million, while that of unemployed women jumped 18.6

agency official said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Labor Ministry said in a separate report that the
ratio of job offers to job seekers dropped to 0.51 in June from
0.53 in May. This meant there were only 51 job offers for every

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Evaluate Alternative Health-Care Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar health authorities is
holding a seminar here to evaluate the country's alternative
health-care financing for effective disease control and promotion
of public health-care services.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which began Thursday, is sponsored by the

</P>
<P>
Quoting Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein, Friday's
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar said health-care
should not depend solely on the private sector, calling for saving
harmonious efforts between the government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that although the government is
increasing health expenditure, it has not reached the satisfactory
level yet due to rising of prices in medicines and medical
equipment, noting that it is difficult for the state to bear all
the national health expenditures alone due to increase in breaking
out of infectious and non-infectious diseases which is a problem
in developing nations including Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for implementing cost-sharing health
project, a contribution to the income, calling for attending to
the poor who are not able to reach the cost-sharing health system
to enjoy proper health-care.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the health personnel to strive for promotion of
public health standard and saving people's lives.

projects.

<HEADLINE> Henan Province Increasing Export of Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number and variety
of agricultural products from central China's Henan Province are
being exported overseas, with total trade volume hitting nearly
700 million U.S. dollars by June this year.
</P>
<P>
This increase is mostly attributed to the mushrooming of local
facilities for agricultural exports such as bases for seeds in
Xinyang, Luohe and Luoyang, aquatic products in southern parts of
the province, fruits and edible fungus in western parts of Henan,
and flower-growing in Xuchang and Luoyang.
</P>
<P>
In addition to primary items, local exports of processed
agricultural products such as canned food and fodder are rising
sharply.
</P>
<P>
Henan has expanded its exports to a greater number of countries
and regions including the ROK, Southeast Asia, Britain, the United
States, and Germany, along with the traditional destinations of
Japan, Russia, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to further improve its export range and
increase the export of livestock, farm and sideline products,
especially meat, fur and wool, and exports green and healthy food.
</P>
<P>
Local seeds are now exported to a dozen countries and region.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's leading producers of agricultural
products, Henan contributes a great deal to China's output of
wheat, cotton and oil-bearing crops.
</P>
<P>
The use of more than 64 million U.S. dollars of overseas
investment for local agriculture is also helping boost the growth
of related exports.

<HEADLINE> Grain Prices Up In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Grain prices in Henan Province,
a leading producer in central China, have stopped their downward
movement, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The price of a kg of both wheat and corn was 1.2 yuan on
average since the end of June, 7.1 percent more for wheat and 0.8
percent more for corn than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
This is related to the nationwide reform of the grain marketing
system organized by the State Council, a provincial agriculture
official says.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government asked all parts of the province to
implement the central government policy of purchasing all grain
sold to the state at a negotiable price and putting a bottom
purchase price on grain as a protective measure. Both prices are
higher than the market price, and in this way, state-owned grain
departments have some control over grain.
</P>
<P>
However, agriculture analysts think the grain price is still
not high enough to offset state subsidized purchases.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Reaffirms Political Settlement for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reaffirmed on Thursday that the Kosovo crisis must be
solved by political means, the state news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The issue must be solved through political means, and talks
between the Serbian authorities and Kosovo political parties must
be resumed, Milosevic told a meeting with a European Union team
visiting the region.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic emphasized that the international community should
condemn terrorist activities in Kosovo, and cut off all sources of
funds to the "terrorists".
</P>
<P>
Serbia and the Yugoslav Federation are determined to curb any
violence that poses threats to the peace, freedom and the equality
of all ethnic groups in Kosovo, warned Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation, formed with diplomats from Austria, Britain
and Germany, arrived in this region on Tuesday, in a bid to
mediate a settlement to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Milosevic, the delegation on Wednesday
visited the central and western towns of Malisevo and Kijevo, both
scenes of recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also had talks with ethnic Albanian leaders in
Pristina, capital of the rebel province Kosovo, urging them to
unite for talks with Belgrade over the future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Kosovo in late February when Serbian
forces launched a crackdown on separatists in the southern Serbian
province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Postulate Plateau Affects Climate Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The upheaval of the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau is quite likely an extremely important factor contributing
to the ongoing transition to a colder global climate, according to
scientists attending an international symposium on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau here.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese and foreign geologists and meteorologists agree
with views expressed during the recent symposium.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiaodong, a researcher at the Institute of Plasma Physics,
explained that global warming over the past two years has resulted
from the green house effect and the El Nino phenomenon. However,
he also pointed out that the world has witnessed the tendency for
a colder climate over the past 60 million years.
</P>
<P>
Liu said scientists studying the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have
observed that the earth has experienced three distinct periods of
colder climates.
</P>
<P>
The first period occurred some 36 million years ago, the
second around 15 million years, and the third within the past 2-3
million years. The three periods coincided with the three periods
of upheavals on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Scientists postulated that the plateau, an area covering 2.5
million sq.km., experienced serious denudation during the
upheaval periods.
</P>
<P>
The fact that denudation siphoned vast amounts of carbon
dioxide and reduced the atmosphere's effectiveness in absorbing
heat from sunshine resulting in a colder global climate.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium agreed that research concerning
the relationship between climate changes and upheavals on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will be extremely important for forecasting
future global climate patterns.

<HEADLINE> Japan's New Foreign Minister to Visit China in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Newly appointed Japanese Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura said early Friday that he plans to visit
China in August to make preparations for Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's upcoming official visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Komura, who succeeded Keizo Obuchi as foreign minister, made the
remarks at a press conference after the first cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi formed his cabinet Thursday evening after being elected
prime minister by the Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
While in Beijing, Komura is expected to meet Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and discuss the contents of a joint communique
the two countries plan to sign during Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was initially scheduled to visit China in mid-July as
foreign minister, but canceled his trip due to political uncertainty
in Japan following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's major defeat
in the July 12 House of Councillors election.

UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A preliminary investigation
shows no evidence of an explosion in the plane crash which last
month killed the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative
for Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye, and seven others, U.N. Spokesman
Juan Carlos Brandit said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At this point in the investigation, which is being led by the
National Civil Aviation Agency of Cote d'Ivoire, no evidence has
emerged of either an explosion or fire in the aircraft prior to
impact," said Carlos.
</P>

The crash took place on June 26 as the plane approached its
landing point in Cote d'Ivoire. There were several communications
between the aircraft and the control tower in Abidjan prior to the
crash, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"These communications gave no indication that the flight was

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Minister Leaves for Border Talks With Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Public Security
Minister Juan Rafael Lizano left here Thursday for Nicaragua to
discuss border disputes with Nicaraguan officials.
</P>
<P>
His visit came one week after a conflict broke out on a border
river between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After the conflict, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman said
sovereignty of the river is not negotiable, and it is defended
with weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican security minister is expected to meet with his
Nicaraguan counterpart, Jaime Cuadra.
</P>
<P>
He said before leaving for Nicaragua that his country will not
back down from what it considers its right to unencumbered
navigation on the border river.
</P>
<P>
Under treaties in force, the river is under Nicaragua's
sovereignty, but Costa Rica has a right to free navigation.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica believed that the transit of their police on the
river is assured by the treaty, but Nicaragua insisted that armed
personnel could not navigate on the river.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua also believed its sovereignty over the river gave its
authorization to supervise the transit of Costa Rican authorities.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican foreign ministry sources here said that Lizano's
visit might pave way for another meeting between the two foreign
ministers or even the two presidents.

<HEADLINE> Round UP: U.N., Taliban to strive for Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia and
officials of the U.N. Afghanistan mission will meet in Kabul
Saturday to find ways as to how dozens of international relief
agencies which left Kabul last week are enabled to revive their
suspended operations.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from Kabul said that the Taliban militia have
agreed to meet the U.N. officials after repeated efforts by the
U.N. and other international donors.
</P>
<P>
Until now the Taliban are firmed not to budge from its stance
and lift the relocation order it had earlier served on these
relief agencies which led to closure of their offices in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Peshawar-based Afghan NGOs
Coordination Bureau (ANCB) has offered its mediation between the
Taliban and foreign relief agencies within its capacity to resolve
the misunderstanding between the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal issued in Peshawar by ANCB, Chairman Qamaruddin
Jabarkhel said "ANCB believes if the prerequisite of international
guidelines and Islamic and cultural values of Afghanistan
respected by the NGOs and the Taliban authority provides proper
facilities, it will be possible to achieve the ultimate goal of
serving the Afghan public."
</P>
<P>
"The international humanitarian goals while making decisions
should strive to resolve their conflicts with the Taliban through
negotiations and consider the welfare of Afghans in general and
the residents of Kabul in particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Agency Coordination Body for
Afghan Relief (ACBAR) held its general body meeting in Peshawar
Tuesday and reviewed the situation arising out of the policy
adopted by the Taliban administration towards foreign aid
organizations and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed developments in the light of fresh
initiative by UN and ICRC urging Islamic Taliban militia to lift
relocation order served on international relief agencies earlier
this month, leading to closure of offices and suspension of
operations by dozens of 30 international relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no specific agenda except that ACBAR reviewed
the latest developments in Kabul and response of the Taliban
militia to UN initiative to help restore relief operations in
war-riddled Afghanistan," a spokesman for ACBAR said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it was a close door meeting attended by
all the ACBAR members. After U.N. agencies, a CBAR based in
Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, is
the largest coordinating body with 72 members including Afghan
organizations coordinating international relief operations in
war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Qari Din Mohammad, a senior Taliban official for planning, said
in an interview with the local press last week that the Taliban
was willing to negotiate with the aid bodies but it will not
change its stand.
</P>
<P>
He said that those left the Afghan capital city were welcome to
return provided they accept the terms set out by the Taliban .
</P>
<P>
More than 30 international relief agencies closed their offices
and suspended operation last Tuesday when they refused to comply
the order by the Taliban militia served on them to relocate their
offices at polytechnic institute Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Except U.N., ICRC mission and international aid mission, aid
workers of all the remaining agencies have left Kabul and reached
Pakistan waiting for settlement of the core issue of relocation of
their offices between the Taliban and international donors.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Raise Environmental Protection Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental Protection Bureau
of the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China has recently
received more than 20 letters from residents of Lhasa, capital of
the Autonomous Region, complaining about the ever-increasing dust
and garbage pollution in their lives.
</P>
<P>
There are five cement plants around Lhasa, and one of them is a
pillar industry of the Autonomous Region. The environmental
protection bureau is already consulting with the plant to invest
more than three million yuan (about 370,000 U.S.dollars) in dust
pollution treatment, said Losang, director of the environmental
protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government held a conference on
environmental protection in June, which concluded that "protecting
the environment is essentially protecting productivity, and the
autonomous region must not achieve progress at the expense of its
environment."
</P>
<P>
Concrete measures were worked out at the conference to allocate
more funds for environmental protection, improve environmental
monitoring systems, enhance people's environmental protection
awareness, and improve the capital's garbage treatment
capabilities and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
The general environmental quality of the Autonomous Region is
quite good, as it is one enormous land left almost untouched in
China, he said, adding that economic and population growth are
putting pressure on the land.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet Daily", the leading newspaper of the region, recently
published a report calling for strengthened protection for a
600-hectare stretch of wet grasslands in northern suburban
Lhasa. The call received a quick response, with the city's mayor
inspecting the region immediately and working out specific
protection measures.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen nature reserves, covering a total area of 325,000
square kilometers, have been established in Tibet, and poaching
activities are frequently stopped by local residents, whose
environmental protection awareness has heightened remarkably,
Losang said.

<HEADLINE> China on Extension of Mandate of U.N. Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The key questions now were
the serious differences that persisted between the government of
Georgia and athe Abkhaz leadership with regard to the future
political status of Abkhaz, China stressed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of the Security Council of the United
Nations which adopted a resolution to extend the mandate of the
U.N. mission in the country, Qin Huasun, Chinese ambassador to the
United Nations, said that only when both sides had demonstrated
their political will to solve their differences, would the efforts
of the international community play a role.
</P>
<P>
The final settlement of the question depended on the people
themselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the recent high-level meeting between the two sides
was welcome, and he awaited the direct contacts between the
Georgian president and the Abkhaz leader at an early date which
would be the first step to confidence-building between the two
sides and would mark a beginning towards solving the current
problems.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the United Nations mission in Georgia always
maintained excellent relationships with both sides, and it was
disturbing that the mission's security was threatened by the
instability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China condemned the terrorist attacks and believed
that the two parties would honor their promises to safeguard
international personnel.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Appeals for More Aid to His Country's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Alhaji Ahmad Kabbah, the
President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, on Thursday appealed
to the international community for more aid to his conntry's
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Special United Nations Conference on Sierra
Leone held Thursday, President Kabbah said, "peace and security
should be considered in the context of our capacity to pursue and
achieve. Our plans for reconstruction and long-term economic
recovery are attainable. But we cannot talk about peace-building
without reference to the material elements."
</P>
<P>
"The Monitoring Group established by the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOMOG) has continued its objective of
restoring peace and security in those parts of the country where
the rebels and remnants of the junta continue to operate," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG has been experiencing logistics and related problems
in its efforts to rid the affected areas of those destructive
elements, and to restore normal community life there," he told
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said thus there was an urgent need for additional
material and logistics support for ECOMOG and for the
deployment of observes working with ECOMO.
</P>
<P>
The President said he feared that unless assistance for
ECOMOG was forthcoming, the rebel activities will not only
continue and create more human tragedy, but will also drain the
country's limited resources.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah added that the poor conditions of the roads, bridges and
social infrastructures such as school, administrative and health
facilities in the rural areas of the country, have greatly
deterred progress in establishing normal lives in those areas,
and have seriously compromised the Country's capacity to
resettle refugees and the displaced.
</P>
<P>
The Special United Nations Conference on Sierra Leone is
convened to address the problems facing the country's
reconstruction and rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Woos Support for Sierra Leone Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday called for international support for Sierra Leone's
peace-building efforts as it is a test whether Africa can heel the
conflict wounds.
</P>
<P>
Opening the U.N. Special Conference on Sierra Leone, Annan said
Sierra Leone President Albaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah has taken a
number of steps to combat the effects of nine months of misrule by
the military junta since he was restored to office in March.
</P>
<P>
The West African country has also sought to lay a new and
lasting foundation for national reconciliation, reconstruction and
rehabilitation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the junta and rebel remnants to lay down their
arms without further delay as there have been continuing attacks
against the government and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Since March 500 victims of mutilations including amputations
have occurred with more people losing their lives or remaining in
the bush in horror, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the peace-building initiatives by Kabbah's
government and international bodies which recognize that "to
ensure lasting gains, the long-term roots of conflict, especially
poverty, must be addressed."
</P>
<P>
"This is why I convened this Special Conference -- to focus
international attention on th situation and to ensure that we
attack the problems with a collective unity of purpose," the
secretary-general noted.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah, elected to office in 1996, was toppled by the military
junta in May 1997. The Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) took over Freetown from the junta in February 1998 and
Kabbah returned to office eventually.
</P>
<P>
Annan called the one-day meeting in consultation with the
government of Sierra Leone and the ECOWAS, focusing on a
disarmament and demobilization plan for former combatants and
other peace-building measures in the country.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping and related activities of the ECOMAS,
including its need for financial and other support to alleviate
the manpower and logistical constraints, are on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The conference brings together members of the ECOWAS, the
European Union, the U.N. Security Council and a number of other
U.N. member states, the Organization of African Unity, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Commonwealth and the
Bretton Woods Institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations Thursday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission in Georgia for a further period of six
months until January 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
expressed its concern over the resumption of hostilities which
took place in May 1998 and called upon the the government of
Georgia and the Abkhaz side to observe strictly the Moscow
Agreement signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed its concern over the significant
outflow of refugees resulting from the recent hostilities, and
reaffirmed the right of all refugees and displaced persons to
return to their homes in secure conditions in accordance with
international law.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the two sides to fulfill their
obligations in this regard, and demanded in particular that the
Abkhaz side allow the unconditional and immediate return of all
persons displaced since the resumption of hostilities in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Security council urged the parties to display without delay
the necessary political will to achieve substantial results on the
key issues of the negotiations, with full respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, within the
framework of the United Nations-led peace process and through
direct dialogue, and to cooperate fully with the efforts made by
the U.N. secretary-general and his special representative.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the meeting of the parties held in Geneva
on July 23-35, 1998 and called upon them to continue and increase
their active engagement in this process initiated by the U.N.
secretary-general aimed at achieving a comprehensive political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the acts of violence against the personnel of the
UNOMIG, and demanded that the parties, in particular the Georgian
authorities, take determined measures to put a stop to such acts
which subvert the peace process in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Provide Food Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States will soon
send 500,000 tons of wheat worth 62.5 million U.S. dollars to
Indonesia to help overcome difficulties caused by its collapsed
economy, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brian Atwood, administrator of the Agency for International
Development, told a news conference that Indonesia is too
important to go without outside help during the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the 500,000 tons of wheat, Washington is ready to
provide up to one million more tons for Indonesia, Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States made the decision to assist
Indonesia because its government had promised to hold democratic
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is part of a 300 million U.S. dollar pledge the
United States made at an international donors conference in Paris.
The donors pledged 7.9 billion U.S. dollars in new disbursements
by March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Set up Regional Telecom Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) plans to invest 300 million U.S. Dollars
to set up a regional telecommunication network.
</P>
<P>
Aaccording to a COMESA document issued Thursday in Mombasa, a
port city in Kenya, the network, which will be known as the
Common Market Telecommunication (COMTEL) company, is expected to
help expand trade within the region.
</P>
<P>
The document was presented during the annual Kenyan
ambassadors' meeting in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, said a
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of a study on inter-connectivity and
tariff harmonization of telecommunication network undertaken by
Telia Swedtel AB for COMESA with financing from the African
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is planned to be implemented in five years,
is expected to improve the standard of services to be offered to
360 million customers as low tariffs would make it possible for
increased telecommunication traffic.
</P>
<P>
Among the states involved are Angola, Botswana, Burundi,
Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho,
Malawi, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda,
Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa meeting also endorsed Thursday that the project
will have representation of national telecommunications
operators.
</P>
<P>
"A reliable and efficient telecommunication network in the
COMESA region has long been identified as a key factor in
facilitating the region's economic integration," said the
document.
</P>
<P>
The existing telecommunication infrastructure in most
countries is said to be far below the desired standards.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the project has already received support
from the third summit of the COMESA in Kinshasa held on June 29.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Resumes Investment Program to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States and South
Korea Thursday signed a new bilateral agreement, reopening the
U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) program to
invest in the crisis-hit country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement means OPIC can offer insurance and other types of
financial support to U.S. companies that want to do business in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
OPIC suspended the program with South Korea in 1991 due to
concerns about labor rights. But the White House said recently
that conditions had since improved. But it seems business groups
have played a crucial role by throwing heavy pressure on
Washington to end the ban on the OPIC program.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who attended
the signing ceremony, said the worst of South Korea's financial
crisis appeared to be over.
</P>
<P>
"The hemorrhaging has been staunched.... I believe we have seen
very important progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Summers warned challenges still remained, "particularly in
the financial sector, particularly in the structural area."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling May Weaken: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
said Thursday that the upward trend of the Kenyan Shilling
against hard currencies is expected to change in the second half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Shilling's appreciation from 70 to 59 Shillings against one
U.S. Dollar within a year is due to low demand for foreign
exchange by importers and high inflows from investors who cash in
on the high yields on Treasury bills, said CBK.
</P>
<P>
However, CBK Governor Micah Cheserem said the Shilling may
become weakening as the government implements the belt-tightening
measures announced in the budget for the 1998/99 year (July/June).
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that the expected recovery will result
in greater demand for foreign exchange which in turn will exert
a downward pressure on the Shilling's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
A tighter management of government revenues and expenditures
would result in a reduced borrowing by the government from the
banking sector, leading to "more downward pressure on the
exchange rate," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheserem cautioned that the Kenyan market tends to
over-react when the local currency is either depreciating or
appreciating.
</P>
<P>
CBK will continue with its strategy of allowing the
Shilling's exchange rate to be determined by market forces, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The target, he added, is to achieve a Shilling exchange rate
that is relatively stable and competitive.
</P>
<P>
However, he said CBK will stand ready to intervene in the
market to smooth out any fluctuations in the exchange rate
occasioned by non-economic sentiments which are not of a
permanent nature.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Thursday named film star Michael Douglas of the United States as
its messenger of peace for his campaign for nuclear disarmament,
the control of small arms and payment of the huge U.S. debt to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Michael Douglas said "I hope to use
the entertainment communications ability we have around the
world to talk a little less about movies and hopefully a lot
more about some of the issues pertaining to the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"This probably means as much to me as any of the two Oscars
that I got," he said.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said he considered nuclear proliferation a human
right issue, the right not to fear countries which have nuclear
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the spread of small arms was particularly prevalent
in Albania, where the United Nations is attempting to collect
illicit weapons held by civilians, and proliferation of small
arms was killing people around the world in a growing multitude
of civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Douglas won his first Academy award in 1975 for producing
"One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," which won five awards
including best picture. He received a best actor Oscar in 1987
for his role as Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street".

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Navy F-14 fighters
collided Thursday over the eastern Mediterranean Sea with an
aviator killed, said the Navy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two jets from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight Eisenhower
collided at 6:11 p.m. local time when the carrier was about 150
miles southwest of western Turkey, said a Navy spokesman, Cmdr.
Brian Cullin.
</P>
<P>
One of the fighters crashed into the sea and its two crew
members ejected but one was killed, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The carrier Eisenhower had been in the Mediterranean for just
over a month and is scheduled to remain in the region through
October.
</P>
<P>
The planes, which are from the VF-103 squadron embarked on the
Eisenhower, were involved in "routine flight."
</P>
<P>
Only 10 of the warplanes are on the carrier. F-14s provide
protection to the carrier battle group by conducting routine daily
air patrols.
</P>
<P>
The Navy said that the reason for the collision is under
investigation.
