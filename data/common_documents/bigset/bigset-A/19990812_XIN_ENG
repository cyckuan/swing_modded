<HEADLINE> Nuclear Techniques Widely Used in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The peaceful use of nuclear
techniques in Zambia has spread over several sectors in Zambia,
namely health, industry, education, agriculture and mining, a
Zambian official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gavin Silwamba, acting director general of Central Board of
Health, told the opening of a three-day seminar on security and
safety of nuclear materials and radioactive sources that "with
this in mind, the benefits that will arise from the knowledge
gained from this workshop will be invariably spread over these
different sectors."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, five cases of attempted illicit trafficking
of spent nuclear materials have almost taken place in the country
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately these sources did not end up in health hazard or
deaths due to timely action by the security agencies and the
regulatory authorities, he told the regional seminar.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba challenged the participants to ensure that a safe
environment prevails for their respective communities.
</P>
<P>
This seminar will provide good opportunities for those who are
involved in obtaining relevant information to detect and control
the irregular and in most cases, clandestine movement of nuclear
and radioactive materials, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The president of the U.N.
Security Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said here Wednesday
that his Council hopes both India and Pakistan to solve their
problems through bilateral consultations.
</P>
<P>
In answering a Xinhua question, the president said, "Members of
the Council encourages both India and Pakistan to settle their
problems through bilateral consultations."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council took note of a statement issued by
(U.N.) the Secretary-General," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after the 15-nation Security

<P>
The U.N. spokesman said Annan was "increasingly concerned at
the repeated incidents between India and Pakistan and urges that
the differences between them be resolved by peaceful means."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Security Council Backs OAU Efforts to End Horn of  Africa War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
said Wednesday that the 15-nation body will continue to support
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in its efforts to end the
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said, the members of the
Council "expressed their full satisfaction and support for the
continuing efforts of the Organization of African Unity."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council reaffirmed their willingness to
consider appropriate support to implement a peace agreement
between the two parties," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement after the Council was briefed
on Wednesday morning by Mohamed Sahnoun, the U.N. special envoy in
Africa, on progress towards negotiated settlement of the conflict
between the two African countries.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council commended the OAU, including the OAU
Chairman and President of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika and
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim" for their efforts to put an
end to the conflict on the Horn of Africa, the statement said.
</P>
<P>

border. The border has not been officially demarcated since
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Denounces Israeli Action Against Al-Aqsa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Wednesday
strongly denounced Israel's recent seal of an opening of Al-Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest site.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based league termed the action an "attack" aimed at
further frustrating the Muslims and breaching the holiness of the
Islamic sanctity.
</P>
<P>
Such practice contradicts Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
pledges to advance the Middle East peace process, the 22-nation
pan-Arab forum said.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to impose its presence and hegemony in Jerusalem,
denying the rights of Arab Muslims and Christians, the Arab League
said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the world community to press Israel to guarantee
Muslim's freedom of worship in Al-Aqsa Mosque and the human rights
of the Palestinian people, keep the demography or legal status of
the city intact, implement international resolutions, and refrain
from unilateral actions before the final status talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1947 U.N. resolution, Jerusalem should be under the
control of the world organization. But Israel occupied the whole
city in the 1948 and the 1967 Mideast war and has declared the
city as its "eternal and undivided" capital.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the traditional Arab East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel will discuss the fate of Jerusalem
in the final status talks that should have started by May 1996.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks with Barak over Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
talked by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the
prospect for the Middle East peace process, the White House said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, spokesman for White House National Security
Council, said the two leader spoke for about 25 minutes on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They talked about the peace process generally, reviewed the
situation on the ground, talked about all tracks, including the
Palestinian track and Syria and Lebanon," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Leavy also said Clinton and Barak discussed ways to make
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to the Middle East a
success.
</P>
<P>
Albright, at Barak's request, has postponed her trip to the
region to give the Israeli leader more time to work out his
problems with the Palestinians over the timing for carrying out
last year's Wye River land-for-security agreement.
</P>
<P>
Before going, Albright intends to meet in Washington with the
senior Palestinian negotiator Aseb Erekat and with Yasser
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, widely known also as Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said both Clinton's
talks with Barak and Albright's planned meeting with Palestinian
officials here are "designed to see how we can be as helpful as
possible, both in insuring the implementation of the Wye River
agreement as well as assisting the parties in pursuing a permanent
peace accord."
</P>
<P>
"Those two objectives are what Albright will be working on,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due in Jerusalem on September 2 and will hold talks
there with Israeli officials. Then she will be in Gaza to meet
with Palestinians and in Damascus to hold talks with Syrian
officials.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israel's Blocking of Al-Aqsa Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday condemned the
blocking of the entrance gate to famous Al-Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem, calling on "followers of Islam and all divine religions
to show suitable reaction to it."
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi said Israel's "continued
desecration of Muslim sanctities indicated that the entity is
negligent of the sanctities of all divine religions, especially
those of the world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community shoulders a grave
responsibility towards the issue and urged the Muslim world to
"concentrate efforts on liberating" Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is expected to use all its means
to prevent gradual demographic changes in the holy Gods (Jerusalem)
and adopt serious measures against the Zionist regime," Asefi
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police Tuesday sealed an opening in the outer
wall of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site.
</P>
<P>
The action was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
coordination with the public security ministry.
</P>
<P>
The closure came when the wall opening of the mosque was under
renovation by the Islamic Trust. During the recent renovations, a
window on the compound's outer wall, which is not far from the
Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, was enlarged into a
door-sized opening.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said that
the enlargement of the window was a violation of the unwritten
agreement between the Israeli authority and the Islamic Trust that
neither side introduce changes at the holy site.

<HEADLINE> German Defendant Hearing Held, Inquiry Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The court hearing for the
arrested German businessman Helmut Hofer was held Wednesday in
the presence of his lawyer at Tehran's public court.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Tehran Justice Department Saeed Noubari said
the inquiry into Hofer's charges was adjourned until the next
court hearing and the judge will announce a date for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September 1997 for illicit sexual
relations with an Iranian woman and was sentenced to death
in January 1998. Iranian laws prohibit affairs between a
non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer argued that he had converted to Islam before
having an affair with the Iranian woman. The death sentence
was then rejected by Iran's Supreme Court, which ordered a
retrial.
</P>
<P>
He was released from jail on bail in April but was again put
behind bars in August. The reason for his re-arrest, according to
judicial officials, was his "links with certain foreign elements
and the possibility of his fleeing from the country."
</P>
<P>
Nobari had been quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency as saying "Hofer's charges are of the kind that according
to the law, must be held behind closed doors."
</P>
<P>
Hofer's lawyer Malek Houshang Qahhari had explained that
according to law, any court where talk may be made of unethical
issues, should be held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
He had said he was not aware of any possible fresh charges
against his client.

<HEADLINE> HIV Prevalence Reduced by Half in Uganda: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Painstaking efforts have
successfully curbed the spreading of AIDS and HIV in Uganda with
HIV infection rate reduced by half in the past few years, an
official with Uganda AIDS Commission told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anne Nakaweesi, coordinator with the AIDS organization,
said:"Although this is a big achievement, but the rate is still
unacceptably high." The infection rate still stands at 12 percent
in the east African country which once had the highest rate in the
world of some 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"At Nsambya hospital sentinel site, the HIV infection rate has
declined from 29.5 percent in 1992 to 13.4 percent in 1998. These
declines have been most marked among the 15-19 year olds. Among
the above age group, the infection rate fell from 32.2 percent in
1991 to 10.3 percent in 1997," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator attributed this progress to the government's
sensitization work, effective anti-HIV/AIDS measures including
setting up of counselling centers and safe sex.
</P>
<P>
Since the first case of AIDS was reported in the country in
1982, more than 1.5 million people have died of the epidemic. The
HIV infection rate was over 30 percent in early 1990s. Now Uganda
is the only African country which has reduced its HIV prevalence
rate.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Minister Held Responsible for Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The indictment of the
former Rwandan Minister for Family and Women's Affairs, Pauline
Nyiramasuhuko, has been amended to include six additional counts,
one of which accuses her of being responsible for rape.
</P>
<P>
Nyiramasuhuko is held responsible for rape "as part of a
widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population on
political, ethnic and racial grounds" in Butare, central Rwanda,
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said in a
press release available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accused is jointly charged with her son, Arsene Shalom
Ntahobali, a former businessman and leader of a local militia,
said the U.N. court based in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
In the previous indictment, only Ntahobali who now faces four
new counts, was charged with committing crimes of sexual violence.
 The two are now jointly charged with ten counts of genocide,
conspiracy to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Nyiramasuhuko faces a separate charge of direct and public
incitement to commit genocide.
</P>
<P>
The accused, with the absence of soldiers and others, were
alleged to have set up road blocks, where they identified,
abducted and killed members of the Tutsi population. When
abducting their victims, they often forced them to undress
completely before forcing them into vehicles and taking them to
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The indictment further alleges that Ntahobali, assisted by
unknown " accomplices," participated in the kidnapping and raping
of Tutsi women.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were allegedly killed
in 1994 Rwanda genocide. The U. N. Security Council set up the
court in Arusha to try the chief suspects of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The former minister was arrested on July 18 in Nairobi, Kenya
and transferred on the same day to Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Her son was arrested on July 24 and transferred on the same day
to the town.

MAPUTO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao said here Wednesday that the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) summit in Maputo next Wednesday will
not decide to provide human and material resources to help the
Angolan government fight the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
It is inappropriate to send troops in any form, the minister
was quoted by the Mozambique News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Simao said that his government will take stand on the
Angolan crisis after the summit has worked out a framework.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC summit will make evaluation (of the situation in
Angola)," he said, adding that only after the evaluation, decision
could be made on what to do.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged that Mozambique will always contribute to
the peace cause of the world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the closure of the Christian broadcasting station
Eclesia and the arrests of the director and three reporters by the
Angolan government, Simao said that it was understandable because
Angola is still in war.
</P>
<P>
The authorities has the right to take measures to prevent
anything harmful to the national security, especially when the
situation is tense, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende
told a press conference Tuesday that many possibilities including
military intervention in Angola exist, but it is up to the
regional leaders to decide what to do at the coming summit.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade Deficit Soars in First 7 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli trade deficit rose to
4.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven months of 1999, up
29.6 percent over the same period last year, the Central Bureau of
Statistic reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, import rose by 7
percent, reaching 17.1 billion dollars, the report said. Export
only saw a slight 1 percent growth, amounting to 12.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
About half the deficit rise derived from the import of
civilian aircraft and another 36 percent from the import of raw
diamonds, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Export of diamonds rose in January-July period by 13 percent,
or 380 million dollars while the import of raw diamonds increased
by 32 percent, or 750 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit increase came after a continuous decline in
1997 and 1998, with a 25 percent decrease each year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As its economy becomes more and more independent, Israel has
narrowed its gap between import and export in recent years, but
the worldwide financial chaos last year has hampered its exports.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that recent figures showed that the trade
deficit has stabilized at a high level. The monthly increase in
export since April comes to only 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Polio Vaccination Campaign Launched in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has launched a
countrywide campaign of vaccination against polio for all children
aged five and below, sources from the Ministry of Health told
Rwanda News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Ezechias Rwabuhihi underscored that the massive
polio eradication campaign is aimed at kicking out polio once for
all by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The population has been mobilized and sensitized for a long
time, and therefore they are aware of its necessity and are
seriously responding to the government's initiative," the minister
declared.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the same ministry said that during the last
immunization campaign held in March this year, the northwestern
prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri had the lowest turn-outs
which was 77 percent whereas countrywide results were 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The northwestern prefectures had the poorest turn-outs due to
the insecurity which was rocking the region. However, we expect
the highest outcome this time in the range of 100 percent," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sub-Saharan countries have got the best performance
in polio eradication campaign because they followed up the
required procedures unlike Rwanda, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that immunization campaign will continue not only with
the eradication of polio, but also on tuberculosis, measles,
whooping cough as well as other related diseases.
</P>
<P>
The next immunization campaign against polio and vitamin A
provision to curb night-blindness will continue in mid next
September.

<HEADLINE> Total Eclipse Darkens Iranian Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- This century's last solar
eclipse was observed in many parts of Iran, attracting thousands
of foreign scientists and tourists and driving people to mosques
for mass prayers.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, the solar eclipse began to darken
the sky over Maku, West Azarbaijan province, and then took place
in other regions.
</P>
<P>
Total solar eclipse was seen in the provinces of Kurdistan,
Kermanshah, Lorestan, Isfahan, Kerman and Sistan-Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Tehran, only partial eclipse was seen, which
began after 3:00 a.m. (1030 GMT) and lasted for about half an
hour. But Isfahan, an ancient city in central Iran, provided best
view of the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Islamic traditions, solar and lunar
eclipse, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, beget mass
prayers.
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that many
civil servants left office early for safety reasons, causing
traffic jams; and many people preferred to stay home to watch the
eclipse on television, which broadcast live from various cities.
</P>
<P>
Since a few weeks ago, health authorities have launched
extensive programs via mass media to publicize the knowledge of
solar eclipse and warn people to avoid looking directly when the
sky darkens.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Dismisses Indian Claims of Warning Before Downing Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Wednesday dismissed the Indian claims that they gave a
warning to the Pakistan navy plane before shooting it down
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking with the media here Wednesday, Aziz said that
Pakistan's air control station did not hear anything about the
warning claimed by India.
</P>
<P>
"If the Indians had given a warning it should have been heard
by the Pakistani air control," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what kind of response did they (Indians) expect,
because that warning should have been heard by our air control,
both civilian and air force, and they did not hear anything about
that," Aziz said, referring to India's claims that they had warned
at 11:15 a.m. Indian time and shot down at 11:17.
</P>
<P>
Aziz rejected the Indian claims that the wreckage of the
unarmed Pakistan Navy plane is lying 10 kilometers on the Indian
side.
</P>
<P>
"Our people have taken foreign correspondents there who have
seen the wreckage two kilometers inside our territory," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"Within three hours after the plane was shot and before our
people found the wreckage the Indians came in helicopters and took
away some pieces. Otherwise, how could it land 10 kilometers
away," he argued.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister termed the Indian action "unprovoked and
cowardly act" because this was an unarmed plane. "They knew it was
a propeller plane," he added.

<HEADLINE> 3 Former Zimbabwean Freedom Fighters Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- At least three ex-combatants were
arrested at the National Heroes Acre in Harare Wednesday, the
Zimbabwe Liberation War Veterans Association said.
</P>
<P>
National chairman of the association Chenjerai Hunzvi told the
Zimbabwe News agency that the arrests included Harare province
vice-chairman of the association Mike Moyo who attended the
celebrations of the Heroes Day at the Acre.
</P>
<P>
Moyo last month led about 1,000 ex-combatants to besiege both
the State House and the headquarters of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union, demanding to meet their patron President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came as a surprise as the three had not threatened
anyone, Hunzvi said, adding that it was the government that had
tried to provoke the war veterans by making the arrests.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no way the former freedom fighters would have
engaged in violence as they respected the fallen liberation war
heroes.
</P>
<P>
He added that war veterans were not enemies of the state but
were patriotic and wanted to see the people united.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for the release of the three forthwith. We
have been living under harassment from the state for too long,"
said a visibly angry Hunzvi.
</P>
<P>
The government had deployed a number of riot police officers at
the shrine, the venue for the Heroes Day celebrations, in
anticipation of a demonstration from the ex-combatants.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the riot police were also deployed at the ruling
party headquarters and around the city center preparing to clash
with the former fighters who intended to hold a demonstration for
more pension.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Cheer Eclipse in French Historical City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOYON, France, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people
cheered the total eclipse which occurred at around 12:25 local
time (10:25 GMT) in this small historical city in northern France
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy clouds and a little rain, the fantastic scenery
of the sun being eaten away by the moon could still be seen from
time to time from an observation ground at the outskirt of Noyon,
the birthplace of the great Christian religion reformer Jean
Calvin (1509-1564).
</P>
<P>
Against the background of the grandiose Notre-Dame Catheral
with its unique early Gothic architecture, where Emperor
Charlemagne was crowned by the Church 1000 years ago, people from
many countries of Europe camped on the ground waiting to see the
crescant sun since early morning.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the medium line of the ``total eclipse belt'' in
northern France, Noyon was chosen as the observation site by the
Astronomic Society of France for the last total eclipse of the 2nd
millennium.
</P>
<P>
At around 12:20, the sky became dark as if a big storm was
about to come. Five minutes later, it was night.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from 14 European member countries of the European
Space Agency, plus many amateur astrologists and professional
photographers, attended the ceremony in Noyon.
</P>
<P>
The whole town of Noyon was in an atmosphere of festival, with
music melodies on the sun being played by the organizers. Children
asked scientists naive but amusing questions about the sun and
outer space at a broadcasting station.
</P>
<P>
Many visitors also had a chance to discover this beautiful
French city with a great northern heritage, which remains
relatively unvisited by foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Most UAE Residents Stay at Home in Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Heeding warnings of health
departments, most residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
stayed at home Wednesday afternoon to avoid hurting eyes by
looking at the sun directly in the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Abu Dhabi, pedestrians and vehicles
reduced sharply in streets. The usually noisy construction sites
became quiet.
</P>
<P>
In response to a government announcement, all federal
ministries, departments, companies and other private firms ended
their work at 10:00 a.m. (0900 GMT) in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The government said the decision was taken for the safety of
citizens and residents against the adverse effects of the partial
eclipse, which took place from around 3:00 p.m. (1400 GMT) to 5:25
p.m. (1625 GMT). A maximum of 87 percent of the sun could be
blocked by the moon during this period.
</P>
<P>
"You must stay indoors to avoid the potential damage to your
eyes and skin caused by the strong sun rays during the eclipse,"
said the keeper of a grocery store. He said the store would remain
open though business could be affected for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the people were following the government's
instruction to stay indoors and watch the millennium's last solar
eclipse on TV, some residents did enjoy observing the phenomenon
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
Near the famous fountain attraction on the Abu Dahbi Corniche,
where people usually take walks in the evening, hundreds of
astronomy fans were holding a huge party.
</P>
<P>
Many of the fans, from different nationalities, were
clustering around two telescopes provided by the Amateur Astronomy
Section of the Emirates Heritage Club. The telescopes could
reflect the image of the eclipse onto a white board.
</P>
<P>
Others were watching the partly-covered sun with special
glasses or negatives, ignoring the government's warning that the
so-called solar glasses bought from the market could not protect
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
"I came here out of a kind of curiosity," said a young UAE
national, resting in the shade of a big tree and wiping off the
sweat on his face. He added that this was the first time he
watched an eclipse.
</P>
<P>
"The newspapers have been talking about this rare phenomenon
for quite a few days and now everybody knows that the sun will
have some problems today," said a middle-aged Indian. "Through
watching this phenomenon, one can learn some astronomical
knowledge," he added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the astronomy section said choosing the
observing site meant to help common people know more about this
astronomical phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Pak Foils 3 Indian Attempts to Steal Wreckage of Downed Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has foiled three
attempts by India to take away the wreckage of the Pakistan Navy
plane shot down by Indian jet fighter planes inside Pakistani
territory Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have repulsed three such attempts by India," Vice Chief of
Naval Staff Admiral Aziz Mirza said here Wednesday at a press
briefing which was also attended by Information Minister Mushahid
Hussain and Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf.
</P>
<P>
Mirza said Pakistan has deployed naval marines, SSG and
Pakistan armymen at the site where the wreckage of downed plane
was lying.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting down of Pakistan Navy's Atlantic plane
Tuesday well inside the Pakistani side at around 11:20 a.m.
Tuesday, the Indian choppers sneaked into Pakistani airspace upto
14:55 p.m. when Pakistan traced out the wreckage of downed
aircraft, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We have found the traces of the landing of an Indian chopper
at the site which may have managed to take away some items of the
wreckage," Mirza said. "This incident took place before we spotted
the wreckage of the plane at 14:55 hours."
</P>
<P>
There were two further incidents of this kind later in the day,
said Mirza.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about reports that Pakistan had fired
missile on Indian choppers which tried to land at the site of
wreckage, he said, "It is quite likely because the wreckage is
lying on our side of the boundary and we have stated in clear
terms that we reserve the right to give appropriate response to
(any intrusion or aggression)."
</P>
<P>
To another question, he said Pakistan's contention that the
Atlantic plane was on a normal training mission was substantiated
by the fact that it was not given cover of the fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
"Had this plane been on reconnaissance mission, it must have
been given a fighter planes cover," he said. "A plane flying on a
routine mission in peace time is never provided with such a
cover."
</P>
<P>
Mirza also said Pakistan Air Force (PAF) planes also scrambled
into the air after the Karachi radar system detected two Indian
fighter aircraft in aggressive posturing in the vicinity of the
downed plane.
</P>
<P>
"But the Indian jets had shot down the Pakistani Navy plane
before PAF aircraft reached the area," said Mirza.
</P>
<P>
"PAF planes were 100 nautical miles away from the Atlantic
plane when the incident took place," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said a warning should be issued to a plane in case of an
aggressive posturing before taking extreme step of shooting it
down.
</P>
<P>
"Our plane had not committed any mistake at all for it had not
crossed into Indian territory and it is obvious from the fact that
its wreckage is lying well inside Pakistani territory," he said.
"Hence the shooting down of the plane was totally unwarranted and
reprehensible."
</P>
<P>
Mirza also rebuffed the claims of Indian Defense Minister
George Fernendes that Indian fighters shot down the Pakistan Navy
plane after it ignored the warning.
</P>
<P>
"That warning would have been recorded with Karachi and Badin
radar systems but there was no such warning from the Indian side,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Government Sticks to "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Government Sticks to
"one China" policy, Albanian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sokol
Gjoka reiterated here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gjoka made this remark during an interview by Xinhua reporters
here on the Albania-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government upheld "one China" policy in the past,
it still upholds this policy now, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some local media reported that a few people in
Albania are pushing Albania to run after Macedonia to establish
relations with Taiwan as a bid to trade Taiwan's economic aid for
Albania. Commenting on that, Gjoka said that it was not the voice
of the Albanian Government.
</P>
<P>
The reports carried on one or two Albanian television stations
and one local newspaper just reflected the points of view of some
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current relations between Albania and China,
Gjoka said: "bilateral relations between the two countries are
into a high position."
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government and the Chinese government have decided
to take concrete steps to strengthen their relations, he said. The
Albanian-Chinese Joint Economic and Trade Commission is going to
restart its work very soon.
</P>
<P>
There are also other signs which have shown or will demonstrate
that the Albania-China relations will move towards to a
strengthening and very qualitative improvement, he added.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Help Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called on
developed countries to help developing countries to face the
challenges in the process of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Yongtu Long, Chinese vice-minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation made the call here at the ministerial meeting
of the Asian member states of the Group 77 (G77).
</P>
<P>
He said that economic globalization is an inevitable result of
the high-speed growth of world economy, science and technology and
thus every nation has to face it.
</P>
<P>
The globalization presents precious opportunities as well as
harsh challenges, he said, adding countries which conducted
policy and structural adjustments timely have been able to seize
the opportunities and achieved significant economic progress at
different levels.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out that a majority of developing countries
have failed to reap their rightful benefits from globalization,
and some even face the danger of being adversely affected or even
marginalized.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that developed nations, as the biggest beneficiary
of globalization, should take more obligations and have unshirkable
responsibilities in helping developing countries to overcome
financial and debt difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The G77's ministerial meeting for Asian member states opened
on Monday, with a main purpose to prepare for the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 2000 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 representatives, including over 10 ministers from
Asian countries, attended the four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
In addition to globalization, the participants will discuss
other topics, including private capital flows and instability in
the development process, debt problems, the international trading
system, information technology, governance of the globalizing
world economy.
</P>
<P>
The G77, which now has 133 member states, was established in
1964 by 77 developing countries at the end of the first session of
the UNCTAD in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
As the largest third world coalition in the U.N., the group
works on enhancing and promoting the collective interests of the
developing world and promoting economic and technical cooperation
among developing countries.

<HEADLINE> 21 Smugglers Killed, Drugs Seized in Eastern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's law enforcement forces
in the eastern province of Khorasan have killed 21 bandits of an
international smuggling gang in an 20-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Bahram Nurouzi of provincial police said Wednesday that
another four smugglers managed to escape, according to a report by
the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The report failed to mention when the exchange of fire
occurred, but said 16 rocket launchers and 89 kilograms of opium
were seized from the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
This gang had previous records of drug smuggling, the colonel
said, adding the operation was conducted in the vicinity of cities
of Tourbat-Heydarieh and Khwaf in the eastern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation was carried out in an unprecedented
magnitude in the province against the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Iran is used by drug traffickers as a transit to ship narcotics
to European and world markets from the "Gold Crescent" overlapping
parts of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The government has beefed up efforts to crack down on drug
smuggling and imposed harsh punishments on traffickers and
drug-dealers.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Western Uganda is experiencing a
 prolonged dry spell which has constituted a serious threat to the
life of local residents.
</P>
<P>
The drought has caused the death of large stretches of crops
and various domestic animals, Radio Uganda reported Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not take any action against it, people
living there will definitely die," one member of Parliament from
the western region was quoted as saying in the House.
</P>
<P>
The adverse weather has also caused reduction of coffee
production, one of the pillars of the country's foreign exchange
income.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the drying grass, many cows cannot produce milk
as before. Western Uganda is regarded as the main milk provider
for others parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Several MPs requested the government to take immediate and
effective measures to ensure the safety of food and drinking water
for the local residents and domestic animals.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Again Denies Saudi Mad Cow Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has denied claims in the Saudi Arabian press that South
African cattle are infected with mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
South African Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Thoko
Didiza said Wednesday that the government had not been notified
officially by Saudi Arabia of the reason for its reported ban on
South African beef products.
</P>
<P>
She said her department was aware of previous attempts to deny
beef exports to Saudi Arabia for reasons that "could not be
scientifically justified".
</P>
<P>
The statement from the minister follows reports in the
Saudi-owned Asharq al-Aswat newspaper on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia
has imposed a ban on beef imports from South Africa because of
concerns over the disease.
</P>
<P>
Didiza said: "The South African government is investigating the
origin of and reasons for these irresponsible and unfounded
allegations."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that South Africa was one of the first
countries to impose strict import requirements to prevent the
introduction of the mad cow disease when it was first discovered
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has earned a respected status in the
international veterinary community for its attempts to control
animal diseases. This is the status we jealously protect in the
interest of our livestock industry, as we are free from the most
important trade sensitive diseases -- which includes official
freedom from foot and mouth disease and rinderpest."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Foreign Affairs
Department said it supported Didiza's statement and called for
Saudi Arabia to raise the question "through appropriate channels".
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad as
saying that relations with Saudi Arabia are very good and that if
Saudi Arabia was really concerned about the disease they would
have raised it with the South African authorities through the
appropriate channels.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with the Saudi authorities to urgently resolve
the matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said there has never been a case of mad cow disease in
South Africa and that Pretoria is therefore surprised that some

<HEADLINE> Create Scientific Social Environment to Fight Falun Gong: Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much work needs to be done to create a properly civilized and
scientific social environment, and priority should be given to
ideological work, the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
The article stresses the importance of occupying such
ideological fields as culture, education, and the press and
publications. Otherwise, they will be taken over by anti-Marxism,
non-Marxism and superstition, it says.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to educate officials and the public
in Marxist materialism, atheism, scientific knowledge, patriotism,
collectivism and socialism, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary calls for helping the people to distinguish true
science from pseudo-science, traditional culture from feudalistic
dregs, and normal religious activities from fallacies preached
under the cover of religion.
</P>
<P>
While furthering the crackdown on Falun Gong's illegal
publications, greater efforts should be made to invigorate the
cause of socialist culture and enrich the people's cultural life,
it notes.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a civilized and scientific social environment
is an arduous task, it says, adding that the work should be set
high on the agenda of constructing socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
The fight against Falun Gong indicates that as long as the
people are mobilized, all evil ideologies will lose ground under
the strong attack of public opinion, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges India, Pakistan to Restore Mutual Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain urged India and Pakistan
to restore mutual trust on Wednesday after a war of words between
the two nuclear-armed neighbors was triggered by the downing of a
Pakistani patrol plane.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned by the incident yesterday in which a
Pakistani military aircraft was shot down with the loss of its
crew. We have instructed our high commissions in New Delhi and
Islamabad to urge their host governments to take immediate steps
to avoid further incidents and to restore mutual confidence and
trust," said Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made shortly after Hain held talks in London
with Pakistan's High Commissioner Mian Riaz Samee. The talks were
reportedly held at Samee's request.
</P>
<P>
An Indian MiG-21 fighter shot down a Pakistani reconnaissance
and anti-submarine aircraft on Tuesday, killing all 16 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
India insisted the plane had intruded into its airspace, while
Pakistan denied the charge by saying the plane was shot down over
its own territory.
</P>
<P>
"This incident underlines the urgent need for India and
Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue," Hain said
in the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Wednesday
reiterated the government's determination to create a healthier
and cleaner environment for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during his tour of Kowloon, Tung said that the poor
environmental hygiene due to the lack of proper management needs
to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
He said all concerned government departments, including the
Home Affairs Department, Buildings Department, Fire Services
Department and Drainage Services Department, have been pooling
their efforts to improve the cleanliness of private streets.
</P>
<P>
"However, to eradicate problems commonly found in private
streets, much still depends on the cooperation of owners and
tenants," Tung said. "Effective management and owners' active
participation are indispensable factors to improving and
maintaining a high standard of environmental hygiene in private
streets."
</P>
<P>
He said the government is determined to create a healthier and
cleaner environment for Hong Kong in order to upgrade the quality
of life.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the government launched the Healthy Living
Campaign last year and many activities have been organized to
encourage community-wide support and active participation in the
campaign," Tung said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Leading Airline Reports Profits in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways reported net profits of 108 million HK dollars (14 million
U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Turnover rose 1.4 percent to 13,167 million HK dollars (1,688
million U.S. dollars), while passenger numbers declined by 1
percent, according to the interim results announced by Cathay
Pacific Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that we have been able to return to
profitability after facing extremely challenging conditions
throughout 1998," said Cathay Pacific Chairman James Hughes-
Hallett.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific recorded a loss of 175 million HK dollars (22.4
million U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The first half of 1999 saw a recovery in a number of markets,
including the United States, Indonesia, South Korea and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The cargo services enjoyed a strong first half with turnover of
3,269 million HK dollars (419 million U.S. dollars), an 8.7
percent increase over the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific continued its fleet modernization plan during
the first half of the year, retiring five Boeing 747-300 aircraft
and taking delivery of two new B777-300s. The airline now has one
of the youngest fleets among major airlines.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that growing signs that key regional markets are
returning to positive economic growth should help the company's
performance over the remainder of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We still remain very confident about our long-term future and
the future of our home base Hong Kong," said Hughes-Hallett.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe said
Wednesday his government plans to establish a Liberation War
Museum at the national shrine in order to provide comprehensive
information of Zimbabwe's struggle for independence for the
benefit of future generations.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president revealed this at an event at the
National Heroes Acre in Harare to pay respects to the fallen
heroes of the liberation struggle that brought about the country's
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Zimbabwean people thronged around the acre to mark
the fallen heroes on the Heroes Day.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said a delegation from the Ministry of Home Affairs
would soon undertake a feasibility study tour of museums in Egypt
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the program of identifying and
rehabilitating the national liberation war graves that were
scattered in neighboring countries was being given top priority by
the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to assist widows of the
fallen heroes and their children under the age of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the president stressed the social and economic
interests of Zimbabweans were equally important hence they should
receive the attention of the government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also paid tribute to Zimbabwean soldiers fighting in the
 Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean forces together with those from Angola and Namibia
have been in the Congo since August last year, assisting Congolese

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with Tibet Issue China Attaches Importance to Protection of Ethnic Minorities' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- the Chinese government has
attached great importance to protecting the rights of the country'
s 55 ethnic minorities over the past 50 years, said a senior
Chinese official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China is a unified nation with many ethnic groups," said Qiao
Zonghuai, head of the Chinese Observer Delegation, during the 51st
session of a United Nations sub-commission on the promotion and
protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
To maintain and develop relations of equality, unity and mutual
assistance among all ethnic groups, and to prohibit ethnic hatred
and discrimination, Qiao said the Chinese government has
formulated and implemented a series of effective policies, such as
the system of ethnic autonomy,
</P>
<P>
On the elimination of racial discrimination, he told the
meeting that "with great help from the central government, arduous
efforts by the ethnic people have substantially changed the
situation in ethnic regions, hence the enjoyment of human rights
by ethnic peoples has been remarkably improved."
</P>
<P>
The population of the 55 minority groups amounts to 108 million,
which accounts for 8.98% of the total population of China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao gave Tibet as an example which confirms that the Tibetan
people now can enjoy and exercise not only the whole range of
rights provided in the constitution but also various special
rights in accordance with the system of ethnic autonomy after they
shook off the oppression by the old Chinese government in the
Democratic Reform 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made great efforts to promote the
economic and social development in the Tibetan Autonomous Region
and protect the human rights of the Tibetan people, he said. The
religious freedom of the Tibetan people is respected and protected.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted the policy of reform and opening-up, the
central government has allocated huge amount of money to renovate
and repair such religious sites as the Potala Palace and the
Jokhang Monastery.
</P>
<P>
The central government also attaches importance to the
protection of the rich traditional culture in Tibet and the
freedom of development of the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet is an inalienable part of China, which is an
internationally recognized fact," Qiao pointed out. "Recently, a
few separatists, ignorant of the reality and fundamental changes
in Tibet, are attempting to split Tibet from china, in the so-
called pretext of 'protecting human rights' and seeking 'high
degree of autonomy'."
</P>
<P>
"This is strongly opposed by all the Chinese people including
the Tibetan people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also told the meeting that his delegation fully endorses
the World Conference Against Racism and Racial Discrimination in
2001, which is now under preparation by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the parties concerned can reach an agreement on such
substantive matters as the function and agenda of the conference
and thus start the overall preparatory process," he added.

KUNMING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's investment in southwest
China's Yunnan Province has exceeded 170 million U.S. dollars,
making Taiwan the third-biggest investor in the province after

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Warned to Abide by Cease-fire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Allied Forces Task Force in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Wednesday warned the Congo
rebels to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement reached
in Lusaka on July 10, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The task force was quoted as saying in a statement from its
headquarters in Kinshasa that rebels and their allies continued to
attack their positions.
</P>
<P>
"The task force commander would like to warn the rebels and
their allies once again that his forces will respond decisively to
any further violations," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the rebels had attacked the Allied Forces
positions on August 8, 9 and 10, using artillery and small fire
arms.
</P>
<P>
The war in the Congo has since sucked in six African countries
which include Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad on the side of
the Congolese government and Rwanda and Uganda supporting the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The major rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, could
not sign the Lusaka cease-fire agreement because of clashes from
within.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said rebels continued to surrender to
the Allied Forces.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are surrendering almost on daily basis in response
to the Congolese government amnesty," it said.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila offered the rebels an
amnesty soon after the signing of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rain Dampens Dreams of Eclipse Watchers in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A unwelcomed heavy rain marred
the spectacle of long awaited solar eclipse here Wednesday, but
its occurrence was felt by the scary darkness in the sky at around
5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The sky along with heavy downpour and gusty winds became so
dark that the lights were turned on at home and on roads. However,
sunlight was restored when the rain ended at around 6:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
However, majority of the people watched the celestial drama on
their television screens, which was telecast live from Karachi,
Pakistan's biggest city on its southern coastline, and other two
cities through occasional breaks in the thick clouds.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse lasted for about two hours from 4:18 p.m. to 6:27
p.m. in Karachi. For around 1 minute 13 seconds, at 5:27 p.m., the
sun was totally obscured, appearing as a dark disc with a blazing
golden halo.
</P>
<P>
As the moon inched its way across the face of the sun, many
faithful offered special eclipse prayers at home and at mosques,
and prayed for two hours, while alms were distributed.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here, thick clouds blanketed much of the
country in the afternoon too, depriving many people of the rare
chance to see the last solar eclipse of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said total eclipse occurs somewhere in the world
about every 18 months. However, this eclipse was unique as it
passed over the thickly populated areas of the world: traveling
across France, Germany, Yugoslavia, Romania, Turkey, Iraq and
Iran, Pakistan and India, before ending in a sunset in the Bay of
Bengal about two hours after its start.
</P>
<P>
After passing over Europe and the Middle East, it entered
Pakistan, plunging Karachi and nearby areas into darkness for more
than one minute.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of the country had been expected to witness a
partial eclipse.

<HEADLINE> World Nuclear Body Chief to Visit S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO)
Wolfgang Hoffmann will visit South Africa from Thursday, South
Africa's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his six-day visit, Hoffmann will meet senior government
officials and role-players in the nuclear field to share
information on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
and acknowledge South Africa's role in the CTBT process where the
country is playing a leading role, the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was among the first countries to sign and ratify
the CTBT, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
on September 10, 1996.
</P>
<P>
South Africa ratified the treaty on March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 1 of the CTBT, each state party "undertakes not
to carry out any nuclear-weapons test explosion or any other
nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear
explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control."
</P>
<P>
The need for a treaty of this nature, was highlighted when
India and Pakistan consecutively conducted nuclear tests during
May 1999, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Adoption of the CTBT by the international community means an
end to nuclear tests globally and is a welcome umbrella in
addition to the advances made on the African continent by the
overwhelming support given to the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone
-- the Pelindaba Treaty," it added.

<HEADLINE> India's Aggressive Act, Serious Threat to S. Asian Peace: Pak Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain said Wednesday that India's aggressive
act by shooting down an unarmed Pakistan Navy aircraft is a
serious threat to peace, security and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Mushahid described the
downing of the Pakistan Navy aircraft by Indian air force in
Pakistan's territory Tuesday as "naked aggression" and "state
terrorism".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Defense Committee of the Cabinet held a
meeting Wednesday which was chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and was attended by the three chiefs of army staff as well as
senior cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting expressed strong condemnation and indignation over
India's act by violating Pakistan's airspace and shooting down the
unarmed aircraft which was on a routine training mission.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was fully justified in making an appropriate response
in self-defense to India's "hostile act", said Mushahid.
</P>
<P>
He said the Defense Committee of the Cabinet had ordered
Pakistan's armed forces to "take all necessary measures".
</P>
<P>
Mushahid urged the international community to take "upfront and
principled stand" towards the hostile act by India which, he said,
was not like "a mature, responsible and civilized state".

<HEADLINE> S. African Gun Owners Protest Gun-control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,200 protesters
took to the streets in Cape Town Wednesday in a march against
government proposals for a tougher law on gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
The march -- organized by Victims Against Crime, United
Christian Action and the South African Gunowners Association --
took place in front of Parliament, where the protesters handed a
memorandum to a representative of the national department of
safety and security.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, addressed to Safety and Security Minister Steve
Tshwete, rejected the "irresponsible, excessive and intrusive"
requirements of the draft Firearms Control Bill, expected to come
before Parliament in the current session, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The memo said the bill would effectively outlaw nine out of
every ten licensed firearms, restrict people to owning only one
handgun and 100 rounds, raise license fees to 500 rand (80 U.S.
dollars) renewable every five years at ministerial discretion, and
place "arbitrary" restrictions on barrel length, maximum calibre
and magazine capacity.
</P>
<P>
Self-defense would also no longer be an acceptable reason for
owning a firearm, said the memo.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said the bill should be scrapped as its only
effect would be to increase violence and crime.
</P>
<P>
It expressed concern at the "secretive and underhand" way the
bill had been drafted and asked why the drafters had ignored the
expertise, experience and advice of firearms experts such as the
South African Gunowners Association.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum pointed out that the vast majority of the
estimated four to nine million illegal firearms in the country
were not stolen from legal owners, but smuggled in from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministry itself had reported to Parliament that incidents
of crime committed by registered firearm owners were statistically
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
"As licensed firearm owners are not the problem, why target
them with such laborious, time and money-wasting demands?"
</P>
<P>
Gun control would not end the violence, but rather disarm
potential victims, the memo noted.
</P>
<P>
"Every day in South Africa, hundreds of crimes are prevented,
hundreds of victims are protected, and countless tragedies averted
by armed citizens," it said.
</P>
<P>
It called for a new drafting committee including
representatives of Victims Against Crime, United Christian Action
and the South African Gunowners Association.
</P>
<P>
African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) MP Steve Swart told
the marchers at Parliament that the ACDP supported the protest and
would oppose all attempts by government to disarm law-abiding
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"The role of government should be to disarm criminals and
confiscate illegal weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it appeared that the aim of the bill was to disarm
those people who had licensed firearms and to make it more
difficult to legally obtain firearms in future.
</P>
<P>
"Government needs to prevent a scenario where obtaining a
firearm illegally is easier and cheaper than obtaining one
legally," Swart said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Set for Further Fall, Says UK Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) - British inflation looks set to
fall still further, despite the pick-up in the economic recovery,
the Bank of England said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said the immediate
outlook is for growth with low inflation. But it acknowledged
there is "considerable uncertainty" over prospects for the future.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Mervyn King said no one could claim to know
exactly where inflation was going in the longer term and that
opinion was divided among the members of the Bank's Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC).
</P>
<P>
But he expected underlying inflation to fall below 2 percent
over the next "year or so", before rising slightly above the
government's 2.5 percent target in two years' time.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released recently showed that average earnings
were up 4.4 percent in June well above the rate of inflation and
unemployment down to 4.3 percent, its lowest level since March
1980.
</P>
<P>
Both of these factors could contribute to inflationary
pressures, along with the rapid heating up of the housing market.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's base rate has fallen sharply over the past twelve
months and now stands at 5 percent, the lowest figure for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The report released Wednesday was interpreted by economists
here as indicating the next move in British interest rates by the
Bank's MPC will be upwards.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment at 19-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) - The number of people out of work
in Britain dropped by 32,900 in July to 1,236,300, taking the
jobless rate to 4.3 percent, a new 19-year low, Official figures
showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly fall figure was much bigger than the markets were
expecting - predictions had put the figure at about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
One labor market analyst said: "It is an extremely strong
report, highlighting the tightness of the labor market and clearly
highlights inflation risks."
</P>
<P>
Another said: "I am surprised the figure has moved so much. It
does underline the fact that it has been an extremely soft
landing. This is very bad news."
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics added average earnings
growth ticked up to 4.4 percent in the three months to June from
4.3 percent in May, well above the expected 4.1 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that the slump in the number of
people claiming unemployment benefit highlighted the inflationary
risks in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Educational Circles Lash Out at Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's educational circles
vowed to further expose the true nature of the Falun Gong cult and
strengthen education on materialism and atheism.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Chen Zhili told a meeting here today that
students and teachers should realize that the struggle against
Falun Gong is a serious political struggle.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is a typical illegal organization and a political
force trying to grab the commanding heights from the Communist
Party of China and the government, she said.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his organization eroded some people's political
beliefs and ethics, and even won over some weak-minded Party
members and officials, by spreading superstition and theism, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The misdeeds of Falun Gong pose great threats to the country's
hard-won political situation of reform, development and stability,
as well as to state power, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called on educational circles across China to further
improve ideological and political education, with universities and
colleges in particular playing a major part in this campaign by
making the most of their intellectual advantages.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting held unanimously that amid the
early success of the struggle everybody should remain sober-minded
about the cult's true nature of being anti-scientific, anti-human
and anti-government, with a hidden political background both at
home and overseas.

SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Parliament
Thursday approved a loan of 3.22 billion U.S. dollars for two
light-water nuclear reactors for the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Under the loan agreement, passed in the single-chamber National
Assembly unanimously Thursday, South Korea will provide 3.22
billion dollars to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) to cover 70 percent of the reactor project's
budget, while Japan will pay 1 billion dollars and the United

<HEADLINE> Philippines Enacts Laws to Protect Local Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada signed into law Thursday two measures aimed at protecting
local industries from unfair trade practices brought about by the
entry of subsidized and cheap imports into the country.
</P>
<P>
The president signed Republic Act No. 8751 aimed at
strengthening the imposition of countervailing duties on imported
subsidized products, including agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Under this act, countervailing duties will be slapped on
imported subsidized articles that may cause the "material injury,"
"material retardation of the growth," or "the prevention of the
establishment" of an affected domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also signed the Anti-Dumping Act of 1999, which
provides rules on the imposition of duties on cheap, imported
goods that threaten domestic industries producing the same
products.
</P>
<P>
This act was signed into law primarily to stop the importation
of cheap, usually substandard products that flood the local market
and threaten domestic goods.
</P>
<P>
It provides for a shorter, simplified and more systematic
process of investigating cases of dumping in the country and
penalizes officials who fail to undertake the necessary actions
against dumping as required under the law.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in free trade, but we also insist on fair trade,"
the president said at the signing ceremony held at the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines, being a founding member of the World
Trade Organization, is firmly committed to opening its markets,
engaging in free trade to make the economy globally competitive.
</P>
<P>
"But our markets are open to those prepared to compete with our
industries on a level playing field, not in underhanded games or
through underground methods," the president said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bumper Harvest Projected Despite Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. farmers will reap a
bumper harvest of corn, soybeans, rice and other crops despite the
drought and heat that have plagued parts of the country this
summer, the Agriculture Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Soybean production is forecast to reach a record high 2.9
billion bushels, up 4 percent from last year, although the drought
has ruined crops from Ohio through the mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
The corn harvest is expected to be the third largest on record
at 9.6 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
Most of the nation's heartland has received plenty of rain this
summer and a Midwest heat wave eased in time to spare most crops,
DPA279HAB206I12TEQL23:2823:291945
the Agriculture Department said.
</P>
<P>
The department expected a modest increase in prices for some
commodities -- 20 cents a bushel for soybeans and 5 cents a bushel
for corn -- because of tightening world supplies or rising
exports. The average price of corn is expected to range from 1.70
to 2.10 U.S. dollars this year while soybean prices average 4.10
to 4.90 dollars per bushel.
</P>
<P>
The higher prices could save the government as much as 1
billion dollars in crop subsidies, but many farmers still wouldn't
recover their cost of production. The Senate last week approved a
7.4 billion dollar package of farm assistance; the House has yet
to act.
</P>
<P>
The biggest impact of the drought could be on dairy farmers.
Milk prices are expected to rise as much as 50 cents per hundred
pounds because of strong demand for cheese and declining
production in the parched Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production is expected to be up by a third from last
year when there was a severe drought across the South.
DPA280HAB207I12TEQL23:2923:290711
</P>
<P>
The rice crop is expected to be a record 21 billion pounds, up
12 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production is down 9 percent, as many farmers switched to
other crops they thought would be more lucrative this year. But
world wheat stocks are rising because of a big crop in China this
year, so the Agriculture Department doesn't expect prices to
increase.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to Six-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of the
Philippine peso to the U.S. dollar depreciated Thursday to
six-month low of 39.225 pesos from Wednesday's 39.15 pesos with
the turnover volume of 305.4 million dollars transacted at the
Philippine Dealing System.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the depreciation to the low peso yields
which pushes investors to shift more funds into dollar investment,
triggering heavy dollar-buying on the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, external factors such as solid fears about a hike in
U.S. interest rates added more pressure on the currency.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Philippine
Central Bank, said that the peso-dollar rate is still on the
"tolerable level" and the central bank will not intervene.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said earlier that the peso's
weakness was not justified given the country's sound economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that the drop in the peso was temporary and would
reverse as the country's foreign loans start coming in. The
government is expecting about 900 million dollars in various loan
inflows.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the year, the central bank has cut its key
interest rates by 437.5 basis points, bringing the overnight
borrowing rate to 9.0 percent and overnight lending rate to 11.0
percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise 0.7 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Thursday that retail sales in July picked up unexpected
0.7 percent, pushed by a big increase in automotive sales.
</P>
<P>
The Department said total retail sales rose last month to a
seasonally adjusted 248.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The July advance followed a revised 0.2 percent decline in
June. The 0.7 percent increase is better than many analysts had
expected. Many analysts had been forecasting a gain of 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales, which represent about a third of the nation's
economic output, have climbed or held steady most months of this
year and were 9.1 percent higher than July of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of the year, consumer spending continues
to remain brisk. With unemployment near a three-decade low, growth
in wages and benefits and a strong stock market, consumers are
continuing to feel confident.
</P>
<P>
Last month, sales at automobile dealerships rose a sizable 2.3
percent, following a decrease of 0.8 percent in June. The auto
industry expects to have a record year of sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Without the volatile autos category, retail sales still would
have risen 0.3 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline sales also jumped 1.2 percent in July, following a
drop of 0.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices had reached their highest point in more than 18
months in July partly because of production cuts by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as
recovering Asian and Latin American economies. However, in recent
weeks, gas prices have been moderating.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods increased a solid 1.6 percent in July,
after being down 0.9 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, rose 0.2
percent in July, following a 0.4 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Sales at food stores rose a tiny 0.1 percent in July, after
having dropped the month before. But sales at grocery stores held
steady for the second month in a row.
</P>
<P>
However, at apparel and accessory shops, sales fell 0.4 percent
in July, matching 0.4 percent drop the month before. And, sales at
bar and restaurants also fell by 0.4 percent in July, following a
0.2 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Last week, most chain stores reported that their retail sales
topped expectations in July, helped out by a strong U.S. economy
and a heat wave in much of the country that sent people to
air-conditioned stores. The big winners in July were the discount
chains, as shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and
Kmart for a wide selection and affordable prices.

SHENZHEN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A container liner sailed from
this south China Special Economic Zone today, marking the opening
of China's new container shipping route to Europe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Raise Oil Prices Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A ranking official of the
Philippine government confirmed Thursday that the prices of
petroleum products in the country will be raised next month as the
price of crude oil in the world market has risen to 19 U.S.
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Cyril de Callar, undersecretary of the Department of Energy
(DOE), said the price increase will push through despite the worry
that the oil price hike will have a direct impact on the prices of
commodity goods in the market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Callar said that the government is doing its best to
closely monitor and check oil companies to ensure that they are
not selling their petroleum products based on the old importation
price for huge profits.
</P>
<P>
He said the DOE is calling on the oil firms not to cheat the
consumers by effecting a new price increase on the old stocks of
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Callar confirmed that the oil companies still have stocks that
could last for 60 days' supply so that any increase now would be
tantamount to economic sabotage.
</P>
<P>
He said that every week, the DOE requires these oil firms to
submit to the government a report on their oil inventory and
latest importation records in order to find out if they are indeed
taking advantage of the situation.

WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Teresa Weatherspoon played
the hero in regulation but was the goat in overtime as the first-
placed New York Liberty remained winless in three tries against
the feisty Washington Mystics 59-56 here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon, who forced the extra session with a crucial 3-
pointer, missed a potential tying layup with 12 seconds remaining
in overtime as New York's lead in the Eastern Conference shrank to
one-half game over idle Charlote.
</P>
<P>
Nikki McCray scored 20 points, including 1,000th of her career,
and gave the Mystics (11-17) a 57-54 lead with 2:11 to play.
McCray became the 11th player in WNBA history to reach the 1,000-
point plateau, accomplishing the feat in her second season.
</P>
<P>
Washington posted its season-high fifth straight win and has a
chance to complete a season sweep of New York on August 17 at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
Sue Wicks grabbed 16 rebounds for the Liberty, who lost the
battle on the boards, 49-38. New York shot only 25 percent (16-of-
64) but scored 27 points off 23 turnovers. Washington shot 28
percent (17-of-59).

<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Children under five are dying at
more than twice the rate they were 10 years ago in the heavily-
populated southern and central parts of Iraq, according to joint
surveys by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the
Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Releasing here Thursday the first surveys since 1991 of child
and maternal mortality in Iraq, UNICEF Executive Director Carol
Bellamy said the findings reveal an ongoing humanitarian emergency.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that whenever sanctions are imposed they should
be designed and implemented in such a way as to avoid a negative
impact on children," she said. "Surveys on the situation of
children and women are essential to the ongoing monitoring of the
humanitarian situation there."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF recommended an immediate implementation of specific
proposals made in the U.N. secretary-general's reports and by the
Security Council's Humanitarian Review Panel. Among the specific
proposals are the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The international community should provide additional
funding for humanitarian efforts to Iraq;
</P>
<P>
-- The government of Iraq should urgently expedite
implementation of targeted nutrition programs;
</P>
<P>
-- Both the government of Iraq and the U.N. Sanctions Committee
should give priority to contracts for supplies that will have a
direct impact on the well-being of children.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Doctors Turning Gray, Health Institute Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada is seeing its pool of 56,
203 physicians grow steadily older, with 22 percent of them
between the ages of 50 and 59, the Canadian Institute for Health
Information said.
</P>
<P>
The number is impressive compared to 18 percent of the total
number of physicians practicing in 1993, the Institute reported.
It also warned Wednesday of a shortage of doctors in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The institute indicated a downward trend in the number of young
doctors in the country under the age of 40, claiming that they
made up only 29 percent of the total last year compared to 36.6
percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The institute, which is an independent health organization,
attributes the phenomenon partly to a relatively large exodus of
young practitioners to the United States earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
It is also critical of a "short-sighted" decision by the
federal and provincial governments to severely limit the number of
practicing Canadian physicians.
</P>
<P>
The institute's warning comes days before the Canadian medical
Association will open its annual meeting here later this month.
</P>
<P>
The medical association has already estimated that there will
be only one doctor for every 718 patients in 2021, unless
something is done to increase the number of physicians.
</P>
<P>
Last year's medical statistics showed that there was only one
doctor for every 548 patients.
</P>
<P>
The medical association meeting is expected to urge a dramatic
increase in the number of students allowed into Canadian medical
schools and teaching hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Barmasai May be Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- World 3,000 meters steeplechase
record holder Bernard Barmasai, one of the four athletes to win
the Golden League one million US dollars jackpot, could be
disqualified, an IAAF spokesman said Thursday in Zurich,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan admitted Wednesday that he asked compatriot
Christopher Koskei to slow down before the finish of the race in
Wednesday's Weltklasse meet before he won the race by one stride
ahead of Koskei.
</P>
<P>
The win kept Barmasai in the chase of the season-ending million
US dollars jackpot for athletes who win all the seven meets of the
Golden League.
</P>
<P>
"His (Koskei's) last 100 meters are really good," said Barmasai.
"When he tried to pass I tried to talk to him. I said 'leave it
for me', and that's why he slowed down. He would have won today,
but because he is a friend and we have to live together...the
jackpot is for me and my friends."
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation announced
Thursday that it would formally investigate "to ensure that the
principles of fair play have been fully respected."
</P>
<P>
International Amateur Athletic Federation spokesman Giorgio
Reineri said if the case turned out to be a misunderstanding then
no action would be taken, but if it was true then: "In this case,
it's obvious there is the disqualification of the athlete."
</P>
<P>
If Barmasai lost, American sprint-queen Marion Jones, Romanian
middle-distance specialist Gabriela Szabo and Denmark's 800-metre
world record holder Wilson Kipketer would suit to a three split of
the jackpot.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Call for Cooperation Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Asian economic ministers
Thursday called on developing countries to strengthen cooperation
to face the challenges in the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
After a four-day discussion at the ministerial meeting of the
Asian member states of the Group 77 (G77), 25 ministers issued a
common statement.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the ministers emphasized the importance of
economic cooperation among developing countries as a strategy for
development and the common prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation has become all the more relevant in the face
of the challenges of a globalizing world economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that trade among developing countries has expanded
significantly; intra-regional foreign direct investment by
developing countries in Asia has increased substantially; and
sub-regional economic cooperation initiatives are playing an
increasing important role in regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called for strengthening cooperation among
developing countries in international negotiations on trade,
monetary and financial matters with a view to enhancing their
development objectives.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Agrees to More U.N. Police in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday approved U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
proposal of increasing the number of U.N. civilian police and
military liaison officers after the U.N.-supervised direct ballot
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The additional U.N. civilian police and military liaison
officers will have the same position and function as the present
U.N. civilian police and military liaison officers. There will be
no change of function," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters
after accompanying Habibie in a meeting with U.N. secretary
general's special envoy for East Timor Jamsheed Marker here.
</P>
<P>
Alatas reiterated that what Jakarta agreed to is the addition
of U.N. civilian police personnel, not an addition to their
functions or duties.
</P>
<P>
"The civilian police will be civilian police, and military
liaison officers will always be military liaison officers. They
will never become a peacekeeping force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his meeting with Habibie, Marker said they
discussed a range of topics on East Timor. But he refused to give
details.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you before I report it to the secretary
general," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan in his report to the U.N. Security Council Tuesday
recommended that additional U.N. civilian police and military
liaison officers be sent to East Timor after the direct ballot on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, the number of U.N.
civilian police will become 460, including 50 members from the
local population, up from 280 proposed before.
</P>
<P>
The military liaison officers will be bolstered to 300 from the
present 50 and they will act as mediators among the military, the
pro-integration militia and the anti-integration group.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 ballot will allow the territory's people to
choose whether their homeland should become an autonomous region
within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Make Its Own Car in December 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The first Bangladesh-made car will
roam in the capital city's streets in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
A Bangladesh National Car Company will be established under a
memorandum of understanding signed here Wednesday between the
NITOL Group of Bangladesh and D&AMP;P Engineering Services of Britain,
the national news agency BSS reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to create 50,000 jobs in making and
selling the car, which, after successful launch, can be exported
to other markets, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of each vehicle with a clean efficient petrol engine
will be around 300,000 taka (6,060 U.S. dollars) with
1,100-1,400cc engines.
</P>
<P>
The BSS said the project offers a unique opportunity in the
country's automobile sector.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh car program, described as a joint-venture of
strategic alliance, offers total independence and acquisition of
technology because the intellectual rights will become the
property of the Bangladesh National Car Company, unlike the
country's other car projects which rely upon original manufactures
supplying technology.
</P>
<P>
The car, which is to be of versatile design, will meet both the
market and operating conditions in Bangladesh, and all its
variants will be environment-friendly and economical, the news
agency said.

<HEADLINE> Australians to Vote on Republic on November 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Australians will vote on a
republic on November 6 after parliament Thursday night passed the
republic referendum bill and a preamble to the country's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Both the bill setting up the republic referendum question and
the bill for Prime Minister John Howard's compromise preamble for
the constitution passed the Senate Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
They were approved earlier by the House of Representatives and
have now passed parliament.
</P>
<P>
The republic referendum question is if the Australians agree
with "an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the
Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with the Queen and
governor-general being replaced by a president appointed by a
two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth
parliament."
</P>
<P>
The bill of the proposed preamble, a deal reached by Prime
Minister John Howard and the Australian Democrats Wednesday, was
passed unamended.
</P>
<P>
The proposed preamble said the Australians honor "Aborigines
and Torres Strait Islanders, the nation's first people, for their
deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing
cultures which enrich the life of our country."
</P>
<P>
It ended the row over the recognition of Aborigines and Torres
Strait Islanders by referring to their "deep kinship" with the
land.
</P>
<P>
It also ditched the controversial reference of mateship to
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Role in Illegal Gathering at Zhongnanhai (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the evening of May 23, Falun Gong practitioners in Tianjin
abandoned their illegal besieging of the Tianjin Teachers
University at the persuasion of local police. No one was detained
and the retreat was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
When the news reached Beijing, Li Chang , Wang Zhiwen and
some key members of the "Society" held a meeting in Beijing at 10:
00 pm, in which they spread rumors that police in Tianjin had
arrested some local Falun Gong leaders and practitioners, and that
some were killed and others missing. Those rumors were intended to
mobilize a large-scale illegal gathering near the Zhongnanhai
compound.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, they also decided to put forward three demands
to the central government during the planned besieging of
Zhongnanhai: first, those detained in Tianjin by the police be
freed immediately; a more favorable and friendly environment be
provided for the practice of Falun Gong; and Falun Gong
publications be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi repeatedly said that he is " uninterested in
political activities" and that "Falun Gong is not engaged in any
form of politics". In fact, he had been actively and secretly
planning to expand the illegal organization and penetrate its
influence into every corner of the society.
</P>
<P>
Their three demands to the central government were signs that
they were trying to legalize their illegal organization and
activities, so as to challenge and rival the Party and the
government.

<HEADLINE> Tripartite High-Level Meeting on E. Timor Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting on East Timor
among senior officials of Indonesia, Portugal and the United
Nations kicked off here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting is likely to discuss the political and
security issues that will arise after the U.N.-sponsored autonomy
ballot in East Timor is held on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Besides U.N. secretary-general's special envoy for East Timor
Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. delegation consists of Ian Martin, chief
of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), Francesc Vendrell,
Mono P. Bahgat, Joachim, Hutter and Tamrat Samuel.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian side is chaired by Nugroho Wisnumurti, director
general for political affairs of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese delegation is composed of Portuguese Ambassador
at Large Fernando Neves as chairman and Chief of Portugal's
interest section here Ana Gomes.
</P>
<P>
Neves told reporters shortly before the meeting that they will
discuss the second phase of the ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said they will also discuss the continued presence of the
United Nations in the territory after the vote to enable it to
handle the interim period during the implementation of the ballot
result.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to issue a joint communique on
the results of their discussions on the last day of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot on August 30, which will allow the
territory's people to choose whether their homeland should become
an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Role in Illegal Gathering at Zhongnanhai (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Li Hongzhi fled out of Beijing, his key followers,
including Li Chang and Wang Zhiwen, were left with the
responsibility of implementing all his plans.
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 am on April 24, a "regular meeting of studying Falun
Dafa" was held by the leaders of the Beijing General Station of
the Society and sub-stations in counties and districts in Beijing
at the address of 7 Cangjingguan Lane, in eastern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li and Wang said at the meeting that the date for the illegal
gathering near Zhongnanhai compound would be April 25. The
leaders of substations were assigned the tasks of security,
transportation, order, and sanitary matters at the gathering site.
</P>
<P>
They set the strategy for the illegal gathering as "no slogans,
no banners, no flyers, no fierce verbal attacks, and no revelation
of the organizer -- the Falun Dafa Research Society."
</P>
<P>
Deputy director of the General Station in Beijing Liu Zhichun
was told to inform all the sub-stations in Beijing, and Wang
Zhiwen was responsible for the areas outside Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An announcement created by Li Hongzhi himself was also made
during the meeting to coax practitioners out onto the streets. It
was: everyone should stand up to fulfill their dues for the
protection of Falun Dafa, and their actions should be individually
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
It is evident that Li was taking advantage of his capacity as "
tutor" and "master" to realize his own political ambitions, and at
the same time attempting to prevent his illegal organization from
being exposed.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of April 24, the Falun Dafa Research Society
and its Beijing General Station convened another meeting of key
figures to further mobilize practitioners for the next day's move.
</P>
<P>
They set up "command headquarters" and a liaison center,
designated two persons responsible for communications between the
gathering site and the headquarters, and another one responsible
for propaganda to be published on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Li Chang further stressed that leaders above the level of
general stations must refrain from appearing at the gathering site
for fear of being recognized by practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Wang Zhiwen made numerous calls to local Falun Gong
leaders in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning and the
city of Tianjin, asking them to organize followers to go to the
Zhongnanhai compound on the morning of April 25 to "protect Falun
Dafa".
</P>
<P>
Now, "all the preparations for the April 25 action were ready,
" as Li Chang admitted later.

<P>
-- The first group of Falun Gong practitioners arrived at the
northern gate of the Zhongnanhai compound as early as 9:40 pm on
April 24;
</P>
<P>
-- At the small hours of 3:07 am on April 25, passenger buses
from nearby Hebei Province arrived too, and people began to get
off. At 3:30 am, another group of practitioners gathered at the
moat river near Zhongnanhai;
</P>
<P>
-- At 5:13 am, a large group of practitioners emerged at the
gate of Beihai Park and walked westward; and at 5:34 am, many
practitioners started to emerge from lanes;
</P>
<P>
-- And by 7:00 am, a large-scale sit-in had been formed at the
western gate of Zhongnanhai.
</P>
<P>
The size of the sit-in kept growing, and exceeded 10,000 by
later that morning.
</P>
<P>
At 8:00 am, Xinhua reporters arrived at the site and saw that
the streets were full of Falun Gong practitioners, most being the
elderly, women, and peasants from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
When questioned, a peasant woman from Beijing outskirts said
they were practicing Falun Gong . When asked why they were doing
it near Zhongnanhai, she refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
The practitioners kept coming in the afternoon, and pedestrian
traffic on the street in front of the western gate of Zhongnanhai
was totally impossible, and Chang'an Avenue also was seriously
affected.
</P>
<P>
According to previous planned arrangements, Li Chang, Wang
Zhiwen, Ji Liewu and some 20 other key figures gathered at the "
command headquarters" at the home of Yao Jie. At 9:00 am, the sit-
in site reported to the "headquarters" that four representatives
were sent to talk with the central government, but they could not
explain clearly the reason for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in site requested capable people from the Falun Dafa
Research Society or its Beijing General Station to come out for
the "dialogue".
</P>
<P>
Finally, Li Chang and Wang Zhiwen decided to come out of the
closet, and headed a five-member "delegation" to enter into the
Zhongnanhai compound for "dialogue".

<TEXT>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, now in Hong Kong, was by no means inactive. He was
in close touch with the Beijing "headquarters," hearing reports
and issuing orders. Evidence shows that there were over 20 calls
placed between Li and the "headquarters" on April 25, and that
all the actions in Beijing were taken after being directed by Li
Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
When the sit-in reached the size of 10,000 people, Ji Liewu
informed Li, and Li asked, "Are there many practitioners from
outside Beijing?"  When he was told that the first two groups of
"negotiators" were sent to Zhongnanhai, Li said, "All right."
</P>
<P>
Li also asked Ji, "Why don't you go to Zhongnanhai now that
they (the government) want to talk with you?"
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government issued a decree demanding that
the demonstrators leave. Li Hongzhi told Ji that they should still
wait until the "negotiators" came out. The five "negotiators"
headed by Li Chang pestered the Letters and Calls Bureau of the
State Council for nearly nine hours.
</P>
<P>
When the "negotiators" all came out, Li asked how it was going.
Ji answered that the talks would continue the next day. Then, Li
said that the practitioners besieging Zhongnanhai may leave.
</P>
<P>
At around 6:00 am on April 26, when Li came to know that his "
negotiators" were not talking with leaders of the central
government, he called Ji Liewu to furiously blame Li Chang for
calling off the sit-in before talking to top officials.
</P>
<P>
With pieces of evidence coming together, it is now known that
the April 25 illegal gathering at Zhongnanhai was a premeditated
and well-organized political incident aimed at exerting pressure
on the Party and the government and unsettling the country.
</P>
<P>
And evidence shows that Li Hongzhi was the behind-the-scene
chief organizer of the all illegal activities, from the attacks on
the Beijing TV Station to the escalation of the sit-in
demonstration in Tianjin, and to the April 25 illegal gathering in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
However, the man who claims to possess supernatural powers has
overestimated his own power. He is no more than an ant trying
vainly to topple a tree, and he will be tried by history.

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The press departments of the
Taiwan Work Office of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council today
refuted the Taiwan authorities' written explanation on "special
state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
On August 1, the "Mainland Affairs Council" of the Taiwan
authorities issued an explanation of Lee Teng-hui's "two states"
remark amid strong condemnation by the Chinese people. It's an
apologia that stubbornly sticks to Lee's remarks, said an article
issued by the offices.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is part of China's territory, and both sides of the
Taiwan Straits belong to one country, not two. "This is an
indisputable fact that has been proved true by history, reality,
and law," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Since ancient times, the island of Taiwan has been part of
China. The Chinese government exercised sovereignty over the
island until 1895, when it was snatched away by the Japanese
imperialists.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese people never accepted the unequal treaties
forced upon them, and fought unflaggingly for their abolition.

During World War II, both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam

In August 1945, Japan announced the acceptance of the Potsdam
Proclamation. Two months later, Taiwan returned to the motherland.
Ever since then, Taiwan's status as part of Chinese territory has

Ever since then, the so-called ROC on Taiwan has lost all its
legitimacy. "It has never been a fact that two China co-exist
internationally, as proclaimed by Lee Teng-hui. This is but his

</P>

In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly passed a

China's sole legitimate representative at the UN, and announcing
the expulsion of the ROC from the world organization.
</P>

Over 160 countries worldwide have established diplomatic ties

only one China, that Taiwan is part of China, and that the PRC is
the sole legitimate government of all China.

A country's sovereignty belongs to the whole nation, and should
never be allowed to be altered by any region or any number of

The fact that the two sides of the Straits have not been
reunified does not affect in any way Taiwan's status as part of
China's territory and Chinese sovereignty over the island, the
article said.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Measures to Rectify Petroleum Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China will take a series of
steps to straighten out its petroleum circulation companies and
put the petroleum market in order, according to the State Economic
and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The SETC, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, the National Administration of Taxation, the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State Bureau of
Quality and Technical Supervision have sent out a notice clearly
setting out the object and the detailed measures concerning the
rectification.
</P>
<P>
The notice demands an overall rectification of petroleum
wholesale companies, and says that all domestically-made petroleum,
kerosene and diesel oil should be wholesaled by the China National
Petroleum Corporation and the China Petrochemical Corp.
</P>
<P>
The two giants are also entitled to reorganize other petroleum
wholesale companies through affiliation, taking shares and
purchasing.
</P>
<P>
Petrol stations will be checked and rectified to ensure that
the petroleum retail market pursues healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country has also decided to strictly control the
opening and expansion of petroleum storage companies, in
accordance with the notice.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign-funded petroleum circulation companies, only
petrol stations as accessory buildings for expressways may be set
up, according to the notice, adding that the procedures for
approval should be strictly followed.
</P>
<P>
The rectification of wholesale and storage companies will be
completed within this year, and that for petrol stations will be

The written explanation claimed that the "special state-to-

cross-Straits talks, but in fact, this is a total lie that is not
in accordance with facts, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article said the statement by the Taiwan authorities
attempted to win sympathy from world opinion under the pretense of
"equality," in order to achieve its aim of separating the country.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the CPC and the Chinese government have
been practicing the basic policy of "peaceful reunification and '
one country, two systems'" since 1979, and have always stood for
achieving reunification through talks on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders including Ye Jianying, former Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), Deng
Xiaoping, and President Jiang Zemin have all made remarks in this

Across Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) have been conducting their negotiations on an equal footing

In 1992, ARATS and the SEF reached a consensus that the two
sides across the Straits uphold a "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
But the Taiwan authorities said the "two sides have their own
explanations of the 'one China' policy", according to the article.
</P>
<P>
It is not true to fact, the article said. Its aim is to
advocate their separatist stand.
</P>
<P>
The article said the "two states" statement deliberately
sabotages cross-Straits relations and the peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
It said without the "one China" policy, cross-Straits talks
will lose their basis and reunification can not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
It said the "two states" remark is a deliberate provocation to
the 1.3 billion Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits,
and Lee Teng-hui should bear all responsibilities for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
The article said that in order to separate Taiwan from China,
Lee Teng-hui takes no heed of their security, interests, or well
being, and his attempt will lead to calamities for the 22 million
Taiwan people as well.
</P>
<P>
The article concluded that no matter how the written
explanation tries to exonerate Lee Teng-hui from responsibility,
Lee is the "trouble maker" of the international community.

<P>
LHASA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The economy in Tibet is less
developed due to the constant disturbance of the Dalai group as
well as poor natural conditions, a senior Tibetan official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Basang, deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's
Committee in the Tibet Autonomous Region, told a visiting group

democratic reform in the region in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian group, headed by Nina Ivanovna Karpacheva, the

at the invitation of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Karpacheva told Basang that the group had held "candid talks"
with citizens of this capital city of the region, on various
aspects of their lives.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased to see the smiling faces of the Tibetan
people, who are leading happy lives," she added.

"Saying is believing," she said. "People who know little about
Tibet talk nonsense about the region. There is little objective

<HEADLINE> Factional Fighting Kills 15 in Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were
killed and 17 others wounded Thursday morning in a heavy fighting
between factions for the control of the town of Bur Dhubo in
southern Somalia, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The reports indicated that the mainstream forces of the Somali
National Front (SNF) led by General Omar Hajji Masalleh took the
town from the SNF breakaway faction loyal to Ahmed Sheikh Buraleh.
</P>
<P>
The exact casualties are not known. However, radio operators
outside the town confirmed that 15 people were killed and more
than 17 others wounded during the heavy exchange of gunfire for
control of the town which is about 35 kms southeast of the
regional capital Garbaharrey.
</P>
<P>
SNF mainstream spokesman Ibrahim Jama Howleh also confirmed the
 fighting by claiming a victory against what he called the
Ethiopian- supported split faction of Buraleh.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declared that his forces have taken control of
the town after inflicting heavy losses on the troops of Buraleh,
adding that his forces have confiscated large amount of ammunition
and telecommunication equipment.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports indicated that situation in the town now is
calm, but tense.
</P>
<P>
The VHF radios are once again on the air carrying out business
messages as well as other information regarding the situation of
the town and the families looking for each other.
</P>
<P>
Buraleh's fighters supported by dozens of battle wagons from
the Ethiopian forces had driven Masalleh's militiamen out of Bur
Dhubo town in late June this year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the forces of Masalleh mounted attacks
after the Ethiopian forces withdrew from the town following the
unrest of Bulo Hawo town Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SNF spokesman admitted that eight of their fighters were
killed during the armed confrontation for control of the town
while more than five others have sustained gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
Howleh also claimed that his men had killed nine soldiers and
wounded seven others from the other side while also capturing six
prisoners of war from Buraleh's men.
</P>
<P>
There's no word as yet from the others side led by Buraleh.
</P>
<P>
However, independent sources confirmed the fall of the town to
the SNF faction of Masalleh.
</P>
<P>
The sources also suggested that the defeated fighters of
Buraleh had retreated back to Luq town, the former Al-Itihad
Al-Islam headquarters but now controlled by the Ethiopian forces
that support the loyalists of Buraleh.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi Evades Over 10,000 Yuan in Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongzhi, founder of the
illegal Falun Gong sect, evaded 10,668 yuan in taxes in 1995, when
he purchased a new house, officials from the local public security
and tax collection departments reported today.
</P>
<P>
Li bought a 145-sq-m residence in the Kaiyun residential
district in this capital of northeast China's Jilin province, for
1,700 yuan per sq m, along with a 21.5-sq-m garage in August 1994.
The total purchasing price was 311,000 yuan, a breath-taking sum
at that time.
</P>
<P>
However, when handling the property rights of the house, Li
produced a counterfeit of the title deed, according to which the
purchasing price had been changed to 800 yuan per sq m, and the
total cost was 132,320 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li then paid 7,992 yuan or six percent of the purchase price in
taxes to the local relevant department.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local public security department said that
Li should have paid 18,660 yuan, according to the real house price.
His behavior violated the Criminal Law and related tax regulations,
and should be punished, he added.
</P>
<P>
Actually, according to him, this was not Li's first involvement
in tax evasion. Li Hongzhi also avoided taxes of 8,655 yuan
during 1992-1994, when he was engaged in Falun Gong activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released today by the
People's Bank of China (PBOC) show that China's financial sector
maintained smooth operations in July but the growth of money
supply slowed some what.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the outstanding amount of broad money (M2)
stood at 11.14 trillion yuan, up 15.7 percent from the same period
last year, while that of narrow money (M1) was 3.9 trillion yuan,
up 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth speed of both broad money and narrow money slowed
slightly compared with the previous month, which was considered a
short-term phenomenon caused by capital diversion to stock markets.
The growth of broad money should still be above 17 percent when
deducting this factor, according to a spokesman for the PBOC.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the outstanding amount of all loans by
financial institutions was 9.12 trillion yuan, up 14.6 percent.
The first seven months saw increased loans of 476.9 billion yuan,
an increase of 24 billion yuan over that of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Of the increased loans, 43.3 billion yuan went to the
industrial sector, 46.1 billion yuan went to agriculture while 104.
6 billion yuan was put into infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the outstanding amount of all deposits in
financial institutions was 10.29 trillion yuan, up 16.2 percent,
of which individual deposits accounted for 5.92 trillion yuan, up
16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the exchange rate of the Renminbi yuan was
one US dollar to 8.2774 RMB yuan, up 13 basic points from that at
the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Stop Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Thursday urged African governments to advance the vision of
a world without war by preventing conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was addressing hundreds of people who had gathered
outside his office at Munhumutapa Building in Harare to mark the
Defense Forces Day.
</P>
<P>
The president said it was in pursuit of that vision that
Zimbabwe had sent troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
to defend the government of President Laurent Kabila against
rebels aided by neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Other continents cannot be expected to have a zeal and
enthusiasm to come to the assistance of Africa if Africans
themselves do not have the commitment to help themselves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the joint operation of the allied forces in the Congo
sends signals that the region was ready to consolidate democracy
on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad sent troops to the Congo
last year to ward off attacks from rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the efforts by the allied countries to send troops
to the Congo should not be misconstrued to mean they had
territorial ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts in Mozambique, Somalia, Angola, Rwanda and lately
the DRC must be seen continentally and internationally as
worthwhile for the cause of peaceful and beneficial co-existence
of mankind," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had intervened in the former Zaire because it
recognized the norms of peace and stability as enshrined in its
defense policy.
</P>
<P>
He also said the expected presence of an Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Joint Military Commission and a United Nations
peace-keeping force in the Congo would create an environment for
socio-economic rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in the conflict signed a
cease-fire agreement in Lusaka on July 10, which paved the way for
the two international bodies to intervene in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also pledged that his government will continue to
resolve operational impediments facing the defense forces.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts to upgrade the forces' fighting capability
through the procurement of equipment would continue to receive
serious attention from the government.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the unfavorable macro-economic environment was
making it extremely difficult for the Defense Ministry to improve
the general conditions of the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telecom , SingTel Negotiate for Alliance or Equity Deal: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Europe's top phone company
Deutsche Telekom (DT) is negotiating with Singapore
Telecommunications (SingTel) for either setting up an alliance or
taking 20 percent of SingTel's stake, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They quoted German magazine Wirtschafts Woche as saying
Wednesday that talks between Deutsche Telekom chairman Ron Sommer
and SingTel president and chief executive officer Lee Hsien Yang
are already "underway".
</P>
<P>
Lee was also quoted by the magazine as saying that DT's stake
purchase would benefit SingTel "as it would be able to compete
internationally."
</P>
<P>
Local media said though SingTel spokesman Ivan Tan declined to
comment on what he described as "speculation", the possibility of
a deal could not be ruled out as the company's standard practice
in the past has been to deny outright rumors which had no basis
while keeping mum on ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But local media quoted an anonymous source as saying it
appeared unlikely at this point in time that DT would take an
equity stake in SingTel.
</P>
<P>
However, local English newspaper The Straits Times gave out
another version of the story.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an unidentified source as saying that SingTel and DT
are exploring the possibility of setting up a billion-dollar joint
venture company which will pool their Asian cellular assets.
</P>
<P>
The two are in early stage of talks to combine their regional
mobile phone assets for greater synergy.
</P>
<P>
SingTel, which has stated publicly its intention to link up all
its Asian cellular investments to offer customers greater services
enhancement, has a 20 percent stake in Thailand's Advanced
Info-Service, and a 40 percent shareholding in Philippine firm
Globe Telecom, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
SingTel's German counterpart has a 10 percent stake in Isla
Communications of the Philippines and a 25 percent stake in PT
Satelindo of Indonesia, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the source as saying that such an alliance
would boost companies' vision of becoming leading carriers in Asia
since it would result in economies of scale and improved
operational efficiency.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper quoted another source as saying that there
are hurdles that need to be overcome for such an alliance to
succeed and it was premature to say an alliance was definitely in
the offing.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks Myanmar to Help Fight Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has asked the Myanmar
government to help curb the influx of illicit drugs into the
country, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures to be discussed by the two governments is
the establishment of a border checkpoint to block narcotic
transportation between Myanmar's Myawaddy and Thailand's Tak
province in the north, TNA quoted Minister to the Prime Minister's
Office Jurin Laksanavisit as saying.
</P>
<P>
TNA said that Jurin had sent the message to Rangoon through the
Myanmar ambassador to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Jurin, who oversees the country's Office of the Narcotics
Control Board, said that he will also discuss with Myanmar
officials a plan to train Myanmar personnel in the detection of
chemicals used in narcotic production.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting of senior anti-narcotic officials from both
Thailand and Myanmar is expected to be held in Thailand's southern
province of Ranong on August 17-18 to discuss comprehensive
measures to fight illicit drug trafficking along the border.
</P>
<P>
According to Jurin, about 80 percent of illicit drugs smuggled
into Thailand were produced by the anti-Rangoon Red Wa Army which
was situated in border areas of Myanmar.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Chief of Defense Staff
Maurice Baril has ordered medical examinations for 3,000 Canadian
military personnel deployed in the Balkans between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The "Ottawa Citizen" newspaper said Thursday that orders were
sent to regional military commanders Monday in a bid to defuse the
scandal over possible contamination of soldiers serving in Croatia
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Overlapping investigations are being conducted to determine
whether or not the Canadian troops were exposed to contaminated
soil, which was alleged to be bauxite, which is used as material
for military works.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said someone from high-ranking sources ordered
the removal of a January 1995 letter from soldiers' files that
underscored their possible exposure to toxins.

<HEADLINE> "China Playing More Important Role in UPU" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- "The upcoming 22nd Congress of
the Universal Postal Union (UPU), to be held in this Chinese
capital, will enable the country to work more closely with the UPU,
" said Liu Huasheng, deputy director of the secretariat of the
Congress's organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Liu was the first Chinese to serve in the UPU headquarters in
Bern, Switzerland, where he worked for six years from 1980, and
has been in charge of contacts between China and the UPU ever
since.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five years ago, when China joined the UPU officially,
the delegates representing China to UPU meetings were from the
United Kingdom. It was not until 1972 that the legal status of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) in the UPU was resumed, and that
was 23 years after the founding of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
"The image of the Chinese delegation to the UPU is improving
all the time, since its debut in 1972, and China's role in the
organization is becoming more and more important," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, hardly any voice from China could be heard at UPU
congresses, for the Chinese delegates lacked knowledge of the
regulations and topics under discussion. Some of them even
regarded such topics as competition in the postal market as
irrelevant to China, the economy of which was a planned one at the
time.
</P>
<P>
However, China became prominent as a spokesman for the
interests of developing countries during that period. During the
17th UPU Congress in Lausanne, Switzerland, China and other
countries successfully helped the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea to join the UPU in the face of opposition from some Western
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1980s, China began to take an active part in all the
activities of the UPU, and played important roles in many key
departments, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
For instance, China was appointed to take charge of a special
panel to coordinate the solution of terminal fees, the most
contentious issue of the postal service at the time, at the Seoul
Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1987 the UPU expressed its wish to see China hosting the
Postal Congress, for it believed in China's capability to hold
such an international event, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attached great importance to the
application for hosting the event. President Jiang Zemin assumed
the office of honorary chairman of the organizing committee of the
congress, with vice-premier Wu Bangguo taking the position of
chairman.
</P>
<P>
"Held at the turn of the century in Beijing, the upcoming
Congress will promote the relations between China and the UPU in
the next millennium," Liu commented.
</P>
<P>
The 22nd UPU Congress, the first UPU meeting ever held in China,
is slated for August 23 to September 15. More than 2,000 delegates
from the 189 member nations of the UPU and over 20 international
organizations will attend the conference.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Importance of Reform of SOEs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called on localities to seize the opportunity to push ahead with
the reform and development of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
make breakthroughs in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, made this call in a speech delivered at
an August 11-12 meeting at which he presided in this city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province on the reform and development
of SOEs in north China's eight provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
"The period from now to the end of the first decade of the next
century is a crucial stage in China's reform and development.
During this time we should do our utmost to form a relatively
sound socialist market economic system, and sustain rapid and
healthy economic growth," Jiang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
This is necessary for the country to realize its trans-century
objectives in the modernization drive, and also for maintaining
and developing the hard-won situation of reform, development and
stability, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The good performance of SOEs not only is a major economic
issue that concerns healthy and long-term economic development,
but also a major political issue that concerns the fate of the
socialist system," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The reform and development of SOEs is an important task for the
whole of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and also a glorious
mission history has offered to this generation of the Chinese
people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Party's basic
line and the rich experience drawn from the last two decades of
reform, we have every reason to blaze a new trail in this regard,
as we now have greater national strength and a more solid material
and technological foundation, as well as the enthusiastic
involvement of the people as a whole," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Party secretaries of Beijing and Tianjin municipalities,
and Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces, and
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, attended the meeting and
gave briefings on the operations of SOEs in their areas. Managers
of some large SOEs in these areas gave some additional
explanations. All the participants were optimistic about the
reform of SOEs, promising to lead vigorous and prosperous SOEs
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the great contributions made by the
people of north China to the national economy and the achievements
in the reform and development of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time this year that Jiang has presided over
meetings on this subject. In today's speech, he focused on
unswervingly promoting the reform and development of SOEs, further
speeding up its pace and strengthening the Party's leadership in
this regard.

ISLAMABAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Thursday denied reports that Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden has
training camps in Afghanistan and reiterated that they will not

"Osama is in Afghanistan... but has no military training camps

the Islamic militia.
</P>
<P>
He said that "all of the activities of Osama have been stopped"
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil reiterated that the Taliban will not hand over Osama
to the United States because "America cannot provide any evidence
or any proof" that he is involved in terrorist activities.

China rose 8.5 percent in the first six months of 1999 to 29.8
billion U.S. dollars, a Japanese semi-governmental trade
organization said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is second only to a record January-June high of 29.
93 billion dollars set in 1997, the Japan External Trade
Organization (JETRO) said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to China grew 11.1 percent to 10.68 billion
dollars, with those of chemical products and electronic parts
increasing 23 percent and 21 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Imports from China increased 7.2 percent to 19.12 billion
dollars, including a 9 percent growth in imports of textile
products and a 22 percent surge in imports of fishery products.
</P>
<P>
JETRO also predicted comparable growth in Sino-Japanese trade
for the second half of 1999, expanding bilateral trade for the
whole year by about 10 percent over the 56.9 billion dollars
registered in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Importance of Reform of SOEs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang praised the SOEs and the working class for their great
contributions to the country over the past 50 years, adding that
SOEs have been growing steadily since the reform and opening
policies were introduced at the end of 1978.
</P>
<P>
However, many problems such as falling economic returns, heavy
debts and surplus workers still plague SOEs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged government departments at all levels to pay greater
attention to the problems, and take concrete measures to solve
them, as the reform of SOEs has entered a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more care for the laid-off workers, saying
that improving their lives and ensuring their reemployment is a
major political responsibility of the government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of properly handling the relations
between reform, development and stability, saying that social
stability must be taken into account while promoting reform to
ensure the long-term stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, in the course of developing the socialist
productive forces and promoting the industrialization and
modernization of the country, SOEs, especially large and medium-
sized enterprises, must play a pillar role.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, measures must be taken to explore ways to establish
a modern enterprise system conforming to the market economy, and
improve their management and competitiveness to ensure their
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stressed the importance of maintaining and
increasing the value of State-owned assets, saying that they are
the common property of the people as a whole. Therefore, effective
supervision must be carried out to guarantee that State-owned
assets and their rights and interests are not violated.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Importance of Reform of SOEs (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to shake off burdens and seek new development
opportunities, SOEs should step up technological upgrading and
industry rebuilding, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that SOEs should bear in mind the fact that science
and technology are the primary production force, and pay more
attention to production quality and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang pointed out that SOEs should also have a
disciplined, capable and experienced leadership. He said that
personnel reforms should be further promoted and a market mechnism
should be introduced to choose SOE leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang also put special emphasis on the
development of leadership in the SOEs. He said that adherence to
Communist Party leadership is a basic political principle, and the
guarantee for the smooth progress of all socialist causes.
</P>
<P>
"The more complicated the global environment is, the more
weighty and arduous our reform and development will be, and the
more important the task of strengthening party leadership," Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged SOE leaders to stand in the forefront of the reform
and make sure that key government policies and decisions are
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the overall development situation of the
SOEs is good, indicating that the government's policies concerning
the SOEs and on stimulating domestic demand are correct.
</P>
<P>
He said that the goal of the reforms and development of the
SOEs will be accomplished, so long as all SOEs make full use of
their capital, technological and personnel resources.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting SOE reforms and development, in the final analysis,
means strengthening the role of the State-owned economy within the
socialist market economy," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
SOEs should adhere to the essential principle that our reform
does not mean privatization, and the Communist party leadership in
SOEs should play a core role in this regard, Jiang concluded.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Role in Illegal Gathering at Zhongnanhai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A lengthy report by the People's
Daily and Xinhua News Agency today reviewed the entire story of
the illegal gathering at Zhongnanhai by Falun Gong practitioners
on April 25, and unveiled Li Hongzhi's behind-the-scenes scheme.
</P>
<P>
On April 25, more than 10,000 people systematically gathered
around Zhongnanhai, site of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
This large-scale illegal gathering, targeted at the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council, seriously disturbed the normal
work of the top leading organs of the Party and the State,
disrupted social order in the capital Beijing, and was the most
serious political incident since the 1989 political turmoil, and
had an extremely bad impact at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The whole truth now has come out: the chief figure who directly
plotted and controlled the incident was Li Hongzhi, the ringleader
of Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
Li, who frequently gave media interviews abroad, however, lied
at the beginning when he said he knew nothing about the April 25
illegal gathering, since he was en route from the United States to
Australia at that time.
</P>
<P>
Faced with evidence of his stay in Beijing, Li had to correct
himself, saying that he was in Beijing changing flights and did
not leave the airport. When more evidence came out, Li again
corrected himself and said he had been in Beijing for one day, but
had "contacted nobody".
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi's lies have been laid bare by facts, one after
another. His crimes and schemes hidden behind these lies are now
exposed to the public.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Beijing on April 22 from New York aboard U.S.
Northwest Airlines Flight NW087, and identified himself as a
business person on his entry registration card. As a matter of
fact, Li engaged in no commercial activities in Beijing up to the
time he left for Hong Kong on Air China Flight CA109 on April 24.
Actually he stayed in Beijing for 44 hours, not one day as he
claimed.

<HEADLINE> Behind-Scene Story of Falun Gong Activities Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A lengthy report by the People's
Daily and Xinhua News Agency has reviewed all the circumstances
surrounding the illegal gathering at Zhongnanhai, site of the
Chinese Government, by more than 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners
on April 25, and has unveiled Li Hongzhi's scheme behind this
incident.
</P>
<P>
The illegal gathering, targeting at the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee and the State Council and disrupting the work of
the top leading organs of the Party and State, was the most
serious political incident since the 1989 political turmoil and
had an extremely bad impact both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The report exposed the truth giving many details about the
illegality of the Research Society of Falun Dafa headed by Li
Hongzhi and the Falun Gong organizations under its control.
</P>
<P>
The gathering of some 6,000 Falun Gong practitioners on the
campus of Tianjin Education College of Tianjin Teachers University
was an omen of the illegal gathering on April 25.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi aimed to lead the Tianjin gathering to Beijing and
create a large-scale social disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, who arrived in Beijing on April 22, spent 44 hours
in the city plotting with his followers the illegal gathering
outside the Zhongnanhai. He then flew to Hong Kong to remote
control the incident prior to the gathering in order not to be
suspected of organizing the gathering in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li's purpose was soon spread among his followers, level by
level, via telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing "headquarters" reported the situation of the April
25 gathering to Li Hongzhi in Hong Kong, and asked for his orders.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Letters and Calls Departments of the General
Offices of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and the State Council required that Falun Gong practitioners
stop the illegal gathering. The Falun Gong "headquarters" then
conceded and dismissed the practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Ji Liewu, loyal to Li Hongzhi, was angry about the retreat, and
said that people who practice Falun Gong should be scared of
nothing, including death. "Bloodshed is sometime necessary. It
would have been good if bloodshed occurred," Ji said.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, who has boasted that he understands the mysteries
of the universe, has made a wrong judgment of the situation and
overestimated his capability. Li is doomed to be sent to the court
of history.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, however, was not content, and considered his
actions up to then to be not influential enough. He even dismissed
a leader of the Beijing station, a branch of the Research Society
of Falun Dafa, for not obeying his orders.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi decided to make use of the event at Tianjin Teachers
University to cause a big storm. The Research Society of Falun
Dafa, manipulated by Li Hongzhi, then enlarged the entire scenario,
as Li expected.
</P>
<P>
On April 21, one day before Li Hongzhi sneaked into Beijing
from the United States, Wang Zhiwen, deputy head of the society,
incited the Tianjin station to lodge a protest at Tianjin Teachers
University.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, when Li Hongzhi arrived in Beijing, over 2,000
practitioners took part in the gathering. Wang Zhiwen expressed
his satisfaction when leaders of the Tianjin station reported the
situation, and he noted that the people could gather during the
day and disperse at night.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, the second day Li spent in Beijing, the number of
practitioners at Tianjin Teachers University proliferated to more
than 6,000 from the original 2,000. The Tianjin station prepared
to asked the practitioners to leave after it learned that this
gathering would be stopped by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhiwen, however, said that the practitioners should not be
afraid and should take it as a test. Another 2,000 to 3,000 people
then gathered in front of the Tianjin Municipality People's
Government.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Tianjin was getting worse as Li arrived in
Beijing. But he not only aimed at Tianjin, but at Beijing as well.
What he deliberately planned was to cause social unrest on a
larger scale.

<P>
Li's return to Beijing was well planned. He notified Ji Liewu,
a key member of the Research Society of Falun Dafa, in advance. As
soon as Li returned to his Beijing residence in Chongwen District,
Ji came to report the circumstances about Falun Gong practitioners
besieging Tianjin Teachers University.
</P>
<P>
That this siege was the first thing Li was eager to learn about
shows that from the very beginning he wanted to plot an even
larger incident out of Tianjin gathering.
</P>
<P>
A magazine sponsored by Tianjin Teachers University published
an article on Qigong written by He Zuoxiu, academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), in early April.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his ideas about Qigong with the use of facts,
questioning a piece of Falun Gong propaganda which claimed that
after practicing Falun Gong, an engineer was able to go into a
working steel-smelting furnace and see with his own eyes the
chemical changes occurring at the atomic and molecular level.
</P>
<P>
He, an academician with China's top natural sciences research
body, also gave as an example a student at the CAS Institute of
Theoretical Physics with whom He is working.
</P>
<P>
The student had to be sent to a mental facility twice after
refusing to eat, drink, or sleep, or speak to anyone after
practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Falun Gong including Li Hongzhi saw He Zuoxiu's
article published by the Tianjin Teachers University magazine with
a limited circulation as an opportunity to make trouble.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, a massive number of Falun Gong practitioners burst
into Tianjin Teachers University, staging a sit-in demonstration,
and completely disrupting the normal teaching and living
activities at the university.
</P>
<P>
In May 1998, Beijing Television Station was besieged for
several days by more than 1,000 Falun Gong practitioners because
the station broadcast a program unfavorable to Falun Gong.

On the morning of April 23, Li Hongzhi called together several
core members including Li Chang and Ji Liewu to plot at his
Beijing residence.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi agreed with them that the followers should "go to
the Central Government, go to the State Council." He also asked
that more people be drawn to Beijing. "The more, the better," he
said, stressing that "this will be the last chance."
</P>
<P>
At this secret meeting, Li worked out a strategy for the
massing around the Zhongnanhai. The gathering could not be
accomplished in the name of the Research Society of Falun Dafa and
its branches, and ordinary practitioners should be pushed to the
front line.
</P>
<P>
The April 25 illegal gathering was thus designed by Li Hongzhi
and arranged and carried out by his key followers step by step.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of the same day, Li Chang, Ji Liewu and Ye Hao,
another key member of Falun Gong organizations who now lives in
Canada, held the first meeting to plot the April 25 illegal
gathering in detail.
</P>
<P>
Li Chang related Li Hongzhi's decision on the Zhongnanhai
massing. He asked Ji and Ye to inform all practitioners to get
together outside Zhongnanhai on the early morning of April 25, to
"not only solve the Tianjin problem. but also to safeguard Falun
Gong."
</P>
<P>
They also decide to make use of a routine meeting on April 24
to tell leaders of the Beijing station what to do.
</P>
<P>
Ji Liewu, before the meeting was over, rushed to report the
implementation plan to Li Hongzhi, who expressed his satisfaction
with this preparatory meeting.

<P>
GUILIN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Huang Tenghui, chief of the Falun
Gong guidance station in this city in southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, has recognized the nature of the Falun
Gong cult and urged other followers to break their ties with it.
</P>
<P>
Huang, an employee of the Ronghu Hotel, began to practice Falun
Gong in 1996, and became chief of the Guilin station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Huang could not accept the central authorities' ban of Falun
Gong cult when he learned the news at first. But he changed his
ideas recently, after local officials persuaded him out of the
fallacies preached by Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that he was astonished to learn that Li Hongzhi
had consulted doctors and taken medicine when he was ill, as Li
claimed that Falun Gong practitioners can recover from any illness
without taking medicine and without the help of doctors.
</P>
<P>
He said facts show that Li's so-called "theory" is nothing but
superstition and is not in accordance with science.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that although Falun Gong had claimed that it had
nothing to do with politics, in fact, the illegal gatherings
around Zhongnanhai and local government buildings by Falun Gong
practitioners were antigovernment acts, showing that it is an
illegal organization.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he regretted having become a Falun Gong practitioner.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Zones Attract US$28 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's 32 economic and
technological development zones have used a total of 28 billion U.
S. dollars of overseas investment funds since 1984, accounting for
one-tenth of the country's total, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the foreign exchange earned by the development zones
amounted to 10.6 billion U.S. dollars, according to the sixth
annual conference on investment and development in China's
economic and technological development zones, which ended today in
this capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 113 multinational corporations have invested in the
development zones, with contractual use of foreign funds standing
at 50.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that 60 percent of overseas-funded
projects in China are concentrated in the development zones.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone, the
first of its kind approved by the Chinese government, has approved
1,200 overseas-funded enterprises since 1984, with an actual use
of overseas funds amounting to nearly 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone has
approved 140 overseas-funded enterprises since it was founded in
1993. Exports by operational overseas-funded enterprises in the
zone totaled 66 million U.S. dollars-worth in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China's Export Growth Rate Picking Up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China reported an export growth
rate of 7.5 percent in July, the second month of positive growth
this year, prompting experts to predict brighter export prospects
for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the General Administration of Customs on
Thursday show that the export volume in July reached 17.34 billion
US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
China's general exports between January and July totaled 100.2
billion US dollars-worth, down 2.8 percent from the same period
last year. The overall trade volume reached 189.1 billion US
dollars-worth, up 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the seven months surged 16.6 percent to 88.9 billion
US dollars-worth, resulting in a trade surplus of 11.3 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The declining rate of China's exports has been narrowing since
the beginning of the year, trade experts pointed out. The 2.8
percent decline between January and June was 1.8 percentage points
lower than that between January and June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that China's exports began picking up mainly
because exports of State-owned enterprises (SOE) have shown
positive growth and there has been a continuous growth of exports
by overseas-invested enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimmer to Attempt English Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chen Xiongguang may become the
first Chinese to swim the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
Chen, an ordinary company worker but a veteran swimmer, will
leave for Britain this weekend and try to swim the world-famous
strait from Dover in England to Calais in France around August 22,
according to a Beijing Youth Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
No Chinese has ever succeeded in swimming the English Channel,
even though a swimmer from Taiwan made an incomplete crossing in
the early 1990s, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Chen started to consider a cross-Channel
attempt last year, when he won a race across the Qiongzhou Strait,
which separates the Leizhou Peninsula in south China's Guangdong
Province from the island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chinese people should be among the swimmers to
cross the English Channel," said the 1.68-m-tall champion of a
national winter swimming contest and the runner-up in an
international winter swimming championship in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Calais, the whole crossing will take about 12
hours, if Chen keeps up an average speed of 3,000 m per hour,
according to his plan.
</P>
<P>
Chen acknowledged that the biggest challenge he will have to
face is the low temperature of the sea water, which is between 13
and 17 degrees centigrade and has led to 80 percent of the
failures. The solutions may be special cold-proof swimwear and a
higher intake of calories.
</P>
<P>
The Dover Strait has long been a popular route for cross-
Channel swimmers because of its short distance. But strong and
frequent tidal movements and cold water make the feat rather
difficult.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,200 people from 42 countries have made trans-
Channel attempts, but fewer than 400 have succeeded, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Chen, an employee of the Wenzhou Tobacco and Sugar Company in
east China's Zhejiang Province, has paid 1,350 pounds to a British
swimming association to acquire permission for the swim and pay
for a backup boat and navigation service.

<TEXT>
<P>
Exports of SOEs have declined continuously since last January,
and the overall export volume in the seven months by SOEs added up
to 44.9 billion US dollars-worth, down 10.5 percent. But it was 2.
5 percentage points higher than that between January and June.
</P>
<P>
In July, SOEs reported a total export volume of 8.88 billion US
dollars-worth, up four percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports from overseas-invested companies in the
seven months reached 46.59 billion US dollars-worth, up 6.2
percent. The proportion of exports from those companies in China's
overall exports grew from 42.8 percent between January and July
last year to 46.5 percent in the same period this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's exports of machinery and electronic
products have shown a strong growth rate of 11.3 percent, with an
export volume of 40.04 billion US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
Exports of other major export commodities, including textile
products, garments, footwear and toys, have also risen.
</P>
<P>
China's exports grew only 0.5 percent last year, as a result of
the financial crisis in the capitalist countries of Asia. The
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and several
other relevant departments have taken a series of encouragement
measures to stimulate exports since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the surge in imports was mainly due to a continuous
crackdown on smuggling since last year, increasing domestic demand
and a decline in the prices of commodities on international
markets.
</P>
<P>
The chief import products in the period were machinery,
electronic products and industrial-use raw materials.

<HEADLINE> China Spends More on Technological Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China increased the funding for
scientific and technological development to 103.3 yuan per capita
in 1998, 7.7 yuan more than in 1997, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint report issued by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) and the Ministry of Science and Technology here
today, the average expenditure per scientific and technological
worker in 1998 was 44,000 yuan, 4,000 yuan more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
An NBS official said that China increased its input into
scientific and technological promotion steadily last year, with
the treasury increasing spending and local companies investing
more heavily in the development of new products.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that spending on science and technology by
local governments saw a diminishing growth rate last year, and
that funding for research and development grew more slowly than in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China's funding for scientific and technological advances
totaled 128.98 billion yuan last year, while actual spending in
this respect was 112.85 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that government spending on science and
technology accounts for 4.3 percent of total budget expenditures
last year, the same as in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, local companies increased investment in
technological development by 8.2 percent last year over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Medium-sized and large companies boosted investment in
technological development by 9.2 percent to 47.87 billion yuan,
and increased their investment in product development by 9.5
percent to 24.52 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that the growing role of local companies
in research and development funding indicates the effect of the
government's policy to stimulate investment.
</P>
<P>
They said that the government's input into the technological
renovation of State-owned enterprises has begun to push up the
companies' demand for investment in technology.
</P>
<P>
However, they pointed out that the per capita funding for
scientific and technological advancement in China is still low.
The funding for research and development (R&AMP;D) is yet to be
increased.
</P>
<P>
The NBS report shows that China's spending on R&AMP;D grew more
slowly last year than in the previous year, accounting for only 0.
69 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The report shows that spending on basic research saw a slower
growth rate, and spending on application research decreased last
year. Bloated organizations wasted a great part of the R&AMP;D money,
it noted.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 5 Injured in Armed Robbery in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and five
others injured Wednesday in an unprecedented armed robbery in
Qom, a religious city about 100 kilometers south of the capital
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said a group of armed robbers entered the city's
Mellat shopping mall at 22:45 local time (18:15 GMT) Wednesday and
then threatened shopkeepers to surrender their belongings and
money to them, the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The robbery happened when the mall was almost closed and gold
sellers were busy collecting their jewels. The robbers, wearing
masks, grasped gold and 90 million rials (about 10,000
U.S. dollars) in cash from the shops, said the eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
The robbers began to open fire at shopkeepers and passers-by
indiscriminately as they tried to run away from the scene. The law
enforcement forces patrolling the area rushed to the scene upon
hearing the shots.
</P>
<P>
After running out of bullets, the robbers attacked customers
with knives.
</P>
<P>
Two people injured in the incident died Thursday, and two
others, including one of the robbers, were reportedly in critical
conditions, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement official said there might have been five
robbers because five assault rifles were seized. The robbers have
not been identified yet, he added.

CAIRO -- The Gulf states are seeking to maintain their surplus
production estimated at over 4 million barrels per day in order to
ensure oil market stability and to meet the anticipated growth in
future demand for Gulf petroleum.

year to maintain its unexploited production capacity which is
estimated at some 3.5 million barrels a day, the Arab daily Al
Hayat reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi High Court Orders Halt to Removing Slums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's High Court Thursday
extended its stay order issued Wednesday till August 17 directing
the government not to remove any more slums in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
A High Court Division Bench fixed the date of further hearing
of the writ petition challenging the eviction of slums.
</P>
<P>
The court passed the order Wednesday in response to the writ
petition filed by three non-governmental organizations and two
slum dwellers against the government and six other respondents.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition challenged the legality and authority of the
demolition of slums in the capital city and the eviction of
inhabitants without arranging alternative accommodation and
without any prior notice.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Mahmudul Islam, representing the government,
said Thursday that the government had taken a decision to
rehabilitate some of the slum people and the government's
rehabilitation program for the slum dwellers would be submitted
during the next hearing.
</P>
<P>
It is said that there are around 2 million slum dwellers in
Dhaka, which has a population of about 9 million.
</P>
<P>
A section of the slum dwellers under the patronage of some
godfathers were involved in drug and arms trafficking, and the
eviction drive, aimed at cutting crime and criminal activities,
would continue till the removal of the last slum from the capital,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
The government took the decision to clear all unauthorized
occupants from slums and level up illegal structures following the
killing of a police constable in the city last Friday.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian security forces will
launch a "massive operation" against Islamic rebels in Daghestan
in the coming days, Deputy Interior Minister Igor Zubov said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military intends to do away with Islamic guerrilla
groups hiding in mountainous Daghestan within an "established time
frame," Zubov said.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify the time frame, but acting Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that the militants occupying several
villages near the border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya
would be driven out within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are bringing reserves there, the necessary manpower,
armament and hardware," Zubov said. "There are all grounds to hope
for success."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian Air Force has flown 200 sorties against
the militants who infiltrated the villages last Saturday, Air
Force Commander-in-Chief Anatoly Kornukov told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the use of special and highly destructive weapons
to stop the militants, saying, "These highly effective weapons can
reach the gunmen in their foxholes, canyons and other places of
concealment." However, he denied any plan to bring in heavy
bombers or cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said the number of rebels, estimated at 1,000-1,500 at
the beginning of the operation, has dropped significantly.
</P>
<P>
"The militants are suffering losses, and big ones. The
situation is such that it can definitely be stabilized in two to
three days," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Kornukov as saying.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Intensified to Rescue Hostages in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- British officials in the west
African region Thursday intensified their efforts to rescue six
European hostages including four British kidnapped Wednesday in
western Liberia, according to a report reaching here from
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
British government has issued a warning in London against
non-essential travel to western Liberia and other trouble spots
in the region.
</P>
<P>
An armed gang kidnapped six European aid workers in a region
near the Liberia-Guinea border Wednesday, where Liberia's
government troops were fighting rebels.
</P>
<P>
Four of the captives are British, and the other two were
Norwegian and Italian, who are working with charity organizations
of Merlin and Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
The British citizens, including one female, were in the country
helping to rebuild hospitals, said the British Foreign Office
Wednesday in London.
</P>
<P>
The workers were seized Wednesday morning when armed men
entered their compound in Kolahun, Lofa County near the Sierra
Leone-Guinea border.
</P>
<P>
Merlin's director of operations Jules Pieters said in London
Thursday that there had been no contact with the hostage takers
but it was hoped that this could be established Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to get in touch with the kidnappers," he
said, adding "No demands have been made" from the kidnappers, the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The area has been witnessing severe fighting between rebels
believed to be based in Guinea, and Liberian government troops.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor Wednesday declared a state
of emergency in Lofa County, where he said insurgents had
captured several towns overnight.
</P>
<P>
Taylor told journalists that rebel troops had broken across the
Guinean border Tuesday and taken Kolahun, one of Lofa County's
main towns, and a number of surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
Government forces were being rushed to the front and Taylor
called on all "able-bodied men" to report for military service.
Government troops had closed Liberia's border with Guinea, said
the president.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parliament Enacts Wiretapping Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) Thursday
enacted a set of bills that will allow investigators to wiretap
communications to fight organized crime, despite last-ditch
efforts by opposition parties to block their passage.
</P>
<P>
The House of Councillors passed the bills with 142 votes in
favor and 99 against. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
its coalition partner the Liberal Party (LP) and the No. 2
opposition New Komeito party backed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The package includes a bill allowing law enforcement
authorities to wiretap private communications to investigate
crimes involving drugs, guns, murders committed by groups, and the
mass smuggling of people into Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has said the wiretapping legislation
would be a major weapon against organized crime, such as crimes
linked to the AUM Shinrikyo cult, as well as gun and drug
violations committed by underworld syndicates.
</P>
<P>
But critics argued the legislation would infringe on
constitutional provisions regarding the secrecy of communications
and protection of privacy.
</P>
<P>
The package, which cleared the House of Representatives (lower
house) in June, was railroaded through the upper house's Judicial
Affairs Committee Monday by the LDP, the LP and the New Komeito.

expectancy as a result of HIV/AIDS, seven are in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe will be back down to that of the
1960s, said the 1999 United Nations Development Program report.
</P>
<P>
The rapid spread of AIDS has also incurred heavy economic
losses to the continent torn by conflicts and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The continent's labor force has been dramatically weakened,
with the sub- Sahara countries the hardest hit. The 14-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC) has the world's
fastest-accelerating AIDS rate and is confronting debilitating
human and economic devastation with 10 percent of its workforce
infected.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is a case in point. Many of its companies are
already losing three percent of their workforce to the disease and
20 percent of tause of
apartheid, but our next lost generation will be due to children
orphaned by AIDS," said Alan Whiteside, director of health,
economics and HIV/AIDS at the University of Natal in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in African countries is also victimized by
AIDS. The World Bank estimated that countries haunted by the
epidemic has already seen a one-percent drop in per capita income,
with Kenya showing signs of a 15-percent reduction in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says if African countries
want to realize its goal of halving the number of their
impoverished people by 2015, they must achieve a seven-percent
economic growth each year in the coming 15 years. The spread of
AIDS, if not checked, would hinder the continent from achieving
its economic goal.
</P>
<P>
Already staggering under heavy debt, African countries are now
shouldering another heavy burden -- the medical cost for AIDS
cases. Africa as a whole currently devotes one billion U.S.
dollars, an increase of 850 million dollars from 1997, to medical
treatment of AIDS patients. By 2005, some African countries, like
Kenya and Zimbabwe, will allocate half of their health budget to
cover the expenses for AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the AIDS gravity, African countries have begun to
mobilize themselves to combat the disease. Uganda, which began an
awareness campaign 10 years ago, has become a successful model of
containing the disease, the only country in Africa that has
reduced its AIDS/HIV infection rate substantially.
</P>
<P>
The country has newly developed retro-viral drug which initial
findings show reduced transmission from mother to child during
pregnancy. The drug, which is presently being tested in clinical
trials, is considerably cheaper than its counterpart AZT, costing
about six dollars instead of 60 dollars per treatment.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, one of the hardest hit countries in the world, has
declared AIDS as a national disaster. The government is working
to set up a national anti-AIDS committee to coordinate and guide
anti-AIDS efforts.
</P>
<P>
South African Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang recently
led a delegation to Uganda to adopt the country's successful model
of mobilizing society against the scourge.
</P>
<P>
"Social mobilization is key to prevention, and before we have a
cure, that is where we need to concentrate," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans are very open about HIV and AIDS. This is what we as
South Africans really have to learn -- the openness is an
essential tool against the stigmatization of the disease, she
added.
</P>
<P>
"If Uganda can do it, so can South Africa . We have fought
many battles. We can't be defeated by a virus," she said.

<HEADLINE> Two Somalis Killed in Demonstration Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- At least two Somalis were
killed and more than 10 others wounded during demonstrations
Wednesday against Ethiopians stationed in the border town of Bulo
Hawo.
</P>
<P>
Elders and businessmen who fled the town to neighboring Mandera
town across the Kenyan border said the people in the town have
been angered by the torture of three Somalis taken away by the
Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians reportedly suspected the two as spies for the
Somali National Front (SNF) faction of General Omar Hajji Masalleh
allied with Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
During the violent demonstrations, the Ethiopian forces opened
fire at the sky in an attempt to disperse the crowd. But as some
of the demonstrators proceeded toward them, two were killed on the
spot. The Ethiopians have also rounded up more than 20 people
whose fate are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Following the demonstrations, the Ethiopian forces imposed
curfew on the town blocking all entrances in and out of the town.
The Ethiopian soldiers erected roadblocks in several strategic
points and restricted all kinds of movements both traffic and
pedestrians alike. Residents of the town were told that the
curfew is effective from 5:00 p.m. local time everyday until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
The SNF faction has strongly condemned the killing and torture
of the Somalis by the Ethiopians in Bulo Hawo town. Its spokesman
Ibrahim Jama Howleh told reporters here Thursday in South
Mogadishu that the Ethiopian soldiers had behaved a lot worse
than any occupation force.
</P>
<P>
Howleh appealed to the Ethiopians to withdraw from the town and
other towns in Gedo region. The curfew, killing and the
demonstrations were also confirmed by the radio operators in other
towns and villages in Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of Ethiopians in several regions in
southern Somalia, their military movements have been limited
following the alleged on-going underground discussions between the
faction of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the Ethiopian government
brokered by Libya.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Railway between Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, the second largest city in the
country, has been disconnected temporarily due to threat of flood,
according a press release by the railway authorities available
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to stop the railway transport services was made to
spare passengers inconveniences on the way, the release said,
adding that the decision applies only to passengers and that
freight transport would continue as usual.
</P>
<P>
The railway, linking Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, also goes to
Djibouti. The railway has become the only land channel for
Ethiopian import and export when the country began engaged in
border conflict with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Dire Dawa is about 450 km east of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The serious flood in the Wolinchiti locality and the recent
heavy rains reportedly carried way minor dams.
</P>
<P>
Transport services between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa will
resume immediately after the flood threat is thwarted through
practical measures taken by the railway, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Barmasai Admits Collusion in Golden League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Bernard Barmasai, one of
the four athletes to win the million dollar jackpot at the Golden
League, admitted Wednesday a collusion with compatriot Christopher
Koskei to keep him in the chase.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai, world 3,000 meter steeplechase record holder, said
his win in the Weltklasse Golden League athletics came from an
appeal to his friend, but not his running.
</P>
<P>
"His (Koskei's) last 100 meters are really good," said Barmasai.
"When he tried to pass I tried to talk to him. I said 'leave it
for me', and that's why he slowed down. He would have won today,
but because he is a friend and we have to live together...the
jackpot is for me and my friends."
</P>
<P>
Barmasai won the 3,000 meter steeplechase by just a stride
ahead of his countryman.
</P>
<P>
If Barmasai lost, American sprint-queen Marion Jones, Romanian
middle-distance specialist Gabriela Szabo and Denmark's 800-metre
world record holder Wilson Kipketer would suit to a three split of
the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's Golden League meeting in Zurich, only two of
the seven stops remain, in Brussels and Berlin.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants New Multilateral Trade Negotiations to Start in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAULA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Thursday it
will stick by its decision that the new round of multilateral
trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization should start in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled preparatory meeting in Seattle this November
should be postponed to next year, Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said Thursday in Kuala Kangsar,
some 255 kilometers north from here, the Bernama news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and other developing countries are not ready for the
preparatory meeting and the "millennium round" of the multilateral
trade negotiations as they are still focusing on reviving their
economies and overcoming domestic problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand is that there must be a new round (of negotiations)
but the announcement shouldn't be made in November in Seattle,"
she was quoted as saying after opening a school there.
</P>
<P>
She said Malaysia could only agree if the preparatory meeting,
which would determine the agendas for the negotiations, would be
held next year at a ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need more time, at least one year, to
settle their domestic problems before shifting their attention on
other agendas to be discussed at the meeting, she said.
</P>
<P>
"As for Malaysia, we are busy with the issue of reviving our
economy and this multilateral issue must be kept aside first. We
prefer bilateral (negotiations) at this moment," she said.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the new round, developing countries can
discuss their trade agendas in existing forum, including the G-77,
G-15, and ASEAN, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We could also use other fora for developing countries to
discuss issues of the (multilateral trade negotiations) agenda.
One year is not long," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said it is more appropriate for the new round of
negotiations, or millennium round, to begin in the year 2001
because the millennium would actually start from that year.
</P>
<P>
"They were wrong when they said the millennium starts from the
year 2000. So give us that one year, we agree (with the new round)
but fix it in 2001," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the date for the new round could only be made
after all the countries agreed to it.

<HEADLINE> British Children Addicted to TV: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The British spend around 15 years
of their waking lives staring at the television and addiction to
the small screen is growing all the time, according to a survey
published by The Times newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people are being damaged and billions of hours of
our lives wasted through intended and culpable media addiction,"
said the report, entitled Media Addiction.
</P>
<P>
"Children's educational development is undermined by media
addiction, even before they start school, and any serious attempt
to address educational standards must consider it," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Media addiction, especially among children, has destructive
effects on basic aspects of life. It undermines speaking, thinking,
sleeping, emotions, activity, seeing concentration, reading, the
shaping of beliefs, growth of relationship and people's sense of
identity," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report warned instead of having a strong sense of their own
identity and personality, children are infatuated with stars such
as David Beckham and Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
It said addiction to TV may be one of the biggest problems of
the age, linked in turn to a poorly developed conscience, a
detached approach to violence and other ills.

<HEADLINE> W. African Gas Pipeline Project to Be Completed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The West African Gas Pipeline
Project will be completed in 28 months' time with Benin, Ghana and
Togo receiving the first delivery of gas from Nigeria on January
1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
A Memorandum of Understanding on the project was signed
Wednesday in Cotonou, capital of Benin, between the West African
Gas Pipeline Project developer and the project implementation
committee, This Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Benin Energy Minister Felix Eson Danson said
that the memorandum was a significant event as it gave what he
called a new vista to the implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
He also described the memorandum signing exercise as a
demonstration of the commitment of the participating governments
of Nigeria, Benin, Ghana and Togo to the success of the project.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture agreement was also signed by a commercial group
 consisting of Shell, Chevron, Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Societe
Beninoise de Gaz, South Africa, and Societe Togolaise de Gaz,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The commercial group agreed to expedite the development of the
project and appointed Chevron Nigeria Limited as the project
manager.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture agreement is a follow-up to the decision
reached by the consortium in August last year in Lagos to launch a
private sector initiative to accelerate implementation of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The 960-km project which was first initiated by a World Bank
study on how best to utilize Nigeria's rich but flared gas
resources is designed to deliver Nigerian gas to domestic and
industrial consumers in Benin, Ghana and Togo.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is expected to deliver between 50 million and 160
million standard cubic feet of Nigerian gas daily to these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is expected to take 75 percent of the gas to feed its old
and new thermal plants at Tano, Takoradi and Tema while Benin and
Togo will utilize the gas for electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, according to the World Bank, would be able
to save about 500 million U.S. dollars in energy cost over a
period of 20 years when gas replaces their expensive fuels and
hydro power currently used for power generation.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of the project include acting as a prototype for
the interconnection of the region, reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions by 100 million tons and availability of reliable, low
cost energy, according to a feasibility study on the project.

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China continued increases in
real estate development and investment this year, with the revival
of the real estate market, according to the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
The housing reform and increased housing sales replacing
government allocations have helped the country's housing markets,
according to an official at the ministry's real estate department.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate individual housing sales, commercial banks have
introduced mortgages to stimulate housing purchases.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show individual housing sales accounting for
70 percent of total housing sales so far this year and a decrease
in the amount of houses sold to government institutions and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country expects to add nearly 400 million sq.m. of housing
by the end of this year, or 50 million sq.m. more than for 1998.
Sharp increases are also expected in housing sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that China's real estate business is growing in a
sound way and construction is expected to grow 15 percent annually
for the first decade of the next century. By 2005, China will have
added 1.5 billion sq.m. of housing in urban areas, 3.5 billion sq.
m. in rural areas, and rebuild 2.9 billion sq.m. of old houses.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees Threat of Iraqi Arms Growing: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Over the past few weeks,
Israel has thrust the Iraqi threat high up on its list of
diplomatic and security priorities, the local daily Haaretz
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In all their diplomatic meetings, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Foreign Minister David Levy reportedly voiced concern over
the Iraqi arms build up after the departure of UN
inspectors overseeing Iraq's non-conventional weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently intensified verbal
attacks on Israel, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In his July 17 Independence Day speech, Saddam called for
Israel's destruction and removal of Zionism from "Arab
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
He attacked those Arab leaders who are seeking peace with
Israel and expressed admiration for "the man calling himself the
new prime minister of the Zionist entity."
</P>
<P>
Barak has been calling Saddam Hussein's Iraq a serious threat
because of the Iraqi leader's drive to obtain chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted intelligence sources as saying Iraq could
regain at least a certain degree of its biological and chemical
capability within nine months after the lifting of the
international inspection.
</P>
<P>
The sources also believe that the Iraqis are continuing to
make headway on gathering know-how, equipment, experts and
material for their nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Israel's diplomatic efforts have been focused mainly on
returning the international inspectors to Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi threat was discussed extensively during a
July visit to Washington by a senior intelligence official of
Israeli army, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, is also scheduled to visit Israel next week and the issue
of the Iraqi threat is expected to be raised in his meetings with
Barak and the heads of Israel's defense establishment.

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Roof tiles
falling at the media center made the host of the Southeast Asian
Games so embarrassed that it took down all 150,000 tiles as a

</P>
<P>
An initial cascade of tiles last week, before the games began,
injured at least one policeman and crushed a police van, reports

No one was hurt when more tiles fell Wednesday, but journalists

"This is only a precaution. There is no danger of tiles falling,
" Ismail Damit, minister of development of oil-rich Brunei, told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the building structure is safe, and it would remain
watertight because of a metal roof under the ornamental tiles.
</P>
<P>
Some problems are normal on a construction site, he said.
</P>
<P>
The media center has been set up in a section, completed in May,
of the International Convention Center. Work was continuing on the
part where tiles fell, which overlooked an outdoor area set aside
as a smoking section for the media center.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the builders had tested the fasteners to withstand
weights 2 1/2 times those of the tiles, and "we have to establish
why they did not work on the roof."
</P>
<P>
He said the first fall of tiles occurred a day after "
exceptionally strong" winds.
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "we have decided not to take a chance on tiles
slipping down" at the part of the center serving as headquarters
for hundreds of journalists covering the games among some 2,400
athletes from 10 nations.
</P>
<P>
Brunei is host to the SEA Games for the first time. It plans to
play host to next year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum and use many of the venues constructed for the
games.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets Int'l Directions for Next millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday announced
its international directions for the next millennium which include
promoting a stable environment in East Asia, forging stronger
bonds with Northeast Asia as well as continuing to foster good
bilateral relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The outlines of Malaysia's course of action in the near future
were given by Foreign Minister Syed Hamid during a talk on
"Malaysia's International Direction in the International Arena in
the Next Millennium" at the National Institute of Public
Administration here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that obviously, Malaysia's international direction in
the next millennium will be influenced not only by external
developments but also internal factors.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also faces manifold challenges such as globalization,
revolutions in the information and communications technology and
the diversity of issues and conflicting interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Malaysia will nurture positive interstate
relations especially with its neighbors and countries of
particular importance.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with bilateral relations with neighbors, Malaysia
will continue to adopt win-win formulas and resolve all
differences peacefully through negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a wider regional context, that is in the
ASEAN-plus-three (China, Japan and South Korea) context, Malaysia
will remain a firm advocate of the strategic and economic
importance of cooperation with China, Japan and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will also continue to be pro-active at the
multilateral level by participating in coalitions or caucuses to
promote interests and rights, especially of the developing
countries, Syed Hamid said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Speeds up Arms Shipments to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel agreed to speed up
shipments of arms and military equipment to India during the
recent incidents in Kashmir, the local daily Haaretz reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the Indian government had asked Israel to
accelerate its arms shipments to India before the recent
developments in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Indian troops attacked a Pakistani-supported guerilla group in
Kashmir in May, and since then tensions between the two countries
have been running high, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and India have maintained extensive security cooperation
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has also taken a serious
interest in developing ties with India and he is expected to make
his first visit to New Delhi next year, the daily noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which for years supported Pakistan, has
recently improved relations with New Delhi and removed
restrictions on sales of arms to India, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Israel subsequently signed a contract for the sale of
sophisticated electronic equipment to India, long delayed because
of the American restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Israel also helped India overcome certain problems with the
United States following the imposition of American sanctions on
India in response to India's nuclear test in May 1998, the daily
said.
</P>
<P>
"India is a large country that knows how to manage with
Washington on its own," a senior Israeli official was quoted by
the daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our help concerned only specific matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the foundation of the relationship between Israel and India
is an understanding of the geopolitical similarity between the
two countries, both surrounded by "strong and hostile neighbors",
the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries maintain two forums for conferring, one
between their respective foreign ministries and the other between
the defense ministries, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
And at periodic meetings, the parties exchange analysis of the
situation in the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Israel and India totals about 700 million
U.S. dollars a year so far.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Court Papers Much Longer Than Before (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's court verdict papers,
which used to be three to five pages long during the past several
decades, are ballooning to 20 and 30 pages, as part of the country
's ongoing judicial reform.
</P>
<P>
The papers now record the full course of the trial and how the
evidence was presented and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
This reform is part of efforts to fully implement the principle
of "open trials," said Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People'
s Court, in an interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
"Openness of the reason for judgment is just as important as
opening trials to the public," he said, noting that the previously
monotonous and oversimplified court verdict papers were
insufficient to reflect the openness and equity of court verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Since he took the office of Supreme Court President in 1998,
Xiao has been pushing for open trials across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese courts, judges used to announce that a judgment was
made based on a certain part of a certain article of a certain law,
without even citing the specific contents of the law. Few people
could understand how the judgment was made.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Western court papers usually bore listeners to
death by containing a complete transcript of the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese courts now are following their Western counterparts.
In May this year, the Supreme Court issued a manual titled "Model
Papers of Criminal Lawsuit," which requires judges to record all
the important evidence and arguments presented to the court, as
well as how they analyzed the material and reached their verdicts.

<P>
"Judges should convince both defendants and prosecutors or
plaintiffs why the verdicts are fair through their court papers,"
Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
A recent court paper on the first instance trial of tobacco
giant Chu Shijian in Yunnan Province was more than 30 pages, as
confirmed by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
However, one judge said it could have been just three pages
before the reform.
</P>
<P>
According to Supreme People's Court judges, based on experience
in criminal trials, they are collecting court paper samples of
civil and economic cases and trying to formulate standards for
implementation across the country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, reform of court papers is just part of the judicial
reforms initiated by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
According to a five-year reform plan in the making, the Court
will push for further comprehensive reforms for trial methods,
mechanisms for verdict enforcement, internal structures, a people'
s jury system, and internal checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts amount to the creation of a just, open,
efficient, and clean and honest judicial system that ensures fair
and independent trials, according to Xiao.

<HEADLINE> Number of Libraries Grows Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's library sector is
experiencing a rapid growth as more new libraries are opened while
service improved, according to a report in today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 2,600 public libraries of county-level
or higher, which have a total floor space of four million square
meters, compared with 1,732 libraries with a floor space of 650,
000 sq m around the year of 1980, the report quoted a researcher
with the China Society of Library Science as saying.
</P>
<P>
"That means in every 3.7 days a new public library is opened in
China," Wu Jianzhong said, describing the growth rate as "world-
leading".
</P>
<P>
Apart from some modern libraries built in the early 1990s, such
as the National Library in Beijing and the Shanghai Library, a
group of large-scale public libraries are under construction or
planned to be built in Shandong and Anhui provinces, and Shenyang,
Nanjing and Shenzhen cities.
</P>
<P>
The researcher added that more and more Chinese libraries
attach importance to improving service, such as extending the work
hours, even during weekends and holidays. The Shanghai Library has
become accessible all days a year.
</P>
<P>
Some new forms of libraries have been emerging, such as
libraries on the bus and the ship and in jails, in order to make
the libraries more accessible, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Aims to Wipe out Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China aims to basically wipe out poverty by the end of
the century, according to a poverty-relief working conference held
recently in Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The number of poverty-stricken farmers and herdsmen in Tibet
has reportedly dropped from 870,000 in the late 1970s to a present
figure 147,000 thanks to a series of preferential policies granted
by China's central government.
</P>
<P>
Since the country adopted its reform and opening up policy in
1978, the central government has invested a total of 26 billion
yuan (3.13 billion US dollars) to help Tibet create projects to
improve the region's infrastructure facilities and mobilized other
localities to help the region with 105 projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Tibet has built 390 water conservancy
facilities to expand irrigated farmland by 30,700 hectares and
reclaim 19,300 hectares of low-yielding land.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Enslaved At Least 170,000 Chinese Laborers in Building Fortress against Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- New evidence shows that the
Japanese used at least 170,000 Chinese laborers and make them toil
to build a fortress in northernmost China against a possible
attack by the Soviet Union during the World War II over half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
According to an extensive, in-depth survey conducted by the
Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Museum, the 110 by 50
kilometers Dongning Fortress was the largest of its kind in Asia,
concentrating a great number of bastions and armories.
</P>
<P>
"At least 170,000 Chinese laborers were enlisted and enslaved
in 11 years between 1934 and August of 1945, when the Japanese
troops were defeated and surrendered, to build the fortress in
Dongning County bordering Russia," said Cheng Penghan, head of the
research group.
</P>
<P>
He said the group has spent half a year studying historical
documents and carrying out field study and investigations. They
have discovered three burial grounds near the fortress, one of
which contained the remains of more than 3,000 bodies of Chinese
laborers.
</P>
<P>
Cheng went on to say that they also found a document by a
former Japanese officer which disclosed that many of the laborers
were held captive, and most of them worked to death or died of
hunger and illness, while others were secretly killed during the
construction of the fort.
</P>
<P>
According to recollections of Huang Shiyi and Zhao Jinbao, two
aged villagers of Laochengzigou, who were forced by the intruding
Japanese soldiers to transport corpses of Chinese laborers then,
they often moved two or three laborers' corpses by horse cart
daily and a dozen corpses a day at times, and they did the same
job again and again for the whole of three years.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops intruded into northeast China in 1931 and
propped up the puppet country of Manchuria rulers there, which
received tens of thousands of Japanese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
However, the fortress failed to hold back the marching Soviet
army in 1945, when the Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin declared war
against Japan according to an agreement he had signed with United
States and British leaders.

<P>
LHASA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Experts have warned that an hole
in the ozone layer will be formed over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
if prompt, effective measures are not taken to deal with the low
ozone distribution phenomenon occurring over the Plateau this
summer.
</P>
<P>
The ozone depletion phenomenon over the plateau has led to a
rising trend over recent years in the incidence of cataracts in
local people, mutations among animals and plants, and a
deterioration of the ecological environment in Tibet, according to
the experts.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has the highest incidence of cataracts in China.
</P>
<P>
Ozone modifies the strength of the ultraviolet radiation
reaching the Earth, and is essential to life on the planet.
</P>
<P>
International environment protection organizations have been
conducting a survey in Tibet to determine the amount of
destruction done to the ozone layer over the Plateau.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Amid a flurry of quiet diplomatic contacts in recent days,
the gap between Israel and the Palestinians over implementing the
Wye accord has been sharply narrowed. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has signalled his willingness to complete all three phases
of withdrawals from the West Bank by February 15, sources close to
the negotiations said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Over the past few weeks, Israel has thrust the Iraqi threat
high up on its list of diplomatic and security priorities. Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy have
repeatedly voiced concern over Iraq's arms buildup, nine months
after the departure of U.N. inspectors overseeing Iraq's
non-conventional weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government has recently debated the growing
violence in the Israeli society. Some officials said that it is
time to take practical measures to curb violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Aryeh Deri, former leader of Israel's Shas Party, told
Yediot Aharonot newspaper in an interview that he will return to
Israel soon. Deri, who is currently staying in the United States,
also said that it is right for him to quit the party leadership
after the May general elections.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged to Develop Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has urged
people owning undeveloped land to develop it, otherwise the land
would be repossessed.
</P>
<P>
Lands Minister Samuel Miyanda said that it was not government's
wish to repossess land, but it was just a way of encouraging
people to develop their land.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry would not allow a situation
where people kept their land idle, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda made this call when he officiated at a raffle draw of
winners of land in Lusaka wednesday, who entered the competition
at just ended 73rd Zambian agricultural and commercial show.
</P>
<P>
The prizes on offer by the government were seven plots in
Chinika Area in Lusaka Province.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said the small holdings competition was restricted to
women as a way of addressing gender imbalance in land ownership.
</P>
<P>
"My ministry decided that the small holdings would be open for
competition to ladies only," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government had put up a deliberate policy
to allocate 10 percent of any land allocation to women in any area
in addition to other women allocation on merit.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry embarked on the draw competition as an
extension to their community service, adding that the winners of
the raffle would soon be invited to collect their title deeds.
</P>
<P>
The government would support a vegetable and flowering
processing and export project in Chinika Area, in which 200
Zambians are expected to be allocated, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Warns to Foil Rebels in Congo: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has promised total force
to foil any attempt by the rebel groups to disrupt the
verification team's job in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Kahinda Otafiire, a member of Ugandan delegation in Kisangani
in eastern DRC, made the warning there Wednesday, the New Vision
paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Any move aimed at making the team's work fruitless would be met
with maximum force. The Ugandan troops would establish order as
over the weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the third largest city in the DRC was high as
the South African and Zambian delegations jetted in, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Rival rebel factions jostled for the attention of the South
African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma as she arrived at the
airport on a mission to iron out differences between the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The verification team was approved under the July 10 Lusaka
cease-fire agreement which was endorsed by six African countries.
The rebels in the DRC did not pen it due to internal rivalry.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan army clashed with DRC rebels backed by Rwanda last
weekend, killing at least seven soldiers and injuring some others.
</P>
<P>
The rebels split into two groups on May 19. Those based in Goma
were headed by Emile IIunga and backed by Rwanda while those based
in Kisangani were led by Wamba dia Wamba and supported by Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Western Kenya Faces Maize Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Western Province in Kenya will
experience a shortfall of over 1.5 million 90-kg bags of maize
this year, the provincial Agricultural Director David Nyasani has
said.
</P>
<P>
Releasing his report on maize production Wednesday, Nyasani
said his province required six million bags of maize to cater for
the region's population and for sale to other areas suffering
food deficit, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that maize output had this year dropped and was
estimated at 4. 3 million bags after the long rains (March to
June) in the crop growing areas.
</P>
<P>
The director announced that during the short rain (September to
December) , the province was expected a small quantity of the crop
which will add up to a total production of about 4.5 million bags
for the long and short rains.
</P>
<P>
Nyasani attributed the shortfall in maize production to late
planting due to a shortage of maize seeds variety which farmers
in the province prefer and the delayed onset of the long rains.
</P>
<P>
Local media earlier reported that scarce rains during the long
rains recorded poor maize harvest in major maize growing areas in
Kenya and the country is facing a shortage of two million bags of
maize this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the Kenyan government announced to cut its
tariff on maize import to 25 percent from 32.5 percent in a bid
to encourage cereal traders to import maize from outside.

<HEADLINE> Downing of Aircraft Complicates Peace Process: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Thursday that the shooting down of an unarmed Pakistan
Navy aircraft by India would further complicate the already
strained ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was a cowardly act," Sharif said during a funeral service
held in Karachi for the 16 navy personnel killed Tuesday when the
aircraft was shot down by Indian jet fighters in Pakistan's
territory.
</P>
<P>
Attending the funeral service were also top civilian and
military officers.
</P>
<P>
Funeral prayers were held at the Mehran naval base where 16
coffins wrapped in Pakistani flags were lined up. Sharif and the
chiefs of the three services laid floral wreaths.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Navy Atlantic aircraft was shot down Tuesday
morning by Indian air force aircraft. The Indian side claimed that
the Pakistani plane was shot down when it intruded into Indian air
space. However, Pakistan has categorically rejected the Indian
charge.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that the navy plane was unarmed and
was on a routine training mission in Pakistan's air space. It
posed no threat to India which committed an act of "military
aggression," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Indian act was a "grave violation" of international norms
and the relevant bilateral agreements, he said, adding that "it
will further complicate and cast a shadow over the bilateral peace
process."

<P>
GUILIN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The popular scenic Chinese city
of Guilin has successfully completed a consultation event during
which it asked domestic and overseas experts to submit designs for
the around-the-city water supply system.
</P>
<P>
Institutions from the United States, Japan, and France, as well
those from Taiwan and Jiangsu Province's Southeast China
University have offered advice.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has done quite a lot to improve its
infrastructure and become more of an international city.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Guilin Prefecture and Guilin City, both of which
were under the jurisdiction of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
regional government, were given approval to combine themselves
into one administrative unit.
</P>
<P>
This means a greater number of projects to be built in the new
city of Guilin, or greater Guilin, which now has an area of 27,800
sq.km. and a population of 4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Because of Guilin's reputation as a tourist spot, it needs
stricter management and controls on construction work to avoid any
possible damage to its natural beauty and harmony, says one local
official.
</P>
<P>
He says they plan to build the new water system with a more
scientific design using drafts from overseas organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese woman soldier in east
China's Jiangsu Province yesterday successfully gave birth to four
babies in a military hospital.
</P>
<P>
Ni Ying, 28 years old, who is also a doctor in the hospital's
contagious diseases department, gave birth to the first of the
quadruplets, weighing 3.3 pounds, at 6:44 yesterday morning. The
second baby, weighing 3.4 pounds, was born eight minutes later,
and the last two were born one hour later, each weighing 3.08
pounds.
</P>
<P>
Ni's delivery was five weeks ahead of the expected date, but
the four babies, all girls, are in good condition, and were soon
sent to a children's hospital nearby to receive special care.
</P>
<P>
According to Ni's doctor, it is unusual that she gave birth to
quadruplets, because she has neither a family history of multiple
births, nor did she take any drug to accelerate ovulation, which
are the two common circumstances resulting in multiple births.
</P>
<P>
A family planing official from the provincial government said
the four babies will receive government aid including free
educations and free home-care services.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Mobil Oil will increase its
price in New Zealand by three cents of the NZ dollar a liter from
Thursday's midnight and local oil companies have all indicated
they would follow the lead.
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of last month, the cost of petrol in New
Zealand has increased twice, with a total increase of six cents a
liter.
</P>
<P>
The latest rise will take the petrol prices of 96 octane to
more than half a U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
All the oil companies operating in New Zealand said they are
all facing the same pressure as a result of continuing increases
in the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Local oil industry analysts have indicated the latest rise in
petrol prices may not be the last in the short-term future. The
size of the increase in crude oil prices means more price rises at
the pump may be on the cards, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's resident
population was estimated to have been 3,808,700 at June 30, 1999,
NZ's Deputy Government Statistician Dianne Macaskill said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Macaskill said that this represents an
increase of 17,800 or 0.5 percent over the figure a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"This growth rate is about two-fifths of the 1.3 percent
average annual growth rate of the previous five years," she said.
</P>
<P>
A turnaround in the external migration balance has been the
main factor in the slower growth. Permanent and long-term
departures exceeded arrivals by 11,400 during the year to June
30, 1999, compared with a small migration gain of 500 in the
previous year. Over the same period, natural increase (excess of
births over deaths) dropped slightly from 29,400 to 29,100,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The number of women compared to the number of men in the New
Zealand population continues to slowly increase. As at June 30,
1999, there were 103 women per 100 men, Macaskill said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Province Benefitting From World Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 560,000 people in 10 poverty-
stricken counties in China's Qinghai Province are living better
lives thanks to assistance from the United Nations' World Food
Program (WFP), according to a local government official.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chengzhi, of the provincial foreign investment office,
says that Qinghai has built five reservoirs, more than 700
kilometers of waterways, 600 kilometers of roads, and 3,300
hectares of forested land with WFP help.
</P>
<P>
WFP started the projects in 1985 and two have been completed
and two others are underway. They have helped improve
agricultural conditions and the environment and increased grain
output, thereby providing food security and increased incomes.
</P>
<P>
They also helped provide tapwater, irrigation systems, primary
schools, and clinics in the impoverished areas and more than 130,
000 farmers and herdspeople have received training from WFP-
sponsored programs, 50,000 of them women, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
The province also benefited a great deal from loans provided by
the International Fund for Agricultural Development, he adds.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Reaches 63.5% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation has
surpassed all expectations to hit an all time high of 63.5 percent
in July, casting doubt on the efforts to meet the International
Monetary Fund's target of 30 percent by year end, the weekly
Business reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office Wednesday said the 8.3
percentage points increase from the June inflation figure of 55.2
percent came largely as a result of a 29.8 percentage points
increase in food prices with non-food prices having gone up by
33.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
"The increase was mainly assisted by the recent increases in
the price of maize meal, beef, post and telecommunications service
tariffs and drink. On the other hand, the purchasing power
continues to decline, the value of the Zimbabwean dollar is now
equivalent to 9.7 cents in 1990," said the Central Statistical
Office in a report.
</P>
<P>
The government now faces an unenviable task of reducing
inflation, which will be heavily dependent on combination of
strict monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rate could reach its peak this month before
starting to decline in the last quarter of the year. The market
projects the August rate to reach 65 percent.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Pays Tribute to "Rhino Man" in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Thursday extended its condolences to the family
members of Michael Werikhe, known as "Rhino Man" in Mombasa, a
seaport city in southeastern Kenya, after learning of his tragic
death.
</P>
<P>
"It is the lives and actions of ordinary citizens that have
awakened the consciences of many of us to the numerous threats
posed to our environment",
</P>
<P>
said Klaus Toepfer, UNEP's Executive Director.
</P>
<P>
He added that "Michael will long be remembered for the positive
action he took to save species that could not protect itself from
man's destruction. We can only hope that there will be others to
continue his efforts."
</P>
<P>
Werikhe, popularly known as "Rhino man", was a renowned
conservationist who championed the cause of the endangered
rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
He raised close to one million U.S. dollars for rhino
conservation in sponsored walks during 1982, 1985 and 1988,
covering nearly 5,000 kilometers in Kenya and several European
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his 1982 walk, Werikhe made a 479-kilometer trip to
publicize the killing of the black rhino, an animal he had never
seen. In 1985, he walked across Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
enlisting the assistance of his fellow Africans in saving the
rhino.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of his efforts, Werikhe was awarded UNEP's
Global 500 Award in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Michael once said: "the rhino is a living symbol of our
environment. It is a big animal, easy to watch. If something is
happening to this big animal, just imagine the problems of small
animals and our total environment."
</P>
<P>
According to the Kenya Wildlife Service, thanks to proper
protection measures, the number of black rhino in Kenya has
increased to 470 at present from 280 in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Installs Condom Automats on Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Following Shanghai and Guangzhou,
the Chinese capital has finally decided to place condom vending
machines on the streets for married couples' convenience.
</P>
<P>
The first two were installed Wednesday in the Haidian District,
Beijing's university area, for around-the-clock service. The pink
colored machine dispenses one condom for the price of a one-yuan
coin.
</P>
<P>
Seven coins had been collected by this morning, and observers
guess they were inserted by customers at night when there were few
people nearby.
</P>
<P>
"The machines will be welcomed by those who are shy about
buying condoms at shops, and it will help strengthen birth control
work," said Sun Linlin, a family planning official.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's most populous country, has ordered that an
urban married couple should give birth to just one child.
</P>
<P>
For a long period of time, the Chinese government provided 150
free condoms a year to one couple. But many Chinese now prefer to
buy condoms at shops, especially high-quality imported ones,
though the price of an imported condom is dozens of yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sun also suggested that there is a more open attitude towards
sex among Chinese youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The new machines and condoms were provided by a United Nations
fund, according to Sun, and a total of 70 machines soon will be on
the streets of Beijing and Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A military strategist has said
that Lee Teng-hui's separatist principle violates the basic
interests of the Chinese nation and invites destruction.
</P>
<P>
Peng Guangqian of the strategy research department of the
Chinese Academy of Military Sciences said Lee Teng-hui is in fact
an abnormal "test-tube baby" bred by international anti-China
forces in their political lab.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee's separatist principle seriously threatens Taiwan's
political future, the reunification of the Chinese nation, and
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Lee's separatist statement is a major
provocation to 1.2 billion Chinese, including 21 million Taiwan
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people obtained national independence by
unyielding and arduous struggle, and many devoted their lives to
this great undertaking.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China will never allow any separatist acts
to prevail.
</P>
<P>
Peng said Taiwan is the marine shield for safeguarding the
security of the mainland areas, and is also the strategic hub for
controlling the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits concerns
the security and development of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
China will never allow separatist plots to hinder the mainland
areas' economic development or destroy the undertaking of
reunification, Peng concluded.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM's Coming Visit to China to Strengthen Bilateral Ties: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will visit China from August 18 to 20, not only
to further enhance diplomatic relations but also result in more
joint-venture projects, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart
Premier Zhu Rongji is in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and
China.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is scheduled to call on President Jiang Zemin and hold
an official meeting with Zhu to discuss bilateral issues
especially on trade and investment, Syed Hamid told reporters
after delivering a lecture on "Malaysia's Direction In The
International Arena in The New Millennium" at the National
Institute of Public Administration here.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the joint ventures to be discussed was the
setting up of the Proton (Malaysia's national car manufacturer)
plant in one of the provinces of China.
</P>
<P>
China on the other hand is keen to set up a pulp and paper
factory in Sabah, East Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, total trade between China and
Malaysia last year stood at 4.264 billion U.S. dollars, a 20-fold
increase over that in early years of the establishment of
bilateral diplomatic relations. In the first half of this year,
total trade between the two countries reached 2.2958 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mutual investment has also been on an upswing in recent years.

<HEADLINE> China's Silk Industry Fighting Hard To Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Silk from the Chinese city of
Hangzhou is known worldwide but the silk industry in Zhejiang
Province, where the city is located, is struggling to get out of a
mess.
</P>
<P>
Because of outdated designs and stagnant domestic sales, China'
s silk industry headed for a fall in 1994 and went on to
accumulate losses of 320 million in 1995 in Zhejiang alone. But,
it took a turn for the better in the first half of this year, when
the province's silk industry had output worth 3.5 billion yuan and
a sales-to-output ratio of 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Still, many insiders are pessimistic about the industry's
future and point to various difficulties both at home and abroad.
They say that some 60 to 70 percent of China's silk is destined
for overseas market with much of it going to Southeast Asia,
Europe, and America, where changing fashions and financial
difficulties have meant problems for the market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show China's silk exports fell 15 percent to 2.5
billion U.S. dollars worth last year. Zhejiang's export fared a
bit better than average, increasing by 5.3 percent, to 1.28
billion dollars. But major silk producing areas of the eastern
Yangtze River Valley were affected this year by major flooding
that began in June. This year's floods caused 100 million yuan in
losses for Zhejiang's silk industry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are calling for more flexible operations so that the
industry can adjust more readily to market fluctuations.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Name Layden General Manager, Sign Coach Van Gundy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks
successfully lured Scott Layden from the Utah Jazz and finally
signed coach Jeff Van Gundy to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
After 18 years in the Jazz organization, Layden left to become
the executive vice president and general manager of the Knicks
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This was an opportunity that was too good to pass up," Layden
said at an afternoon news conference. "It was a tough decision for
me to leave Utah, but I feel very fortunate to be given this
opportunity. Certainly, the New York Knicks are one of the premier
franchises."
</P>
<P>
Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts reached back to
his Utah roots to court Layden, who spent the last three years as
the Jazz's vice president of basketball operations. Utah released
Layden from his contract on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance to hire a guy who is clearly recognized as one
of the premier basketball executives in the NBA and I am delighted
he is joining us," Checketts said.
</P>
<P>
Checketts and Layden became close in Utah, where Checketts
served as club president for six years during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Layden was being paid roughly 400,000 U.S. dollars a year with
the Jazz, but reportedly received a four-year deal worth 6 million
U.S. dollars from the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
It was believed Ed Tapscott, the Knicks' vice president of
player personnel, would be promoted to the position of general
manager full time. He assumed the duties when Ernie Grunfeld was
demoted in April.
</P>
<P>
An unlikely run to the NBA Finals put Van Gundy back into the
good graces of Checketts and Cablevision executives after a
disappointing regular season.
</P>
<P>
Although terms were not disclosed, Van Gundy reportedly was
rewarded with a two-year extension through 2003 worth between 8
and 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Jeff is going to be with us a long time," Checketts said. "He
has achieved a lot with us and he's a great coach. We had quite a
run in the playoffs and what has impressed me the most is the way
he has communicated with the player."
</P>
<P>
Next year, Van Gundy is scheduled to earn $2 million, and with
the Knicks advancing to the NBA Finals in June, a $3.5 million
extension for the 2000-01 season automatically kicked in.
</P>
<P>
Layden is the son of former Jazz coach Frank Layden and has
worked in the Utah organization for the last 18 years. He joined
the Jazz in 1981 as an assistant coach and quickly moved up the
management ladder, first as head scout, then as director of player
personnel in 1988-89 and director of basketball operations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy, 37, was the subject of constant rumors throughout a
disappointing regular season. The media had Van Gundy fired
numerous times during the lockout-shortened campaign, but he
remained on and barely guided the Knicks into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy has a career record of 120-97 in three-plus seasons
with the Knicks. He took over the team in 1996 and guided the
Knicks into the Finals last season.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Jobless Drops to Nine Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate
hit a nine year low of 7.0 percent in July as the job market
continued to show further signs of improvement, Australian Bureau
of Statistics said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is now at its lowest level, seasonally
adjusted, since July 1990, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's figures showed that total employment rose by
17,800 in July from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It followed strong job gains in June, suggesting Australia's
recent economic growth may finally be kicking into the jobs
market.
</P>
<P>
Australian Employment Minister Peter Reith said in a statement
that the figures showed the strong performance of the labor market
under this government.
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say these are only one month's figures and more
work needs to be done to consolidate the gains made to date and
further strengthen employment growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also found the number in the country's full-time
employment increased by 7,200 in July to 6.49 million from a year
earlier while part-time workers rose by 10,600 to 2.29 million.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment fell by 18,500 in July to 661,100 and youth
unemployment dropped from 23.0 percent to 21.4 percent in July,
seasonally adjusted.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate fell in all of the country's states except
Victoria, and was steady in Western Australia state, the bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
The data, along with improved gold prices, spurred the
Australian dollar nearly half a U.S. cent higher in the country's
exchange market.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Employee Theft A Big Problem for U.S. Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-nine percent of
employees in U.S. companies steal from their employers, according
to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, surveying more than 500 employees nationwide on the
issue of employee theft in the work place, found only 21 percent
of employees are basically honest and will never steal. Thirteen
percent are dishonest and will undoubtedly attempt theft and the
remaining 66 percent will steal if they see others doing so
without repercussion.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the study turned up some astounding facts that

employees," said Michael G. Kessler &AMP; Associates, a U.S.
investigative and forensic accounting firm specializing in
corporate issues affecting today's work place, which conducted the
study.

Although employee loyalty is what every manager strives for,
the firm said, employee loyalty may in fact be a tip off to a more
serious internal problem.

<P>
Employee theft amounts to 120 billion U.S. dollars a year,
according to the investigative firm, which surveyed workers

<TEXT>
<P>
KRIV-TV reported that Pippen has asked the Rockets to trade him
to the Lakers. Neither side would confirm nor deny if the story
was true, and KRIV declined to specify its source.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, declined comment, telling KRIV he
would neither confirm nor deny the news. Tomjanovich, Rockets
coach, did not address the issue either, citing club policy that
prohibits team officials from commenting on trade speculation.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers also did not want to say anything about this story.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, a seven-time NBA All-Star, joined the Rockets prior to
last season when the Rockets pulled off a sign-and-trade deal with
the Bulls. The 34-year-old Pippen signed a five-year contract
worth 67.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pippen averaged 14.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists a
game last season.
</P>
<P>
Phil Jackson, the new Los Angeles coach who previously coached
Pippen and the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships, might be
glad to let Pippen reunite him.

<HEADLINE> France's AXA Opens Insurance Company in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- France's AXA opened a joint
life insurance company, AXA-Minmetals Life, in Shanghai on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was started by AXA and China Minmetals Group, one of China's
largest foreign trade enterprises, with assets worth 2.3 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
AXA's chairman Claude Bebear said at an opening ceremony that
China's insurance market is undergoing many reforms and provides
huge development potential and that Shanghai has a favorable
investment environment. According to an AXA market survey,
Shanghai's life insurance business accounted for a fourth of the
country's total in 1998 and was worth more than 7 billion yuan.
This was 80 times the amount in 1995 and the business is expected
to grow by more than 30 percent annually for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
As China's housing, medicare, and pension reforms grow, people
will have to carry a much greater financial burden themselves and
this means a big insurance market, according to Joseph Sin, the
chairman of the board of the new company.
</P>
<P>
AXA-Minmetals is the 10th foreign-funded insurance company to
open in Shanghai. AXA itself was founded in 1816 and ranks 15th in
the Fortune 500 with total assets worth 655 billion U.S. dollars
and profits of 1.7 billion dollars last year.

</P>
<P>
Sources at the municipal preparatory committee say that

<HEADLINE> New Giant Panda Cub Born in Chengdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A Giant Panda cub was born
Sunday at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center in
China's Sichuan Province, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Both the cub, which weighed 170 grams at birth, and its mother
are said to be in good condition. It is given the name "qiu qiu" (
'autumn' in Chinese) because it was born on the first day of the
Autumn season.
</P>
<P>
The 30-hectare center in the northern suburbs of Chengdu has
been developing breeding technology since it used frozen semen for
artificial insemination in 1980. China used artificial
insemination to breed the first Giant Panda cub in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 10 percent of the center's males and 24 percent of
its females are able to mate by themselves and, of the ll giant
panda births, 80 percent have been produced by artificial
insemination. Giant pandas only have one or two cubs each time.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,000 pandas in Sichuan, Gansu, and
Shaanxi provinces and 80 percent are in Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> China's Tractor Exports up for the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Exports of tractors grew about
12.6 percent in the first six months of the year, the best figures
for a two-year period, China Trade News reports.
</P>
<P>
Exports of tractors manufactured by 50 leading Chinese tractor
plants amounted to 344.40 million yuan (41.7 million U.S. dollars)
from January to June. The increase is mainly attributed to
increased sales of walking tractors to Southeast Asia, but exports
of caterpillar tractors, high-powered tractors, and other types
were also up.
</P>
<P>
China's traditional tractors markets are in Southeast Asia,
Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
China's overall exports for the first six months were worth 83
billion dollars, down 4.6 percent from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White People Urged to Promote National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the Commercial
Farmers' Union of Zimbabwe, Tim Henwood, Wednesday said whites
here should join the rest people of the country in promoting
national unity and development, the daily Herald reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview after he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier at the National Heroes Acre in Harare, the white
farmer challenged the white community in the country to forget the
colonial past and join others in celebrating national events.
</P>
<P>
"I was here at the celebration of the Heroes Day last year and
it has become a custom of me. If we are to build the nation, we
have to build it together," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must have gone past the stage where people do not
trust each other."
</P>
<P>
"We should always encourage each other to participate in
national events because this is our country and we are responsible
for developing it," said Henwood.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the majority of the whites in Zimbabwe had remained
reluctant to participate in national celebrations, Henwood said
whatever differences might have occurred, they should be a thing
of the past.
</P>
<P>
He said for the country to enjoy meaningful development, every
citizen should participate and go along with others.
</P>
<P>
"Together we make the nation and together we should develop our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
August 11 was Zimbabwe's Heroes Day when thousands of
Zimbabwean people thronged the National Heroes Acre in Harare to
pay respects to the fallen heroes of the liberation struggle that
brought about the country's independence in 1980.

<HEADLINE> "Image Problem" Hampers Bangladesh's Shrimp Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The "image problem" is hampering
Bangladesh's shrimp exports though the country now has very high
quality shrimp processing plants producing best categories of
shrimps for exports, The Independent daily newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh fetched a total of 274 million U.S. dollars during
the 1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30 from exporting shrimps,
which experts said was 20 percent less than the standard
international market prices.
</P>
<P>
Market researchers, exporters and international consultants
said the country's shrimp industry was losing huge revenue for no
substantive reasons other than the country's rating abroad as a
least developed country, and the "image problem" had become the
main obstacle to Bangladeshi shrimp exports.
</P>
<P>
The competitive strength of the country's shrimp exporters
caused a loss of 67 million dollars as importers offered prices
lower than those offered for imports from other sources, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh also sustained a loss of 23 million dollars during
the last fiscal year due to a sudden slide in the shrimp prices in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
The country's shrimp export volume increased by 3,000 tons to
28,000 tons in fiscal 1998-99, but its earning is 23 million
dollars less than that of the previous fiscal year, which is 297
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The shrimp industry of Bangladesh has already overcome its
structural weakness, and the United States and the European Union
have recognized this development and now rated Bangladesh's shrimp
industry as one of the best equipped with standard hygienic and
health measures, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Spectacular Waterfall On Yellow River Possibly to Dry Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The most famous waterfall on the
Yellow River is possible to disappear as a result of reduced water
flow, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey they had conducted on June 28 this year,
the Hukou Waterfall, in northwestern Shanxi province, had only 75
cubic meters of water per second going over it during this year's
flood season in sharp contrast to the 300 cubic meters per second
of previous years, affecting the charm of the scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
The waterfall is in a narrow, precipitous gorge and is known
for the rapid speed of the water and as the thunderous sound. It
attracts millions of tourists every year as well as adventurers
who have attempted, for example, to jump a motorcycle over it.
</P>
<P>
Scientists noted that water levels of the Yellow River have
continued to decline over recent years because of climate changes
and other reasons. Some sections of the river are dry for several
months every year, causing anxiety among people living along the
lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River was known as the cradle of Chinese
civilization and for its extreme floods that took thousands of
lives, but scientists have warned that the river could itself
become seasonal if the environmental deterioration continues and
splendors like Hukou Waterfall could eventually become just a
distant memory in the not too distant future.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
fell to 6,301.3 billion yen (53 billion U.S. dollars) in the first
half of 1999, down 14.9 percent from a year earlier, the Finance
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus -- the broadest measure of trade in
goods and services -- decreased as the stronger yen reduced the
competitiveness of exports, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the payments surplus was the first in five half-
year terms, before adjustment for seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, the surplus in goods and services
trade stood at 4,072.1 billion yen (34.3 billion U.S. dollars),
down 9.0 percent, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus dropped 7.5 percent from a year
earlier to 7,016.2 billion yen (59.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports fell 9.2 percent to 22,187.2 billion yen (186.8 billion
U.S. dollars) while imports decreased 10.0 percent to 15,171.0
billion yen (127.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The current account balance is the difference between a country
's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations payable,
excluding net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 118.81 to the dollar in the first half of this
year, compared with 132.03 in the same period last year.

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
adopted new policies to encourage development of non-state owned
enterprises, sources from the Ministry of Science and Technology
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the regulation, drawn up by
the ministry and State Economic and Trade Commission, is designed
to create a healthy climate for the research and development of
high-tech projects and the commercialization of scientific
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
The government supports non-State technical firms in applying
to participate in national scientific research programs.
</P>
<P>
The development of high-tech research and the prompt transfer
of the latest scientific discoveries to mass production will be
the focus of a national conference on technical upgrading slated
for August 23-26.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the regulation is among one of over a dozen new
policies announced recently or to be issued in the following weeks
to boost technical invention and high-tech research, in efforts to
promote China's sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government has already announced a policy for encouraging
scientists and technicians to establish high-tech ventures with
their discoveries as part of the shares of the ventures.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered 1 million yuan (120,000 U.S.

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka's Business Community to Mediate with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Business Forum
leader will meet the Tamil rebels in October with a set of
proposals agreed on by the two main parties to resolve the ethnic
conflicts, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Business Forum Lalith Kotelawala will seek to
persuade Tamil rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
back to the negotiating table, the official Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance government and the main opposition
United National Party (UNP) met in Colombo on Wednesday in a
meeting organized by the Business Forum chaired by Lalith
Kotelawala.
</P>
<P>
They will try their best to iron out existing differences by
September 30, a deadline agreed on by the two parties who will
meet in the next round of meeting on September 1, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs G.L. Peiris, who
headed the government delegation, described Wednesday's meeting as
a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said, "a set of proposals with a consensus of the
government and the main opposition would pressurize the LTTE to
divert itself for a political solution."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war fought between
security forces and LTTE rebels who demand a homeland for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is committed to achieving a political
solution to the ethnic conflict, has come up with a devolution
package.
</P>
<P>
However, it requires a two third majority for passage in
Parliament which can be obtained only with the support of the UNP.

ranking this year as they coasted into the third round Wednedsday

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Yangon Airways Extends Domestic Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Yangon Airways, a joint
venture between state-run Myanma Airways (MA) and private-run
Myanmar Mayflower (MMF) Co Ltd, has extended its flights to two
border towns in the country's eastern Shan state, according to
Thursday's official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The extended flights to Tachilek and Kengtung from Yangon,
which began Wednesday, will operate via Heho on every Monday and
Wednesday, it said.
</P>

Yangon and Bagan, Mandalay, Heho, Tachilek, Kengtung, Dawei, Myeik
and Kawthoung.
</P>

The Yangon Airways was initially formed jointly by the MA and
the Krong Sombat Co Ltd of Thailand and started flying in October
1996.
</P>
<P>
Later, the share of the Thai company in the joint-venture
airline was taken over by the MMF in August 1997.

Meanwhile, the Myanmar Airways International, a
Myanmar-Singapore joint venture, flies externally to seven
destinations and there are also 18 foreign airlines having regular
flights to Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Premiers End Meeting With Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian provincial premiers and
territorial leaders ended their three-day meeting in Quebec City
on Wednesday,reaching consensus on tax cuts and investments in
infrastructure and shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
The 10 premiers and three territorial leaders agreed to urge
Ottawa to cut tax while investing in national highways and
shipyards.
</P>
<P>
Unlike three days ago, when the premiers were divided on what
the annual meeting should focus, the provincial and territorial
leaders were "excited" at the end of the meeting in a unanimous "
call for cash within existing budgets."
</P>
<P>
Canadian media said, however, that the leaders fell short of
specifying any of their requirements for money from the federal
budgets, as they did not want to "determine a minimum or maximum."
</P>
<P>
The ball is now in the court of Ottawa, and the media quoted
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein as saying that it will be hard for
Prime Minister Jean Chretien to ignore the results of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Ottawa, Finance Minister Paul Martin refused to
comment on budget specifics "this early," but believed that the
provincial and territorial leaders "confirm their support for the
approach" of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
"As long as premiers recognize that governments can't be all
things to all people, and that they have to make choices, I think
what essentially we are seeing is a confirmation of that approach,
" the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the premiers were actually discussing
ways to better share the 10 billion or more Canadian dollars (
about 6.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the federal budget surplus.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Rely Less on Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
shift from foreign to domestic borrowings beginning next year in
an effort to arrest the continued decline of domestic interest
rates, the Philippine Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu as saying
Wednesday that the government will increase the ratio of its
domestic borrowings to total loans from only 30 percent this year
to 70 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Since interest rates are on a down-turn and there is no longer
any danger of crowding out domestic borrowers, the government
could go to domestic banks to borrow part of its budgetary
requirements, Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that once the government starts borrowing from
domestic sources, interest rates are expected to go up and ease
the attacks on the peso. At present, the peso is down to 39.165
pesos to the dollar as the Philippine Central Bank introduced a
cap on its borrowing to encourage banks to be more aggressive in
lending to the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
who symbolically resigned last week, on Wednesday was sworn in as
president before the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA).
</P>
<P>
Chavez, elected in the December presidential elections,
testified as president for the first time on February 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Chavez offered his resignation to the NCA and
called on the NCA to rewrite the country's present constitution,
which has been in effect since 1961. But his resignation was
rejected by the NCA, controlled by Chavez's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Among his proposals for a new constitution, Chavez called on
the NCA to extend the presidential term from five years to six
years and to allow all incumbents to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
But Chavez's bid to rewrite the 1961 national charter was
strongly opposed by the Supreme Court and Congress, both
controlled by opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Real Depreciates Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose to a
five-month high against the Brazilian real on Wednesday, as a
result of unstable foreign markets and Brazil's domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency, on the rise for the last two weeks, rose on
Wednesday by 0.54 percent from Tuesday's close, and reached at mid-
session in the free market a rate of 1.875 reals (buying) and 1.
878 reals (selling).
</P>
<P>
This price was the highest it had come to since March 12 when
it stood at 1.91 reals (buying), and 1.92 reals (selling).
</P>
<P>
A rise in the dollar was also seen on the parallel market in
Sao Paulo, where the dollar was purchased at 1.88 reals, and sold
at 1.91 reals, while in the tourist sector it registered at 1.84
reals (buying) and 1.91 reals (selling).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Brazil's exchange market was under strong
buying pressure as a result of the nervousness of investors about
a possible interest increase and a lack of confidence in domestic
politics.
</P>
<P>
According to director of Renova Corredora company Miriam
Tavares, the market was nervous at rumors of the possible quit of
Finance Minister Pedro Milan.
</P>
<P>
Director of International Affairs of the Central Bank, Daniel
Gleizer, expected that the exchange market would calm down in the
next few days, when banks reduce their purchasing of dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The international police force
and the international peacekeeping force arrested 78 terrorists in
Kosovo on Tuesday, peacekeeping force spokesman Jan Josten
announced in Pristina on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the massive arrests indicated that the
international peacekeeping forces have started to strengthen the
maintenance of public order in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The international peacekeepers arrested 60 armed Albanian
terrorists in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) uniforms and seized
a large amount of weapons in a building located in Gnjilan.
</P>
<P>
In Prizren, they arrested five Albanian terrorists who were
kidnapping civilians, and in Ska Mitrovica, 10 Albanian terrorists
were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
Since the Yugoslav troops and police left Kosovo in early June,
the KLA has taken advantage of the tolerance and connivance of the
international peacekeepers and launched aggressive terrorist
assaults on non-Albanian residents, hence creating a "law vacuum"
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, the KLA has recently run into more conflicts or even
bloodshed with the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, the 478-strong international police force from 10
countries began joining force with the peacekeepers in maintaining
public order.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Not to Blame for Trade Disputes With Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- In the matter of trade disputes,
it takes two to tango, said Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia, when refuting charges that Brazil is to blame for the
ongoing trade tension with neighboring Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said Wednesday that while the devaluation of the
Brazilian currency, the real, did play a role, it was not the only
cause for Brazil's rapid rising exports of footwear, textiles,
household appliances and other goods to the Argentine market.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's economic recession, which started last September,
and the lack of modernization of its industrial sectors, played an
important part in the country's declining competitiveness against
Brazilian products, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some sectors of the Argentine economy did not go
all out to cater to the domestic demand, leaving a gap for foreign
goods to fill, said Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and Argentina are members of the four-nation
Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). The bloc has been facing
its most serious row since its two biggest members went bitter
over trade because of the real's devaluation in January.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said Brazil would not leave Mercosur, which is
valuable to the country, nor would it accept restrictive measures
against the principle of free trade.
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil will file a complaint with the World Trade
Organization against an Argentine trade restriction curbing its
textile exports.

appeared, by and large, in the Asian countries which were hit by
financial crisis in the past few years, the German Institute for
Economic Research said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is likely to regain a fairly strong economic growth
this year while Thailand will see a very weak growth and Malaysia
may expect a rebound, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the Indonesian economy will downslide again,
only at a slower speed than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the recovery of the Asian economy is
closely related to the financial restructuring, which is designed
to establish internationally competitive financial systems in
those countries.
</P>
<P>
The report believed that the restructuring of commercial banks
and the reform of the credit-releasing practices can play a major
role in boosting the economy.
</P>
<P>
These measures can help set up effective business supervision
mechanisms and achieve overall economic recovery in this region,
said the report.

<P>
SHENYANG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered some 39 historic sites in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
These sites were found at a dozen expressway and railway
construction areas, and the oldest dates back to the Bronze Age (
16th-11th centuries B.C.). The others are of the Han Dynasty (206-
24 B.C.), Liao Dynasty (916-1125), Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368), Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Among the relics are two special tombs of ancient Koreans who
lived along with a variety of other ethnic groups in northeastern
China.
</P>
<P>
A local archeologist said the discovery of these sites will
provide valuable material for the study on the ancient politics,
ethnic groups, and ethnic cultures of the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign exchange
reserves increased slightly, by 99.7 million U.S. dollars to
16.214 billion dollars, in the week ending on August 6, from
16.115 billion dollars the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to the disbursement of 107.1
million dollars in loans from Japan, the central bank said in a
weekly report, quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign exchange reserves were now well above the
International Monetary Fund-adjusted target of 14.3 billion
dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said its gross foreign exchange reserves,
which are net foreign exchange reserves plus outstanding foreign
exchange contracts, also increased during the week by 95.6 million
dollars to 26.68 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Promises to Combat Common Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said on Wednesday that his government will seek
security and peace for all Colombians.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana made the promise when he announced that an Academic
Mission will be set up to analyze the causes of crime and 100
Centers of Immediate Attention (CIA) will be put into action to
control urban insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that security is a fundamental element for the
restoration of investor confidence and an essential factor for the
creation of employment.
</P>
<P>
"The main condition for the progress of a country is that its
citizens have confidence in the state by way of its security
organizations. It guarantees everyone has the sacred right to live
without anxiety, to move without fear and to work without danger,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, more than 55 percent of
Colombians are concentrated in 59 municipalities, which account
for 60 percent of homicides.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, there has been a new call to the local mayors
of the country to restrict the carrying of arms during weekends so
as to reduce violence and create a peaceful environment for
residents.

<HEADLINE> Four Athletes Still in Hunt for Golden League Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unbeaten in track events since 1997, American world champion
sprinter Jones held off compatriot Inger Miller at the finish to
win in 22.10 seconds, her 21st consecutive 200 meter win.
</P>
<P>
In the 3,000m steeplechase, world record holder Barmasai had
looked poised to register another easy victory as he bolted into
an early lead.
</P>
<P>
But the Kenyan instead was forced to fend off a late charge
from Christopher Koskei, crossing in 8:05.16 just a stride ahead
of his compatriot.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer, the 800m world record holder, had to fight off a
challenge from South Africa's Hezekiel Sepeng, crossing a half
second clear of the South African in 1:43.01.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Gabriela Szabo, the only other athlete in the hunt
for the jackpot, produced the most comfortable victory, crossing
first in the women's 3,000m in 8:25.03.
</P>
<P>
All four can collect a share of the jackpot if they can win in
Brussels and Berlin and sweep their seven Golden League events.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Violeta Szekely became the first woman to run under
four minutes this season in the women's 1,500m.
</P>
<P>
Pushed by Anita Weyermann, who was trying to become the first
Swiss to win in Zurich since 1993, Szekely clocked 3:59.31
</P>
<P>
American world record holder Maurice Greene was an easy winner
of the men's 100m ahead of Obadele Thompson, going under 10
seconds for the fifth time this season in 9.99.

CARACAS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- OPEC members will discuss the
possibility of expanding the group at the summit to be held here
at the beginning of next year, a Venezuelan official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Alvarez, general director of the petroleum sector
under the Ministry of Energy and Mines, revealed that expansion of
the oil organization "has already been begun, considering all the
work done with Russia, Mexico and Norway".
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
currently groups 11 members, which are Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez recently proposed that the
OPEC headquarters, which is in Vienna, should be moved at the
beginning of next year to Caracas of Venezuela, a leading oil
producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was supported by the majority of the OPEC
members, the Venezuelan government said.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez vowed that his country would contribute to the
transformation of the organization into one that not only decides
oil prices, but also act in other areas of the petroleum sector.

</P>
<P>
"The government will explain its actions to combat the fires
and request input from the two countries for further action," he
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Muslimin said his office had found that hot spots had spread to
all 12 provinces in Sumatera and Kalimantan on Wednesday, from
five provinces in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
"As of this week, forest fires have ravaged over 3,601 hectares
of forest and plantation areas in Sumatera and Kalimantan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister blamed the forest and land fires on plantation
owners and small farmers starting fires to clear land.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the hot spots were detected in plantation areas, and
areas located near human settlements indicated that the fires were
started by plantation firms and nomadic farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry would immediately revoke licenses to
forest concessionaires and plantation companies found responsible
for the fires.
</P>
<P>
Haze from the fires in Sumatera and Kalimantan covered most of
the region in 1997, causing serious health and transport hazards,
and recurred in 1998, but to a lesser extent.

<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Parades
Commission Wednesday gave green light to a Protestant march near a
Roman Catholic area in the city of Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a statement it had imposed some
restrictions on Saturday's march by the Apprentice Boys, a
200-year-old Protestant fraternity of men of any age, in an
attempt to avert violence.
</P>
<P>
BBC television said some 10,000 people were expected to take
part in the march along the city's historic walls overlooking the
Catholic Bogside area.
</P>
<P>
Catholic residents plan to protest against the march, which
celebrates a 17th-century Protestant victory over Roman Catholics,
the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second Apprentice Boys parade to be approved for
Saturday. Earlier in the week, the Parades Commission gave the
go-ahead for a march down the mainly nationalist Lower Ormeau Road
in the Northern Ireland capital Belfast, also on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The march is part of the annual province-wide parades by the
Apprentice Boys, whose name commemorates 13 apprentices who closed
Londonderry's city gates against the army of deposed Catholic King
James II of England in December 1688.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Protestants died before the city was relieved in
August 1689. Londonderry is now 75 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Northern Ireland is deadlocked due to a
long-running dispute between politicians from the majority
Protestant and minority Catholic communities over guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Irish Republic are currently seeking ways to
revive last year's Good Friday peace accord.

<HEADLINE> 1,100-Year Old Fresco Tomb Found in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
excavated an ancient tomb with unusual wall frescoes in Horinger
County, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The brick tomb, dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907), has
an arched roof about three meters wide and four meters high,
according to Chen Yongzhi, a local archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton of the tomb occupant, whose sex is still
undetermined, was found on a raised platform. The chamber walls
are decorated with colored frescoes featuring scenes of everyday
life, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
One scene shows a typical living room of Tang times, with a
door, lattice windows and pillars. Two plump maids in long gowns
are poised beside the door.
</P>
<P>
Another scene is of two male servants in colorful clothes and
hats in a posture of greeting. There are also pictures of dozens
of people, as well as flower patterns. On the ceiling there are
frescoes of clouds, the sun and the moon.
</P>
<P>
The maids look exactly the way they are depicted in terra-cotta
images unearthed in the central part of China.
</P>
<P>
Objects discovered in the tomb include a tower-shaped jar, a
porcelain bowl, a silver hair clasp and a bronze coin.

SHANGHAI, August 12 (Xinhua)-- Heavy rain has brought serious
damage to ordinary people and businesses in this east China
metropolis, but the damage is being duly compensated for by the
Shanghai branch of the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC).
</P>
<P>
What had been lingering drizzle turned into downpours over the
past two months here, resulting in over 3,900 households and some
750 companies suffering losses.
</P>
<P>
The company paid out a record 70 million-plus yuan, which
helped those affected to restore normal life and production
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Fang Zhimin, deputy general manager of the Shanghai branch of
the PICC, said that many companies and individuals had not
received compensation because they had not taken out property
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
He said that, according to estimates by meteorological
departments, there will be a concentration of tornadoes, heavy
rain and tidal waves striking Shanghai in the second half of this
year.

SHENYANG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- There has been a severe drought

<HEADLINE> Numbers of Tourists Dwindle in Italy This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 11 (Xinhua) -- As the Summer vacation season
reaches its peak, fewer tourists are passing vacation in Italy,
spurring losses in the tourism industry, according to a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A study carried out by an association of restaurant and bar
owners, Fipe, found that tourism dwindled by 1.5 percent between
June and August, as 2.2 million fewer vacationers are present in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The report, which gathered information from 400 night clubs,
bars and restaurants across Italy, showed the most significant
drop to be in seaside tourism.
</P>
<P>
Fipe noted that the drop in these areas could be explained by
the Kosovo war, which caused many to rethink their holiday plans
and steer clear of the area which is Italy's closest point to the
troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Figures also showed that tourism had slipped in some regions
along the Adriatic coast and south island of Sicily.

UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) is investigating an attack which
killed two local students, U.N. sources confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place Wednesday at a gathering of students in
Vikeke where two participants were shot to death, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.

<P>
"So far we have no other information on dead and wounded," he

<HEADLINE> Italy's Alitalia Aims to Triple Profits by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Alitalia, Italy's flag-carrying
airline, aims to triple its profits in the next three years thanks
to increased competitiveness due to privatization and its alliance
with Dutch partner KLM.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998-2001 business plan which was published
Wednesday, the airline expects to lift profits from 202 billion
lire (about 112 million U.S. dollars) this year to 610 billion
lire (about 339 million U.S. dollars) in 2001 and to establish
itself as a player on the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Achieving these goals will depend largely on the group's
ability to negotiate the passage from a state-owned, and in part
state-financed, company to a self-supporting private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization represents both a challenge and an opportunity
for the company which must learn to face up to the competitive
logic of financial markets," the plan said.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia, which is currently 53 percent owned by the state
holding company Iri, needs to privatize quickly. A condition of
its alliance accord with KLM was that it would make the transition
to the free market by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
As well as the partnership with KLM, Alitalia has also struck
business accords in the U.S. with Continental and Northwest in a
bid to carve out a place for itself in the global air market.

WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was

down in the downtown area of Salt Lake City in Utah State of the
United States Wednesday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted local authorities as saying that the black,

and tents set up for a retailers convention. It also damaged the
roofs of the Delta Center, home of the Utah Jazz basketball team,
and the Salt Palace Convention Center.

The downtown area looked like a disaster zone with trucks
overturned, power lines down, windows blown out, shards of glass

The streets were littered with debris from the outdoor retailer
show at the Salt Palace, which was evacuated because of a gas

NEW YORK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Alcoa, the largest U.S.
aluminum company, offered Wednesday to buy Reynolds Metals for 5.6
billion U.S. dollars to beef-up its number one position.
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger would create a combined revenue of 21

The Richmond-based Reynolds Metals said its Board of Directors

Alcoa's bid came hours after Alcan Aluminum of Canada said it
would buy French Pechiney AS and the aluminum and packaging untis

Commodity price declines have led raw-material producers in a

<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
higher Wednesday as the networking company Cisco Systems
reported strong earnings and the Federal Reserve found little
evidence of rising inflation pressures in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 132.65 at
10,787.80, trimming almost all losses of 138 points in the three
previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
The broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 20.50 at 1,301.93 and the technology
heavy Nasdaq index rose 74.87 at 2,564.98.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied because Cisco Systems reported Tuesday
after the trading that its net income was up 29 percent in the
fourth quarter, much better than expectations.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also encouraged to rush into the market as
the Federal Reserve survey indicates that U.S. economy is well
running on the track. The survey said widespread labor shortages
could lead to more inflationary pressures but it found only
scattered signs of mounting wage pressures and little evidence
of rising inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
A wave of deals in the aluminum industry also helped to
push the stocks higher. Early today, Canada's Alcan Aluminum
Ltd., France's Rechinery SA and Switzerland's Alusuisse Lonza
Group announced the three combination of merger, passing
U.S.-based Alcoa as the world leader in aluminum while Alcoa
offered to buy its rival Reynolds Metal Co. for 5.6 billion U.S.
dollars in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
The market bounced back from a steep drop that has left
major indexes well below the lofty records set on July 16 after
the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned possibility
of the second interest rates hike.

<P>
The NYSE composite index was up 6.85 at 610.22 and the
American Stock Exchange index was up 6.60 at 777.37. The Russell

WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
praised the United Nations days after criticizing the world body
for its slow action in Kosovo, saying that the organization is
beginning to fulfill its key tasks there.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing
that the U.N. administration is beginning to fulfill its key tasks
in Kosovo "despite formidable challenges."
</P>
<P>
"The U.N.'s goal of being present in all municipalities is also
on the way to being fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.S. administration accused the U.N. of being
too slow and bureaucratic in establishing a 33,000-man
international police force.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) took advantage of a power
vacuum in the province to collect taxes, appoint local council and
carry out other governmental functions.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the changed situation now in Kosovo is reflected in
the deployment of 600 civilian police, with more on the way each
day. He said 115 U.S. police arrived in Kosovo last week, bringing
the U.S. total to 135 out of an eventual contingent of 450.
</P>
<P>
He added that the first training course for some 200 Kosovo
police candidates is scheduled to begin at the end of this
month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Complaint Against German Telephone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration on
Wednesday threatened to file a complaint with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against German telephone giant Deutsche Telekom
if the latter imposes unfair connection charges to limit foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she was
taking action after U.S. telecommunications companies complained
that the German telephone company was trying to impose high
interconnection fees and other roadblocks in their efforts to
offer services in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"German regulatory authorities must take concrete steps to
ensure that Deutsche Telekom provides timely interconnection at
fair rates, terms and conditions for prospective entrants,"
Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. trade office would be closely monitoring
upcoming decisions by German regulators and would not hesitate to
bring a case before the WTO if those decisions are not consistent
with a global agreement opening up telecommunications services to
greater competition.
</P>
<P>
In issuing the warning, Barshefsky said U.S. officials welcomed
recent rulings in which German regulators decided to "reject most
of the unreasonable rates, terms and conditions that Deutsche
Telekom has sought to impose immediately on new entrants to the
telecommunications market."
</P>
<P>
But she said the concern now was upcoming rules to be issued in
the fall that will set the conditions for foreign competition
beginning in the year 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"Further action by the regulator is essential to secure market
access for U.S. industry in the newly liberalized German
telecommunications services market," she said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a loan
of 100 million U.S. dollars to support primary health care reform
in three Argentine provinces that will serve as models to extend
the reform throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The program -- to be implemented as a first step in the
provinces of Cordoba, La Pampa and Salta -- is designed to make
primary health care delivery more efficient and equitable and
introduce new health care approaches, the IDB said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At the national level, the project will fund technical support,
information systems, and training to prepare for a new and
improved health care model that can be applied to the provinces at
their request.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the first phase of the project for the
initial three provinces is 167 million dollars. The IDB loan is
for a 20-year term, with a five-year grace period, at the variable
annual interest rate, now 6.98 percent. Local counterpart funds

WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of its
largest fiscal modernization operation ever, a 2.2 billion U.S.
dollar program spanning a period of 12 years to improve fiscal
management and transparency in more than 3,800 municipalities in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The IDB will help finance the program with three loans totaling
1.1 billion dollars, an amount that will be matched by local
counterpart funds.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the program, to last four years, the IDB
will provide a loan of 300 million dollars to support fiscal and
administrative modernization in 722 cities.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to increase the availability of
municipal resources for public financing, achieve greater economy
in public administration, and improve the quality and availability
of municipal services.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the program will improve transparency in municipal
management by such means as making regular information available
to the public, ensuring citizen participation in setting tax and
spending priorities, and the establishment of evaluation
procedures that take public opinion into account.
</P>
<P>
The 300-million-dollar loan is for a 20-year term, with a
four-year grace period, at the variable interest rate, now 6.98
percent. Local counterpart funds total 300 million dollars.

WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged India and Pakistan to observe a 1991 agreement
that bans military flights close to the border without advance
notification of the other side.
</P>
<P>
"We urgently call on both sides to reinstitute this agreement
in order to avoid further loss of life and further escalation
and heightening of tensions," State Department spokesman James
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both India and Pakistan had clearly violated
the agreement over the past few days, when an Indian plane shot
down a Pakistani reconnaissance plane close to the border and
when Pakistani planes fired on Indian fighters said to be
intruding into Pakistani airspace.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 agreement, Indian or Pakistani military
aircraft should not fly within 10 km of the border without
telling the other side in advance.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the 1991 agreement also provided for a prompt
investigation of any violation, by contacts between the two air
force headquarters through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States has contacted the Indian and
Pakistani governments through its embassies in those countries
and through their embassies in Washington, adding: "In those
discussions we have urged restraint and dialogue to resolve this
incident, and we will continue to meet with senior officials here
as well as in Islamabad and New Delhi."

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Surges with Shrinking Stockpiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices surged to a new
22-month high on Wednesday after data showed that petroleum
stockpiles are waning.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend crude oil settled at 20.63 U.S. dollars a
barrel in London, up 14 cents on the day, after roaring to a peak
of 20.85 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said latest weekly data from the United States showing
a decline in national inventories of crude and petroleum products
had underlined the success of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) producers in tackling a glut which early this
year dragged Brent below 10 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted the American Petroleum Institute as saying that
U.S. crude stocks in the week to July 6 fell three million barrels
while gasoline inventories shrank by 3.5 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. crude stocks now are six percent lower than a year ago
while gasoline inventories are four percent smaller.
</P>
<P>
The latest leg of the oil rally has been spurred by the
expectation that output curbs implemented by OPEC will erase the
glut entirely in coming months.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a
monthly report that OPEC compliance with the supply cuts was at 91
percent in July, compared to 87 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based think-tank also said world oil demand was
expected to accelerate next year, while only marginal extra
supplies would emerge from non-OPEC producers.
</P>
<P>
It said a recovery in Asian economies would help double global
demand growth from 900,000 barrels a day this year to 1.8 million
bpd in 2000. It expected only 660,000 bpd of extra non-OPEC
supply.

<P>
The report of the three committees set up last week concluded
that the allegations levelled against Senate President Enwerem by
a Lagos-based magazine of Tell were baseless.
</P>
<P>
The Tell magazine alleged that the Senate president lied
variously about his age while contesting for public office and
that he was convicted for stealing while serving as a revenue
clerk in the British colonial administration before Nigeria's
independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the report by the Senate came less than a week
after Enwerem vigorously denied the allegations, dubbing it an
"orchestrated campaign to bring him down" and reduce his office.
</P>
<P>
The Senate president, who resisted pressure to step down while
investigations were being conducted, said the allegations were a
"rehash" of similar allegation made in 1992 after his election as
governor of Imo State, southeast Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Private Sector Backs Govt Bid to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian private
businessmen Wednesday voiced support for the government's
intention to pull out from the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Arnold Kilewo, chairman of the Tanzania Private Sector
Foundation, told a press conference here that with low exports
over the years to other member states of COMESA, Tanzania has not
been benefiting in the trade arrangements within the economic
bloc.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of trade imbalances between Tanzania and the rest
of COMESA member states, there has been no meaningful equitable
partnership in trade," Kilewo said, adding that the country's
economic scale cannot compare with that of Egypt, Mauritius,
Zimbabwe and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Given Tanzania's low levels of production of industrial
products as well as low export levels, the zero tariffs proposed
to be implemented by COMESA member states in the year 2000 will
not benefit Tanzania as the country has not much to offer in terms
of trading, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kilewo said Tanzania has signed many regional and global
treaties and protocols, therefore it is time to objectively review
and assess the economic benefits of these treaties.
</P>
<P>
"When we feel that the country is not going to benefit
economically, we should not hesitate to reconsider our positions
and take remedial measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kilewo reiterated that Minister of Industries and Commerce Iddi
Simba has stated the intention of Tanzania to pull out and gave an
adequate notice of the government's intention to pull out from
COMESA as provided in relevant protocols.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, Simba announced that Tanzania plans to quit COMESA,
which surprised the organization a lot as Tanzania has always been
an active partner.
</P>
<P>
A COMESA delegation visited Tanzania early this month trying to
persuade the country not to quit the economic bloc, but Simba
insisted that Tanzania would stick to its position.
</P>
<P>
Simba stressed that it is better for Tanzania to adhere to
smaller blocs such as the 14-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC), and East African Co-operation that comprises
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian manufacturers have expressed concern that zero
tariffs would damage its local industries with the flooding of
imported goods from other COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, set up in 1994, groups Angola, Burundi, Comoros, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles,
Sudan, Swaziland, as well as Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
With an annual import bill of around 32 billion U.S. dollars,
COMESA forms a major market place for both internal and external
trading.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's Finance Minister Amina Salum Ali, however, has
raised concern about the union government of Tanzania to pull out
of the COMESA, saying the move runs against international trend
and indicates that Tanzania is still pursuing protectionism
policies.

<HEADLINE> Fed Finds U.S. Economy Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve said
Wednesday that the U.S. economy is still growing strongly with
widespread labor shortages reported nearly everywhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In its latest survey of economic conditions around the country,
Fed found only scattered signs of mounting wage pressures and
little evidence of rising inflation in general.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey said, "Widespread labor shortages persist in
virtually every district, but there have been only scattered
reports of acceleration in wages." There are "some reports of
accelerating prices -- largely related to home construction -- but
there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in consumer price
inflation," the survey added.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, known as the "beige book," will be used by Fed
policy-makers when they next meet on Aug. 24 to review interest
rate policies.
</P>
<P>
There has been a growing concern in financial markets that the
central bank will boost interest rates for the second time this
year because of growing fears that the economy is growing too
rapidly, given current tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey did note developments that could lead to
increased inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The beige book found "continued strength in economic activity"
in late July and early August, although the book did note that
retail sales had slowed somewhat in July. It attributed a portion
of this decline to depleted inventories at retail establishments.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, hard hit by the world currency crisis, was
showing signs of a rebound in many parts of the country, although
several districts reported continued weakness in textiles and
heavy metals such as steel.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said its Boston, Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco
districts reported strong demand for computer and
telecommunications equipment while Cleveland and Chicago reported
orders for heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that housing construction was continuing at a
vigorous pace in most districts although there were signs that a
lack of available building materials and skilled workers was
limiting growth in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"Labor shortages are indicated in New York, St. Louis, Chicago,
Dallas and San Francisco -- mainly for skilled tradespeople such
as carpenters, framers and masons," the survey said. "Many
districts also report problems in obtaining key construction
materials, most notably dry wall, insulation and bricks."
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey also said that while hot and dry weather was
causing crop damage in the eastern part of the country, crops were
generally reported to be in good shape in other areas.

<HEADLINE> Alleged U.S. Gunman Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The white supremacist who
allegedly wounded five people in Los Angeles in California State
of the United States surrendered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Buford O'Neal Furrow used a high-powered gun and
burst into a Jewish community center in Los Angeles and sprayed
the lobby with 20 to 30 shots, wounding five people, including
three boys attending day camp, and then walked away.
</P>
<P>
Furrow, who surrendered to investigators in Las Vegas in Nevada
State, would also be charged in the slaying of a postal worker who
was shot Tuesday near the community center.
</P>
<P>
He told investigators that he wanted this to be "a wake-up call
to America to kill Jews."
</P>
<P>
The violence in Los Angeles was the latest shooting at
workplaces and schools in the United States, and brought immediate
calls for stricter gun control and measures to protect children.

broadly higher Wednesday, boosted by buoyant technology shares on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 made some modest gains following a six-month

at a U.S. bank. But he also said that traders remain unsettled.
And U.S. interest rate worries eroded gains in the markets as
investors balked at big moves.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Lawyer Named U.N. War Crimes Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday appointed Switzerland's attorney-general, Carla Del
Ponte, to the position of the prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes
tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council, in a unanimous resolution, endorsed the
nomination by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte will take up her new post on September 15, when
Louise Arbour of Canada, who has been U.N. prosecutor since
October 1996, steps down to be a judge on Canada's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor normally serves a four-year term and is eligible
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted at a brief meeting, noted Arbour's
resignation "with regret." Arbour was rejected entry into Kosovo,
a Serbian province, by Yugoslavia earlier this year when she tried
to investigate alleged atrocities in the province.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, set up in January
1991, is based in the Hague. The Rwanda tribunal, seated at
Arusha, Tanzania, was founded to prosecute leaders of the 1994
Hutu-led genocide of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte, 52, has been Switzerland's attorney-general since
April 1994.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Tightens Financial Control, Replaces Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian Government
has appointed Khem Sophoan as the new director-general for the
Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) in a reaction to mismanagement
of funds allocated to CMAC by the Government, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), which funds some 90 percent of CMAC's
action, said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new director-general was sworn in this week in the capital
Phnom Penh. In june, an audit initiated by UNDP discovered
financial irregularities in the government-allocated funds at the
mine action center.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the allegations of financial mismanagement
surfaced, we ordered an external audit of CMAC's financial
administration of these funds," Zephirin Diabre, associate
administrator of UNDP, said. "Since then, we have also initiated
an external audit of the UNDP trust fund for CMAC, even though the
use of these funds have never been questioned."
</P>
<P>
UNDP provided financial and technical assistance to CMAC since
1993. The center's budget for 1999 is 13 million U.S. dollars.
Since it was established, CMAC has cleared a total of 51.7 million
square meters of mined land, destroyed 62,000 anti-personnel
mines, 465 anti-tank mines and 178,000 items of unexploded
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
The center has trained 4,000 Cambodians in mine clearance and
educated 400,000 people in 15,000 villages in mine awareness.
Through its work, the number of people injured by landmines in
Cambodia has been reduced from 300 to 100 per month. The newly
cleared lands provide livelihoods to some 35,000 poor families.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Crash Linked to Insulation, Canadian Board Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The metalized mylar insulation
blanket was significantly linked to last September's Swissair
crash, Canadian investigators announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the
insulation blanket used inside the bulkheads of aircraft was a
significant factor in the spread of fire aboard doomed Swissair
Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications that a significant source of the
combustible materials that sustained the fire was thermal
acoustical insulation blanket material," the board said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Burnt remnants of this material, quenched by sea water, were
found in the wreckage," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian media reports said the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) is soon expected to order the
metalized mylar insulation blankets replaced on nearly 700
commercial airliners within four years.
</P>
<P>
The FAA decision, partly based on an urgent advisory from
Canadian investigators, would apply to a variety of airplanes
built by McDonnell Douglas, including the MD-80, MD-88, MD-90,
DC-10 and the MD-11, the type of plane that crashed off Nova
Scotia last September, killing all 229 aboard, the Canadian media
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Most Jobs Still in Old Place, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Italians are still more likely to
find work in traditional fields such as banking, medicine or the
law than in the reportedly expanding areas of services and
technology, a new report on employment showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1998 employment in banking and finance rose
13.4 percent, jobs in law soared 21.5 percent and doctors and
other medicine-related figures grew 5.2 percent, said the study by
Isfol, the Italian Institute for the Development of Professional
Training.
</P>
<P>
The report contained some other surprises. During the same
period jobs in telecommunications, an area widely believed to be
thriving, dropped by 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In the short and medium term most of the job possibilities
will still be in the traditional cornerstones of the economy,"
said Isfol, which is a public institution researching and
promoting professional training.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of job growth, according to the study, were
tourism, which employed 30,000 more people in 1998 than three
years earlier, and research where there were 134,000 more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The two career directions least likely to offer work to
Italians entering the job market were agriculture and any artistic
discipline, where employment fell 8.3 percent and 9.9 percent
respectively.
