<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: Giuliani tapping into right-leaning network  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton says Rudolph Giuliani
is piling up a lead over her in fund raising in their Senate race
because he is tapping into a network of right-wing non-New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said during a campaign trip Monday that Elian
Gonzalez should be back with his Cuban father and that any decision
about a return to Cuba should be left up to the father, if the
courts award him custody.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the New York City mayor is utilizing a ''broad
national network of people who are opposed to what I would do in
the Senate'' to raise what her husband on Saturday predicted would
be a ''double-ton'' of money.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is playing on their fears and sending out these direct mail
requests and people that are seeing them are responding to it,''
said Clinton, who is trailing $19 million to $12 million in the
fund-raising competition against Giuliani. ''I don't think it's
very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's fund-raising letters are ''more in line with the
right wing of America than the mainstream of New Yorkers,'' Clinton
said. On Saturday, the president said Giuliani was benefiting from
a ''right-wing venom machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton is obviously disappointed in her campaign and its
ability to attract more support, so now she's reverting to that old
Clinton ruse of blaming the vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Giuliani
campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   During her campaign trip Monday, the first lady also said life
on the campaign trail is harder than expected, especially for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having a great time, but I'm also seeing how hard it is''
to be a candidate, she told an audience of about 100 people at a
community forum in the village of Coxsackie just south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm almost embarrassed to think back -- all the times that I
would say to my husband, 'Well, you could have said this
differently, or you could have done that.' Now, I would like to
take all those words back because it's very tough for both men and
women,'' the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said ''there are extra burdens that women
(candidates) face around the country.'' She did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best advice I've ever seen for women in politics came from
one of my favorite predecessors, Eleanor Roosevelt ... She said,
'You must grow skin as tough as a rhinoceros.'
</P>
<P>
   ''So if you look carefully at my skin ...'' Clinton began before
she was drowned out by laughter.
</P>
<P>
   There were serious moments at the forum, such as when one former
Democrat and handgun owner told her he had defected to the
Republicans because of what he perceived as ''no-gun policies''
being promoted by Clinton's fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she did not believe in outlawing all guns,
but did want to see them licensed, have required background checks
for owners and action to make sure children could not get at guns.
</P>
<P>
   And while attacking the National Rifle Association for being
stuck on a ''theological view'' about gun control, Clinton also
warned against ''people on the other extreme who want to take
everybody's guns away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gone hunting,'' she said. ''I don't have anything against
guns if guns are used by responsible people.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a message seemingly designed to appeal to more
conservative voters in upstate New York, a key battleground in the
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was fielding questions on the campaign trail,
Giuliani took time out from his mayoral duties to take in opening
day at Shea Stadium where the Mets hosted the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also joined Democrats from the state Legislature at an
appearance at the state Capitol in calling on the state Senate's
Republican majority to pass hate crimes legislation. For several
years, Giuliani has unsuccessfully sought to convince the state
Senate GOP to adopt that very legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated Monday that Elian Gonzalez should be with his
Cuban father, but she stopped short of saying she favored him being
sent back to Cuba. She did complain that the boy was being used
''for political purposes'' and that a ''media circus'' had
developed around him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe personally, this little boy should be with his
father,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady
felt the father should be granted custody of the child and that any
return to Cuba should then be up to the father. She said
politicians should stay out of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both Giuliani and Vice President Al Gore have called on Congress
to approve legislation granting Elian, his father and other family
members permanent residency in the United States so they can stay
here while the court fight goes on and so the family can stay in
this country after it is over, if they wish to.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has said Giuliani has helped turn Elian Gonzalez
into a ''political football.'' She has refused to say the same of
Gore, although she conceded Monday that the two disagree on the
case.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore leads Bush among New York voters  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Al Gore has ended months of being in a
statistical dead heat with George W. Bush and is now ahead by
double digits, a statewide poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   The poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion
showed the vice president leading the Texas governor, 49 percent to
38 percent. Previous polls dating back to March 1999 had shown Gore
and Bush running neck-and-neck when margins of error were factored
in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a wide lead over Bush in New York City and its suburbs.
He is ahead in the city 65 percent to 23 percent and 50 percent to
41 percent in the suburbs. But Bush, a Republican, is favored by
upstate New York voters 47 percent to 39 percent for the Democratic
vice president, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had an 8-point lead among suburban voters in December but
now trails Gore by 9 percentage points. Among independents, Bush
was ahead by 21 points but is now behind by 6.
</P>
<P>
   Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-3 margin in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said Monday the shift took place
largely among suburban voters and independents, who were driven
away from Bush when the governor ''moved to the right'' in order to
defeat Arizona Sen. John McCain in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that the primaries are over, we're seeing some of the more
normal Northeastern voting patterns coming into play,'' Miringoff
said. ''We're seeing the middle-of-the road electorate fighting for
Gore. New York is not on the must-win list for Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the decline in support for
the governor is ''natural after a competitive primary.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always realized that New York is going to be a
competitive state, but we still think that Governor Bush's
compassionate conservative message appeals to a lot of different
people and we'll make sure we keep delivering that message,''
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ''isn't going to take one vote for granted,''
said Peter Ragone, spokesman for Gore's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to fight his heart and soul out for every vote in
the state and continue to talk about issues that matter most to New
York state,'' Ragone said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marist poll also found that having Gov. George Pataki as his
running mate won't help Bush much in New York, with only 28 percent
of voters saying they'll be more likely to vote for Bush vs. 42
percent saying they're less likely to vote for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly there's not a big sense in the numbers that Pataki
would make a huge difference here,'' Miringoff said. ''He doesn't
bring any inroads to Democrats and independents, which he clearly
needs to do if he's on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are in a statistical dead heat among male
voters, with 46 percent supporting Gore and 42 percent for Bush,
but Gore leads Bush among women, 53 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 561 registered voters was conducted March
27-28 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points. Forty-two percent of those polled were Democrats, 31
percent were Republicans and 21 percent independents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton lobbies for passage of Albany hate crime bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton had no better luck
than her expected opponent for the U.S. Senate in urging state
Senate Republican Senators to pass a hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   After a heated debate Monday, Republicans blocked a Democratic
attempt to force the hate crimes legislation passed by the Assembly
onto the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ''it's embarrassing'' that New York is one of only
nine states without hate crime measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making clear that New York can no longer lag behind the
rest of the country in the emphasis ... on stopping hate wherever
it rears its ugly head,'' Clinton said in a state Capitol news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-led state Assembly has passed the bill for 11
straight years, most recently in February. But the state Republican
majority has repeatedly ignored the legislation, arguing that such
a bill would discriminate against the victims of non-bias crimes by
creating a special class of victims.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, has also unsuccessfully tried to
convince the Senate GOP to adopt the legislation. Clinton said
that's because the New York City mayor never came to Albany to
directly address the hate crimes issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to come here and look into the eyes of the Republican
senators who he's expecting to support him and tell them that they
should do this because this is the right thing to do,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said Republicans were voting
against the procedure, rather than the legislation, and promised
that GOP senators would deal with the issue on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important issue that should be addressed and discussed
on the Senate floor and we intend to do this,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   But tempers on both sides of the aisle in the Senate were short,
with Republicans accusing Democrats of grandstanding and Democrats
complaining that they were not being allowed to discuss the issue
openly.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said Democrats were prohibited from talking about the
merits of the legislation they were trying to get out onto the
floor through a ''motion to discharge.'' When the presiding officer
in the Senate, Republican Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, upheld that
interpretation of the chamber's rules, Senate Democratic leader
Martin Connor complained that his members were being muzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ''No presiding officer that I know of has ever, ever ruled hat
members cannot discuss underlying bills,'' Connor said. ''How could
one possibly explain a motion of discharge ... and why it was
important to bring the bill to the floor now, without discussing
the merits?''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue later gaveled and shouted Connor down when he yelled
that the Democrats were facing unprecedented obstacles to debating
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed hate crimes bill would increase penalties for
crimes motivated by race, color, gender, sexual orientation,
religion, national origin or disability.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crime offense would be a class C or D felony and would
be imposed separately from other offenses by an attacker, such as
murder or assault. Conviction could add as much as 15 years to an
offender's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Howie Katz, chairman of the Hate Crimes Bill Coalition, said
with Georgia passing a hate crimes bill two weeks ago, New York and
South Carolina are now the only states on the East Coast without
such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's particularly embarrassing to stand in the company of a
state that still flies the Confederate flag over its capitol,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution's case questioned seven years after man entered prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Attorneys for a man convicted of
strangling an ex-girlfriend to death 13 years ago say prosecutors
ignored other suspects and had a former medical examiner modify the
estimated time of the killing during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Rivas has been in prison since 1993 serving a
25-year-to-life sentence, but allegations of prosecutorial
wrongdoing may get Rivas a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Onondaga County Judge John Brunetti has scheduled a hearing this
week on the issues raised by Rivas' attorney. District Attorney
William Fitzpatrick's office has denied the accusations in its
written response to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick is accused of concealing evidence and documents that
would have undermined the prosecution's theory that Rivas stalked
Valerie Hill and killed her because she had rejected his attempt to
rekindle a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's body was found in her Syracuse home on March 30, 1987.
Hill, a 28-year-old pediatrics nurse, had been strangled with the
belt of her bathrobe and sexually molested.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas, Hill's former boyfriend, was questioned at length the day
the body was found but no charges were brought. That is, until
Fitzpatrick became district attorney in 1992 and decided to reopen
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas was convicted in March 1993 of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court Appellate Division upheld the conviction
in 1995. But Rivas' attorneys started further legal maneuvering's
last year after claiming they had newly discovered evidence that
warranted overturning the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argues that former Medical Examiner Erik Mitchell
concluded that Hill had been dead less than 48 hours before her
body was found. Rivas, however, had an alibi for most of that time,
and authorities opted not to charge him initially.
</P>
<P>
   The time of Hill's death and Mitchell's findings on that issue
were key factors in the 1993 trial.
</P>
<P>
   When Fitzpatrick resurrected the case and took it to trial,
Mitchell expanded the time frame for the killing by a day, a time
for which Rivas did not have an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rivas was the victim of a concerted effort to convict that was
severed from concerns over actual guilt very early on in this
investigation and was orchestrated by the district attorney
himself,'' the defense charged.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell quit his job after being charged with criminal
misconduct in the way he ran the medical examiner's office. Rivas'
attorneys said that information raises questions about Mitchell's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are suggesting that Mitchell gave false and misleading
testimony in an attempt to ingratiate himself to a district
attorney who he knew might one day be making a prosecutorial
decision regarding his gross misconduct,'' the defense claims.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the defense claims it has learned about
potentially helpful evidence authorities had at the time but did
not provide. They say police had other suspects in Hill's slaying
and that a jail inmate had told police a mentally disabled man
confessed a year after the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Mitchell Monday night were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> State ended 1999-2000 fiscal year $1.5 billion in black  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York was in the black as its last fiscal
year ended, the fifth straight year of surpluses under Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The state recorded a $1.5 billion surplus in the 1999-2000
fiscal year budget in which it spent $73.3 billion, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said the balance sheet for the
just-completed fiscal year shows that a ''lack of resources'' is
not an issue in the failure of Pataki and the state Legislature to
have a new budget when the 2000-01 state fiscal year began on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Late budgets are the result of a lack of leadership and a
flawed budget process,'' McCall said. ''It's time for the governor
and the Legislature to enact meaningful budget reform and end this
cycle of ineptitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The year-end budget figures released Monday were interpreted in
different ways by the players in Albany's budget game.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's budget director Carole Stone urged caution, saying
surpluses are ''one-time resources'' which should not be depended
on to fund recurring programs.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said years of tax cuts
championed by his Republican chamber have helped create recent
years' surpluses. He reiterated his insistence on enacting further
deep tax cuts in the 2000-01 budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leader in the Assembly, John Faso, said the
surplus should be used to repeal the state's gross receipts tax on
energy.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a Democrat who may run for governor in 2002, also
accused Republican Gov. Pataki of operating a ''shell game'' of
sorts with the surplus. McCall said his office has started to send
out more than 1 million state income tax refunds which were held up
for at least three weeks because there was technically no money to
cover the checks.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the state could have paid for the refunds, but
accused Pataki of holding up the money so the $500 million or so to
cover the checks would be counted toward the year-end surplus for
fiscal 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki budget aides denied that any refund checks were held up
to intentionally pad the 1999-2000 surplus numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Previous years' budget surpluses under Pataki have totaled $1.8
billion in fiscal 1998-99; $2.04 billion in 1997-98; $1.42 billion
in 1996-97 and $445 million in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Monday, the finger-pointing continued over the late
budget for fiscal 2000-01, with Bruno and the Democratic speaker of
the state Assembly, Sheldon Silver, blaming each other for the 16th
straight failure to adopt an on-time budget.
</P>
<P>
   Silver continued to insist that Bruno is so miffed at Pataki
because of a spat between the two Republicans that the Senate is
refusing to join productive talks that have been taking place
privately between Pataki and Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Bruno is intent on ''political paybacks'' against
the governor for firing Bruno-recommended workers on the state
payroll and other difficulties between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Sen. Bruno wasn't so upset about his loss of patronage then
we would have a budget,'' Silver said on Albany radio station
WROW-AM Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, meanwhile, said Silver continues to harp on the dispute
between the majority leader and governor to deflect attention away
from Silver's desire to negotiate as much of a high-spending budget
in private as he can. Bruno said he remains prepared to immediately
convene conference committees to discuss a budget publicly.

   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Niklas Sundstrom scored a short-handed
goal at 4:37 of the third period Monday night, lifting the San Jose
Sharks to a 1-0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton lost the puck in its own end and Sundstrom jammed it
past Oilers goalie Tommy Salo for the Sharks' 15th short-handed
goal this season, matching the Detroit Red Wings for the NHL high.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Shields recorded his fourth shutout of the season,
stopping 20 shots.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, with 83 points, has a three-point lead in the Western
Conference over ninth-place Vancouver for the final playoff
position. Edmonton is in seventh place with 84 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers had a chance to tie the game, with under six minutes
left, when forwards Todd Marchant and Ethan Moreau broke in on a
2-on-1, but Moreau could not beat Shields up high.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, which was 2-1-1 this season against Edmonton, snapped
a three-game winless streak.

<HEADLINE> Employees Buy Canton Paper Mill  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, N.C. (AP) -- Tim Smather had the look of a contented man,
even though he took a $7,000 pay cut in 1999 at his job of 24
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year ago, he and more than 1,000 other workers at the
old Champion International paper mill jumped off the career path
followed by their parents and grandparents, who punched a clock
every day at the Haywood County plant.
</P>
<P>
   They bought the place.
</P>
<P>
   The historic purchase of the Canton mill and several other
plants owned by Champion came with a hefty price: a 15 percent cut
in pay and benefits for the length of their seven-year union
contract. In return for financial backing by a New York investment
group, the employees got stock in the company and a profit-sharing
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now named Blue Ridge Paper Products, Inc., the new company
operates mills in Canton and Waynesville and five finishing plants
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   For Smather, he hopes it means there will be stability at the
mill, which has seen its share of volatility and controversy since
it opened in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more laid back in there than it's ever been,'' said
Smather, now 42, pointing back over his shoulder to the sprawling
factory that has provided his income since he was 18. ''Now we can
worry about what other paper companies are doing instead of
worrying about our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   As part-owners, the workers have to deal with the same problems
that compelled Champion to sell it in the first place: cheap
foreign imports, uncertain markets and antiquated equipment.
Moreover, the industry is undergoing rapid consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Smather said morale is high at the Canton plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We earned a small profit last year,'' he said proudly. ''I got
$1,000 back from the $8,000 I lost in wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's buyout resolved nearly 18 months of uncertainty that
followed Champion's announcement that it planned to sell the
Haywood County mills and plants in Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the plant was harshly criticized by environmental
groups from Tennessee for polluting the Pigeon River. Champion
invested about $250 million several years ago to comply with
stringent environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mills went on the selling block, the local paperworkers
union stepped up as the only potential buyer. After months of
negotiations, the New York-based KPS Special Situations Fund
investment group backing the deal said it had reached a formal
agreement to buy the seven factories for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Employees now control 40 percent of the company's stock, while
KPS and its investors control 55 percent. Five percent was retained
by senior management.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member board of directors hired industry veteran Gordon
Jones as its president and chief executive officer. His first major
move was to acquire Westvaco's liquid packaging division.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the acquisition would increase Blue Ridge's market
share. Based in Richmond, Va., the division has about 100 employees
and includes two state-of-the-art web offset presses used to make
high-quality juice and milk cartons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it's not a huge acquisition, it's a significant step
for us to grow our business,'' said Jones, who managed 85 plants
for Chicago-based Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., one of the world's
largest makers of paperboard and paper-based packaging products.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has made it clear he plans for the employee buyout to have
a happy ending. Distinctly aware of the mill's long history in
western North Carolina, he bought some old photographs of the plant
and its workers dating to 1910.
</P>
<P>
   The prints were enlarged and framed, and now hang in the
company's headquarters in the BB&AMP;T Bank building in downtown
Asheville. Jones likes to point out details in some of the photos,
such as the huge piles of pine and hardwood trees that were cut
down and stacked neatly by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows just how much more productive paper mills are today,
because we'd never have that kind of volume on hand in our yard,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rank-and-file, Jones is invigorated by the challenge of
making Blue Ridge Paper successful. He also is proud of the
experienced management team he assembled.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tested in the rough-and-tumble markets in which Blue
Ridge will have to compete. Making their challenge even tougher is
a spate of recent mergers and acquisitions that make the Asheville
company a much smaller player.
</P>
<P>
   ''These deals make us the aberration as a $500 million
company,'' Jones said. ''What we need to do is to take advantage of
our size and be quicker to bring new products to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one motive behind his decision to buy Westvaco's liquid
packaging division. The high-end cartons produced by the new
presses bring in a higher profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   While Champion was often reluctant to make major changes to the
plant's product line, Blue Ridge is looking for ways to enter new
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we talk about changes coming to this company, we're not
just talking about changing the color of the paint in the
bathrooms,'' Jones said. ''We want to do things better.''

<HEADLINE> Youth, Poor Shooting Strand Gators  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- They walked off the court with their heads
bowed, looking disappointed but shedding few tears. The Florida
Gators figure they'll be back here again.
</P>
<P>
   But the youth that brought about so much optimism over this
season and this magical tournament run turned out to be Florida's
undoing in the title game Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators lost 89-76 to a court-savvy Michigan State team, a
performance in which the effort was there but the experience
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just a better team today,'' said Kenyan Weaks,
Florida's lone senior. ''They came out and took it to us and took
advantage of our youthfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed up all over the court, but nowhere as dramatically as
at guard, where it seemed nobody could shoot straight.
</P>
<P>
   Or pass well.
</P>
<P>
   Or defend anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Brett Nelson hit two early 3-pointers, then spent the
rest of the game forcing shots, passes and everything else a point
guard is supposed to do well. He finished 4-for-10.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Teddy Dupay, a 5-foot-10 gunner, looked about three
inches shorter and nothing like the 41-point-per game scorer he was
in high school. He didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could never get into a flow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of experience was supposed to be Weaks. He finished
with three points.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Donovan, the 34-year-old mastermind of this youth
movement, inserted Justin Hamilton, a freshman defensive
specialist, into the starting lineup. The thought was that Hamilton
could contain senior Mateen Cleaves. Guess what? Cleaves finished
with 18 points and Hamilton was totally ineffective, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''From last year to this year, we made great strides and
jumps,'' Donovan said. ''But we've got to make some more steps. I
think we'll use this as a great learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there was plenty to learn from a team that made the
Final Four last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like how to keep going to a guy when he gets hot.
</P>
<P>
   Center Udonis Haslem finished with 27 points, but didn't get the
ball enough. The guards, Donovan said, were more intent on shooting
quick jumpers than working the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   So, Haslem's success did nothing but underlie his teammates'
failure. The 6-8 sophomore carved out room in the middle and shot
10-for-12. The rest of the Gators shot 16-for-48, a measly 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the failure included the performance of Mike Miller. The
can't-miss forward from Mitchell, S.D., looked as confused as the
kids in the backcourt. He shot 2-for-5 and finished with 10 of the
most invisible points he's ever scored.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a team that was young and didn't know what to expect
coming into this situation, we did a great job,'' Miller said.
''Any time you get in situations like this and come out losing,
it's definitely difficult. But I think we grew up, and that's the
most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Weaks will be gone and Miller, a sophomore, could
leave for the pros. But another strong recruiting class is coming
and the Gators know the future looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   Another year of experience should work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Michigan State.

<HEADLINE> Speedy Spartans Sprint Past Gators  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Michigan State can outrun the best of them.
Just ask Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After plodding through the NCAA tournament against slower, more
physical opponents, Michigan State was challenged to a footrace by
the up-tempo, full-court-pressing Gators in the championship game
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans adapted to the style change with poise and
precision typical of their senior-laden roster, and they ran to a
national title with an 89-76 victory. By game's end, the Gators
were pulling on their shorts while the Spartans were shouting at
the top of their still-fresh lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in attack mode,'' A.J. Granger said. ''We knew the way
to beat the press was to get the ball upcourt quick and take care
of it. We had to take the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, Florida intimidated opponents with its
press and wore them down with superior conditioning. Florida could
do neither against the Spartans and floor general Mateen Cleaves,
who kept the Spartans cool and collected while waves of Gators
roared at them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just staying cool, that's all it really was,'' Cleaves
said. ''They can disrupt you if you let them, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State essentially won the battle in the game's first
five minutes by showing it would use the Gators' pressure against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Using a variety of long passes and clear-outs for Cleaves, the
Spartans attacked the press aggressively and got the ball downcourt
so quickly that they rarely needed to run an offensive play in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked the way we attacked immediately,'' coach Tom Izzo
said. ''We got the ball to the middle of the floor and got it up
the court. That's the way we diagrammed it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactics led to several layups and easy shots before most
fans had settled in their seats in the RCA Dome. Michigan State
scored on seven of eight possessions in the first five minutes and
led 17-11 before the first timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they were doing was hitting the sideline and then
slashing Mateen Cleaves over the top, and they were hitting him,''
Florida coach Billy Donovan said. ''At times, he just outran our
guards. He was just faster. That's when they got some easy
baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   With the press ineffective and Michigan State about to pull
away, the Gators were forced to try to match the Spartans basket
for basket. Florida couldn't do it, as Michigan State played its
usual tough defense and got several baskets in transition even when
the Gators weren't pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators didn't score off a turnover forced by their press
until 9:09 remained in the game. But after Florida got a layup on
that play, the Spartans immediately attacked once again, and Morris
Peterson got behind the defense and converted a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Peterson, Cleaves and Granger each shot 50 percent or
better from the field while scoring 58 of the Spartans' 89 points.
Michigan State had 19 assists against just 14 turnovers. The
Spartans even shot 55.9 percent, a remarkable number against a
defense as tough as Florida's.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a convincing win for a veteran team that
learned from the pressure of their appearance in last year's Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of these guys knew how important it was to focus on our
game and not worry about their press,'' Izzo said. ''I felt like we
stayed focused pretty much all night.''

<HEADLINE> Granger Was Spartans' Ace in Hole  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Most everyone knew Michigan State had the
Flintstones. Now the basketball world knows about A.J. Granger,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Granger matched his career-high with 19 points to help the
Spartans beat Florida 89-76 on Monday night for their first NCAA
title since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called him the 'X' factor going into the game,'' Florida
coach Billy Donovan said. ''We knew that Mateen Cleaves and Morris
Peterson were going to probably play well and do a good job
handling our press.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson led the Spartans with 21 points and Cleaves, despite
missing about four minutes because of an injured ankle, added 18
for Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said the Gators needed to stop Granger from stepping out
and making 3-point shots. They didn't. Granger was 3-of-8 from
beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Granger, a senior from Findlay, Ohio, who was recruited in the
same class as Cleaves and Peterson, said the Spartans were one step
ahead of Donovan. They figured Florida would gamble on spending
most of its energy trying to defend Peterson and Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not the go-to guy, so I got more good shots,'' Granger
said. ''They got me open tonight, set some picks for me. Then, I
just had to make the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other unsung heroes for the Spartans, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Richardson, Mike Chappell, Adam Ballinger all played key
roles off the bench as the Spartans beat the Gators at their own
warp-speed game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just seems like somebody on this team steps up every
night,'' Granger said. ''Tonight, it just happened to be me and
Morris.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State also got a gutty performance from Charlie Bell,
who isn't nearly as well-known as fellow Flintstones Cleaves and
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   During a stretch of about four minutes when Cleaves was out
getting his right ankle tapped after a hard fall early in the
second half, Bell held the Spartans together.
</P>
<P>
   If the Spartans, leading by six points at the time, were going
to fold, this might have been the time. But they had been in this
situation before -- for the first two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bell played point guard for the Spartans' first 13 games while
Cleaves recovered from a stress fracture in that right foot. He did
it again in the biggest game of his life and Michigan State had
increased its lead to nine points by the time Cleaves limped back
onto the court.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Granger who gave the Spartans an unexpected offensive
push -- something they felt would be vital against Florida's
in-your-face defense.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Gators collapsed on Peterson, Cleaves and Andre
Hutson, it was Granger who shredded their strategy. He hit
3-pointers, drove the baseline for leaners in the paint, and
battled underneath for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Every time it seemed like the Gators had come up with a stop, it
seemed Granger would get the ball and somehow hit a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Granger has been quietly outstanding during this entire
tournament run. He averaged 9.3 points during the regular season,
but put his game on another level once the tournament started.
Granger also scored 19 against Syracuse and 18 against Iowa in the
Midwest Regionals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a night when we had a lot of guys do a lot of
things,'' Spartans coach Tom Izzo said. ''I don't know what we
would have done without some of those subs.''

<HEADLINE> Israel's Ally Threatens Violence  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATIMA GATE, Israel-Lebanon Border (AP) -- Israel's top ally in
Lebanon on Monday invoked the fall of the ancient hilltop fortress
of Masada -- the bloodiest last stand in Jewish history -- to
describe what may be in store for his men after Israel's scheduled
withdrawal in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Antoine Lahad's rhetoric, however, was at odds with
predictions by Israeli officials -- and of some of the 80,000
Lebanese in his charge -- of an uneventful transition, with some
militiamen going into exile with their families, and others coming
to peaceful terms with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw his
troops from south Lebanon by July, making good on an election
promise to end an increasingly unpopular occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Barak would prefer to pull out as part of a peace agreement with
Syria, the main power in Lebanon, but the two sides seem
intractably at odds over territorial issues. Without an agreement,
Lahad's South Lebanese Army faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Lahad told reporters Monday that his 2,600 fighters would only
relinquish control of south Lebanon if given assurances by the
Lebanese government that they will not be punished for cooperating
with Israel. He also demanded that his men be absorbed into the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Lebanese government has offered lenient
treatment to lower-ranking South Lebanon Army members considering
defection. However, Lahad and other senior officers have been
sentenced to death in absentia, and it was not clear if they would
get the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lahad said Beirut's failure to meet his conditions would mean
''the government does not want to come south.''
</P>
<P>
   Without assurances from the Lebanese authorities, ''just like
you at Masada, we will fight for our land,'' he told reporters at
an Israeli army base on the border.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to a hilltop fortress in the Judean desert
where Jewish rebels and their families resisted Roman soldiers for
years. When they saw the Romans were about to breach their
defenses, 960 people killed themselves rather than surrender in
A.D. 73.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of Lahad's militiamen are already quietly moving
to avoid a cataclysm. Some speak of accommodating themselves to
Lebanese rule; others say they will seek refuge in Israel from a
vengeance promised by the Hezbollah, the Islamic militia that is
Israel's main enemy in the south.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would prefer to live in my land,'' said Issa Karim, an SLA
mechanic who was crossing into Lebanon at the ''Good Fence,'' the
transit point for the many Lebanese who shop and work in Israel.
''But if the Hezbollah comes to try and take me and my children, I
would come to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis, feeling an allegiance to a militia that has
helped their troops police the buffer zone Israel has occupied for
18 years, have lobbied their government hard to absorb the SLA men
and their families -- about 10,000 people altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are their last hope,'' said Miriam Hod, a hotelier in the
border town of Metulla who has been working on behalf of about 100
Lebanese families.
</P>
<P>
   The top Israeli army commander in Lebanon said his troops were
ready to offer refuge in Israel to any or all of the SLA men and
their families -- the first official Israeli acknowledgment of such
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is obligated to them,'' Brig. Gen. Benny Ganz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganz said he was ''optimistic'' that the post-pullout period
would be relatively free of bloodshed. He cited the SLA withdrawal
from Jezzine, a town on the northern tip of the buffer zone, last
year as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the SLA troops who remained in Jezzine -- and who had
supposedly faced death sentences for treachery -- instead spent a
few months in prison and were released to their old jobs and
families.
</P>
<P>
   Ganz grimaced each time Lahad, who is recovering from an
undisclosed illness, warned that his men were prepared to ''die on
their land.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of those under Lahad's control are sure it will come to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like Israel to stay,'' said Yusuf Salih, a 73-year-old
Lebanese returning from a day's work in the peach and cherry
orchards along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also looked forward to reuniting with two sons in Beirut.
Even the prospect of imprisonment did not daunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will see them when I get out of jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday that
the United States will not deploy troops in south Lebanon as part
of an international peacekeeping force after Israel withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, speaking after a meeting with Cohen, said he did not
expect the current U.N. peacekeeping force in the area to be
expanded significantly after an Israel pullback.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said no decisions have been made about the future of U.N.
peacekeepers in south Lebanon. ''I do not anticipate that the
United States will be a participant should there be such a
UNIFIL,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmate's Son Charged  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The 21-year-old son of an infamous Texas death
row inmate has been jailed on a capital murder charge stemming from
a shooting death in Houston last week, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors choose to seek the death penalty in the Gary
Hawkins case, conviction could result in Gary Graham and Hawkins
becoming the only father-son duo among the more than 450 condemned
murderers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we had the arrest warrant we believed he was Gary
Graham's son,'' Brian Harris, a Houston police homicide
investigator, said Monday. ''Obviously Gary Graham's been gone for
a whole lot of time and hasn't had an influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 38, who now prefers to be known as Shaka Sankofa to
reflect his African heritage, has been on death row since November
1981 when he was condemned for the shooting death six months
earlier of Bobby Lambert, 53, of Tucson, Ariz., during a robbery
outside a Houston supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   His case has been one of the most highly publicized in Texas,
serving as a lightning rod for both death penalty opponents and
proponents. It has been reviewed more than 35 times by the courts
and remains in the federal appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and his supporters have produced what they say are
witnesses who place him elsewhere at the time of the shooting or
contend someone else was the gunman. Such witnesses previously have
been ruled by courts as vague or not credible.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins was hiding in a motel along Interstate 10 in east
Houston when he arrested without incident Sunday for the fatal
shooting of Melvin Ray Pope, 32, whose body was found on the side
of a road March 29. Pope was shot in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   A second man was arrested Friday and charged with aggravated
robbery in the Pope case.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Hawkins was the triggerman. They say robbery was
the motive.

<HEADLINE> Silvester probe nets fourth guilty plea  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A fourth person has pleaded guilty in
connection with the corruption investigation of former state
Treasurer Paul J. Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   George Gomes, who worked as Silvester's assistant treasurer,
pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court Monday to a single count of
mail fraud. Federal prosecutors say Gomes, 33, laundered money for
Silvester's failed 1998 re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Gomes) disguised an influx of cash to Paul Silvester's
campaign as legitimate contributions,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Nora Dannehy.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes could receive a maximum 5-year prison sentence, but will
likely serve less time because he has cooperated with the
government and has accepted responsibility for his actions. He also
faces a $250,000 fine. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 22.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes admitted that an intermediary for Silvester gave him
$4,500 in October, 1998. Dannehy and Gomes' lawyer, Harold James
Pickerstein, refused to say who gave Silvester that money or who
funneled the cash to Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes then gave $1,600 to an individual who turned the money
over to Silvester's campaign. With some of the remaining money,
Gomes made two contributions to Silvester's campaign -- one in his
name and one in someone else's. Dannehy and Pickerstein would not
identify the other people involved in the scam, and their names
were not mentioned in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, campaign contributions for treasurer are capped
at $1,500 and contributors are not allowed to make payments in the
name of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes also mailed a statement to the secretary of the state
which falsely listed the source of contributions to Silvester's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agree that if the case were to go to trial, the government
would be able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt,''
Pickerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, Silvester, his brother Mark, and brother-in-law
Peter Hirschl pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from a
multi-million-dollar racketeering and kickback conspiracy during
Silvester's tenure from mid-1997 to January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The three have agreed to testify against others. They are
scheduled to be sentenced June 19, and investigators are still
probing the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least last summer, federal authorities have been
investigating the hiring of Gomes in early 1999 as a lobbyist with
the New London law firm of Glenn T. Carberry. Carberry is a former
Republican congressional candidate with ties to Gov. John G.
Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   When Silvester left office in January 1999, he tried to find
jobs for a number of his displaced appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his term, Silvester gave a $27.5-million state pension
deal to Philadelphia-based Keystone Venture Capital Management Co.,
which Carberry had represented in talks with Silvester's office.
Keystone agreed to make payments totaling $275,000-- 1 percent of
the investment-- to Carberry's firm for lobbying services through
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry has denied any link between Silvester's approval of the
Keystone deal and Gomes' job with the firm. Gomes has since left
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry could not be reached for comment by The Associated
Press. A telephone message was left at his firm Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes' name was brought up last fall by J. Vincent Chase, the
man Rowland picked to become state treasurer in mid-1997 and then
dumped a few days later in favor of Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that Gomes approached him with the idea of using the
treasurer's office as a 1998 campaign fund-raising machine for
Rowland and the state Republican Party. Chase thought his refusal
to go along with that idea contributed to Rowland's decision not to
support his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has denied the charge, and his spokesman Dean Pagani
would not comment on the Gomes case Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thousands turn out to welcome returning champs  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- In her last home game at Gampel Pavilion,
senior forward Stacy Hansmeyer sang the national anthem before
10,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   She hit all the high notes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, when she held the microphone at Gampel rally for
the NCAA national champs, she struggled through tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have made my four years so special,'' she told the crowd.
''What a way for us to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates made sure that Hansmeyer and fellow senior Paige
Sauer finished their collegiate careers on a high note. A very high
note.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies routed perennial power Tennessee 72-51 for their
second national title in five years. The crowd of about 5,000
cheered wildly Monday as highlights of the title game were flashed
across the large scoreboard screen.
</P>
<P>
   Junior All-American Svetlana Abrosimova didn't need to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everytime I close my eyes I see the game,'' she said. ''And
especially the last couple minutes when we were on the bench and
Stacy and Paige were on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauer and Hansmeyer, both top recruits out of Oklahoma four
years ago, have had limited playing time in their final year,
making way for a talented sophomore squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''They brought so much to the team,'' said Abrosimova.
''Everyone was crying because we knew it was there last game. I
love them. They're my best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   All over Connecticut on Monday, school principals politely
looked the other way as parents pulled their kids out early for
''dentist appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, more than a few employees skipped out early with a
sudden fever.
</P>
<P>
   Husky fever, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The Hossack sisters -- Ashley, 12 and Shauna, 10 -- of Storrs
sported blue and white face paint and waved their signs to the beat
of the pep band. They weren't in school Monday because ''we said we
had a dentist appointment,'' said Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we wanted to celebrate their victory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Colleen, knew they were playing hooky. She was
sitting right next to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really proud of the team,'' she said. ''I'm hoping maybe
my kids will go to UConn and maybe they'll want to play
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn (36-1) has won seven straight Big East titles and breezed
through this year's tournament. Coach Geno Auriemma was able to
play every player on his bench in all six tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   University President Philip Austin called the rally ''an
official reaffirmation of what we have known for a long time --
we're Number One.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight year the state and campus embraced a
national champion. The UConn men won it all last year and a few of
the men's players attended the rally, cheering as the women were
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very proud of both the men and women. They are true
ambassadors in every way,'' said Wayne Locust, director of
admissions. ''They represent the university in the light that we
want them to represent us.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, hundreds of fans greeted the team at Bradley
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Ginnie Christiansen, who on Sunday was battling a very real,
101-degree fever, stood in the rain to celebrate the homecoming.
She and her daughter find the Huskies ''truly inspiring,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They bring more joy than anything else,'' said her daughter,
29-year-old Traci Christiansen. ''They are so phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gampel rally, the team was presented with NCAA trophy and
the Women's Coaches Basketball Association trophy. Auriemma
accepted his AP Coach of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   ''You all can take a little bit of satisfaction for taking these
kids to where they want to be,'' Auriemma told the crowd. ''Not
everybody gets to accomplish their dreams. We're the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Sunday) night we won a lot of awards, a lot of accolades and
a lot of honors,'' said Auriemma. ''But the honor that we have is
to coach these guys.''

<HEADLINE> Colonel charged with ignoring wife's drug scheme  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. Army colonel commanding the military's
anti-drug operation in Colombia knew his wife was laundering money
but failed to turn her in, federal prosecutors have alleged.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written Monday to a Brooklyn federal judge,
prosecutors revealed that Col. James Hiett faces criminal charges
of ignoring a felony committed by his wife, Laurie Hiett. The
charge carries a maximum sentence of 3 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett, 36, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in
January, saying she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth of
drugs to New York City. She also admitted traveling to New York to
collect the illicit proceeds to take back to Colombia -- an act
falling under the legal definition of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she told reporters she purposely kept her husband
in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, he may have asked me why I was going to New
York,'' she said. ''I just told him, 'Don't ask me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors refused to detail the case against the colonel. His
attorney, Abraham Clott, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Harvey Perritt said that James Hiett, 48, a
24-year veteran, remains on active duty at Fort Monroe, in Hampton,
Va., where he was transferred after allegations arose against his
wife. Military officials would not comment further on the case.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in
Panama had cleared Hiett, saying he had ''no prior knowledge'' of
his wife's crimes. Brooklyn prosecutors, meanwhile, had insisted
their investigation was not over.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett, an admitted cocaine addict, surrendered to
authorities last August after they intercepted two 1.2-kilo
packages of heroin that she allegedly mailed to Queens and
Manhattan from a post office at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The parcels had her return address. But she claimed that she
sent them for Jorge Ayala, a civilian driver for U.S. military
commanders in Colombia, and that they contained books, candy,
coffee and Colombian artifacts. She pleaded innocent and was freed
on bond.
</P>
<P>
   One of her co-defendants, Hernan Arcila, 54, pleaded guilty on
Jan. 5 to drug conspiracy, admitting that he accepted shipments
from Colombia at his Queens address. Ayala, who also was named in a
13-count indictment, was arrested in Bogota in February, and his
extradition is pending, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea, Laurie Hiett told a federal magistrate she
shipped six packages from Bogota to New York City, believing they
contained cocaine. Tests on the two seized shipments revealed they
were heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant also described flying to New York City two times
to pick up cash. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Dunst said the woman
once took another trip to Miami carrying a half-kilo of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Still free on bond, Laurie Hiett faces up to nine years in
prison at sentencing April 28. Her husband is to enter his plea on
April 17.

<HEADLINE> Defense claims accused killer was with victim night before wedding  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The man accused of killing Gladys Ricart on her
wedding day was her registered husband, his defense team said.
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Garcia, 47, claims to have spent the previous evening
with the woman he's charged with shooting to death.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, of North Bergen, N.J., is accused of killing Ricart, 39,
of Ridgefield, N.J., on Sept. 26, 1999, just as she prepared to
marry another man.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is jailed on $5 million bail. His attorneys claim he knew
nothing about the wedding until he walked in on it and found Ricart
in a wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to debunk the notion that Garcia was stalking Ms.
Ricart,'' attorney Fernando Oliver said Monday at a news conference
at a Manhattan law office.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver described Garcia's involvement with Ricart as ''an
ongoing, loving relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Ricart ''was living a double life or not, it
certainly appears from the course of the investigation that she
was,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   A former FBI agent hired by the defense to investigate the case,
Maurice Roussell, said four witnesses saw Garcia and Ricart
together in North Bergen, N.J., the day before the shooting -- at 6
p.m., 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. and then again at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ricart's sister has contended that a videotape showing the pair
at a Pathmark at 2 a.m. the day of the shooting only proved that
Garcia was following her.
</P>
<P>
   Roussell, the former FBI agent, said Garcia and Ricart had also
''registered as husband and wife'' in 1997 on the membership roster
of a church they continued to attend until shortly before the
shooting. He acknowledged that they were not legally married, and
he would not say where the church was.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, the lawyer, and Roussell also said that in August,
Garcia had discussed buying Ricart a new car as a wedding gift for
marrying him.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said he had no evidence that Ricart was afraid of Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why somebody would be showing affections in
public if they're in fear of somebody else,'' Oliver said. ''Dozens
of witnesses we have place them together consistently in May, June,
August and September. In many occasions they're introduced as
husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver suggested a wide range of defense theories, from
depicting the shooting an accident or self-defense during a
scuffle, to an act committed in the heat of passion, which would
constitute manslaughter as opposed to premeditated murder.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney also said Garcia had provided a $50,000 down
payment for Ricart's home and was giving her $500 a week for the
mortgage. Oliver said the pair had lived together between 1992 and
1995 but were living apart because Ricart did not want to care for
Garcia's children.
</P>
<P>
   As for reports that Garcia wore a tuxedo to fake his way into
the wedding, Oliver said he was dressed up because he was scheduled
to speak that evening at an art opening.

<HEADLINE> Peru Candidate Gets Campaign Boost  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAJAMARCA, Peru (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Alejandro Toledo's
campaign caravan slowly traveled to a rally in this northern Andean
city, making frequent stops to hug supporters and kiss babies -- and
to clear star-shaped spikes left to flatten the candidate's tires.
</P>
<P>
   A television camera crew focused on Toledo, a one-time shoeshine
boy turned economist, and discussed how to capture the most
unflattering recording of the man who is the leading threat to
upset President Alberto Fujimori's bid for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's ballot only days away, coverage of Toledo on
Peru's mostly pro-government TV stations has featured ominous
warnings that he will cut government food programs to the more than
42 percent of Peruvians who rely on the aid for their daily
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has characterized his opponent as an undisciplined,
free-spending populist whose offer of jobs and education will
plunge the country back into the hyperinflation of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue these (aid) programs while we begin to
generate jobs,'' Toledo promised the crowd of 3,000 supporters and
curious onlookers. ''Our people have dignity. Mothers and fathers
don't want their children spending the rest of their lives stepping
into line for a handout.''
</P>
<P>
   On a nearby corner, Adolfi Huamani perched atop a portable
waist-high grinding wheel that he uses to earn a living sharpening
knives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already seen in the last 10 years what Fujimori's
government can do. Now we need someone new,'' the 33-year-old said,
peering over the crowd. ''Toledo is an economist. He's from the
countryside. He knows poverty. He has a profound understanding of
Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid charges of government-sponsored harassment and political
sabotage, Toledo has made a surprising break from the pack of
opposition candidates languishing in the single digits in election
polls.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll released March 24 by the private firm Apoyo,
Toledo was in second place with 27 percent -- compared to 10 percent
a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, for months a clear favorite to win, was still leading
in late March with 37 percent, according to the survey, which had a
margin of error of 2.5 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo's recent surge in popularity has shaken the
61-year-old's chances for an outright majority and pollsters are
suddenly talking about a showdown between the two candidates in a
second round runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's campaign has capitalized on his dark, Indian features
and his background as one of 16 children born to a humble Indian
bricklayer and his wife in a remote Andean village.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford University trained economist refers to himself as
''El Cholo'' -- a common term for Peru's mostly poor Indian and
mixed-race majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Send El Chino back to Japan,'' his supporters in Cajamarca
chanted, using Fujimori's nickname, which means ''the Chinaman,''
and refers to his Asian features and Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's image has been boosted by his wife, Eliane Karp, an
eloquent red-haired Belgian anthropologist who has accompanied him
on the campaign trail and who speaks Quechua, the native tongue of
Peru's highland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's campaign success has drawn comparisons to
Fujimori's meteoric rise a decade ago when the then-university
rector rose in the polls a month before the vote and staged an
upset victory over novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in a second round
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, 54, was a World Bank official in the early 1980s when
Peru's deadly Maoist Shining Path insurgency set the stage for a
decade of guerrilla violence and economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   And he was a visiting scholar and research associate at Harvard
in 1992, when Fujimori -- two years into his first term -- suspended
the constitution, closed Congress in a ''self coup,'' and
celebrated the capture of Abimael Guzman, the Maoist rebels'
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo says he recognizes Fujimori's achievements and wants to
build on the free-market policies and economic stability that
helped earn his opponent a landslide second-term victory in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo said he also wants to rebuild the democratic
institutions that Fujimori is accused of subverting or casting
aside to consolidate power.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is prepared to deal with Fujimori's shadowy
intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, who is widely perceived
as the power behind the presidency, and who exercises direct
control over the armed forces and police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the guts to cut that infrastructure,'' Toledo said
during the chartered flight back to the capital, Lima. ''You have
to cut it the same day that you are inaugurated. Otherwise you will
become a hostage.''

<HEADLINE> Test May Rule Out Chemotherapy Need  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Many women with early-stage breast cancer
might be spared chemotherapy if doctors check tumors for proteins
that help reveal whether the disease will spread.
</P>
<P>
   Testing for these proteins is already becoming routine in
Europe, but U.S. doctors say they need more evidence that the
approach actually works.
</P>
<P>
   About 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the
United States this year. Most will have small tumors that have not
yet spread to the lymph nodes. About 70 percent of these women can
be cured with surgery and radiation alone.
</P>
<P>
   However, cancer will come back in the other 30 percent. Giving
chemotherapy to these women can reduce this risk by about
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for doctors is trying to identify this minority who
need chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   In general, doctors recommend treatment with the drug tamoxifen
for those whose tumors are fueled by estrogen, and they urge
chemotherapy for those who tumors are larger than two centimeters,
or about an inch.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at a meeting in San Francisco of the American
Association for Cancer Research, Dr. Anita Prechtl of Technical
University in Munich described the use of two proteins in tumors
that might help reveal their likelihood of coming back.
</P>
<P>
   The proteins are uPA -- short for urokinase-type plasminogen
activator -- and its natural inhibitor, known as PAI-1. About 45
percent of breast cancer patients have high levels of these
proteins. They have a higher risk of cancer spread, even though
their lymph nodes seem free of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prechtl's study involved 684 women whose breast tumors ranged up
to five centimeters in size but had not spread to their lymph
nodes. Those with low levels of uPA and PAI-1 were given no further
treatment. Those with high levels were randomly assigned to get no
more treatment or to receive a combination of three chemotherapy
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three years of follow-up, cancer had come back in 7
percent of women with low levels of the protein. Among those with
high levels, it had returned in 12 percent receiving chemotherapy
and in 18 percent in the untreated comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   However, breast cancer can come back after many years, and
doctors plan to follow the women for 10 years to see if the
proteins continue to help predict women's risk.
</P>
<P>
   By testing for the two proteins, ''more than half of all
node-negative breast cancer patients can be considered as a
low-risk patient group with less than 10 percent probability of
disease recurrence,'' Prechtl said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the German Research Association and
the test's maker, American Diagnostica Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen Antman of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New
York City cautioned that the test results need to be confirmed in
larger studies before it becomes part of routine care.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors would like to spare the majority of node-negative
breast cancer patients from going through chemotherapy, she said,
they fear missing those who might benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Arteaga of Vanderbilt University said that even if
the test proves out, U.S. doctors will still probably want to offer
chemotherapy to node-negative patients with tumors larger than two
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the study's results might eventually apply to
many women. ''The majority of breast cancer patients are node
negative, and a large proportion of them are under two
centimeters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UPA and PAI-1 are also being tested as possible ways to assess
the outlook of patients with ovarian, prostate and digestive system
cancers, among others. Research suggest these proteins increase the
tendency of cancer to spread throughout the body.

<HEADLINE> Swimming Discouraged for Under 4YO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Swimming lessons for children under 4 may give
them a false sense of security around the water, the American
Academy of Pediatrics is warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're discouraging lessons for children under 4 if the
parents' idea is that teaching their baby to swim makes them
safer,'' said Dr. Barb Smith, a pediatrician who helped write the
policy statement, published in the April issue of the academy's
journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Children under 4 are not ready physically or intellectually for
lessons in how to swim, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is not discouraging programs that get children
accustomed to the water and teach safety tips, such as those
developed by the YMCA and the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   But some aquatics programs try to develop water survival skills
and even tell parents that their children can be taught to swim,
the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Such training ''can make the parents less vigilant and the baby
more interested in going into the pool'' alone, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever an infant or a toddler is in or around water, an adult
should be within arm's length, providing ''touch supervision,'' the
academy said.
</P>
<P>
   Drowning is one of the leading causes of unintentional injury
and death among children nationally, and is the leading cause of
unintentional injury and death among 1- and 2-year-olds in Arizona,
California, Florida and Texas, according to the academy.
</P>
<P>
   The academy issued the policy statement because of a growing
interest in aquatics programs for infants and toddlers, Smith said.
An estimated 5 million to 10 million children participate in
aquatics programs.

<HEADLINE> Use of Antibiotics for Kids Studied  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A group of pediatricians concerned about the
overuse of antibiotics found that withholding the drugs from
children with respiratory infections did not hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that many doctors, pressured by parents and
schools, may prescribe antibiotics for virtually all respiratory
infections. But the overuse of antibiotics has also led to
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a serious long-term problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a yearlong study of 383 children, doctors from a pediatric
practice in the Rochester, N.Y., area administered what they called
''judicious antibiotic use'' in patients with colds and other
respiratory infections. The results were published in the April
issue of Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of
Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Since most respiratory infections are caused by viruses and
antibiotics work only against bacteria, antibiotics were given only
to children with infections presumed or shown by lab tests to be
caused by bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Infants and children through age 12 were studied. About
one-quarter of the children received antibiotics, while the rest
did not.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors then compared the frequency of return office visits
within a month of the initial visit. Just 29 percent of the
untreated group showed up for an unscheduled visit for additional
treatment, compared with 44 percent of the antibiotic-treated
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors, led by Dr. Michael Pichichero, wrote that
while some doctors will prescribe antibiotics for nearly all
patients with respiratory infections, ''there is, however, no
scientific rationale for such antibiotic use.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
published in the December issue of Pediatrics showed that 86
percent of pediatricians surveyed in Georgia routinely prescribed
antibiotics for bronchitis, even though such use is rarely
justified; and 42 percent prescribed them for the common cold,
which is caused by viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Many do so out of concern that a patient with an untreated virus
is vulnerable to a secondary bacterial infection, according to
Pichichero.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tina Tan, an infectious-disease specialist at Children's
Memorial Hospital in Chicago who was not involved in the New York
study, said it makes an important point that ''the better part of
valor here is to err more on the conservative side and not
prescribe an antibiotic for an upper respiratory tract infection.''
</P>
<P>
   The study may encourage doctors ''to really think about what
they're diagnosing and what should and should not be treated,'' Tan
said.

   Founded three years ago, Xlibris has published about 600 books
so far, some selling as many as 1,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the help of Random House we should be able to support a
mind-boggling number of authors,'' said John Feldcamp, CEO of
Xlibris, which is based in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would discuss exact terms of the deal, but they
said the transaction is worth at least seven figures. Random House,
a subsidiary of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, made the
deal through its recently formed Random House Ventures unit, which
invests in technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it would be interesting to get into involved with
what Xlibris is doing,'' said Richard Sarnoff, president of Random
House Ventures. ''Given the revolution in communications the
Internet allows, there's no reason the audience shouldn't get to
find authors they otherwise wouldn't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Xlibris accepts both fiction and nonfiction manuscripts. While
the vast majority have sold few copies, at least one did well
enough to get acquired by a major publisher. Aggie Jordan's advice
book ''The Marriage Plan'' will be released in December by Broadway
Books, a division of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Random House already has changed how Xlibris does
business.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been charging authors a basic fee of $450 to
take a manuscript and make it ready to be ordered as a book, but as
of Monday that service will be offered for free. Xlibris would
still charge for amenities such as a galley for the author and a
customized book covers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal continues a trend in which traditional publishers and
bookstores are increasingly putting money into new formats. Just in
the past year, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. purchased 49 percent of
iUniverse.com Inc., the main competitor of Xlibris; several
publishers starting experimenting with electronic books and Stephen
King, a Simon &AMP; Schuster author, published the novella ''Riding the
Bullet'' exclusively online.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole issue is: Do you view all of these start-ups as
competitors or do you view them as potential partners?'' said
Lorraine Shanley, co-director of the publishing consulting firm
Market Partners International.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear the winning strategy is to see them as partners.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Discloses Korean Spy Records  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly all Korean agents sent behind enemy
lines by the CIA during the Korean War were killed or doubled to
spy for the communists, causing the agency to conclude that its use
of American-trained loyalists was ''morally reprehensible,''
according to declassified records.
</P>
<P>
   That judgment is significant not only for the internal conflicts
it exposes but also because the CIA had never before publicly
acknowledged the scope or the outcome of its covert operations
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The records indicate the CIA sent thousands of agents into North
Korea during the 1950-53 war, which broke out just three years
after the agency was created. Their missions ranged from
intelligence collection to establishing ''escape and evasion,'' or
E&AMP;E, networks to rescue downed U.S. pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ''E&AMP;E operations as conducted by CIA in Korea were not only
ineffective but probably morally reprehensible in that the number
of lives lost and the amount of time and treasure expended was
enormously disproportionate to attainments therefrom,'' a July 1973
CIA historical review said, quoting from a January 1954 report by
the Korea Branch chief at CIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the war, CIA espionage efforts scored some notable
successes, but most of its attempts to penetrate North Korea once
peace talks began in the summer of 1951 failed, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the secret 1973 review and other related CIA records
were declassified at the request of author Michael E. Haas, whose
book, ''In the Devil's Shadow,'' was published in March by the
Naval Institute Press. The book provides a detailed description of
CIA and U.S. military operations behind North Korean lines.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA provided The Associated Press with copies of the
declassified pages after the AP inquired about the book's
disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans were sent on CIA missions behind enemy lines, but
the vast majority of agents were South Koreans or anti-communist
North Koreans forced to flee when China entered the war in October
1950.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, a retired Air Force colonel and decorated Vietnam veteran,
used the 1973 report and other declassified records to write the
most comprehensive account yet published of the CIA's first wartime
operations.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Tom Crispell said the agency had no comment on the
book.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA pledged publicly in 1993 to declassify its records on
Korean War covert operations but has not done so. Haas said he
obtained the CIA documents only after a private lawyer intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said the CIA refused to release an exact count of agents it
infiltrated into North Korea during the war -- often aboard Air
Force planes. But he cited a partially declassified CIA document,
titled ''Infiltration and Resupply of Agents in North Korea,
1952-1953,'' which stated that ''thousands of personnel'' were air
dropped into the communist country from June 25, 1950 until the
truce on July 27, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy also sent untold hundreds of
Koreans on such missions by land, air and sea.
</P>
<P>
   Few agents made it back alive, especially in the last two years
of the war. Their inherently dangerous missions were made even more
hazardous by bureaucratic conflict and confusion that combined to
produce what Haas called ''behind-the-lines chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior agency official, whose identity was not disclosed,
warned in September 1952 that agents sent north to set up escape
and evasion networks ''had almost no chance of success.'' He
predicted they would be captured ''and that the majority of them
would be doubled,'' to work for the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently was right.
</P>
<P>
   During the latter part of 1952, the CIA's airdropped teams
''were annihilated, taking 100 percent losses as many simply
disappeared after parachuting into North Korea,'' Haas wrote,
citing other CIA documents.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 CIA historical review said ''no airman or POW was known
to have been assisted by CIA-sponsored clandestine mechanisms,''
and it said little was gained from the ''numerous Koreans
sacrificed in what proved to be a basically futile attempt'' to set
up resistance cells and pilot rescue networks.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 review put part of the blame on the Air Force, whose
planes were used to drop agents by parachute. The Air Force crews,
it said, ''were never taught the finer techniques of clandestine
air support.''
</P>
<P>
   The report alludes to another aspect of the morality question,
beyond the sacrifice of Korean lives. It mentions an individual
Korean agent, whose identity is blacked out, who had a hand in the
North Korean drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''His trading with the enemy was an immense financial benefit to
them since his American intelligence connections served to
facilitate widespread traffic in narcotics amounting in value
probably to many millions of dollars,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no elaboration on the narcotics connection, but it
suggests at least an indirect CIA link to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Crispell, the agency spokesman, said, ''There is no indication
that the CIA supported or benefitted from illicit activities
involving this individual.'' An intelligence official speaking on
condition of anonymity said the Korean agent's relationship with
the CIA was ended after his drug trafficking became known.

<HEADLINE> Battles Over Gay Student Clubs  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE, Calif. (AP) -- Anthony Colin wanted to create a club at
his high school where students could get together and promote
tolerance of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his idea for a Gay-Straight Alliance Club has divided
the community, generating threats, courtroom battles and heated
school board meetings. One student was arrested for biting a
principal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole thing has stopped being about my club. It's become
this debate about sex,'' said Colin, 16, a sophomore at El Modena
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Although homosexual concerns -- like anti-discrimination laws and
lifestyle acceptance -- have been discussed for decades, dealing
with them in public schools is a recent development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students are feeling more comfortable and, therefore, a little
more courageous about coming forward'' to ask for recognition of
student clubs, said Julie Underwood of the National Schoolboards
Association, which represents the country's 15,000 districts.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, students have formed more than 700 Gay-Straight
Alliance clubs at high schools across the country -- about half came
after the beating death two years ago of gay Wyoming college
student Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs, supported by the Gay, Lesbian, Student Education
Network, or GLSEN, promote education and tolerance of
homosexuality. They also advocate some activism, such as amending
anti-bias policies at schools to include sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to form gay-oriented clubs are being met by resistance
from parents, school officials and religious leaders. Battle lines
between parents and club organizers have been drawn in California,
Utah, Louisiana, Indiana and Florida. One Salt Lake City school
district eliminated all student clubs rather than allow a gay club,
a ruling that is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're for protecting all children. But this is about more than
that,'' said Ed Vitagliano, director of research for American
Family Association, a Mississippi-based conservative watchdog
organization. ''To us, this is just another demonstration ... that
there is a broader agenda out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's ridiculous,'' said Kevin Jennings, executive director
of GLSEN. ''We don't use children. We don't go to them. They come
to us. Most of them we never hear from until there's a problem like
in Orange County.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kozuch, the faculty adviser for the GSA at Newton South
High School in Newton, Mass., said club members spend much of their
time hosting dances, going to conferences and showing movies ''just
like other student clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't talk about sex. They talk about trying to educate
people about homophobia and discrimination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Research Council, a Washington D.C.-based
conservative research group, maintains that those efforts are
''much more radical than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the clubs have had school-wide seminars where they
bring transsexuals in to talk about their lifestyle,'' said Pete
LaBarbera, an analyst for the council. ''Their reality is there is
much more going on than meets the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, if this was elementary school, this would be an issue,''
replied Sarah Austin, the 16-year-old president of her school's GSA
in Decatur, Ga. ''But high school students, and I mean all high
school students, have been having sex since the beginning of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if they're not having it, they are thinking about it. If
you don't know that, you really don't know what's going on at
schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what concerns parents in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my job to talk with my children about their sexuality.
It belongs at home, not at school,'' said parent Jack McNiff.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Unified School District board unanimously rejected
the club in December. Colin sued, accusing the board of violating
the Equal Access Act, which gives students the right to form clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge granted Colin a temporary injunction earlier
this year, allowing the club to meet on the 2,000-student campus
while his lawsuit against the board goes through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Things have hardly been quiet.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old El Modena student was arrested March 10, a day
after she allegedly bit the principal of another high school at a
school board meeting. Police said the bite happened after a group
wearing bandanas rushed forward when a critic of the club was
preparing to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators stepped in to stop them and the protesters fled,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Many El Modena students just want the controversy go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it needs to be decided and over with, so people can
get on with their lives,'' said 15-year-old Emily Burningham. ''I
don't like being known as the girl who goes to the school with a
gay club.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates Transplant Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two years of public struggle, warring
parties are edging toward common ground in a dispute over which
transplant patients will get first chance at donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   But a contentious debate beginning today in the House and a
federal lawsuit in Wisconsin make it clear that solving this
emotional and bitter argument will not be simple.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appear weary from the protracted battle. ''It's time
to get on with it already,'' said a frustrated Dr. Jeffrey Reese, a
kidney surgeon from the University of Vermont. ''Let's get onto the
next issue of increasing (organ) donation.''
</P>
<P>
   He and most others are looking to a pair of leaders on health
care, Sens. Bill Frist and Edward Kennedy, who are working on
compromise legislation that all parties can accept.
</P>
<P>
   ''We honestly are trying to work this thing out in a civil
manner,'' said Mark Rosenker of the United Network for Organ
Sharing, the private firm that runs the nation's transplant network
under a government contract and has been battling the Clinton
administration over a new distribution system for organs.
</P>
<P>
   The other side agrees. It's as if Kennedy and Frist found the
transplant world in a shaky, crowded rowboat with everyone trying
to stand up at once, said Charlie Fiske, who heads a patient group.
''The Frist-Kennedy people are saying, 'Put your lifejackets on.
Please sit down.'''
</P>
<P>
   But while Frist, R-Tenn., and Kennedy, D-Mass., prepare to
introduce their compromise as soon as Wednesday, the House is
taking a much different path. The House bill being debated today
takes the transplant network's side on virtually every point of
dispute. With heavy lobbying under way by both sides, the bill was
expected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue are two questions: How should a nation
accustomed to the finest medical resources divvy up the scarce
number of livers, hearts, kidneys and other organs donated for
transplant? And, equally important, who has final say over what
that policy will be?
</P>
<P>
   The current system relies heavily on geography, with patients
getting the first chance at organs donated locally, even if someone
sicker is just over the arbitrarily drawn border.
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1998, the Department of Health and Human Services
ordered the network to create a new system that directed more of
the donated organs to the sickest patients. Patients are dying
simply because of where they live, HHS argued.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, a liver donated in New Jersey will go
to a relatively healthy patient in another part of the state before
it crosses the Hudson River to save a dying patient in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The network and many transplant centers objected on two fronts:
They didn't want to overhaul their local-first system, which many
centers rely on for a reliable -- albeit inadequate -- supply of
organs. And they didn't want HHS telling them what to do. They
launched an intense lobbying effort, which succeeded in persuading
Congress to keep the regulations in limbo for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the HHS rules finally took effect. As directed, the
transplant network promised to develop a new policy for
distributing livers, the organ that's generated the most
controversy. It already had begun to break down geographic barriers
for the very sickest patients. A new system, they promised, will
continue to broaden the distribution areas. And it will be based on
more objective criteria, meaning the sickest patients will rise to
the top of the waiting list more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   HHS was cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was hopeful news from the Senate. Frist and
Kennedy, who led their respective parties in the highly charged
debate over the patients' bill of rights, came together to look for
common ground on the transplant issue. Their bill, like the one
being debated in the House today, gets at the underlying issue of
who has the power to set policy.
</P>
<P>
   But while the House bill strips HHS of all its authority over
substantive policy issues, the Kennedy-Frist measure seeks a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest issue is whether the HHS secretary should have
final say over what the nation's transplant policy should be. The
Senate bill would force the secretary to share that final say with
an advisory board made up of experts, administration and
congressional officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But first comes today's debate over the House bill. President
Clinton's advisers have threatened a veto, arguing the measure is
unconstitutional because it gives a private body the power to set
federal rules that would be enforceable by law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last month the state of Wisconsin, where patients get
transplants relatively quickly, sued HHS, trying to stop the
regulations in federal court. Louisiana has filed a similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers see no quick end to a battle that has engendered
considerable lobbying on Capitol Hill and bitterness among
transplant centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to believe people are sick of this issue,'' said Dr.
John Lake of the University of Minnesota, president of the American
Society of Transplantation. ''But the factions seem to have their
loins girded and are ready to do battle.''

<HEADLINE> Long Island congressman fuels talk of possible Senate run  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY SHORE, N.Y. (AP) -- Rick Lazio knows there are a lot of
people who love the idea that the U.S. Senate race between Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani is shaping up as a
personality-driven contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think it's fun and entertaining and it sells copy,'' the
Long Island congressman said Monday. ''But it's not good for the
people of New York, and they don't have to live with the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who last summer toyed with the idea of challenging
Giuliani for the GOP nomination, has resurrected the notion that he
may be a better candidate than the New York City mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not trying to be difficult, I am not trying to be
defiant,'' Lazio said at a hastily called press conference at his
district office. ''I am simply trying to be what I think is a good
public servant and good Republican in saying I think we have had a
wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did during a national television appearance on Sunday,
Lazio noted that Giuliani is not likely to receive the backing of
the Conservative Party. No Republican has won statewide office
without Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that Republicans need to join with the Conservative
Party in order to have a winning combination,'' Lazio said. ''I
think the landscape has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had been an active contender for the GOP nomination until
last August, when he yielded to the wishes of Gov. George Pataki
and delayed an official announcement of his candidacy. He said
Monday that he backed off last summer out of respect for the
governor and that if Pataki asked him again not to run, he would
likely agree.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Mike McKeon said Monday that ''the governor
strongly supports Mayor Giuliani and believes he is the best
candidate to defeat Hillary Clinton in November, and he would urge
Congressman Lazio and all Republicans to get behind the mayor's
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had not spoken directly with the governor but
expected that conversation would take place soon. He repeated that
he has no intention of running for the Senate as the Conservative
or any other third-party candidate but would accept Conservative
backing if he won the GOP nod.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has set no timetable for deciding but noted that
Conservative James Buckley didn't enter the U.S. Senate race in
1970 until June and still won. He conceded his campaign warchest is
dwarfed by those of both Clinton and Giuliani, but he didn't think
it would be difficult to ''raise a lot of money quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised $19 million for the race to Clinton's $12
million. Lazio raised about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also said he had no fears that a GOP primary fight might
weaken the winner for a November race against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Primaries aren't inherently bad,'' he said. ''The key to a
good primary, a constructive primary, is to engage on the issues
and for it not to be derogatory; not for us to get down in the
mud.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor seemed unconcerned about a possible primary challenge
during a City Hall press conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last poll I saw we were ahead of the first lady, Mrs.
Clinton, by 3 percent and we were ahead of him by 120 percent, I
think,'' Giuliani said. ''If Congressman Lazio wants to run, he
should.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Prepare for Mir Mission  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- After eight months of orbiting Earth unoccupied,
the Mir is about to have some new tenants -- two cosmonauts who
blasted off Tuesday on a mission to bring the troubled space
station back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri were shot into the sky
aboard a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan,
said Vera Medvedkova, a spokeswoman with the Russian space agency.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation is high over the two-month mission because it comes
after months of doubt about whether the 14-year-old Mir, the pride
of the Russian space program, would remain in orbit or be forced
down in a fiery plunge into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like athletes before a start, we are feeling excitement and a
desire to get on the track as soon as possible,'' Zalyotin said on
Russia's RTR television Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mir's last residents left in August, as the cash-strapped
Russian space program decided that keeping the 130-ton station
aloft didn't make economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mir wasn't taken out of operation immediately,
giving officials time to search for funding. Colorful proposals
came and went, including a plan to send an actor to the Mir to film
scenes for a movie about a renegade cosmonaut.
</P>
<P>
   The government had planned to decommission the Mir around the
end of March, but changed its plans after MirCorp, based in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, agreed to pay $10 million to $20
million to lease commercial rights on the station.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp has said it is considering various ventures aboard the
Mir, including opening it for well-heeled tourists. Under the
agreement, Mir remains Russian-owned and available for Russian
scientific use.
</P>
<P>
   The station has been plagued by a series of glitches, but
officials insist it's in good shape and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mir's computer-controlled orientation system that keeps it
properly aligned with the sun has been successfully activated on
commands from the ground last month and it's fully ready for an
automatic docking,'' Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Once hooked up with the station, the crew will concentrate on
efforts to stop an air leak from the station. Shortly before the
last crew left, officials noticed that the station was slowly
losing oxygen, but said the leak was minor and easy to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   An unmanned cargo ship that docked with the station in February
brought oxygen and other supplies, and the cabin pressure has been
brought to normal, Lyndin said. He added that new equipment has
been made to search for the leak.
</P>
<P>
   During the mission, the crew is also expected to go on a
spacewalk to conduct scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Russian actor Vladimir Steklov -- the would-be ''renegade
cosmonaut'' -- was supposed to travel to Mir along with the crew to
make a movie. But space officials canceled his flight after the
filmmakers failed to fund the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The mission had been originally set to last for 45 days, but
officials extended it to 60 days after the cancellation of
Steklov's mission left more food and water for the crew.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Custody Battle May End  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With new hope that a long-running custody
standoff may be near a conclusion, Cuban diplomats are preparing
for the arrival here of Juan Miguel Gonzalez as negotiators attempt
to work out the details of how he will be reunited with his son
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   During a day of fast-paced developments, the State Department
issued a visa to the elder Gonzalez on Monday as the Justice
Department dropped a threat to revoke Elian's right to remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials raised the possibility that the father may fly to
Miami, where he would see Elian for the first time since the boy
was rescued off the Florida coast more than four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when the senior Gonzalez would arrive in the
United States. Visa requests also were approved for his wife, their
infant son, a male cousin of Elian's, a pediatrician and a
kindergarten teacher. All would initially come to Washington and
remain at the home of Fernando Remirez, Cuba's top diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it was reviewing visa requests from 22
other Cubans, of whom 12 were classmates of Elian. One request was
from Ricardo Alarcon, who is president of the Cuban National
Assembly and a top adviser to President Fidel Castro on U.S.
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had threatened to order Elian's
deportation by today unless his relatives in Miami agreed to accept
the outcome of pending court decision on whether the boy should be
remain in the United States or be reunited with his father in Cuba.
He has been staying at the home of his great uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Wallis, the Immigration Service's director for the
Miami district, said late Monday, ''Revocation of Elian's parole
tomorrow has been superseded by the expected arrival of Juan Miguel
Gonzalez in the United States. Once Mr. Gonzalez comes, the INS
will begin transferring parole care from Lazaro Gonzalez to the
boy's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis added that the transfer of temporary custody ''does not
mean that the child will be immediately removed from the home of
the great uncle. Instead it is our hope to begin a smooth and
orderly process that will create as little disruption as possible
to Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez said Monday night, ''If the father comes or not
we don't know, but he is welcome here. Don't ever doubt the
Gonzalez family has their door open for their family.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sense of conciliation did not extend to some in Miami
who believe it would be a travesty for Elian to be returned to a
communist country.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the great uncle's home, protesters practiced forming a
human chain and vowed they would stop at nothing to keep the boy
from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would have to go over the bodies of all of us Cubans who
are here,'' said Maria Gonzalez, 70, who is not related to the boy.
''They would have to kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters stamped their feet as Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader
of the Miami-based anti-Castro group Democracy Movement, used a
bullhorn to call for Cuban-Americans to come to the home to protect
Elian. The Miami area has nearly 800,000 Cuban-American residents.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush met with safety officials to determine how
to respond to possible unrest if Elian is removed from the Little
Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas' statement last
week that local authorities would not assist the federal government
if it attempted to remove Elian, the county police department said
it is ready to respond to protests.

<HEADLINE> Financial adviser to the stars allegedly made pitch that was all anact  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Manhattan financial adviser counted some of
Hollywood's top young celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and
Ben Affleck, among his clients even as he swindled customers who
trusted him to make safe investments, federal prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case demonstrated that ''no
one is immune from any kind of scheme, securities or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors DiCaprio, Affleck and Matt Damon and singer Alanis
Morrisette were some of the rich and famous clients of Dana
Giacchetto, 37, a New Yorker accused of diverting $20 million from
clients. Prosecutors say the band Phish and its manager may have
lost as much as $5 million to Giacchetto.
</P>
<P>
   The financial adviser also is accused of failing to return at
least $4 million maneuvered through the accounts in his investment
business, The Cassandra Group, which he ran from a loft in the
city's SoHo section.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors brought criminal securities charges against
Giacchetto in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday while the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged him in a civil lawsuit
and obtained a freeze of his assets. They alleged that the
financial security Giacchetto promised his clients was all an act.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal and civil actions threaten Giacchetto's lifestyle,
which has included an increasing share in his clients' spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   An article in April's issue of Vanity Fair noted that Giacchetto
had won the trust of some of Hollywood's biggest stars, such as
Cameron Diaz, Courtney Cox Arquette and R.E.M. singer Michael
Stipe.
</P>
<P>
   And a story published in The New York Times Magazine last May
described an interview in Giacchetto's loft in which he introduced
two large white birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''That one's for Leo,'' he told the writer. ''And that one's
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as Giacchetto's financial world seemed to collapse,
he came across as part of the jet set. His lawyer, Andrew Levander,
told Judge Lawrence McKenna that his client was returning from a
trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Levander said he couldn't comment further because
he had not yet had a chance to read the court papers or talk to his
client.
</P>
<P>
   He said Giacchetto, who was expected back in New York today,
sent a letter to his customers a week ago telling them he was
getting out of the investment business.
</P>
<P>
   As for his client's next move, Levander said to ''stay tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, prosecutors and the SEC said Giacchetto stole
from clients to pay for his apartment, hotels, travel, dining and
entertainment and sometimes lent money to third parties, including
$12,000 to a law enforcement officer for a down payment on a
Mercedes Benz. Giacchetto is also accused of using money belonging
to entertainment's A-list to make unauthorized donations such as
$90,000 to the New York Arts Academy and $5,000 to the New York
Police Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Giacchetto failed to tell clients he was
suffering severe financial difficulties that threatened his ability
to pay them back.
</P>
<P>
   Company literature promised a ''conservative investment
strategy'' focused on large companies, but Giacchetto ''knowingly
or recklessly'' deposited more than $20 million of his clients'
money in bank accounts permitting him to pay the expenses of his
business and himself, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission accused Giacchetto of issuing fake portfolio
statements or other false documents to clients who wanted proof of
their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged Giacchetto with securities fraud,
fraud and making false statements to the SEC. They said in court
papers that he signed an affidavit in December admitting he
misappropriated $3.9 million from Phish and another $968,900 from
accounts held by the band's manager.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Giacchetto faces a maximum of 10 years in prison
and $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from the
crime.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Save Chechen Dictionary  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- A world away from the conflict in the
former Soviet republic of Chechnya, Johanna Nichols is engaged in a
Chechen battle of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, a Slavic languages professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, is racing to compile a Chechen-English
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya became virtually independent in 1996, when Russian
forces withdrew after being fought to a standstill by separatists.
But Moscow sent troops back in last September after Chechen-based
militants invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   War, poverty and chaos have killed many and scattered Chechen
speakers. Said Nichols: ''The language is not going to survive for
long if this continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen and Ingush, which Nichols also studies, are part of a
language family that may go back 8,000 years in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each language has something unique and distinctive to offer.
In addition, the Chechen culture, which is closely bound up with
the language, is interesting and potentially valuable for
humanistic studies,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, social standing in Chechen culture comes from
showing courtesy and respect, rather than wealth -- customs wrapped
in language, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kept the society coherent and strong for centuries,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a Chechen colleague and about a dozen graduate
students, Nichols spends up to several hours each day cataloging
the language.
</P>
<P>
   New computer software helps her sort and store Chechen words.
She also must keep up to date on what's happening to the 1 million
or so people who speak the language.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying desperately to get a lot of information
together,'' she said. ''Dictionary-making is not anything that can
be done in a great rush.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Nichols has collected about 2,000 words. She hopes to
maintain a permanent electronic dictionary that will continue for
some time and publish a smaller version sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols happened upon Chechen 20 years ago while studying in
Russia and ''instantly realized that it was of interest to
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols knows of only three Chechen dictionaries, two in Russian
and Chechen and one small English-Chechen dictionary and phrase
book.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ladefoged, a professor emeritus at UCLA and member of the
endangered languages committee of the Linguistic Society of
America, lauded Nichols' efforts to preserve the Chechen language.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, really, if we want to know what's possible for a
human language we need to study all the languages that there are.
So many of them are just dying very rapidly that unless we study
them now we won't be able to do so,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Used Private School Option  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- As a Republican candidate for president,
George W. Bush wants taxpayer-funded tuition vouchers to give some
parents the option of sending their children to private school. As
a parent, the Texas governor has on occasion used the private
school option -- no vouchers needed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's twin daughters have attended both public and private
schools, and are now seniors at Stephen F. Austin High, a public
school about two miles from the Governor's Mansion near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the oldest tax-supported school in the state of Texas,''
says Tina Juarez, Austin High's principal, adding that the
2,200-member student body is among the city's most diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush's 1994 election as governor, he was managing partner
of the Texas Rangers baseball team. Daughters Jenna and Barbara
attended a public elementary school and then the private Hockaday
School in Dallas, his campaign says.
</P>
<P>
   When he became governor, the girls were in the seventh grade.
They entered the private St. Andrews Episcopal School in Austin,
which mother Laura described as the best choice to ease a
transition that included a new school, a new city and a father who
was the new governor.
</P>
<P>
   One and a half years later, they opted for a public school with
the motto, ''Everybody is somebody at Austin High.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, the school's 2,219
students last year included 1,250 whites, 761 Hispanics, 161
blacks, four Native Americans and 42 Asian or Pacific Islanders.
And 519 qualified as economically disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the whole gamut from the students on the low
socioeconomic level to the very high socioeconomic level,'' Juarez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The public-and-private school path followed by Bush's daughters
also has been used by the children of his likely Democratic
presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore was in the Senate, his four children attended the same
public elementary school in the Washington suburb of Arlington,
Va., that their mother, Tipper, attended as a child.
</P>
<P>
   In their middle-school years, their three daughters transferred
to Washington's National Cathedral School for girls, sister school
to the St. Alban's boys' school where younger brother Albert III
transferred while in elementary school. He is now a junior at
Sidwell Friends School, another private school, which President
Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's daughters are on track to graduate this spring, said Andy
Welch, a spokesman for the Austin Independent School District.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara spent the fall of 1998 studying in Italy before
returning to Austin High, said Scott McClellan, spokesman for
Bush's presidential campaign. She received credit at Austin High
for the foreign study program, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their governor-father, the principal says the girls have
had a typical high school experience. ''They're just like anybody
else,'' Juarez said. ''They don't act differently. They're just
teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, parent George W. has attended school functions. ''He
attended some of our activities and activities where the girls have
been recognized,'' Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   While differing on some key education issues, the Bushes and
Gores share a reluctance to discuss their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores have said such decisions are private. In a recent
campaign debate, Gore stiffened when a moderator asked about
sending his children to private schools while opposing tuition
vouchers to help poor families do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, you can leave them out of this if you want to,'' he
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering public life, the Bushes also have tried to guard
their daughters' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried to shelter the girls. They don't give interviews,
and they don't come to events unless they want to. ... Their life
in Austin has been normal; Laura and I are grateful that the media
has respected their privacy,'' Bush wrote in his 1999
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush failed to convince the Texas Legislature to
support even a pilot program of tuition vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In his bid for the White House, he has proposed removing federal
Title 1 money aimed at poor children from states and school
districts that do not improve student test scores over three years.
The money would go directly to parents in $1,500 vouchers that they
could then use to pay private school tuition, hire a tutor or
attend another public school.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission of this plan is to make sure public schools
improve so kids don't have to change schools,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ''But in cases where they don't, he feels
it's very important for their children to have a choice.''

<HEADLINE> Highway Deaths Down in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans are dying on the nation's
highways.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. highway death toll dipped slightly last year, falling
to 41,375 from 41,471 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing number of people on the roads, that decline
marked a record low death rate of 1.5 fatalities per 100 million
vehicle miles driven, down from 1.6 in 1998, Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the highway death rate was 5.5 per 100 million
vehicle miles in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a decline in the number of alcohol-related
fatalities, which fell to 15,794 from 15,934 in 1998, according to
preliminary estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings from the annual traffic safety report included:
</P>
<P>
   --The number of pedestrians killed dropped 10 percent from 5,220
in 1998 to 4,695 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --Deaths among children under five who were passenger vehicle
occupants dropped slightly from 566 in 1998 to 543 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --There was a slight increase in the number of people injured,
from 3.19 million to 3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Motorcycle crashes killed 2,537 in 1999 compared with 2,284 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fatalities in crashes involving large trucks dropped from
5,374 in 1998 to 5,203 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   -- Speeding-related traffic deaths rose from 12,477 in 1998 to
12,672 in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister in Coma  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was on life support
Tuesday after a stroke, leaving the Japanese government to grapple
with a leadership crisis and the possibility of dissolving the
Cabinet and finding a successor.
</P>
<P>
   There was also growing anger over the delays by the government
in reporting Obuchi's illness to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo News Service reported that Obuchi's situation took a turn
for the worse Tuesday afternoon. Officials refused to confirm that,
but said acting Prime Minister Mikio Aoki left the prime minister's
residence to visit Obuchi at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as Obuchi's wife, daughter and other family members
assembled at the Tokyo hospital where he has been since early
Sunday, Aoki called a Cabinet meeting amid speculation that
politicians were moving quickly to name a successor.
</P>
<P>
   According to media reports, a replacement could be selected as
early as later Tuesday and a new Cabinet could be installed by the
end of the week. Under that scenario, it appeared likely that Aoki
would be able to keep the government together.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports were widespread that Yoshiro Mori, the
secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was the
likely candidate to replace Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Mori and Aoki met Tuesday afternoon, prompting reports that the
Cabinet was likely to resign before the day was over, opening the
way for a new prime minister to be named. Officials refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, 62, was hospitalized early Sunday after complaining of
fatigue. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and Aoki announced on
Monday that Obuchi had suffered a stroke and was in a coma. He was
put on a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Chizuko, and brother were at his side. His daughter,
Yuko, returned from studies in England Tuesday morning to join
them.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's private TBS television network quoted unidentified
doctors late Monday as saying that Obuchi was clinically brain
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office said it could not confirm the
report, and officials at Tokyo's Juntendo University Hospital
refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Aoki apologized Tuesday for government delays in
announcing Obuchi's condition to the public. The government waited
nearly 24 hours to announce that he had been hospitalized and
leaving the public in the dark about the seriousness of his
condition for 12 more hours.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki said an official who provided incorrect information to
media about Obuchi's situation did so because he was so shocked by
the situation that he was ''not thinking straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize,'' Aoki said. ''We will be careful in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki earlier had said that when he visited Obuchi at the
hospital Sunday, and Obuchi verbally requested that he become
acting prime minister, he did not realize how serious Obuchi's
condition was.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Monday, officials still had not disclosed when Obuchi
suffered the stroke or when he fell into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised Obuchi. ''He has been a good friend to
me personally, he's been a good friend of the United States,''
Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The process of selecting a replacement would begin with the
nomination of a new president of the Liberal Democratic Party. The
nominee would then be approved as prime minister by Parliament.
Because the LDP has more seats in Parliament than any other party,
its president is guaranteed the prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers were expected to resist the appointment of
a stopgap prime minister from the ruling coalition ranks. They were
also expected to demand an early election, raising the possibility
of a lower-house election before the G-8 summit of industrialized
nations in July. Japan is to be host of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   National broadcaster NHK television reported that some LDP
leaders would like to see such an election held before the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mori, another name that has come up as a possible
successor is that of Foreign Minister Yohei Kono.
</P>
<P>
   Despite upheaval, officials said they were plowing ahead with
initiatives. Talks planned this week with North Korea were to go
ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Taichi Sakaiya, head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, said
economic policies remained solid. ''It is not possible that
(Obuchi's illness) will have an impact on economic policies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi fell ill after an intense string of days in which a
volcano in northern Japan erupted, forcing the evacuation of
thousands, and his three-party ruling coalition started to
splinter.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998, and surprised many
analysts with his ability to get his policies through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, he jump-started the economy, consolidated his
party's dominant position in parliament and championed legislation
strengthening Japan's regional security role and giving official
status to the Rising Sun flag.
</P>
<P>
   His fortunes had sagged recently, with polls finding that
support for his Cabinet is declining.
</P>
<P>
   Three Japanese prime ministers have died while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, also of the Liberal Democratic
Party, died of a heart attack in 1980. Two prime ministers were
assassinated before World War II: Takashi Hara in 1921 and Tsuyoshi
Inukai in 1932.

<HEADLINE> Change Sought for Flag Code  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strange as it sounds, when a local hero dies
and the U.S. flag on city hall is lowered to half-staff to honor
them, it's almost always a violation of the Federal Flag Code
governing usage and display of Old Glory.
</P>
<P>
   The code, established in 1942, says only presidents and
governors can order U.S. flags lowered to half-staff on public
property. And only the president or Congress can change the code.
</P>
<P>
   The vice mayor of Rocklin, Calif., George Magnuson, who also is
a volunteer firefighter, wants the code amended so local officials
can order U.S. flags lowered in tribute to firefighters, police
officers and other public safety officials killed in the line of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Many local officials ignore the code intentionally or out of
ignorance. And though there are no criminal or civil penalties for
violations, Magnuson believes the ''last act you do for somebody
shouldn't be something that is not a legal act.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I really firmly believe that when somebody dies, helping to
protect fellow citizens, that the citizenry should have the right
to honor them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson learned of the code 17 years ago when he was helping
with funeral arrangements for fellow volunteer firefighter Cliff
Graves, who died battling a house fire. He was troubled by the
code, but didn't start trying to change it until 1991, when he was
elected to the City Council in Rocklin, a Sacramento suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he raised the issue at a National League of Cities
meeting, but got nowhere. League officials said not enough members
expressed an interest in pursuing it.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson now is lobbying Congress and may be making headway.
Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., is considering legislation or a
resolution to allow local officials to lower U.S. flags to honor
public safety officers, said Richard Robinson, Doolittle's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   National police and firefighter groups say no one has ever
approached them about trying to change the code, but that
Magnuson's idea has promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can think of no higher honor'' for slain police officers,
said Craig Floyd, chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers
Memorial Fund, a Washington group that commemorates officers killed
in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   George Burke, spokesman for the International Association of
Fire Fighters, said amending the code to include firefighters
''would be wonderful.'' But, he added, ''it's certainly not a
burning issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Gormalley of the Veterans of Foreign Wars' national
office in Kansas City, Mo., said there is no reason to change the
code because it already calls for flying the flag at half-staff on
Peace Officers Memorial Day each May 15. Gormalley recommends local
officials lower a local flag or fly a black ribbon or drapery below
a fully raised U.S. flag to honor local heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Buss of the American Legion's national office in
Indianapolis says local officials who want to honor slain police
and firefighters can call their governor's office and seek an
official declaration to lower the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson doesn't like those alternatives. Peace Officers
Memorial Day doesn't cover firefighters, he said, and contacting
the governor is inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be an authorized procedure,'' Magnuson said. ''Just
say, 'This is OK, you don't have to worry about it.'''

<HEADLINE> Reports Offer Views of Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two reports are offering widely contrasting
views on the status of Census 2000, which has been the subject of
heavy criticism recently over the types of questions asked on
forms.
</P>
<P>
   A report released from one of the Census Bureau's harshest
critics demands that the statistical agency be dismantled. The
Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation said the bureau should
be replaced by two independent agencies that would ensure a ''fair,
constitutional decennial census count.''
</P>
<P>
   But census officials and supporters said a second report
released Monday, by the Census Monitoring Board, offered proof that
the once-a-decade count was going well in spite of criticism from
citizens and some congressional Republicans that the Census Bureau
was asking too intrusive questions.
</P>
<P>
   After monitoring various census operations, the board's
bipartisan report said that, ''Our observations indicate the
planning for census operations and community relations is generally
proceeding well'' with a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-person board is composed of four members appointed by
President Clinton and four by Republican leaders in Congress. The
two sides rarely release joint reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''The census has seen its share of political controversy. But
for all the debate, we join unanimously to urge every resident of
the United States to complete and return their census forms,'' the
board's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Less enthusiastic was the proposal from Southeastern Legal
Foundation president Matthew Glavin. He was a plaintiff in a case
last year in which the Supreme Court ruled the federal government
cannot use sampled data from the Census Bureau as a basis of
reapportioning House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials favor using the statistical sampling method,
contending it accounts for populations that are traditionally
undercounted, such as inner-city residents.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said the Census Bureau has been burdened by too many
other responsibilities that prevent it from accurately counting the
population. He proposed creating one agency responsible solely for
census operations and another to handle all statistical work for
the government, including collection of the kind of information
currently asked on the Census' 53-question long form.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on news accounts, it seems that his plan would place
more burden on American households with dozens of more extensive
surveys,'' Census spokesman Steve Jost said in dismissing Glavin's
proposal. ''We'd be happy to consider something more substantial,
more thoughtful and more academic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people have overwhelmingly rejected participation
in this year's census because, frankly, they do not trust the
federal government,'' Glavin said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. County Janitors Begin Strike  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands of janitors seeking higher pay went
on strike Monday, a walkout that could affect about 70 percent of
the commercial office space in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts between 18 cleaning contractors and 8,500 janitors
expired Friday night. Both sides said they were so far apart that
further negotiations would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 union members authorized the strike Monday, an
action that could be a precursor to nationwide disruptions as
contracts covering 100,000 janitors expire in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a nationwide movement of the poorest and most
exploited workers,'' said Stephen Lerner, director of the building
services division for the Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Union Local 1877 planned a ''rolling strike'' in which members
walked off their jobs in one downtown building after another, union
representative Blanca Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of the week, the entire county will be impacted,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized janitors make an average of $6.90 an hour and are
demanding a $1-an-hour pay increase each of the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   During a rally following the strike vote, janitors received
support from state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa -- a
candidate for Los Angeles mayor -- and Los Angeles County Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky, who said the janitors' wages amount to ''virtual
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, groups of janitors demonstrated around
downtown, marching, shouting and waving picket signs. The largest
appeared to involve about 60 people. In one instance, television
footage showed police briefly shoving a group of picketers.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters were arrested, however.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors said they doubled their offer Friday. It included
two 40 cents-per-hour boosts in the second and third years. The
union said the majority of members would have had their wages
frozen in the first year, with only downtown and Century City
workers getting a 50-cent raise the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected contract offer represented an 18 percent pay
increase by the third year, said Dick Davis, chief negotiator for
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's double the national average of wage increases,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike will have minimal effect on many buildings because
contractors have hired temporary workers, he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Babylift' Orphans Hold Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- Survivors of a plane crash in
the final days of the Vietnam War were gathering today at the
accident site for a poignant memorial service to mark the 25th
anniversary of one of the conflict's most tragic moments.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six infants were among the 144 people who died during
the start of Operation Babylift, an effort to bring some hope amid
the imminent loss of U.S.-backed South Vietnam to communist forces.
</P>
<P>
   A giant C-5A cargo jet, the largest plane in the world at the
time, sped down the runway of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport
carrying more than 300 children and their caretakers on April 4,
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after takeoff, an explosion blew out the rear doors. The
pilots were able to turn the aircraft around and crash-land two
miles from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Skidding 1,000 feet, the aircraft bounced up again before
hitting a dike and shattering on impact. Virtually everyone in the
bottom cargo compartment was killed -- the majority children younger
than 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, David Shakow thought his adopted son Jeffery, then on
his way to his new family, had been among the fatalities. But
today, father and son are among a group of 38 people -- 15 Operation
Babylift orphans and their relatives -- who have returned to Vietnam
for the first time since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kept hearing that he was dead, then alive, then dead
again,'' Shakow recalled. ''That was a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, 13-month-old Jeffery arrived in the United
States, his eyelashes burned off, his bangs singed and his cheek
and back scarred.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial tour is being led by Sister Mary Nelle Gage, an
organizer of the evacuation. In the final days of the war, more
than 2,000 Vietnamese children were airlifted out of Saigon, now Ho
Chi Minh City, as part of Operation Babylift.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said the tour will help the participants -- including 15
former Vietnamese orphans now in their mid-20s to early 30s -- come
to terms with their past. Many were adopted by American families.
</P>
<P>
   For Shakow, 57, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the trip brought back
memories of the painful days following the crash when Jeffery's
very existence was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just disappeared for a while. There were rumors that he was
in the hospital badly burned,'' Shakow said. ''Then others swore
that he was on the manifest of those killed. The world was falling
apart there, and we couldn't get any information.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Shakow, born Luu Khiet Minh and now 26, survived. His
twin sister did not.
</P>
<P>
   It's a thought that haunts his father today.
</P>
<P>
   David Shakow served in Vietnam from 1965-66. When he and his
wife decided to adopt, Vietnam was a natural choice.
</P>
<P>
   After trying for two years, they finally got word that an infant
from Danang's Sacred Heart orphanage would be theirs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time their son arrived in New York, the Shakows saw an
emaciated, undernourished toddler who couldn't walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had these little, little legs and arms and a big stomach
from the parasites,'' Shakow recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had night terrors for a while, and got up screaming and
shaking. He had been so malnourished he had diarrhea for a month,
but he never complained.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jeffery's arrival, the Shakows discovered from his birth
certificate that he had a twin sister, Luu Le Quyen. Shakow spent
the next 20 years trying to find her.
</P>
<P>
   He finally discovered the two children had been separated at the
orphanage but had ended up on the same disastrous flight. Luu Le
Quyen, he learned from an orphanage official, was listed on the
official manifest as one of the children ''who did not return.''
</P>
<P>
   For both father and son, the return to Vietnam has been
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needed to come back to see this,'' the elder Shakow said.
''You can see pictures of Vietnam all you like, but until you walk
around the streets here, there would be pieces you'd miss.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, now a composed young man, agreed: ''It's good that I
came back. It means a lot to me to be here now.''

<HEADLINE> White House Offers Advice on Saving  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the rate of personal savings at a record
low, the Clinton administration would like to see Americans become
more financially literate -- and in the process become better
savers.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department is teaming up with financial education
groups, banks and others to form a national coalition to help
people sharpen their financial skills and educate them about ways
to save.
</P>
<P>
   Called the National Partners for Financial Empowerment, the
coalition was to be announced by Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers in a speech tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition will create an Internet Web site to provide people
with resources to become financially literate, Summers said in his
prepared remarks. A copy of the text was made available to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   It also will set up national conferences featuring experts to
discuss subjects such as personal financial management, saving for
retirement and ways employers, schools and other institutions can
help educate consumers about their finances.
</P>
<P>
   And, the coalition will launch a national campaign on the
importance of financial literary and saving for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the rate of personal savings, or savings as a
percentage of after-tax income, fell to 0.8 percent, a record low.
That rate isn't as dire as it would seem because it doesn't include
gains realized on savings from such things as rising stock market
values and higher real estate values from homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lifting the rate of savings in our country is both a national
and a personal imperative,'' Summers said in the prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, Summers offers some suggestions: Start saving
early; manage debt as carefully as assets; teach children about
money; and do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a savvy personal consumer takes time,'' Summers said.
''The average American spends several hours per day watching
television. Even a small portion of that time diverted into
managing one's personal finances could yield big dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers also is urging employers to make it as easy as possible
for employees to participate in 401(k) savings plans and to educate
workers on ways to improve managing their finances. And, he is
encouraging schools to bring financial education into their
curricula at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   To promote savings, President Clinton, in his State of the Union
address, proposed setting up retirement savings accounts for
low-income families with the government offering a 2-for-1 match
for the first $100 contributed by each person.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the new coalition include the American Savings
Education Council, the Consumer Federation of America, Chase
Manhattan Bank, Bank of America and Fidelity Investments.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 3, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- In his first opening-day assignment,
Orlando Hernandez was every bit an ace.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque struck out Mo Vaughn three times, Paul O'Neill and
Shane Spencer homered and the two-time defending World Series
champion New York Yankees started the season with a 3-2 victory
over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were coming off a 13-20 spring training that raised
some concern, especially with owner George Steinbrenner. But they
began their bid to become the first team to win three straight
titles since the 1972-74 Oakland Athletics by winning for the first
time in six West Coast openers.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (1-0) worked around eight hits. He walked three and
struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for a save, giving up his first
run since last July 18 on an RBI single by Vaughn. Rivera ended
last season with 28 straight scoreless appearances in the regular
season, a span of 30 2-3 innings. He has converted 23 consecutive
save chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez fanned Vaughn to end three innings -- the first with
nobody on, the third with a man on second, and the fifth with the
bases loaded. With one runner on in the seventh, Hernandez ended
that inning by getting Vaughn to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' right-hander got the Angels' slugger swinging on
all three of his strikeouts, using a variety of pitches that ranged
from a breaking ball that floated in at 67 mph to a slider in the
low 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was 3-0 with a 1.20 ERA in four postseason starts last
year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, coming off a season in which his home run production
dropped to 19 from 24 in 1998, put New York ahead 2-1 with a
two-run shot in the sixth off Ken Hill (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Spencer gave New York a two-run pad when he led off the seventh
with a homer off reliever Kent Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon put the Angels in front with a leadoff homer in the
second. He also homered in last year's opener against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   After Derek Jeter led off the sixth with a single, just the
third hit off Hill, O'Neill hit a 430-foot drive to center.
Notes: Williams, a Gold Glove-winning center fielder, will be used
as the DH until his sore right triceps muscle feels better, manager
Joe Torre said. ''It isn't the type of thing that's going to get
worse, but I don't want him in a situation where he is going to
have to throw somebody out,'' Torre said. ... New York seemed to
have about the same number of fans in the sellout crowd of 42,704
as the Angels, with the visitors receiving as much applause in the
pregame introductions as the home team did. ... Beginning their
40th season, the Angels announced their all-time team as chosen by
fans voting on the club's web site. The team included Jim Fregosi
as both manager and shortstop; infielders Rod Carew, Bobby Grich
and Doug DeCinces; outfielders Brian Downing, Jim Edmonds and
Reggie Jackson, with Don Baylor the DH. The starting pitchers were
Nolan Ryan, Mike Witt, Frank Tanana and Chuck Finley. Troy
Percival, the current Anaheim closer, was voted the relief pitcher.
... Anaheim was one of only three teams to win its season series
with the Yankees last year. Boston and Kansas City also did it. ...
The Yankees' $92.5 million opening-day payroll was tops in the
majors, $4.4 million higher than the No. 2 team, Los Angeles.

Judge: Microsoft Violated Antitrust Laws
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is vowing to fight a federal
court decision that his company violated U.S. antitrust laws by mounting a
''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet browser market. The ruling
could lead to drastic punishment, including the breakup of one of the world's
major corporations. ''Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of
competitive fortune, thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance,''
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote in a sweeping decision that
said Microsoft violated the Sherman Act, the same law used to break up
monopolies from Standard Oil to AT&AMP;T.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- After eight months of orbiting Earth unoccupied, the Mir is
about to have some new tenants -- two cosmonauts who blasted off Tuesday on a
mission to bring the troubled space station back to life. Sergei Zalyotin and
Alexander Kaleri were shot into the sky aboard a Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakstan, said Vera Medvedkova, a spokeswoman with the Russian
space agency. Anticipation is high over the two-month mission because it comes
after months of doubt about whether the 14-year-old Mir, the pride of the
Russian space program, would remain in orbit or be forced down in a fiery plunge

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. 89, Florida 76  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mateen Cleaves was quite a sight.
</P>
<P>
   He needed crutches so he could stand and some help from his dad
with the championship trophy. One of the nets was wrapped around
his neck and tears rolled down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I came back here for,'' he said Monday night
after leading Michigan State to its second national championship
with an 89-76 victory over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought Cleaves would be playing in the NBA this season.
Instead, he led the Spartans to their first title since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressive in the first half, breaking Florida's press as
Michigan State built a 43-32 lead. In the second half, he was their
limping leader after rolling his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is as storybook as it gets for Mateen,'' Michigan State
coach Tom Izzo said. ''He gave up a lot of money, a lot of things
to be back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's first title was memorable because of Magic. Its
second will be remembered because of Mateen.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21 years ago that the championship game between Michigan
State and Indiana State -- Magic vs. Bird -- changed the landscape of
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This one may not have had the magnitude, but it had the drama
thanks to Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has the heart of a lion. He has done it for four years, not
just one,'' Izzo said. ''That's why you love him. He's what our
program embodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson watched the victory from the stands of the RCA Dome and
was on the court to celebrate with the current Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew they were going to win, especially when Mateen came
back this year,'' he said. ''It's been tough waiting these 21
years. But they've been great the last couple of years, and I knew
they were going to win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, the Final Four's most outstanding player, rolled his
ankle early in the second half and had to go to the locker room to
have it taped. He had helped the Spartans build the 11-point
halftime lead by scoring 13 points, including going 3-for-3 from
3-point range, and negated Florida's vaunted full-court pressure
with his ballhandling and passing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them he'll be back. Let's not get our heads down,''
Izzo said. ''I just knew.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the trainer they'd have to amputate it to keep me out
of this one,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   When he left with 16:18 to play the Spartans led 50-44. His
teammates got the lead to 58-50 by the time he returned 4:29 later.
But the senior guard who missed the first 13 games of the season
while recovering from a stress fracture in his right foot, was
again the team's emotional leader.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' long pass to Morris Peterson for a layup made it 60-50.
He was leveled while setting a screen a few minutes later, but it
was enough to spring A.J. Granger for a 3-pointer that started a
16-6 run that made it 84-66 and put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mateen Cleaves is a great point guard. He showed it tonight,''
Florida's Mike Miller said. ''Senior leader, been through a lot of
things. I think he did a good job of running his team and he
knocked down shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State had been on a mission since losing to Duke in the
Final Four last season. Anything short of a national championship
would have been a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made some promises. We answered the promises,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves certainly didn't beat Florida by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson finished with 21 points on 7-for-14 shooting and
Granger had 19 and was 7-for-11 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves was 7-for-11 from the field -- all the shots coming
before he was injured -- and had 18 points and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (32-7), the only top-seeded team to reach the Final
Four, finished 33-for-59 from the field (56 percent), the best
against Florida's frantic pace by far in the tournament. The
previous best was 43 percent by top-ranked Duke in the regional
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State never seemed fazed by the pressure, beating it
early with long passes. The Spartans were their usual efficient
selves when they did run their halfcourt game, getting good looks
and crashing the boards when they missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we attacked the press well and passed off very well,''
Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Billy Donovan said his team's style was a gamble
against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ''We watched a lot of tape. I did not see one team press them
all year long,'' he said. ''Probably, obviously, for a good reason
teams didn't press them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan State bench was considered a key to any chance the
Spartans had. Florida's reserves had outscored it 175-45 in the
tournament, but Jason Richardson had nine points as the Spartans'
backups came up big.
</P>
<P>
   Udonis Haslem had a season-high 27 points for the fifth-seeded
Gators (29-9), while Brent Wright added 13 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great season. You hate it to end like this,''
Haslem said. ''If we look back on all the good times we
accomplished a lot. We came together as a family and made this run
to the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 final is still the highest-rated telecast of an NCAA
basketball game -- the one that hooked the nation on the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which beat Wisconsin 53-41 in an ugly all-Big
Ten national semifinal, won all six games on its title run by at
least 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans closed the season with 11 straight wins and are the
first Big Ten team to win it all since Michigan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, looking to become the fourth straight Southeastern
Conference team to win the national championship in an
even-numbered year, was making its first appearance in a
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators had seven freshmen and sophomores in their 10-man
rotation and this was the first game in the tournament that their
lack of experience showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not too many freshmen get to play in a national championship
game,'' said Kenyan Weaks, Florida's only senior. ''This is a great
experience for them. I hope they learn from it. Hopefully, they can
be back here next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves had two 3-pointers in the 14-3 run that gave the
Spartans a 33-20 lead with 6:51 to play, but a three-point play by
Haslem and a basket by Donnell Harvey got the Gators within 35-29
with 4:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Bell and Cleaves sandwiched 3s around a layup by Haslem
and the Spartans had a 43-32 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Peterson Stars in NCAA Title Game  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The last 20 minutes belong to Morris
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson scored 15 of his team-high 21 points in the second half
Monday night, leading Michigan State to the national championship
over Florida. It was the continuation of a trend for the fifth-year
senior, who dedicated the Final Four to his grandmother after she
died March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 105 points Peterson scored in the NCAA tournament, 75
came after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Izzo was asked about the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why he doesn't do it in the first half, I don't know,'' he
said. ''The good part is I don't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson played these games with a heavy heart, after Clara Mae
Spencer died last month. The Michigan State senior flew to
Mississippi for her funeral, then returned for the Final Four. He
wrote her name on his sneakers, a private memorial.
</P>
<P>
   When he climbed the ladder to cut his share of the net Monday
night, he held up a sign. It said: ''This one's for Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson scored 20 points in the semifinal against Wisconsin and
then another 21 in the 89-76 win over Florida. He also had two
rebounds, five assists and a steal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know she is with me on the court,'' he said over the weekend
about his late grandmother. ''I can feel her presence.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mateen Cleaves turned his ankle in the second half, it was
a turning point in the game for Michigan State. Peterson had three
personal fouls and had to sit for a while. But the Spartans weren't
folding.
</P>
<P>
   When Peterson returned, he scored six straight points -- a
stretch that began with a layup and ended with a 3-pointer -- as
Michigan State stayed on top.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he went out, everybody got angry,'' Peterson said of
Cleaves' injury. ''All the guys stepped up and made big plays. We
have a bunch who stepped up all year.''
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, the Spartans hugged two prominent Michigan State
alumni -- Magic Johnson and Steve Smith. ''They were the best ever
to play at Michigan State,'' Peterson said. ''They watched over us,
supported us. They mean a lot to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's performance capped a big NCAA tournament for
Peterson, who came back for this game, this night, this national
championship. He was a huge presence in the Midwest Regional,
scoring 21 points against Syracuse, 18 against Iowa State and
helping Michigan State dominate the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Then came his grandmother's funeral and his emotional return.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was one of Michigan State's trio of Flintstones. He
grew up with Charlie Bell and Cleaves in the industrial city of
Flint, playing on concrete courts and becoming buddies with the
other two. Together, they went to East Lansing, determined to win a
title.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Peterson helped Michigan State to the Final Four,
but the Spartans lost to Duke in the semifinals. He could have left
after that, but stayed for one more shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a matter of wanting to be around the Spartan family,''
he said. ''These guys are like brothers to me. We come from a
background where education is important. There was never any doubt.
We talked about winning a national championship together.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what they did.

<HEADLINE> Promise Made, Promise Kept  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The national championship was theirs for the
taking, but in the time it takes to roll an ankle, it was almost
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Tom Izzo turned up on Mateen Cleaves' doorstep,
a struggling coach desperately pursuing his first big recruit. This
was in Flint, Mich., a gritty, gray town where the future rarely
extends beyond the end of an assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo promised Cleaves he was going to build a program to rival
the Dukes, Kentuckys and North Carolinas of the college basketball
world. He could have told him stories about Magic Johnson and shown
Cleaves the faded national championship banner hanging in the gym
from 1979, but that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo didn't have the players those other programs had, he didn't
have the blue-chip recruits, either -- all he had to sell Cleaves
was a promise. And himself.
</P>
<P>
   On a Monday night four years later, all of it was about to come
true. Michigan State was rolling over Florida in the championship
game, knocking down shots, winning the loose balls, breaking the
Gators' vaunted jaws -- their full-court press -- at will. And in the
middle of it all was Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   There were slightly more than 16 minutes left to play when he
tried to finish off a drive to the basket, dueling every step with
Florida's Teddy Dupay. They swapped shoves, chest bumps, elbows and
then got their feet tangled. As Cleaves planted his right foot, his
weight moved to the outside edge of his sneaker and the full weight
of his body rolled over it.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, Frances Cleaves' heart leapt into her throat. ''I
know he's strong and I knew his resolve was going to make him come
back if he could,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's lead, as big as 13 points, had shrunk to 50-44.
Momentum was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Izzo made a promise to the team, ''He'll be back.
Let's not get our heads down.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach can explain all kinds of things, but how he knew
Cleaves would return is not one of them. Izzo and his star share
many traits -- toughness, instincts, courage and a way of seeing the
floor. But ultimately, this came down to a feeling in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy has the heart of a lion,'' Izzo said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It was as close to a medical opinion as he was prepared to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has worked for this for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the other thing that drew them close -- a commitment
to see this through together. After the Spartans reached the
semifinal last season, Cleaves could have left Michigan State,
cashed in his chips and taken his chances in the NBA. The same was
true for Morris Peterson, the Spartans' slender scoring machine and
another alum of Flint's tough playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   But every time they looked over at Izzo, what stuck out in their
minds were the sacrifices already made, not the rewards that lay
ahead. Their resolve was tested even before the season began, when
a broken right foot sidelined Cleaves for 13 games. Izzo had to
find someone else he could trust to run the team on the floor and
Peterson struggled to become more of a leader. But it must have
been toughest for Cleaves, stuck on the sideline and watching
helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was a distant memory as Cleaves sat in the locker room
Monday night watching the trainer tape his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going to start crying, 'Oh no, not now, I really want to
play, win this game,'' he said. ''They were going to have to
amputate my leg to keep me out of this one.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, meanwhile, a whole other dynamic was at work. Izzo
was yelling at Dupay and the guys Cleaves had carried through the
early going started looking out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'We have a war on our hands. Somebody's got to step up
right now,' '' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   The first somebody turned out to be Mike Chappell, a
Detroit-area kid who chose Duke out of high school, but transferred
to Michigan State and sat out a season to be part of the team. He
scored five points in the run that carried the Spartans to a 58-50
lead by the time Cleaves hobbled back out of the tunnel and toward
the bench at the 12-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Spartans' intensity level soared, as if somebody
had cranked the dimmer on a light switch. Peterson started popping
up on both wings, throwing in jumpers. Cleaves, who scored early,
turned provider late. An eight-point advantage swelled to 15, then
20, and finally to put the game beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end, the first coach and player to take Michigan
State to a national title came back to the court to celebrate: Jud
Heathcote, who took a flyer on Izzo; Magic Johnson, who helped
inspire Cleaves' dream to win another.
</P>
<P>
   ''Four years ago, we made some promises,'' Izzo said. ''Now
we've answered them.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 3, Predators 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jorgen Jonsson scored the go-ahead goal,
his first score in 22-games, as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the
Nashville Predators 3-1 Monday night and stayed in the thick of the
Western Conference playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rucchin connected on a first-period power play and Kip
Miller also scored for the Ducks, still three points behind San
Jose with three games remaining. The Sharks, holding on to the
eighth and final playoff spot, beat Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Ronning scored for the Predators, 0-3 this season against
Anaheim. The teams play again Friday at Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson intercepted a clearing pass by Nashville defenseman
Craig Millar along the right boards and quickly unleashed a wrist
shot that beat Mike Dunham to the far side as the goalie fanned on
it with his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson's goal with 1:34 left in the second period was his 12th
of the season and first in 10 games with the Ducks. He was acquired
from the New York Islanders on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made it 3-1 at 1:50 of the third, taking a pass in the
left circle from Jonsson and beating Dunham to the short side for
his 10th goal and sixth in 26 games since joining Anaheim in a
trade from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who were without power-play specialist Fredrik
Olausson because of the flu, opened the scoring with the
man-advantage at 1:40 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin one-timed Teemu Selanne's centering pass from 10 feet
away, beating Dunham low to the stick side for his 17th goal -- and
10th by Anaheim's power play in 39 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators, looking to play the spoiler role for the second
straight game after hurting Vancouver's playoff chances last
Friday, tied it at 8:10 of the second when Ronning beat Guy Hebert
under the pads from the base of the right circle. Hebert made 16
saves.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville defenseman Richard Linter, who took a jarring check
from Mike Leclerc in the first period, left the game with 14:34
left in the second with an injured shoulder after Ducks defenseman
Ruslan Salei rode him into the boards and was called for
interference.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators, who will eclipse the 300 mark in man-games lost
for the second straight season on Wednesday night at Phoenix, also
lost defenseman Alexandre Boikov in the first period with a
separated right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Spartans Shakes Off Cleaves' Injury  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mateen Cleaves crawled along the baseline,
his tightly clenched face a window to the excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan State star surely wondered if his right foot was
broken again, the injury that kept him out for the first 13 games
of the season. He was expendable then, but not now. Not in the NCAA
championship game against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would have had to amputate my leg to get me off the
court, baby,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   Amputation wasn't necessary. But he did have a severe sprain
after rolling his right foot on a drive to the basket with 16:18
remaining Monday night. He managed to pull himself up and hobble to
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't done -- and neither were his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   While the trainer furiously taped the ankle outside public
scrutiny, Michigan State stretched a tenuous 50-44 lead to 58-50 by
the time Cleaves limped back on the court 4:29 later.
</P>
<P>
   His long pass to Morris Peterson for a layup made it 60-50.
Cleaves was leveled while setting a screen a few minutes later, but
it was enough to spring A.J. Granger for a 3-pointer that started a
16-6 run, made it 84-66 and put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds ticked away on Michigan State's 89-76
victory, Cleaves could barely make it up and down the court. But he
smiled broadly and jogged in place for his mother, showing her that
nothing could break his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's strong, and I knew his resolve was going to make
him come back if he could,'' Frances Cleaves said. ''I knew if
there was any way possible for him to come back, he would, because
that's the kind of kid he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son scored 13 points in the first half and helped the
Spartans continually beat the feared Florida pressure with his ball
handling. He had 18 points when the injury occurred and wouldn't
score another, but the rest of the Spartans seemed inspired by his
Willis Reed-like return to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy has the heart of a lion,'' coach Tom Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves got tangled up with Florida's Teddy Dupay while driving
to the basket and landed wrong on his right foot after putting up
the shot. The whistle already had blown for a foul behind the play,
but neither Cleaves nor Dupay could hear the call.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I hurt it real bad,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan State fans booed Dupay, clearly believing he was
trying to hurt their star. No way, said Dupay.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a big, physical guy,'' the Florida guard said. ''He's not
going to back down and I'm not going to back down. But I wasn't
trying to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Head trainer Tom Mackowiak -- ''T-Mac'' to the players -- sprung
into action as soon as Cleaves went down. He knew what to do after
working with Cleaves during the rehab from his broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gets emotional,'' Mackowiak said. ''I wanted to let him
settle down. I knew there was nothing we could do on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Izzo told the remaining players, ''He'll be
back. Let's not get our heads down.'' He switched Charlie Bell to
the point and the team didn't miss a step.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put the team on my shoulders,'' Bell said. ''For half the
year, I ran the team when Mateen was injured. ... We had adversity
all year and tonight was no different. We are a team and that is
why we're still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a hobble.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the locker room, Mackowiak found no signs of serious
injury. He wrapped Cleaves in tape from foot to the mid-calf, then
had him test out the ankle in the empty room.
</P>
<P>
   Running. Cutting. Backpedaling. Jumping. Cleaves passed the
impromptu test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew if he could do all that, he could go back to the
court,'' Mackowiak said. ''I understand what this meant to him.
He's very strong and he has a very strong tolerance for pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves returned to the bench on his heavily taped ankle and
told Izzo, ''I'm OK.'' He went back in the game with 11:51
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I wanted to do was leave it on the floor,'' said Cleaves,
a second-team All-American who returned for his senior season for
this very moment. ''Tonight, we left it on the floor and it was
good enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cleaves hobbled out of the raucous locker room with
crutches and a championship, Mackowiak was alone in a back cubicle,
gathering up his leftover rolls of tape.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just doing my job,'' T-Mac said with a shrug.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 7, Athletics 4  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Hideo Nomo won his American League debut
with seven strong innings, and the Detroit Tigers opened by beating
the Athletics 7-4 Monday night before the largest baseball crowd
ever at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer went 4-for-5 with a homer and two RBIs and Deivi
Cruz went 3-for-4 with a walk and two runs scored to help make Phil
Garner a winner in his debut as Tigers manager.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time AL MVP Juan Gonzalez, acquired from Texas in a
nine-player trade, went 0-for-4 with a walk and two strikeouts in
his Detroit debut.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 53,498 saw Jason Giambi homer twice and Matt Stairs
and Frank Menechino hit one each -- Oakland's only hits and all solo
shots. The attendance eclipsed the previous Oakland Coliseum high
of 51,263 for an interleague game against the San Francisco Giants
last July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier, making his eighth career opening day start but
first with Oakland, held Detroit's No. 4 hitter (Gonzalez) and No.
5 hitter (Tony Clark) hitless in eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Appier allowed six runs -- just three earned because of two
errors -- and eight hits in six innings. He struck out seven but
walked four, including one with the bases loaded, and hit a batter.
He was trying to become the first Oakland starter to win on opening
day since Bob Welch beat Detroit in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, released twice last season before catching on with
Milwaukee and winning 12 games to revive his career, allowed three
runs and three hits. He struck out eight and walked three to win
his first U.S. opening day start; he pitched four openers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi homered in the first, and Nomo didn't give up another hit
until Stairs' one-out solo homer in the fourth, which pulled
Oakland to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 2-1, Detroit added four runs in the fourth, taking
advantage of Appier's control problems and a fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Encarnacion singled with two outs and Cruz followed with a
double. Luis Polonia was walked intentionally to load the bases and
set up the force, but the plan went awry when Appier walked Brad
Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson's pop fly behind second base then fell for a
three-base error when it glanced off the glove of center fielder
Rich Becker, whose attempt to make a running catch appeared impeded
by backpedaling second baseman Menechino.
</P>
<P>
   Menechino, starting in place of injured Randy Velarde, got one
run back for Oakland when he hit his first big league home run off
Nomo in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi hit his second homer of the night in the eighth off Doug
Brocail. Todd Jones finished with a perfect ninth for the save.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer led off the second with a homer and Luis Polonia added an
RBI single. Palmer had an RBI single in the eighth.

<P>
Notes: Appier became the eighth opening day starter for Oakland in
as many years. Nomo was the sixth opening day starter in six years
for the Tigers. ... The Tigers last opened the season in Oakland in
1993, when they lost to the A's 9-4. ... Both the Tigers and the
A's began their 100th seasons. ... Oakland started the season
without 2B Randy Velarde (left knee strain) and reliever Doug Jones
(lower back strain). Both are on the 15-day disabled list. ...
Detroit is without pitchers Seth Greisinger (right elbow surgery)
and Sean Runyan. Greisinger is on the 60-day disabled list while
Runyan is on the 15-day DL. ... Palmer has hit 20 of his 236 career
home runs against Oakland. His four hits matched a career high. ...
Giambi now has nine multihomer games. He has 18 homers against
Detroit, the most of any team.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 2, Kings 1  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix sparkplug Jeremy Roenick set up the
go-ahead goal with a spectacular assist, and the Coyotes defeated
the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 Monday night to clinch a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, knocked headfirst into the boards seconds earlier,
found the loose puck in front of him when he got up, and flicked it
to Trevor Letowski, who scored Phoenix's second goal 8:54 into the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes reached 87 points -- enough to secure a spot in the
postseason for the fifth consecutive season -- and pulled within two
points of the Kings for fifth place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' Glen Murray scored the first goal of the game, and
Dallas Drake tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Burke needed to make just 21 saves for his third victory in
four games. But he had nine crucial stops in the third period, when
Los Angeles was pressing to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr had 32 saves for the Kings, who lost for the first
time in six games (3-1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, a battler who leads the Coyotes in everything but
penalty minutes, where he is second, got his 42nd assist with a
signature move.
</P>
<P>
   Checked from behind by Aki Berg, Roenick stayed down until he
saw the puck roll ahead of him. As he was getting up, he wristed it
to Letowski in the slot, and the rookie scored his 19th goal with a
one-timer over Storrs' shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes improved to 14-4-0-1 when Letowski scores.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had two early power plays, and Storr stopped seven shots
in a 3:27 stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes took 18 shots in the first period -- two below their
season high for a period -- but Storr was solid.
</P>
<P>
   Burke also was perfect against 10 shots in the first, but Murray
scored on Los Angeles' 11th shot 4:16 into the second.
</P>
<P>
   He led Stumpel into the Phoenix end, took the pass and fired
from the circle. Burke tried a kick save to his left, but Murray
went to the far side and got his 28th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes finally solved Storr with 9:30 left in the second
period when Benoit Hogue led Drake to just outside the crease, and
the assistant captain found the net with a low wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix won the season series from Los Angeles 4-2.

<HEADLINE> Nationl Zoo Raises $8M for Pandas  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Completion of a major addition to the Air and
Space Museum is one of the projects the new head of the Smithsonian
Institution has in mind for $1 billion he is trying to raise in
donations. Most of an estimated $8 million needed to bring a pair
of pandas to the National Zoo has already been raised, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Small said the $1 billion also will pay for
completion of the new Museum of American Indian and refurbishing of
the old Patent Office which houses the Museum of American Art and
the National Portrait Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, it's not so much a matter of setting goals
and collecting smaller contributions, but of waiting for the big
donations that have become more common in recent years -- tens and
even hundreds of millions at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Small said Monday in an interview with reporters and
editors of the Associated Press that China in the future likely
will rent pandas to foreign countries, not loan them or give them
away like Hsing-Hsing, a gift to America after President Nixon's
visit to China in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would probably cost an estimated $8 million to rent a
new pair of pandas from China for 10 years. Any offspring, he said,
could be kept though they would still belong to the Chinese
government. But he said he believed it would take protracted
negotiations to work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a team over there now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, panda lovers concerned about the remains of the
zoo's last giant panda, Hsing-Hsing, who died in November, can also
relax. His remains will not be stuffed for display.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many people who care,'' Small said. ''They felt
the panda was part of their lives. To say you were going to display
it was just not a smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Small was especially enthusiastic about prospects for the
addition to the Air and Space Museum -- the world's most visited --
due to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have what I think will probably be the most spectacular
museum interior in the history of the world,'' he said. ''We have a
176{ acre site. ... This is going to be two-and-a-half football
fields long, and 10 stories high. It's going to have 178 airplanes
inside the one room.''
</P>
<P>
   Small also sees great significance in the American Indian
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a museum that's been developed with the total support of
hundreds of American Indian tribes and it will give the nation ...
a place of reconcilement for an issue that's been a troubling one
in American history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over the Smithsonian's 16 museums and zoo in
January, Small has been working to spread more of the 141 million
objects it owns to affiliates all over the 50 states. Only about 2
percent of the objects are now on display, and almost all those in
Washington. Many have never been seen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, there are 25 suits of Samurai armor than
American ships brought back when they opened Japan to trade before
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Museums are hot,'' he said. ''Culture is hot. People want more
than just entertainment. They want to have enriched experiences,
and they're getting used to have (private) enterprise go after that
and improve their experiences. So you go to Starbucks for coffee
and you pay 10 times more for coffee than you might have done 15
years ago, but you want to be in an environment that stimulates
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that there are 8,500 to 10,000 museums of all kinds
in the United States, and only 29 affiliated with the Smithsonian.
The affiliates can enrich their own collections with supplements
from Washington, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you went to Bisbee, Arizona, for instance, they have a
museum of mining,'' he said. ''They had everything but the kind of
ore that came out of the mines. Their mines were totally played
out, so they had mining equipment. We sent them the ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Small pointed out that the Northeast is not an area of growing
population. The West and Southwest are.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the things can't be seen by the American public, what good
are they?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said museums in the rest of the country are eager to display
the authentic materials that the Smithsonian has.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't just invent something of George Washington's or
Thomas Jefferson's,'' he said, ''you either have it or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But he believes borrowing museums should not be ''little
Smithsonians.'' The Smithsonian museums have been largely financed
by taxpayers' money and he wants admission to remain free, but
others have different degrees of public and private ownership and
the Smithsonian does not want to dictate what their charges should
be.

<HEADLINE> Census Count Comes to Prisons  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- In the U.S. Census, even prisoners matter.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates at Williard-Cybulski Correction Institution -- one of 20
Connecticut prisons housing 17,000 inmates -- were awakened early
Monday to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got woken up at 7:30 this morning. Everybody thought we
were getting shut down,'' said a Connecticut inmate named Dwight.
Prison officials allowed inmates to be identified by first names
only.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the census of prisoners began Saturday and will
continue through May 6.
</P>
<P>
   The census affects government funding for different programs and
the number of seats states receive in the U.S. House of
Representatives. It also can influence decisions such as where to
locate a veterans' hospital or additional prisons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Data collection is starting this week in Pennsylvania, Maryland
and surrounding areas, said Nunzio Cerniglia, assistant regional
census manager. Census workers have not objected to going in
prisons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're indoors in this case,'' Cerniglia said. ''You have a
controlled environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states rely on prison administrative records rather than an
actual inmate count, said Bart Eaton, area manager in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Connecticut inmates refused to fill out the form
Monday, Department of Correction spokeswoman Heather Zimba said.
Federal law imposes a $100 penalty for refusing to cooperate, but
violations are seldom prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafeteria of Williard-Cybulski, census officials brought
forms in 37 languages, from Arabic to Yiddish. Spanish was a common
request. A counselor, interpreter and other staff were present.
</P>
<P>
   Most prisoners filled out a short form seeking basic information
such as name, age, race and date of birth. Like the general
population, one in six prisoners was given a long form seeking
additional information such as whether the person is a veteran and
if they worked last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned the need for a formal census, since they are
already counted several times daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know where we're at,'' said Jamaal, a 23-year-old
prisoner from Hartford. ''Everything we filled out in that form
they already knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoners objected to questions about income and race.
Dwight had a problem with a question asking whether he stays at his
residence most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not staying here,'' he said. ''I've been in and out of
here a couple of times, but I don't intend to make a habit of it.''

<HEADLINE> Financial adviser to the stars allegedly made pitch that was all anact  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Manhattan financial adviser counted some of
Hollywood's top young celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and
Ben Affleck, among his clients even as he swindled customers who
trusted him to make safe investments, federal prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case demonstrated that ''no
one is immune from any kind of scheme, securities or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors DiCaprio, Affleck and Matt Damon and singer Alanis
Morrisette were some of the rich and famous clients of Dana
Giacchetto, 37, a New Yorker accused of diverting $20 million from
clients and illegally pocketing more than $6 million. Prosecutors
say the alternative rock band Phish and its manager may have lost
as much as $5 million to Giacchetto.
</P>
<P>
   The financial adviser also is accused of failing to return at
least $4 million maneuvered through the accounts in his investment
business, The Cassandra Group, which he ran from a loft in the
city's SoHo section.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors brought criminal securities charges against
Giacchetto in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday while the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged him in a civil lawsuit
and obtained a freeze of his assets. They alleged that the
financial security Giacchetto promised his clients was all an act.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal and civil actions threaten Giacchetto's lifestyle,
which has included an increasing share in his clients' spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   An article in April's issue of Vanity Fair noted that Giacchetto
had won the trust of some of Hollywood's biggest stars, such as
Cameron Diaz, Courtney Cox Arquette and R.E.M. singer Michael
Stipe.
</P>
<P>
   And a story published in The New York Times Magazine last May
described an interview in Giacchetto's loft in which he introduced
two large white birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''That one's for Leo,'' he told the writer. ''And that one's
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as Giacchetto's financial world seemed to collapse,
he came across as part of the jet set. His lawyer, Andrew Levander,
told Judge Lawrence McKenna that his client was returning from a
trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Levander said he couldn't comment further because
he had not yet had a chance to read the court papers or talk to his
client.
</P>
<P>
   He said Giacchetto, who was expected back in New York today,
sent a letter to his customers a week ago telling them he was
getting out of the investment business.
</P>
<P>
   As for his client's next move, Levander said to ''stay tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, prosecutors and the SEC said Giacchetto stole
from clients to pay for his apartment, hotels, travel, dining and
entertainment and sometimes lent money to third parties, including
$12,000 to a law enforcement officer for a down payment on a
Mercedes Benz. Giacchetto is also accused of using money belonging
to entertainment's A-list to make unauthorized donations such as
$90,000 to the New York Arts Academy and $5,000 to the New York
Police Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, Giacchetto failed to tell clients he was
suffering severe financial difficulties that threatened his ability
to pay them back.
</P>
<P>
   Company literature promised a ''conservative investment
strategy'' focused on large companies, but Giacchetto ''knowingly
or recklessly'' deposited more than $20 million of his clients'
money in bank accounts permitting him to pay the expenses of his
business and himself, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission accused Giacchetto of issuing fake portfolio
statements or other false documents to clients who wanted proof of
their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged Giacchetto with securities fraud,
fraud and making false statements to the SEC. They said in court
papers that he signed an affidavit in December admitting he
misappropriated $3.9 million from Phish and another $968,900 from
accounts held by the band's manager.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Giacchetto faces a maximum of 10 years in prison
and $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss resulting from the
crime.

<HEADLINE> Army Colonel To Plead Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Army colonel once in charge of the U.S.
military's anti-drug efforts in Colombia has been charged with
covering up the money laundering activities of his wife, who has
pleaded guilty to drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written Monday to a New York federal judge,
prosecutors revealed that Col. James Hiett is charged with ignoring
a felony committed by Laurie Hiett. The charge carries a maximum
sentence of three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett, 36, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in
January, saying she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth of
drugs to New York City. She also admitted traveling to New York to
collect the illicit proceeds to take back to Colombia -- an act
falling under the legal definition of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she told reporters she purposely kept her husband
in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, he may have asked me why I was going to New
York,'' she said. ''I just told him, 'Don't ask me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported today that Hiett will plead guilty
to the charge on April 17. The newspaper, citing unidentified
sources, said Hiett's wife implicated him, and that he confessed in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett, 48, was the U.S. military group commander at the U.S.
Embassy in Bogota. In that job, he was in charge of all U.S.
military activities in Colombia, including counterdrug operations.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Harvey Perritt said Hiett, a 24-year veteran,
remains on active duty at Fort Monroe, Va., where he was
transferred after allegations arose against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett has admitted that his wife gave him up to $45,000, which
he stored in his apartment and embassy office safe, the Post
reported. Upon his wife's arrest last year, he came to the United
States, where he reportedly deposited the money in banks in small
amounts to avoid scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customs agents have suspected for some time that U.S. Army
Col. James Hiett had knowledge of his wife's actions and may have
even had some complicity,'' U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly
said in a statement released Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett's attorney, Abraham Clott, did not return a telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in
Panama had cleared Hiett, saying he had ''no prior knowledge'' of
his wife's crimes. Brooklyn prosecutors, meanwhile, had insisted
their investigation was not over.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett, an admitted cocaine addict, surrendered to
authorities last August after they intercepted two packages of
heroin that she allegedly mailed to New York from a post office at
the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   One of her co-defendants, Hernan Arcila, 54, pleaded guilty on
Jan. 5 to drug conspiracy, admitting that he accepted shipments
from Colombia at his Queens address.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea, Mrs. Hiett told a federal magistrate she
shipped six packages from Bogota to New York City, believing they
contained cocaine. Tests on the two seized shipments revealed they
were heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett is free on bond. She faces up to nine years in prison
at sentencing April 28.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Return to Me'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Return to Me'' is a movie with its heart in the right place.
Especially considering it's a heart that beats in two different
women's bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny and Minnie Driver, the film builds an
implausible scenario into a credible and utterly charming romantic
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Return to Me'' marks a worthy directorial debut by actress
Bonnie Hunt, who co-wrote the screenplay and co-stars as Driver's
solicitous buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny plays Bob Rueland, an architect who loves his work and
adores his beautiful wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), a
zoologist crusading for money to build a gorilla habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's opening languidly depicts the Ruelands' ideal
marriage as they prepare for Elizabeth's big fund-raiser. She
frets, he encourages.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the worst that could happen? You forget your speech and
we don't get any donations,'' Bob says, a flip but ominous portent
of the evening to come.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-cut with the fund-raising preparations are scenes of Grace
Briggs (Driver), a young woman who has lived a secluded life
because of a bad heart. Grace is first seen in a hospital bed,
enfeebled but holding out hope for a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Ghastly ill, Grace's zest for life, even as it ebbs away, is
apparent when she jokingly mutters, ''Rosebud,'' Orson Welles'
cryptic deathbed line from ''Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Ruelands' smash-hit fund-raiser, the movie takes a
dark turn. Unconscious and horribly injured in a car wreck,
Elizabeth is wheeled into the hospital, her husband racing beside
her stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Bob goes home alone, slumping to the floor, weeping in his
bloody tuxedo and comforted only by the couple's faithful dog,
which waits by the door for a mistress who's never coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Toward morning, Bob is jerked to attention by a sound he isn't
quite sure he's heard. It's the first beat of Grace Briggs' new
heart.
</P>
<P>
   What inevitably follows could have lapsed into bland
predictability if not for Hunt's witty script and the endearing
ensemble of actors who make up Grace's circle of matchmaking
relatives and friends. Notable among them are Hunt herself as a
mother with five raucous children, James Belushi as her lovably
oafish husband, Robert Loggia as Grace's Italian uncle and Carroll
O'Connor as her Irish grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, of course Grace's heart will skip a beat when
she passes Bob unnoticed at the zoo, where he has taken on
construction of the gorilla habitat in Elizabeth's memory. Of
course Bob will somehow wander into the oddly named O'Reilly's
Italian Restaurant, the family business where Grace now works as a
waitress. Of course they will find romance, and later heartbreak,
when the truth is revealed about the source of the organ beating in
Grace's chest.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the finale: Will Bob and Grace find a life
together?
</P>
<P>
   ''When she met you, her heart beat for the first time,'' Grace's
grandfather tells Bob. ''Perhaps it was meant to be with you
always.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's all predictable, but it's the getting there that makes
''Return to Me'' work. Despite its somber beginnings and Bob's
sorrowful brooding over Elizabeth, the movie is light and playful
as the characters get on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa O'Reilly, always watchful for potential mates for his
granddaughter, tells Bob, ''We'll have a pint on that,'' when he
learns the new man in Grace's life is a widower.
</P>
<P>
   When her scheming friend fixes her up with a date, Grace is told
that he had a transplant, too. Cut to Grace trying to keep a
straight face as she shares a drink with a man who has the world's
worst hair transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's shyness over her surgical scars prompts a foot-in-mouth
reassurance from her grandfather: ''You're beautiful, and no one's
going to notice your chest.''
</P>
<P>
   On break from the droll, deadpan Fox Mulder on TV's ''The
X-Files,'' Duchovny is warmly human and humorous as Bob, and he
shows some real emotional range in the melancholy and anger that
follows Elizabeth's death.
</P>
<P>
   Driver (''Good Will Hunting,'' ''An Ideal Husband'') delivers
another fetching romantic turn, infusing Grace with captivating
coyness, vulnerability and childlike wonderment as she belatedly
takes her first baby steps into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming the unsettling premise of a loved one's most vital of
organs coming home in someone else's rib cage, ''Return to Me'' is
a gratifying throwback to old-time romantic comedies. The movie is
funny without straining toward the hip and trendy, sweet without
becoming overly saccharin. And, pun intended, it's eminently
goodhearted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Return to Me'' is rated PG. Running time 116 minutes.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Gold Medal for Reagans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has voted to award the Congressional
Gold Medal to former President Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution approved Monday praised Reagan, president from
1981-1989, for his leadership in restoring optimism to the nation
and bringing an end to the Cold War. Mrs. Reagan was recognized for
her efforts to curb alcohol and drug abuse among the nation's
youth. The bill awaits Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If today's historians looking back at the end of the 20th
century get it right, they will surely say that Ronald Reagan more
than any other person helped to restore the American dream,'' said
Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The one Democrat who spoke, John LaFalce of New York, remembered
Reagan, now 89 and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, ''for being
such a person of good will toward all.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hoped the next Congress would also consider
''honoring the work of our present president and first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven Democrats and GOP Rep. Ron Paul of Texas voted against
awarding the medal and Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., voted present.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 3591.

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- It's a dirty job, but someone's
got to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest attempt to rid the streets of the Dutch capital of
dog excrement, city officials are offering to pay people $4.30 an

said Tuesday.

<P>
   There is an ongoing debate about how to solve the messy problem

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed moderately lower today, falling
from a three-year high, amid political uncertainty in Japan. The
dollar edged higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 132.06 points,
or 0.64 percent, to close at 20,594.93 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
On Monday, the average closed up 389.67 points, or 1.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.06 yen in late trading on the Tokyo
foreign exchange market, up 0.20 yen from Monday and also above its
late New York level Monday of 104.85 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock exchange, traders said investors remained cautious
amid expectations of the resignation of the cabinet of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, who remains in a coma after suffering a
stroke. The resignations came at an emergency cabinet meeting after
markets closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party,
is viewed as the front-runner to succeed Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   With Obuchi's ruling party firmly in control, the changes were
not expected to lead to any significant alterations in the nation's
basic political or economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   But acting Prime Minister Mikio Aoki convened an emergency
Cabinet meeting to accept the resignations because it had become
clear Obuchi would not be able to resume his duties. ''We cannot
allow a political vacuum to form,'' Aoki said in announcing the
resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Prices started lower today on profit-taking following recent
gains. Investors in Tokyo were also discouraged by steep declines
Monday in U.S. high technology stocks on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 18.16 points, or 1.05 percent, to close at
1,714.29. The TOPIX closed up 26.51 points, or 1.55 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index plunged 349.15 points
to close at 4,223.68. It was the Nasdaq's worst one-day point drop
in history, surpassing a 229-point fall on Jan. 4, and its
fifth-biggest daily percentage decline. But the Dow industrials
soared.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher against the yen in
narrow trading amid continued concern of another central bank
intervention to stem any drop by the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese importers and U.S. and Canadian banks were among early
players who bought the greenback after Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa reiterated his determination to be ready to take action
against the yen's excessive upsurge.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today that Japan is ready
to take necessary action to contain disruptive foreign exchange
moves.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened in the market to weaken
the yen, whose recent rise has alarmed Japanese financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese finance authorities have intervened several times this
year to stem gains by the yen, which make Japanese exports more
expensive overseas, and thus less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.33 yen, up from
100.14 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7800 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8050 percent. Its price
rose 0.22 point to 101.03.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 36 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock

recovery this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say yesterday's move has presented a buying
opportunity for investors.

<P>
   Still others suggest technical levels have been violated,

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 9.01; Dow Up 138.60  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed today, with battered
technology stocks falling once again and continuing the dramatic
decline of the Nasdaq composite index.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was down
9.01 to 4,214.67, failing to mount even a modest recovery from its
349-point swoon yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 138.60 at 11,360.53,
extending Monday's 300-point gain.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were slightly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 12.94 at 1,518.91, nearing its March 24 closing
record of 1,527.46.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks tumbled even as the catalyst for their rout
yesterday -- Microsoft -- stabilized somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging 15] to 90~ yesterday, Microsoft slipped just 3/16
to 90 11/16 today. After the close of trading yesterday, a federal
judge ruled the company violated U.S. antitrust laws by mounting a
''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet browser
market. The ruling could lead to drastic punishment, including a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology shares, which have fallen prey to investors'
worries that their prices ran up too quickly in recent months, slid
once more today.
</P>
<P>
   Veritas Software fell 10| to 100~, Exodus Communications fell 4
37/64 to 118 15/64 and Amazon.com fell 2 5/16 to 61\.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which rose nearly 86 percent in 1999, started out
the year at the same extraordinary velocity, rising 24 percent from
the close of 1999 to March 10. But since closing at a record
5,048.62 on March 10, the index has fallen 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors have returned to blue-chip stocks. Today,
DuPont rose 2\ to 59 13/16 and Merck rose 2 11/16 to 69 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 145.30 million
shares, ahead of Monday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.93 to 512.11.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 1.4 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Helms Has Neurological Disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms says a neurological
disease has forced him to use a cane but is not causing him serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, 78, has been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and
received treatment last fall at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The disease affects the nerves that run from the brain or the
spine to the arms, hands, legs and feet by breaking down the sheath
that covers and protects nerve endings. The exposed nerves become
inflamed, interrupting their ability to conduct brain signals to
the extremities.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has multiple causes and no certain permanent cure.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a numbness or a no-feeling situation in an
extremity,'' the North Carolina Republican told The News &AMP; Observer
of Raleigh in an interview last week. ''I happen to have it in my
feet. But it doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the numbness causes difficulty with balance and forces
him to use a cane, Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms underwent eight treatments using an experimental therapy
called intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. The therapy, overseen
by the National Institutes of Health, replaces antibodies whose
absence is thought to cause the deterioration of the nerve
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' doctors don't know the cause of the condition and his
physician wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said he has recovered from earlier double knee-replacement
surgery and feels no knee pain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Helms also has undergone surgery for
prostate cancer and a quadruple heart bypass. He has suffered from
Paget's disease, a degenerative bone disorder, in his hip.

   Leading Indicators Fell in February
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future U.S. economic activity
fell 0.3 percent in February, the biggest monthly drop in more than
four years, suggesting that rising interest rates have begun to
take a toll. The Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators dropped to 106 in February after rising a revised 0.2
percent in January to 106.3, the private business-financed research
group said today. The decline, the first in the index since
September, was larger than the 0.1 percent drop that analysts had
expected. And it was the largest since the index fell 0.4 percent
in January 1996, Conference Board economists said.

   Gates Pledges To Fight Ruling
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is vowing to
fight a federal court decision that his company violated U.S.
antitrust laws by mounting a ''deliberate assault'' on competition
in the Internet browser market. The ruling could lead to drastic
punishment, including the breakup of one of the world's major
corporations. The judge issued his ruling Monday after the stock
market closed, but word that it was coming caused Microsoft stock
to drop by more than $15 a share. It declined a fraction this
morning. Gates has promised to appeal, and said he feels the
company has a strong case. He said the court ruling ''...turns on
its head the reality that consumers know: That our software has
helped make PCs accessible and more affordable to millions of
Americans.'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, said on NBC's ''Today'' that he will hold
hearings on the case.

and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and said it would advise shareholders as
soon as possible of its recommendation. The German company,
Europe's third-largest tour business, already owns 2.9 percent of
Thomson stock. C&AMP;N cited Thomson's poor financial performance in
disclosing earlier in the day that it plans to make a cash offer of
130 pence, or $2.08, a share that would value Thomson at $2.08
billion.

   March Is Mixed for Automakers
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Gas prices and higher interest rates did little
to dampen Americans' demand for new cars and trucks in March, as
nearly all major automakers reported sales gains. Ford Motor Co.
said yesterday that its sales for the month jumped, while General
Motors Corp. reported flat results and the Chrysler half of
DaimlerChrysler AG reported a small gain. Many foreign automakers
reported larger sales increases. Ford said its overall sales were
up 10 percent, with car sales up 19 percent and truck sales up 5
percent. The spike in car sales came mostly from newer models: the
redesigned Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable sedan, the Ford Focus compact
cars and the Lincoln LS sedan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes Telecom Accusations  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today accused
Mexico and seven other nations of erecting unfair barriers to keep
American telecommunication companies out of their markets.
</P>
<P>
   The administration set deadlines for later this year for the
barriers to be removed and raised the prospect that cases would be
brought to the World Trade Organization if the most objectionable
barriers are not dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The other nations named in the annual review of
telecommunication practices were Germany, South Africa, Britain,
Canada, Peru, Israel and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the administration issued a separate report accusing
Japan of violating its WTO commitments by refusing to lower high
interconnection fees that U.S. telecommunication companies complain
are designed to keep them out of the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   The administration today set a deadline of July 28 for resolving
both the Japanese case and a separate case against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Mexico, it appears that progress towards a level playing
field for telecommunications carriers now is stalled,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said. ''I view the situation in
Mexico as extremely serious. The United States will determine by
July 28 whether additional action, including in the WTO, would be
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Mexico was brought by a group of U.S.
companies including AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom. The U.S. companies
contend that the Mexican government and the nation's largest
telephone company, Telmex, have engaged in unfair practices aimed
at restricting access by foreign competitors to the Mexican market.
</P>
<P>
   Other review deadlines set by the administration today included
June 15 for Germany, South Africa and Britain, and Oct. 2 for
Canada and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration said it would also be watching
to see that Israel lives up to commitments to terminate
objectionable telephone barriers by Dec. 31, 2001, and to see that
Taiwan carries forward with the elimination of certain exclusive
licensing arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Freeh Denies Job-Hunting Reports  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior FBI official denied a published
report that FBI Director Louis Freeh is job-hunting and expects to
leave office before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't decided when he's leaving,'' the senior official
said of the 51-year-old FBI chief whose tenured term runs through
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some time he said he wouldn't leave any sooner than the
end of the year, and everyone here expects him to stay longer than
that,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   This official, who spoke Monday night on condition of anonymity,
said Freeh has made commitments to give speeches and make
appearances as FBI director through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Freeh does not want a change in the FBI
directorship to be linked to a change in U.S. presidential
administrations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who appointed Freeh, but whose relations with
the bureau chief have soured, leaves office early next year. The
tenured term was designed by Congress to make the FBI director
independent of any one White House administration. Freeh does not
want to undermine that, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that
intermediaries for Freeh have been sounding out legal and financial
services firms here and elsewhere on his behalf, telling them Freeh
is expected to leave office in the last several months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior official said, ''Freeh has not approached any
companies seeking employment nor has he authorized any others to do
so on his behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   This official said Freeh reiterated that to him on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years as a public servant -- FBI agent, federal
prosecutor, federal judge and FBI director -- Freeh faces some
financial difficulty in paying college tuition for his six boys.
</P>
<P>
   As FBI director, Freeh makes $141,300 annually. The senior
official said Freeh has declined more than one offer of a legal job
paying more than $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official said he understood ''one of Freeh's friends
trying to look out for him'' was making unauthorized inquiries
about whether companies would be interested in hiring Freeh.

<HEADLINE> Senate Delays Kosovo Aid Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decision by Senate leaders to delay a
multibillion-dollar bill for Hurricane Floyd and U.S. efforts in
Colombia and Kosovo could end up boosting the bill's ultimate cost,
a Senate committee chairman says.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other leaders
decided to indefinitely postpone today's scheduled votes on the
measure by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The panel's
chairman, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, revealed the delay Monday
after meeting with Lott and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens had planned to present his committee with a bill costing
at least $6.5 billion, according to documents obtained by The
Associated Press. In an interview, Stevens said he expected the
price tag to grow to at least $9 billion and perhaps $12 billion
eventually, with potential additions for agriculture and other
items.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will continue to grow, in my opinion,'' as lawmakers and
federal agencies make new requests, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the top U.S. military commander for Latin America
said today the money to help Colombia fight drug traffickers is
crucial, and any delay could make it that much harder to stem the
flow of illegal drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Gen. Charles Wilhelm, commander in chief of the U.S.
Southern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee the
House-passed spending measure, which designates $1.6 billion for
drug interdiction in Colombia, is important for ''a region of
rapidly growing strategic importance to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm joined Defense and State Department witnesses in urging
the Senate not to delay further the anti-drug money, despite Lott's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lott says the measure is too expensive and would slow the
Senate's work on other legislation. He wants parts of it added to
fiscal 2001 spending legislation, which could begin moving through
Congress in several weeks and has to be approved anyway. Fiscal
2001 begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House easily approved a $13 billion version of
the bill, which is for fiscal 2000, which runs through Sept. 30.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other House leaders
support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' bill includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$1.5 billion for helping Colombia and other Andean countries
battle drug traffickers and their left-wing rebel protectors, $200
million less than the House.
</P>
<P>
   --$4.2 billion for defense, including $1.9 billion for
peacekeepers in Kosovo. The House approved $2 billion for Kosovo
and $9 billion overall for the military.
</P>
<P>
   --$1 billion for Hurricane Floyd, which battered the East Coast
last fall, and other disasters, half what the House approved.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly $200 million in savings. The rest of the measure would
be paid for from the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton requested $5.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> FEC complaint filed against Clinton, Giuliani campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
Associated Press Writer, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two watchdog groups filed a complaint today
with the Federal Election Commission alleging that special accounts
established by the political parties to benefit Democrat Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Republican Rudolph Giuliani are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause and Democracy 21 also delivered their complaint to
the Justice Department and called for its campaign finance task
force to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint targets accounts set up by the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican
Senatorial Committee to accept unlimited contributions, known as
''soft money,'' from unions, corporations and individuals who are
not permitted to give directly to individual campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say soft money allows candidates to bypass campaign
donation limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're really engaged in a scheme to raise money that is
illegal in federal campaigns,'' said Scott Harshbarger, executive
director of Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats defended the accounts, saying they have been used in
Senate elections for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DSCC's joint fund raising with the Clinton campaign is
entirely legal and absolutely appropriate,'' said Jim Jordan, its
political director.
</P>
<P>
   The NRSC did not return a telephone call seeking comment. The
Clinton and Giuliani campaigns also did not return telephone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaign committees have similar fund-raising agreements
with several candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's account had raised more than $700,000 by the end of
last year. Giuliani's was recently established and has not yet
reported on its fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   While the parties are legally barred from earmarking money for
specific races, they keep close track of how much the candidates
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money cannot be spent on advertising that advocates voting
for a specific candidate but can be used for general issue ads to
benefit them, as well as for get-out-the-vote and other
party-building activities.
</P>
<P>
   With seven months remaining before the November election, the
New York mayor and first lady are on track to mount the most
expensive contest in New York state history. Giuliani has raised
$19 million to Clinton's $12 million. Recent polls show the two
locked in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake and the race being one of the most watched
in the country, both parties are expected to pour soft money into
the state for issue ads.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's highest court this morning ruled
that the state Legislature properly rescinded New York City's tax
on commuters living in New York last year, and the judges also said
the tax cannot be imposed on residents of other states.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the state Court of Appeals will cost the city $360
million a year. About 500,000 people live in New York state and
commute to jobs in the city and about 300,000 others who work in
the city live in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for New York City argued the tax was illegally rescinded
by the state Legislature and governor in May 1999 without the New
York City Council asking Albany to do so in a ''home rule''
message.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals unanimously said that no such message
was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the State appropriately authorized the city to
implement the commuter tax, it never ceded its taxing authority to
the city,'' wrote Judge Richard Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Connecticut and New Jersey residents, as well as the
state of Connecticut, argued that since the tax was being
eliminated for New York state residents, it violated the federal
Constitution to impose it on people from Connecticut and New Jersey
who work in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The language of the statute plainly and frankly discriminates
against nonresidents,'' Wesley wrote. ''There is little doubt but
that the discrimination is so great that both its purpose and
effect are exclusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Joy Lee, a Manhattan attorney who represented two
commuters from New Jersey, praised the decision. ''It's been
obvious from the start it's the right answer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also lauded the timing of the decision, since many commuters
still have time to change their income tax returns to reflect the
change in law.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise to legislators that the out-of-state portion
of the law was declared unconstitutional. When lawmakers approved
the tax rescinder, they included a ''poison pill'' provision that
said that if part of the law was found unconstitutional, the repeal
of the commuter tax would appeal to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   New York City also argued that the tax rescinder was improper
because its passage was designed to win votes in a hotly contested
special election last spring for a state Senate seat in New York's
northern suburbs. That election was won by Thomas Morahan, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals said it would put it on a ''slippery and
dangerous slope'' to make judgments about the legality of laws
based on the political motivation of Legislatures and governors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vortex of the legislative process is often the
intersection of politics and policy,'' wrote Wesley, himself a
former Republican state assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman, a spokeswoman for New York City's corporation
counsel, said city officials were ''extremely disappointed'' by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the Legislature acted in a very punitive way toward
New York City,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she hopes the decision is the end of the case, but
noted that since the Court of Appeals based its decision on the
federal Constitution, New York City could appeal to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully they won't, because it's not the right thing for New
York,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature approved the commuter tax rescinder on May 17,
1999, and Gov. George Pataki signed it into law 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   The city stopped collecting the tax from its residents then, but
continued collecting it from out-of-state commuters throughout the
appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals heard the various challenges to the
commuter tax rescinder at the same time and ruled on them in one
decision.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Below 4,000; Dow Up 1.86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Battered technology stocks dropped sharply again
Tuesday, pulling the Nasdaq composite index below 4,000 for the
first time in two months.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was down 297.02, or
by 7 percent, at 3,926.66. The technology-dominated index last
traded below 4,000 on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's selloff came a day after the index suffered through a
single-day record drop of 349.15 points, a decline of 7.6 percent.
The technology-focused average now was down 22.2 percent from its
record 5048.62 of March 10 and below where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 300 points
Monday, was up just 1.86 at 11,223.79 at midday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks tumbled as the catalyst for their rout on
Monday -- Microsoft -- slipped again.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging more than $15 on Monday, Microsoft fell $2.50 to
$88.38 Tuesday morning. After Monday's trading session, a federal
judge ruled the company violated U.S. antitrust laws by mounting a
''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet browser
market. The ruling could lead to drastic punishment, including a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology shares, which have fallen prey to investors'
worries that their prices ran up too quickly in recent months, slid
once more Tuesday, lending credibility to analysts' belief that
Microsoft wasn't solely responsible for the technology selloff
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's precipitous drop wiped out its spectacular gains
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, technology shares had been ripe for a further
correction,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''The Microsoft news merely

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross, 'The Supremes' To Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Diana Ross, meet the Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit-born diva announced plans today for a new tour with
''the Supremes,'' although the two singers signed up for the shows,
Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne, actually joined the group after
Ross' departure 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tour will really be dedicated to all the songs from the
early days,'' Ross told a packed news conference at Grand Central
Terminal. ''The reason we're doing this is for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Ross, joined by Laurence and Payne, arrived at
the vast train station in a black stretch limousine. Despite a
steady rain, Ross sported sunglasses as she exited the car.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will open June 14 in Philadelphia, and run through Aug.
5 with a finale at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Tickets for the
shows in Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, New York and Boston go on
sale a week from today.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's classics from the 1960s are ''Stop! In the
Name of Love,'' ''Baby Love,'' ''Reflections,'' ''The Happening''
and ''You Can't Hurry Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross was adamant that this was not a reunion tour. Original
Supreme Mary Wilson was approached for the tour, but a financial
deal could not be worked out, according to the promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, this is really about the music,'' Ross said. ''Aren't
we celebrating the music?''
</P>
<P>
   The third of the original Supremes, Florence Ballard, died in
1976.

<HEADLINE> Arizona senator hits the campaign trail again in New York Senaterace  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- Nearly a month after giving up his
presidential effort, Sen. John McCain was back on a campaign bus
today urging New Yorkers to elect his ''soul mate,'' Rudolph
Giuliani, to help reform big-money politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Giuliani ''I think I will have a staunch and strong ally in
the United States senate for campaign finance reform,'' McCain told
a town hall meeting of more than 100 people at Long Island's
American Legion Post 694.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor agreed with McCain on campaign funding, even though
Giuliani aims to raise $20 million, some of it in soft, or
unregulated, donations, in his battle with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to be competitive,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   If voters like McCain's pugnaciousness, the senator said,
they'll love Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more mild-mannered, even-tempered individuals like
Rudy and myself who will never rock the boat or say anything that's
controversial in nature,'' McCain told the laughing crowd. ''I look
forward to having a soul mate in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Told by one member of the audience that Clinton has alleged
Giuliani lacks the temperament to get along in the Senate, Giuliani
poked fun at his own reputation. ''Did she say that?'' he roared at
the questioner. ''Sit down! Shut up!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very forceful in my advocacy,'' the mayor added. ''Maybe
Washington needs a little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of the party's likely presidential nominee, George W.
Bush, came up only in passing, as when McCain threw in what stands
for now for an endorsement:

   ''I support the nominee of my party, I've had conversations with
Governor Bush,'' McCain said, though he has not said when he would
endorse the Texas governor, or under what circumstances. He
confirmed on his way into the hall that he would seek more
agreement from Bush on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Giuliani mentioned Bush's campaign in answer to a
question about whether Republicans can hope to win New York State.
The mayor said he keeps reminding the Bush campaign that Ronald
Reagan won the state in 1980 and 1984, and that Bush can, too, if
he can attract moderate Republicans and Democrats -- the same
coalition that propelled McCain to victory in New Hampshire and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took a trip down memory lane on a bus hired by Giuliani --
without the ''Straight Talk'' logo -- to the senator's first
campaign event since his campaign collapsed March 7 in the Super
Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is in a tight battle with Clinton for the Senate seat
being vacated by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Giuliani
endorsed Bush during the primary season but declined to attack
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's support might help Giuliani with the independents and
moderate Democrats who helped McCain beat Bush in New Hampshire and
Michigan. Those voting blocs are key constituencies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race could become the most expensive contest for a
seat in that chamber in history, with Clinton's campaign trying to
raise $25 million and Giuliani's camp shooting for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The race has been tight, but a poll late last month showed the
mayor has been hurt by his unsympathetic response to the March 16
killing of Patrick Dorismond, a security guard who was killed by an
undercover officer in a botched police drug sting.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was the fourth unarmed black man shot to death by New
York City police in the past 13 months. After each case, Giuliani
has defended the police.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he's sure Giuliani will have a chance to show more
sympathy during the campaign, and that New York residents will give
the mayor credit for the city's falling crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, McCain said his Commerce Committee will hold
hearings on Microsoft, but he declined to comment on Monday's
antitrust ruling.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain said he misses riding along with reporters aboard his
''Straight Talk Express'' and has talked to his GOP colleagues
about the press corps' professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've tried to convince my Republican friends they're not the
enemy,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Rain Likely; Grains, Soybeans Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures declined in early
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by rainy
forecasts for the central United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the Midwest is expected to remain dry for most of this
week, new forecasts for rain Friday and Saturday helped send prices
lower in a slide that also was attributed in part to carryover from
Monday's weak finish.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat opened higher but then retreated as investors concluded
that frosty weather in part of the winter wheat belt overnight
won't necessarily harm the crop.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported dry soil conditions
in Illinois and Iowa that could hinder development of the nation's
leading crop -- corn. But investors have already long factored that
into the price, and corn fell victim today to the across-the-board
decline in agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 1} cent to $2.56 a bushel; May corn
fell 1} cent to $2.32{ a bushel; July oats fell { cent to $1.20{ a

   Beef and pork futures retreated in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Chats With Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't look for Leonardo DiCaprio to replace
Peter Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News denies that the 25-year-old megastar (that would be
DiCaprio) was meant to be performing in the role of a TV journalist
when he interviewed President Clinton at the White House last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Participating in an hourlong ABC News environment special, the
ecologically involved DiCaprio was supposed to take an on-camera
tour of the White House with Clinton to explore modifications to
make it more environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our expectation all along had been that this would be a
walking tour to observe some recent changes -- the 'greening' of the
White House,'' ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton unexpectedly offered a sit-down interview with
DiCaprio. During the conversation, which lasted about 15 minutes,
Clinton discussed his policy on global warming and other
environmental issues, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   When ABC News staffers -- real ones -- learned of the exchange,
there was discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that ABC News chief David Westin, who had found out
after the fact, sent an e-mail Saturday assuring his colleagues
that ''all roles of journalist must be played by journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is that stupid'' as to send DiCaprio to conduct a
presidential interview for ABC News, Westin wrote. He added that
when the TV special airs on or around Earth Day on April 22,
DiCaprio's White House segment might be found in the recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite possible we'll use none,'' Westin wrote.

<HEADLINE> Army Wants Comache Helicopters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army today unveiled a helicopter
modernization plan that affirms a commitment to buy 1,213
new-generation Comanche reconnaissance helicopters for $38 billion
over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation in Congress and within the military
that Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, would scale back
the Comanche program to pay for a planned overhaul of the rest of
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army is fully committed to the Comanche,'' Brig. Gen.
Craig Hackett, director of Army requirements, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Comanche, now in development and intended to begin entering
the fleet in 2006, is designed mainly for reconnaissance but also
can fill an attack role. It will replace today's OH-58D Kiowa
Warrior helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Army's helicopter modernization plan includes a
commitment to completing the purchase of 1,213 Comanches by 2024.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for accelerating the retirement of the
Army's oldest helicopters, the AH-1 Cobras and UH-1 Hueys. All
Cobras are to be retired by this October; the Hueys are to be gone
by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also will convert more AH-64 Apache attack helicopters
to the D-model ''Longbow'' configuration, which gives it more
offensive and defensive capabilities. The Vietnam-era CH-47 Chinook
transport helicopters will be modernized and kept in the fleet for
another 15 to 20 years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the plan is an accelerated effort to improve the
training of Army helicopter pilots. ''Army aviator proficiency and
experience levels have taken a dramatic decline over the past 10
years,'' the plan said. Ten years ago, a battalion commander
typically had 2,000 hours of flight experience, whereas today it is
less than 1,000, and flight experience across the ranks has dropped
as well, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Army has not decided how much the overall
modernization plan will cost beyond what already is budgeted for
aviation. He said that would be worked out over the next several
months in conjunction with Shinseki's broader effort to make the
entire Army lighter, more mobile and more flexible.

<HEADLINE> Boxers Punched In and Out of Ring  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Most boxing films aren't about boxing, really.
''The Harder They Fall'' wasn't. ''Rocky'' wasn't. And neither is
''On the Ropes,'' a magnificent documentary about three young New
Yorkers trying to touch their dreams by giving and taking punches
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Airing Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT on The Learning Channel, ''On the
Ropes,'' an Oscar nominee for best documentary, is a sort of
pugilistic ''Hoop Dreams.'' It's set in the world of up-and-coming
amateur fighters who train at the New Bed-Stuy Boxing Center Inc.
in New York City's rough-and-tumble Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There is George Walton, one of 15 children, a fast-moving,
ambitious young man being courted by promoters to turn pro. There
is Tyrene Manson, trying desperately to conquer her troubled home
life and be a successful fighter. There is Noel Santiago, a lanky
former drug addict and small-time robber who lost his father to
AIDS and sees boxing as his chance to finally excel.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Harry Keitt, proprietor of the New Bed-Stuy
gym, a 40-ish man with an affable moon face who turned his
delinquent life around and dedicated it to helping young people
discipline themselves and succeed both in and out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where I'd be if I didn't start boxing,'' Noel
says, and you get the feeling he speaks for all of them, including
Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sport, while omnipresent, is really only a bit player.
''It's not just about what it seems on the surface,'' says Brett
Morgen, who, with co-filmmaker Nanette Burstein, spent two years
with the four main characters.
</P>
<P>
   As with all good sports movies, ''On the Ropes'' is about life
itself -- about the tough battle to learn the tools like
self-discipline and commitment that produce success.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour film is whittled down from hundreds of hours of
footage -- and, the filmmakers say, hundreds more hours spent just
hanging out with the four protagonists. The rapport between
subjects and filmmakers is so obvious that at times the
''performances'' are seamless enough to seem like acting.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrene is the most interesting of the young fighters. She is
trying to extricate herself from a house that includes her
drug-addled uncle, a young niece named Ebony whom she's trying to
protect, and -- as she tells it -- various crack-toting vagrants.
</P>
<P>
   As she trains for her dream, Tyrene is charged with possession
of cocaine with intent to sell it -- cocaine that was found when
police stormed the house and searched the room she shared with four
other people. She says the cocaine wasn't hers. And you believe
her.
</P>
<P>
   For Tyrene, the gym and its sparring opportunities offer escape.
''My world is crammed up in me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The others are fascinating, too.
</P>
<P>
   Noel's tears stream after he takes a hard punch in the face and
loses a fight -- then he battles distractions and inertia as Harry
struggles to keep him on track. George's head swells a bit and he
cuts Harry loose when professional promoters come calling. Then
there's the action at the Golden Gloves tournament, New York's
showcase for young boxers hungry for victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to see how it feels like to be a winner,'' Noel says.
''I never felt like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   And, most interestingly, there's Harry. Harry Keitt is the kind
of character screenwriters dream of inventing. When he was younger,
he drifted from his boxing dream (which included a stint as
Muhammad Ali's sparring partner) and became addicted to crack. Then
he shot his cousin seven times with a .25 automatic, and did two
years in Sing-Sing and Attica for attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Now reformed and pushing 40, he uses his gym for athletic
interventions -- snagging kids before they are incorrigible, and
channeling their energy and rage into discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ''My day's over,'' he tells Noel between rounds of one fight.
''I'm trying to make my dream come through you.''
</P>
<P>
   As the film progresses into a natural story arc for each
protagonist, each faces a life challenge. Two of those challenges
are muted and subtle, as life tends to be. Tyrene's is more
dramatic, and the obstacles she faces edge into the closest thing
the film offers to preaching. But even that section is subtle and
never crosses the line to being shrill.
</P>
<P>
   The film ends in 1998. But The Learning Channel airing includes
a new, four-minute epilogue showing what became of the four. It
includes a surprise, so don't be fooled when the credits roll; stay
tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the Ropes'' is documentary filmmaking at its best --
textured and relevant, subtle and genuine. Word has it the
filmmakers recently sold remake rights to Warner Bros. for some
sort of fictional version. It may make them money, but from an
artistic standpoint it's probably not worth it: Whatever they do,
it won't come near the purity of this.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Tumbles 500; Dow Drops 475  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index plunged more than 500
points Tuesday, dropping 25 percent from its record high and
pulling the rest of the stock market into a broad-based decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped into what some analysts consider a bear
market. It was down 513.83 at 3,814.95 in early afternoon trading.
Selling pressure was heavy, gathering momentum as the index smashed
through 4,000 for the first time since Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's selloff came a day after the index suffered through a
single-day record drop of 349.15 points, a decline of 7.6 percent.
The technology-focused average was down 23 percent from its record
5048.62 of March 10 and below where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is considered a sustained drop of more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which soared 300 points
Monday, was down 475.53 at 10,764.40 in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks tumbled as the catalyst for their rout on
Monday -- Microsoft -- slipped again.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging more than $15 on Monday, Microsoft more than $4
to $86.50 Tuesday afternoon. After Monday's trading session, a
federal judge ruled the company violated U.S. antitrust laws by
mounting a ''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet
browser market. The ruling could lead to drastic punishment,
including a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology shares, which have fallen prey to investors'
worries that their prices ran up too quickly in recent months, slid
once more Tuesday, lending credibility to analysts' belief that
Microsoft wasn't solely responsible for the technology selloff
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's precipitous drop wiped out its spectacular gains
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, technology shares had been ripe for a further
correction,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''The Microsoft news merely
provided a handy excuse.''

<HEADLINE> Estrogen, Heart Problems Linked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preliminary findings from one of the nation's
largest medical studies shows older women taking estrogen had a
slightly higher risk of heart attack, stroke or a blood clot during
their first two years of treatment compared with women who took a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The risk was very small -- in fact, it seems to disappear after
the first two years of hormone use -- according to findings from the
government-funded Women's Health Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But the preliminary findings add to growing questions about
estrogen's effect on the heart. Two other recent studies found no
evidence estrogen helped the hearts of postmenopausal women who
already have heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the hope behind estrogen was not that it could help
existing heart disease, but that it could prevent or delay it,
something the Women's Health Initiative is studying.
</P>
<P>
   And experts stressed today that it is too early to change how
women and their doctors decide who should try estrogen -- already a
complex decision.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 16 million postmenopausal women already take
hormone replacement therapy, either estrogen alone or combined with
progestin. Hormone replacement can reduce menopausal symptoms, such
as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, and reduce the risk of
osteoporosis. Some previous studies suggested it reduced the risk
of heart disease, and it is being studied as possible protection
against Alzheimer's disease. But it also can increase the risk of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know how this is going to play out,'' cautioned Dr.
Elizabeth Ross of the American Heart Association. ''I don't think
there's anything here to make us change our clinical practice. ...
It's a patient-to-patient decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a huge, nationwide study of women's health
issues, and 27,000 women are participating in the hormone-therapy
portion. Those women all were mailed letters Friday notifying them
of the preliminary findings.
</P>
<P>
   Only a little more than 1 percent of the 27,000 participants
have suffered either a heart attack, stroke or blood clot
regardless of whether they were given hormones or a placebo, said
the initiative's acting director, Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But the frequency of these health problems was slightly higher
in hormone-treated women than placebo-treated women, Rossouw said,
although he refused to provide actual figures.
</P>
<P>
   The initial increased risk ''seems to go away'' after the first
two years of hormone treatment, Rossouw said. But he cautioned that
the study isn't slated to end until 2005, so results could change.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent study of estrogen in heart-disease patients also
found the first two years of treatment posed a heart attack risk
that disappeared with longer hormone use.
</P>
<P>
   Although estrogen has long been known to cause blood clots,
''these findings for heart attacks and strokes were not expected
... when you first joined this landmark study,'' say letters to the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   However, independent safety monitors concluded the study should
continue, and the letters urged women not to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really owe it to the public out there to continue so we
have definitive answers,'' Rossouw said.

<HEADLINE> Nortel Selling Plants to Solectron  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nortel Networks Corp. is taking a step away from
brick and mortar, transferring its manufacturing plants in North
America and Asia to Solectron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Brampton, Ontario-based telecommunications company said
Tuesday it will sell its manufacturing plants in Calgary, Research
Triangle Park, N.C.; Monterrey, Mexico; and Istanbul, Turkey, to
Solectron. The 4,200 workers at Nortel's plants will keep their
jobs, both companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel, which expects to make $900 million from the sale, will
sign a four-year, $10 billion supply deal with Solectron.
</P>
<P>
   ''This announcement is part of Solectron's core strategy to
continue to expand our business units, capabilities and presence in
the telecommunications industry,'' said Ko Nishimura, Solectron's
chairman, president and CEO, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Nortel's printed circuit board, new product
introduction prototyping and telephone set assembly centers,
Solectron gets wider access to modern assembly sites.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel said it will realize an annual savings of $250 million to
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our efforts over the past year have helped to transform Nortel
Networks into one of the most flexible, agile and responsive
provider of high-performance Internet solutions,'' said Chahram
Bolouri, president, global operations for Nortel Networks, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Solectron will be setting up a new
operating unit comprised of the acquired Nortel Networks sites. The

<HEADLINE> New tour, new Supremes for Diana Ross  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty years after leaving the group, Diana Ross
will again reign Supreme.
</P>
<P>
   A radiant Ross, joined by a pair of Supremes who joined the
group after her 1970 departure, announced plans Tuesday morning for
a two-month U.S. tour focusing on the group's timeless Motown hits.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest re-pairing of once-fractured bands -- think the
Eagles or Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young -- that can still sell out
arenas long after their last hit. Tickets are priced from $39.50 to
$125 for fans eager to hear Ross reprise the Supremes' catalog for
the first time in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Such reunions are inevitably lucrative. Bruce Springsteen's tour
with the E Street Band generated $61.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross, addressing a crowded news conference inside Grand
Central Terminal, stressed that this was not a reunion. She's
teamed with Lynda Laurence, a Supreme since 1971, and Scherrie
Payne, who joined the group in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has never performed on stage together; Ross says that
at this point, they know exactly four Supremes songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was never called a reunion tour,'' Ross insisted. ''I
never considered it a reunion tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, efforts to sign up original Supreme Mary Wilson for the
tour fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish she was here,'' Ross said of Wilson. ''I think where
the breakdown came was with Mary and the promoters ... I don't
think anyone was willing to go as far as Mary wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Arthur Fogel refused to discuss specifics of the
negotiations, but confirmed that efforts to add Wilson ended
without an agreement. The third original Supreme, Florence Ballard,
died in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Return to Love'' tour opens June 14 in Philadelphia and
runs through Aug. 5, with a finale at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
Tickets for the shows in Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, New York
and Boston go on sale next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that fans can expect to hear all the Supreme's
chart-topping hits: ''Where Did Our Love Go,'' ''Baby Love,''
''Stop! In the Name of Love,'' ''Back in My Arms Again'' and many
more.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-show tour may be ''a once-in-a-lifetime chance,'' Ross
said. ''The reason we're doing this is for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 56, was in high spirits for the announcement. Wearing a
pink leather outfit with matching lipstick, she arrived with her
bandmates in a stretch limousine. Despite falling rain, Ross exited
wearing sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she joked about the length of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent 10 years with the Supremes, and 30 years as a solo
act,'' Ross said. ''I've been performing 40 years, and I'm only
38!''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Dow Drop 500 Then Recover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index plummeted more than
500 points today, but bounced back from its earlier lows as bargain
hunters entered the market looking for cheap deals after a steep
two-day selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in the Nasdaq derailed the Dow Jones industrials,
pulling the blue-chip index down sharply in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-programmed sell orders sent stocks tumbling once the
Nasdaq plunged below 4,000 for the first time since Feb. 1. Then
programmed buy orders lifted stocks from those lows.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was off 273.40
at 3,950.28. At its low point, the Nasdaq fell 574.57 to 3,649.11
and was down more than 923 points in two days, having dropped
349.15 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff knocked the Nasdaq 27.7 percent below its March 10
peak of 5,048.62. Historically, Wall Street has considered a drop
of 20 percent from a peak the hallmark of a bear market. For the
moment, however, analysts were reluctant to predict whether the
current decline means that the end of the long bull market in
high-tech stocks is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the bottom may be in place. That's not to say that we
won't go back down and test these levels,'' said Brian G. Belski,
chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   While the breadth and sharpness of the technology selloff
ultimately pulled the broad market into a powerful decline. The Dow
Jones industrial average was down as much as 503 points before
recovering to a loss of 174.98 at 11,046.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 47.23 at 1,458.74.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which nearly
matches the Nasdaq in its heavy weighting of technology stocks,
plunged 35.48 to 480.56.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq was long overdue to drop from the
heights it reached early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it is to believe, this is a good thing,'' said Pete
Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ''One sector of the market was insanely
overvalued. The rest was deeply undervalued. Now we are reversing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of technology stocks sustained crushing losses.
Veritas Software fell 16 1/16 to 95 7/16, Exodus Communications
fell 12 13/16 to 110 and JDS Uniphase fell 12| to 99.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-known names, which some investors had been
clinging to as a safe haven, collapsed early today, but then erased
some of those losses. Cisco Systems was down 2 1/16 to 70~, and
Oracle fell 4~ to 70~.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Monday's rout -- Microsoft -- slipped again.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging 15] to 90~ on Monday, Microsoft fell another 4]
to 86{ today. After the close of trading Monday, a federal judge
ruled the company violated U.S. antitrust laws by mounting a
''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet browser
market. The ruling could lead to drastic punishment, including a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology shares, which have fallen prey to investors'
worries that their prices ran up too quickly in recent months, slid
once more today, lending credibility to analysts' belief that
Microsoft wasn't solely responsible for the technology selloff
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, technology shares had been ripe for a further
correction,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''The Microsoft news merely
provided a handy excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.07 billion shares,
compared with 643.69 million at the same time Monday.

<HEADLINE> Army Wants Comanche Helicopters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army today unveiled a helicopter
modernization plan that affirms a commitment to buy 1,213
new-generation Comanche reconnaissance helicopters for $38 billion
over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation in Congress and within the military
that Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, would scale back
the Comanche program to pay for a planned overhaul of the rest of
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army is fully committed to the Comanche,'' Brig. Gen.
Craig Hackett, director of Army requirements, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Comanche, now in development and intended to begin entering
the fleet in 2006, is designed mainly for reconnaissance but also
can fill an attack role. It will replace today's OH-58D Kiowa
Warrior helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Army's helicopter modernization plan includes a
commitment to completing the purchase of 1,213 Comanches by 2024.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for accelerating the retirement of the
Army's oldest helicopters, the AH-1 Cobras and UH-1 Hueys. All
Cobras are to be retired by this October; the Hueys are to be gone
by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also will convert more AH-64 Apache attack helicopters
to the D-model ''Longbow'' configuration, which gives it more
offensive and defensive capabilities. The Vietnam-era CH-47 Chinook
transport helicopters will be modernized and kept in the fleet for
another 15 to 20 years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the plan is an accelerated effort to improve the
training of Army helicopter pilots. ''Army aviator proficiency and
experience levels have taken a dramatic decline over the past 10
years,'' the plan said. Ten years ago, a battalion commander
typically had 2,000 hours of flight experience, whereas today it is
less than 1,000, and flight experience across the ranks has dropped
as well, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Army has not decided how much the overall
modernization plan will cost beyond what already is budgeted for
aviation. He said that would be worked out over the next several
months in conjunction with Shinseki's broader effort to make the
entire Army lighter, more mobile and more flexible.

<HEADLINE> Watchdog groups file complaint against Clinton, Giuliani campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alleging that special party accounts
established to benefit Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani
are illegal, a pair of good government groups on Tuesday filed a
complaint with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause and Democracy 21 also asked the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The groups' complaint targets accounts set up by the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican
Senatorial Committee to accept unlimited contributions, known as
''soft money,'' from unions, corporations and deep-pocketed
individuals who are not permitted to give directly to individual
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say soft money allows candidates to bypass campaign
donation limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaigns of first lady Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani
are thumbing their noses at the federal campaign finance laws and
treating the voters of New York as if they were fools,'' Democracy
21 President Fred Wertheimer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said the Clinton and
Giuliani camps were ''clearly in violation of the spirit and
explicit letter of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But party officials defended the fund-raising agreements, which
they say have been used in U.S. Senate elections for several years
now.
</P>
<P>
   The DSCC currently has seven joint fund-raising agreements with
candidates. The NRSC has similar agreements with several
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   DSCC political director Jim Jordan called the complaint
''frivolous, disingenuous, and utterly without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These mechanisms are entirely appropriate and legal as a
settled point of campaign law,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger and Wertheimer said they targeted the New York race
because of the documented connection between the parties and the
campaigns. They pointed to remarks made by top Clinton adviser
Harold Ickes who said the campaign had reviewed and provided input
for a DSCC-funded commercial featuring the first lady last year.
And the advocates said the parties have become more brazen, now
attaching the names of candidates to accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are barred from specifically earmarking soft money
for candidates. They say they set up the accounts to keep a tally
of how much candidates help raise for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer scoffed at that explanation saying, ''Clinton and
Giuliani are soliciting these soft money contributions for the
purpose of having them spent to directly influence their Senate
races.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRSC did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
Neither did the Clinton and Giuliani campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the DSCC sought to discredit Harshbarger, a fellow
Democrat,by distributing press releases Tuesday detailing how he
had received soft money himself when as Massachusetts attorney
general he ran for governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said the soft money used in his race was ''a
completely different kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint came as Giuliani stumped in New York with Arizona
Sen. John McCain, the most visible booster of campaign finance
reform. McCain's plan would ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   With seven months to go before the election, the
Giuliani-Clinton contest is on track to become the most expensive
contest in New York history. Giuliani has raised $19 million and
Clinton $12 million. Recent polls show the two in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are expected to pour soft money into New York for
television advertisements as Election Day draws nearer.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money cannot be spent on advertisements that specifically
advocate voting for a candidate but can be used for general issue
ads as well as get-out-the-vote and other party-building
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's New York Senate 2000 account had raised more than
$700,000 in soft money by the end of February. The Giuliani Victory
Committee was set up just weeks ago and has not reported yet. A
March 23 fund-raiser held in New York City to kick off soft money
donations to Giuliani asked for $50,000 donations.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC had no comment Tuesday. The Justice Department did not
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates Transplant Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking sides in the bitter debate over who
gets the first chance at donated organs, the House is set to pass
legislation that would kill a Clinton administration effort to move
more hearts, livers and kidneys to the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would strip the Department of Health and Human
Services of its power to set transplant policy and comes after
years of tension between the federal government and the United
Network for Organ Sharing, the private firm that has long run the
transplant system under a government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents tried to amend the bill to allow the HHS secretary
final say over any transplant policy, but the House rejected that
move, 260-160.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill, which sides
with the transplant network on virtually every point of dispute.
The legislation also encourages organ donation, something both
sides support.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not yet acted on the issue, and both sides were
hoping for a resolution there. Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., planned to introduce compromise
legislation Wednesday that would give an expert commission power to
mediate disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is supply and demand. Only about half of
families asked to donate organs say yes, and many families are
never asked. Meanwhile, nearly 5,000 people die each year waiting
for organ transplants, and 68,530 people are waiting for
transplants today.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give the transplant network total control
over the rules governing distribution of organs. Under the
network's system, patients who live in the same area as donors have
first chance at organs, even if a sicker patient lives just outside
the border. The Clinton administration wants to eliminate those
geographic barriers, saying someone's chance at life should not be
dictated by where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ''Healthy people are getting organs before they need them and
the very sick are not getting organs before they die,'' said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich. ''If you like that situation, this is a bill
you ought to support.''
</P>
<P>
   The transplant network and many transplant centers --
particularly smaller hospitals -- fear that change will siphon away
locally donated organs to other centers, jeopardizing their
programs. They also argue that HHS has no right to write the rules,
calling its effort to direct policy a ''power grab.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the government, is this bureaucracy up here equipped to
make these decisions?'' asked Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., the
bill's chief sponsor. ''Do we want politics determining life and
death matters? I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the current system also argue that states would
have little incentive to encourage organ donation if the organs
were being shipped to other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're allowed to keep the fruits of your labor, you're
going to work harder. If the fruits of your labor are going to be
sent to another part of this country, that increases the chances
that you won't work as hard,'' said Democrat Rep. Thomas Barrett of
Wisconsin, where donation rates are high and the state has sued HHS
to stop the new transplant regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has intervened in this emotional battle before. HHS
issued regulations in April 1998 directing the transplant network
to give more organs to the sickest patients -- even if they live far
from the donor -- and Congress put those rules on hold for nearly
two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Congress ordered the prestigious Institute of
Medicine to study the system. In its report, the institute
recommended that HHS assert more oversight over the transplant
system. It also backed up the core of the HHS regulation,
recommending that the geographic barriers be broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation repeatedly cited that report as
they argued that Congress should not strip HHS of its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public would have no say over public policy,'' said Rep.
Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. ''It turns those decisions over to a private
bureaucratic organization, which in the end has no real
accountability to taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The HHS regulations took effect last month, and the transplant
network is now working on a new policy for distribution of livers,
which have engendered the greatest controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant world has been consumed by the intense argument
over distribution policy for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to believe people are sick of this issue,'' said Dr.
John Lake of the University of Minnesota, president of the American
Society of Transplantation. ''But the factions seem to have their
loins girded and are ready to do battle.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Votes on Visa Waiver  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel voted Tuesday to make permanent
a pilot program that waives visa requirements for travel between
the United States and 29 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the House Judiciary Committee by voice
after Democrats on the panel inserted language to ensure that
racial and ethnic profiling are not used to exclude nations from
the program.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would make permanent a visa-free program that was
inaugurated in 1986 and now is used annually by 17 million people,
more than half those visiting the United States every year for
business and travel.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the program, a country must extend reciprocal
visa-free entry privileges to American citizens, have a
nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of less than 3 percent and commit to
fully develop a machine-readable passport by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of
the Judiciary immigration subcommittee, also seeks to tighten
controls over visitors by requiring the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to develop a fully automated system for
tracking the entry and departure of visa waiver travelers entering
by air or sea.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's spokesman, Allen Kay, said the United States is the only
industrialized nation that does not record departures of visitors,
a practice that has made it harder to prevent overstays.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by the tourism and travel industry, and in
a letter to the committee, Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben
said the administration backs a permanent waiver program. He
expressed some concern that time frames for putting automated
databases in place were overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel noted that not one African or Caribbean
country has qualified for the program because of high visa refusal
rates, and they alleged some U.S. consular officials have used
racial or ethnic factors in denying visa requests.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the committee's top Democrat,
offered an amendment to preclude from calculations of refusal rates
any denials based on race, sex, sexual orientation or disability.
</P>
<P>
   The language was accepted, although Smith said it could subject
consular officials to second-guessing by anyone claiming
discrimation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also approved by a voice vote a bill, sponsored by
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., that would create a new class of
visas for victims of sex trafficking or slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Visas would be extended to those victims and their families who
cooperate with law enforcement and who would face persecution or
extreme hardship if repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Those under the program, which would be capped at 5,000 a year,
would be able to apply for permanent residence after three years.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The visa waiver bill is H.R. 3767.
</P>
<P>
   The trafficking visa bill is H.R. 3244.

   Leading Indicators Fell in February
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future U.S. economic activity
fell 0.3 percent in February, the biggest monthly drop in more than
four years, suggesting that rising interest rates have begun to
slow economic growth somewhat. The Conference Board's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators dropped to 106 in February after rising
a revised 0.2 percent in January to 106.3, the private
business-financed research group said today. Economists had
expected a 0.1 percent drop. ''Signals for the immediate future
point to continued expansion, although not at the breakneck pace of
the fourth quarter of 1999,'' when the U.S. economy grew at a
sizzling 7.3 percent annual rate, Ken Goldstein, the Conference
Board's chief economist, said.

   Startups Ponder Microsoft Effects
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Entrepreneurs see both opportunity and
potential disaster if severe penalties are levied at Microsoft in
an antitrust case, particularly if a breakup of the company is
ordered. At Spring Internet World 2000 yesterday, several small
company representatives looked with trepidation at a judge's ruling
that the world's largest software maker violated federal law. In
the short term, a major defeat for Microsoft could scare investors
away from technology stocks, drying up much-needed capital for
startups looking to market the next big Internet idea. That fear
has been lent credence by the Nasdaq's sharp falls yesterday and
today. Others, however, said firms struggling against the
proverbial 800-pound gorilla could benefit from a smaller
Microsoft, especially if it is broken up into a series of more
focused companies. Microsoft owner Bill Gates says he will appeal
the verdict and believes the company has a strong position for an
appeal. Microsoft stock was down 4\ at 86| this afternoon.

   EU Reserves Comment on Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission declined to
comment today on a U.S. federal court ruling finding Microsoft
Corp. guilty of violating antitrust laws by mounting a ''deliberate
assault'' on competition in the Internet browser market. EU
spokesman Michael Tscherny said the EU executive ''does not comment
on decisions by other judicial authorities. U.S. authorities are
doing their job and we are doing ours.'' He also said it was too
early to say whether the U.S. ruling would have any impact on EU
antitrust investigations of Microsoft.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and Vodafone AirTouch PLC
plan an initial public offering to sell stock in their newly named
wireless venture, Verizon Wireless, which is the biggest mobile
phone and paging company in the nation. The announcement today
accompanied the introduction of a national flat-rate plan for
mobile calling and the launch of an aggressive branding and
marketing campaign for Verizon, a name choice that has puzzled many
observers. The companies also announced plans to invest $3 billion
this year in upgrading and expanding their national wireless
network to increase capacity and add new services such as instant
text messaging between mobile phones and handheld devices. Bell

crackers and Oreo cookies. In yesterday's announcement, the Nabisco
Group board also rejected as inadequate Carl Icahn's declaration
that he was prepared to start a tender offer of $13 a share, or
$1.3 billion, for 100 million shares of Nabisco Group under certain
conditions. The Nabisco board said that price ''does not come close

American telecommunication companies out of their markets. The
administration set deadlines for later this year for the barriers
to be removed and raised the prospect that cases would be brought
to the World Trade Organization if the most objectionable barriers

telecommunication practices were Germany, South Africa, Britain,
Canada, Peru, Israel and Taiwan. Last week, the administration

<HEADLINE> Justice Lets Black District Stand  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court justice rejected an emergency
request by Tennessee's top officials and cleared the way Tuesday
for use this year of a majority-black election district in West
Tennessee for the state House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first such Tennessee district outside the state's
four urban counties and could add a black representative to the
99-member House, which now has 13 black members.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens refused to postpone the effect of
federal court rulings that require use of new district lines
affecting voters in Madison, Hardeman, Haywood, Chester, Tipton and
Fayette counties.
</P>
<P>
   Those lines, adopted by the state Legislature as a contingency
in case of a successful court challenge, created a new district in
which a majority of the voters are black.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered the change in 1998 after ruling that the
districts created by the Legislature in 1992 violated the federal
Voting Rights Act by diluting black voters' political clout. That
ruling was upheld Monday by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In asking Stevens to temporarily set aside that ruling,
Tennessee Attorney General Paul Summers argued that the new
districts will prove too confusing for voters and potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who handles emergency matters from Tennessee for the
nation's highest court, issued a brief order unaccompanied by any
written opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this instance, the public interest lies in maintaining
stability in the affected House districts, not in changing the
district lines for this election -- especially since the district
lines will be altered in two years for the 2002 elections'' as a
result of this year's census, Summers said. ''To permit the 2000
primary and general elections to proceed under (the mandated plan)
will undoubtedly result in voter and candidate confusion for these
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying deadline for August's primary elections is
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The request was filed on behalf of Gov. Donald Sundquist,
Secretary of State Riley Darnell and other state officials.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the appeals court noted that 31 percent of West
Tennessee's voting age population is black but that none of the
five House districts from the six-county area is majority-black and
no black candidate has won an election in those districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''These circumstances simply overwhelm those factors that might
favor the state of Tennessee,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Sundquist vs. Rural West Tennessee African-American
Affairs Council, A-810.

<HEADLINE> Groups Lobby for Increased Privacy  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With increased protections to safeguard
drivers' license information set to begin in two months, consumer
advocacy groups Tuesday hailed its implementation and urged
Congress to do even more.
</P>
<P>
   But states' motor vehicles administrators said further
clarification is needed of the laws aimed at curbing states'
ability to sell the license information to businesses and political
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clarification would help ensure that state practices are more
uniform,'' Roger D. Cross, administrator of the Wisconsin Division
of Motor Vehicles, told the Senate appropriations transportation
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, most states will begin implementing provisions that
allow consumers to ''opt in'' to state programs that market their
personal information, a change from the current ''opt out''
provision. Under the change, consumer confidentiality is
essentially assumed unless otherwise notified.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of states whose state legislatures did not meet this
year were given extensions to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Cross said states are confused about the interpretation of
''express consent'' and many may close records for marketing
purposes to avoid the costs of the new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups hailed the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government does not own its listings of our name, address,
phone number, Social Security number, photograph or other personal
information just because we are required to provide them for
specific purposes,'' said Phyllis Schafly, president of the
conservative Eagle Forum. ''It's bad enough when private interests
invade our privacy, but it's positively offensive when the
government does this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates say further changes should include a
permanent ban on the sharing of information or building of
databases and tough enforcement of states that don't comply.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no options,'' said Susan Herman, executive
director of the National Center for Victims of Crime. ''Drivers'
personal information should never be released except as outlined in
the act.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's changes strengthened the 1994 Driver's Privacy
Protection Act, which required states to give licensed drivers the
option to keep their contact information confidential. Disclosure
was limited to instances such as for law enforcement officials,
courts, government agencies and private investigators. States
responded by requiring consumers to ''out'' to prevent marketing of
their information.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the subcommittee chairman who
authored last year's amendments did not directly comment on the
push for more restrictions but said, ''American citizens should
have the power to put 'doors' on all aspects of their private lives
and to expect that anyone who wants to enter must seek and gain
consent.''

<HEADLINE> US Claims Unfair Telecom Practices  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Tuesday accused
Mexico, Canada, Britain and five other nations of erecting unfair
trade barriers to keep American telecommunications companies out of
their markets.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual review of barriers to competition in telephone
services, the administration did not announce that any immediate
cases would be filed with the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it set a series of upcoming deadlines for the countries
to remove the offending barriers or run the risk that WTO cases
would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she was
particularly concerned about Mexico, where she said the situation
was ''extremely serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The other nations named in the annual review of
telecommunication practices were Germany, South Africa, Britain,
Canada, Peru, Israel and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the administration issued a separate report accusing
Japan of violating its WTO commitments by refusing to lower
interconnection fees that U.S. telecommunication companies complain
are designed to keep them out of the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky on Tuesday set a deadline of July 28 for resolving
both the Japanese case and a separate case against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Mexico, it appears that progress toward a level playing
field for telecommunications carriers now is stalled,'' she said in
a statement. ''The United States will determine by July 28 whether
additional action, including in the WTO, would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Mexico was brought by a group of U.S.
companies including AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom. The U.S. companies
contend that the Mexican government and the nation's largest
telephone company, Telmex, have engaged in unfair practices aimed
at restricting access by foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T applauded the administration's decision, saying it sent the
right signal to countries attempting to keep their consumers from
benefiting from greater competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Policies that promote the care and feeding of monopolies must
end,'' AT&AMP;T said in a statement. ''The USTR's decision to further
investigate these countries sends the right signal and shows it is
prepared to act if the offending policies don't change.''
</P>
<P>
   Other review deadlines set by the administration today included
June 15 for Germany, South Africa and Britain, and Oct. 2 for
Canada and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration said it would monitor Israel's
performance in living up to its commitments to terminate
objectionable telephone barriers by Dec. 31, 2001, and watch to see
that Taiwan eliminates certain exclusive licensing arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Army Pushes $38B Buy of Helicopters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army said Tuesday that 40 percent of its
helicopters cannot be relied on in wartime and disclosed a
blueprint for improvement that includes buying 1,213 new-generation
Comanche helicopters for $38 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint included stark admissions of problems in Army
aviation, but senior officers who laid out the plan at a Pentagon
news conference expressed confidence that affordable solutions are
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't agree with the fact that we're in crisis,''
said Col. Pat Garman. ''A crisis is you don't have a clue what's
going on, and you don't have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan that Garman and other senior officers presented Tuesday
said ''just over 40 percent'' of the helicopters in the Army's
fleet are rated ''red,'' meaning they could not be counted on to
perform their wartime missions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also cited a ''dramatic decline'' in Army aviator
experience and skill over the past decade. It said today's aviation
battalion commander has an average of fewer than 1,000 hours of
flying time, compared with an average of 2,000 hours 10 years ago.
The drop-off has occurred up and down the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, aviation is headed in the wrong direction,'' the
blueprint said.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the experience shortfall, the Army plans to redesign its
training program. Basic flight training will be shortened and
advanced aviators given 50 percent more training time.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Army aviation in the 21st century is supposed
to be the Comanche, an armed reconnaissance helicopter with more
radar-evading stealth technology than any chopper in the current
fleet. It will replace the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior, which will be
retired in 2013, about seven years earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Comanche is being produced by Boeing Co. and Sikorsky
Aircraft Corp., a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Craig Hackett, director of Army requirements, told
reporters that despite recent speculation the Comanche program
would be scaled back or delayed to free money for other
modernizations, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki decided the
helicopter is vital to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army is fully committed to the Comanche,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The first Comanches are to enter the fleet in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the addition of the Comanche, the overall Army
helicopter fleet will be reduced from six types to four.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the AH-1 Cobras, combat mainstays in the Vietnam War
that now average 30 years old, will be retired this October, and
UH-1 Huey helicopters will be retired in 2004. That will leave the
UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter fleet, the Vietnam-era CH-47
Chinook transports and the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the modernization plan will require some new
investments, but he said the Army continues work on estimates of
how much more it will cost than is provided in the current Army
budget plan.

<HEADLINE> Witness Takes Stand in Marine Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain charged in the
heatstroke death of a reservist once compared his troops to dogs,
an infantry school instructor testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came during the second day of a court-martial for
Capt. Victor Arana, 28, of DuPage County, Ill. Arana is charged
with dereliction of duty and failure to obey an order in the death
last July 7 of Lance Cpl. Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto, 21, a reservist
from New Milford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Arana marched Leto's 180-man unit too fast
without adequate rest breaks in the humid July heat and didn't seem
to care about his troops. Defense lawyers contend Arana wasn't
given proper guidance by his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Lloyd Freeman, second in command at Camp Lejeune's
infantry school training battalion, said he talked to Arana after
noticing that Arana's sergeant had a negative attitude about
Marines in his company.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Well, I see them like dogs. You tell them what to do
and you don't worry about their feelings,''' Lloyd testified. ''At
that point I was shocked. ... I think I said, 'I'm glad I wasn't
around as an enlisted man with you as a leader.'''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman also said he felt company commanders at the infantry
school pushed new Marines too hard on conditioning hikes. He said
he was particularly concerned about heat casualties during hot
months.
</P>
<P>
   Arana faces a maximum sentence of nine months in prison and
dismissal from the Corps if convicted of both charges. A judge is
hearing the trial without a jury.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Dow Fall 500, Cut Losses  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index plunged more than 574
points today, sending the broader market on a steep slide, as
investors grew increasingly pessimistic about the future of
technology stocks. Buying from bargain hunters in late trading
helped lift stocks from their early lows.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled once the Nasdaq plunged below 4,000 for the first
time since Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was off
220.62 at 4,003.06. At its low point, the Nasdaq fell 574.57 to
3,649.11 -- its lowest level since Dec. 15 -- and was down more than
923 points in two days, having dropped 349.15 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day selloff knocked the Nasdaq 27.7 percent below its
March 10 record of 5,048.62. Historically, Wall Street has
considered a drop of 20 percent from a peak the hallmark of a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, analysts were reluctant to predict
whether the current decline means that the end of the long bull
market in high-tech stocks is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the bottom may be in place. That's not to say that we
won't go back down and test these levels,'' said Brian G. Belski,
chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth and sharpness of the technology selloff ultimately
pulled the broad market into a powerful decline. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down as much as 503 points before recovering
to a loss of 116.73 at 11,105.20.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 39.65 at 1,466.28.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which nearly
matches the Nasdaq in its heavy weighting of technology stocks,
plunged 26.93 to 489.11.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq was long overdue to drop from the
heights it reached early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it is to believe, this is a good thing,'' said Pete
Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ''One sector of the market was insanely
overvalued. The rest was deeply undervalued. Now we are reversing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of technology stocks sustained crushing losses.
Veritas Software fell 10 15/16 to 100 9/16, Exodus Communications
fell 7 13/16 to 115 and JDS Uniphase fell 12 1/16 to 99 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-known names, which some investors had been
clinging to as a safe haven, collapsed early today, but then erased
much of those losses. Cisco Systems was down 1 15/16 to 71, and
Oracle fell 5 7/16 to 71 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Monday's rout -- Microsoft -- slipped again.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging 15] to 90~ on Monday, Microsoft fell another 4
3/16 to 86 11/16 today. After the close of trading Monday, a
federal judge ruled the company violated U.S. antitrust laws by
mounting a ''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet
browser market. The ruling could lead to drastic punishment,
including a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's pressures came from three M's: Microsoft, margin calls
and mounting anxiety,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president
at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology shares, which have fallen prey to investors'
worries that their prices ran up too quickly in recent months, slid
once more today, lending credibility to analysts' belief that
Microsoft wasn't solely responsible for the technology selloff
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, technology shares had been ripe for a further
correction,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''The Microsoft news merely
provided a handy excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   As stocks have fallen, investors who bought securities on
margin, or on credit, have had to sell their shares and repay their
loans to brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.25 billion shares,
compared with 776.26 million at the same time Monday.

<P>
   PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- Boot camp with the Army Rangers
wasn't the Hollywood experience Ben Affleck envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The star of ''Dogma'' and ''Chasing Amy'' spent four days with
the Rangers to get a taste of military life for his role in Walt
Disney's upcoming ''Pearl Harbor'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him was the film's co-star, Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it was going to be an actor-y kind of boot camp,
where they teach you to salute,'' Affleck said. ''It wasn't quite
that. It was more like the first 20 minutes of 'Full Metal Jacket,'
but it was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''I don't think I scrubbed a urinal in my entire
life.''
</P>

   In the $135 million ''Pearl Harbor'' film, Affleck and Hartnett
play fighter pilots from Tennessee who fall in love with the same

<HEADLINE> Stock Fall Pinches Commodities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures fell sharply Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as investors and funds yanked their
money when U.S. stock markets went into free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans fell more than half the 30-cent-a-bushel limit before
cutting their losses in half by the end of the session as equities
rebounded. Prices also were pressured by followthrough from
Monday's weak close and new forecasts for rain in the still-dry
Midwest late this week.
</P>
<P>
   Corn also took stock market-related losses, with funds taking
profits in commodities to cover losses in equities. The bearish
mood was added to by concerns that foot-in-mouth disease in South
Korea will spread. The additional slaughter of cattle, if needed as
a result of the disease, would cut into demand for both corn and
soymeal as feed.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat trading was lighter but prices also were hurt by the stock
market's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 2 cents to $2.55} a bushel; May corn
fell 2\ cents to $2.32 a bushel; July oats fell } cent to $1.20\ a
bushel; May soybeans fell 8 cents to $5.38{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, in a slide also accelerated by the stock market selloff.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle fell .48 cent to 68.67 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .73 cent to 83.17 cents a pound; June lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Market Turmoil Could Hurt Countries  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many developing countries are bouncing back
from the global financial crisis that started 2{ years ago but risk
turmoil again if the flow of capital should become volatile again,
the World Bank said Monday in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Another threat to these nations' recovery is the possibility of
a sharp economic slowdown in the United States, a major provider of
investment funds. Stronger economic growth in Europe and Japan and
expanded world trade could offset any U.S decline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In an annual report called ''Global Development Finance,'' the
World Bank said the global economy would grow by 3.5 percent in
2000, compared with 2.9 percent in 1999. Last December the bank
forecast world global growth at 2.9 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said in developing countries average growth was likely
to reach 4.6 percent in 2000 and climb slightly higher to 4.8
percent in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank warned that 41 low-income countries, with a
combined population of more than one billion people, will barely
cross the threshold into positive growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''This underscores the still fragile path of reform and recovery
that lies ahead for these countries,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial crises has abated in Asia, Russia and Latin
America, the report said, ''the next decade may well see another
capital boom to emerging markets, accompanied again by high
volatility of capital flows.''
</P>
<P>
   It said the current pause in flight capital movements could last
for some years, providing developing countries with breathing room
to protect against future chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Dadush, director of the bank group that produced the report,
said developing countries should use this time ''every hour, every
day to improve their economic fundamentals, strengthen their
banking systems and carry out other reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The report explores short-term safeguards countries can adopt to
guard against rapid capital inflows and outflows such as imposing
controls as Chile and Malaysia have tried in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary
Fund, used to routinely oppose such controls, but in recent months,
both have said such measures can be useful if carefully applied for
a limited period.
</P>
<P>
   But capital controls and bank reform cannot substitute for the
economic fundamentals, the report said. ''For example they cannot
protect countries against the consequences of large fiscal deficits
over overvalued currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank said that despite the financial crises, foreign direct
investment in developing countries continued, rising to $192
billion in 1999 compared with $35 billion eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that to encourage this investment, developing
countries should rely more heavily on trade, diversify their
economies and achieve greater competetiveness.

<HEADLINE> Disney Workers Can Sport Mustaches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Attention Disney workers: Don't
throw out those razors just yet.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Walt Disney executives said they were relaxing a
decades-old policy that prohibited theme-park workers from sporting
mustaches on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy has a caveat: You can only grow a mustache on
vacation, and not at work.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney World spokesman Bill Warren said there's nothing
unusual about the caveat in the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very common corporate guideline that you should grow a
mustache on your vacation so you wouldn't have an unkempt
appearance,'' Warren said. ''I'm not a hair expert, but I'm sure
someone can grow a mustache in a reasonable amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren said apparent confusion among workers means that
''somebody didn't get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney officials decided to scrap the mustache ban -- which had
been in place since 1957 -- in order to make it easier to recruit
employees in a tight labor market.

<HEADLINE> Havana Gives Gonzalez Kin Visas  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials in Havana issued visas today to
Elian Gonzalez's father and his immediate family, as negotiations
resumed in Miami over how custody of the 6-year-old Cuban boy will
be transferred to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department approved visas Monday for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, his wife, their infant son, a male cousin of Elian's, a
pediatrician and a kindergarten teacher. U.S. officials in Havana
confirmed today that the visas have been affixed to their
passports.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez has said he would come to the United States
only if he could be assured custody of his son, who has been living
with relatives in Miami since he was rescued off the Florida coast
more than four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear today when he might travel to Washington or
where a custody transfer might take place. Officials said one
possibility was a reunion between father and son in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Miami recessed around lunchtime today as usual, and
a family attorney said they had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not heard from the attorneys for the relatives in
Miami that they consider the talks to have been broken off,''
Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said this afternoon. ''We continue
to hope that we can all work together to resolve this in a fair,
orderly and prompt manner.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official, requesting anonymity, said that
absent a transfer agreement, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service would send the Miami relatives a letter formally
transferring custody to the father. A second letter shortly
thereafter would provide instructions on how and when that transfer
should occur.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice official rejected the Miami family's suggestion that
Elian's future be decided by a panel of psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could conceivably see using medical experts to determine
how best the transfer should happen, but not whether it will
happen,'' said the Justice official, who requested anonymity. A
federal judge has upheld the authority of the INS to order Elian's
return to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice official did not anticipate that Elian's father
would arrive in this country today. Immigration officials are still
discussing with the father's lawyer the details of when and how
Elian would be returned to Juan Miguel's custody, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin who has been helping care for
Elian, said she still has not told the boy his father is coming.
The last time she mentioned the possibility, she said, the boy
cried through a weekend and the father did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a precaution, I will not tell him until everything is
certain.'' When someone mentions that his father might be coming,
she said, ''All he asks me is 'please don't let them take me.'''
She was hospitalized today after becoming ill following an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 protesters chanting ''Elian is not leaving'' broke
down a barrier today separating them from the home where the boy
has been staying. They linked arms and former a chain around the
home. City of Miami police did nothing to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who has taken heat from some fellow
Democrats for advocating permanent residency for the boy, said
today on NBC's ''Today'' that the father should be allowed to
return the son to Cuba ''if the father says on free soil that he
believes that the son should go back to Cuba with him.'' However,
he said the boy's fate should be left to a family court -- not to
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who unsuccessfully sought the
Republican presidential nomination, told ''Today'': ''The ideal
arrangement would be dual citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his party would
initially come to Washington and remain at the home of Fernando
Remirez, Cuba's top diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it was reviewing visa requests from 22
other Cubans, including 12 classmates of Elian. One request was
from Ricardo Alarcon, who is president of the Cuban National
Assembly and a top adviser to President Fidel Castro on U.S.
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asked today why the six
were chosen, said, ''The point was to try to make it a group that
was useful for the child. We have to keep the interest of the child
central here.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of Americans approve of the government's
decision to send the boy back to Cuba to be with his father,
according to a Gallup Poll released today. Just over half of those
polled said the Clinton administration is making its decision based
on what it feels is in the best interest of U.S. relations with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department threat to order Elian's deportation by
today unless his relatives in Miami agreed to accept the outcome of
pending court action was dropped in anticipation of the arrival of
the father. Robert Wallis, the Immigration Service's director for
the Miami district, said Monday, ''Once Mr. Gonzalez comes, the INS
will begin transferring parole care from Lazaro Gonzalez to the
boy's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis said that ''does not mean that the child will be
immediately removed from the home of the great-uncle. Instead it is
our hope to begin a smooth and orderly process that will create as
little disruption as possible to Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez said Monday night, ''If the father comes or not
we don't know, but he is welcome here. Don't ever doubt the
Gonzalez family has their door open for their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the great-uncle's home, protesters practiced forming a
human chain and vowed they would stop at nothing to keep the boy
from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters stamped their feet as Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader
of the Miami-based anti-Castro group Democracy Movement, used a
bullhorn to call for Cuban-Americans to come to the home to protect
Elian. The Miami area has nearly 800,000 Cuban-American residents.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush met with safety officials to determine how
to respond to possible unrest if Elian is removed from the Little
Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas' statement last
week that local authorities would not assist the federal government
if it attempted to remove Elian, the county police department said
it is ready to respond to protests.

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross Has New Tour, Supremes  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thirty years after Diana Ross left the Supremes,
the sexy diva of '60s pop is back with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   In pink leather and lipstick to match, Ross strutted into a news
conference Tuesday at Grand Central Terminal where she and two new
backup singers announced plans for a U.S. tour featuring the
group's timeless Motown hits.
</P>
<P>
   They're all Supremes -- Ross, Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne --
but it's far froma reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has never performed on stage together. Laurence became
a Supreme in 1971 -- a year after Ross left to start a solo career --
and Payne joined in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Ross said, they can sing exactly four Supremes
songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was never called a reunion tour; I never considered it a
reunion tour,'' Ross told the crowded news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ross had hoped to walk on stage at the tour's June 14 debut with
original Supreme Mary Wilson, but efforts to sign her for the tour
fell through. The third original Supreme, Florence Ballard, died in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think where the breakdown came was with Mary and the
promoters,'' Ross said. ''I don't think anyone was willing to go as
far as Mary wanted. I wish she was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Arthur Fogel refused to discuss specifics of the
negotiations, but confirmed that efforts to add Wilson ended
without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Reunions and re-pairings of once-fractured bands like the
Supremes are inevitably lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen's tour with the E Street Band generated $61.4
million last year; and the Eagles and Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young
are still selling out arenas long after their last hits.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to hear Ross reprise the first wildly successful girl
group's catalog for the first time in three decades are going for
$39.50 to $125.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-show tour may be ''a once-in-a-lifetime chance,'' Ross
said Tuesday. ''The reason we're doing this is for our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 56, said fans can expect to hear all the Supreme's
chart-topping hits, among them: ''Where Did Our Love Go,'' ''Baby
Love,'' ''Stop! In the Name of Love'' and ''Back in My Arms
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Return to Love'' tour opens June 14 in Philadelphia and
runs through Aug. 5, with a finale at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
Tickets for the shows in Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, New York
and Boston go on sale next week.

<HEADLINE> Study May Link Between Milk, Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A large study raises the possibility that
consuming lots of milk and other dairy products may modestly raise
the risk of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The case is far from settled, but researchers say the study at
least raises questions about the usual assumption that getting
plenty of calcium from supplements and food is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not, based on this study, recommend that men drastically
change their intake of dairy foods,'' said June M. Chan, an
epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, researchers note that a few other studies have
found similar results, and together they suggest a need for more
rigorous examination of calcium's effects on health.
</P>
<P>
   Chan presented the results Tuesday in San Francisco at a meeting
of the American Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on the Physicians' Health Study, a
landmark study that proved that aspirin prevents heart attacks.
Between 1982 and 1984, 20,885 male doctors were questioned about
their eating habits, including their consumption of skim milk,
whole milk, cheese and ice cream. During the next 10 years, 904 of
them developed prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that men who consumed at least 2{ servings
of dairy food daily were about 30 percent more likely to develop
prostate cancer than were those who averaged less than half a
serving a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a weak correlation, but there is some scientific reason
to believe it,'' said biologist Donald Coffey of Johns Hopkins
University, a prostate cancer expert.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have shown that calcium can lower the body's
levels of the most active form of vitamin D, known as 1,25
dihydroxyvitamin D, and this vitamin in turn may help protect
against prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, of course, is a rich source of calcium. And even though it
is fortified with vitamin D, the calcium in milk might actually
lower the body's supply of the active form of the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study found that men who consumed more than six
glasses of milk a week had lower levels of this form of vitamin D
in their bloodstreams than those who drank less than two.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research from the same team found an even stronger link.
That work, called the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, found
that men who consumed high amounts of dairy products had a 70
percent increased risk of prostate cancer. Those who also took
calcium supplements had about a threefold increase.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the reports ''add a little caution about
increasing consumption of milk and calcium supplements,'' Dr.
Edward Giovannucci, a co-author of the studies. ''We ought to
understand the potential downside.''

<HEADLINE> Air France Pilots To Speak English  </HEADLINE>
By JASON STRAZIUSO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Parlez-vous anglais? Air France pilots on final
approach to Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport will have to from now
on.
</P>
<P>
   France's national airline said the decision to order its pilots
to speak English in all radio communication with air traffic
control is designed to improve safety. But French enthusiasts are
outraged and say it's another example of the English language's
creeping worldwide dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Air France officials, defending the policy that took effect
March 23, contend that the language spoken by pilots and air
traffic control is not a question of culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often, other pilots in the area who don't speak French can't
understand when the pilots and the control tower communicates,''
said Jean-Claude Couturier, a spokesman for Air France. ''We wanted
to do this before something tragic happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marceau Dechamps, vice president of the group Defense of the
French Language, said the prohibition of French was
''inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''French pilots should absolutely be allowed to speak French,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the new rule improves safety for surrounding
pilots is flawed, Dechamps said, contending that the new rule
impedes communication.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't know the language of the country, it's good to
speak in English, but to tell French people not to speak French is
foolish,'' Dechamps said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Quebec's minister responsible for the French language
Charter, Louise Beaudoin, lambasted the decision as ''scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The imperialism of English must have some limits,'' said
Beaudoin on a visit to Paris on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The French government is reserving judgment on Air France's
decision until it can study the decision's impact on safety, French
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Francois Rivasseau said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now it hasn't been an issue,'' Rivasseau said. ''There
are certain advantages to speaking one's mother tongue in exchanges
with air control.''

<HEADLINE> Doomsday Sect's Handbook Had Message  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANUNGA, Uganda (AP) -- In a 163-page handbook distributed across
Uganda, a doomsday sect offered a seductive message of heavenly
salvation to African villagers struggling with poverty and the
scourge of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   For the unconvinced there was a different fate -- a fiery torment
where they would burn for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The paperbound tract, ''A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of
the Present Times,'' was distributed by the thousands; The
Associated Press obtained a copy from a man in the southwestern
village of Rugazi who said cult members tried unsuccessfully to
recruit him.
</P>
<P>
   It offers little but stark choices and homespun advice for
righteous living. For hundreds who adhered to its tenets, the
reward was ultimately a vicious death.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say leaders of the Movement for the Restoration of
the Ten Commandments of God masterminded the killings of at least
924 followers between late February and mid-March. Police say 530
burned alive inside a chapel at the sect's base in Kanungu; 394
bodies were found buried or hidden at sect compounds.
</P>
<P>
   According to survivors of the movement, sect members demanded
the return of possessions they had surrendered to the cult after
the world failed to end on Dec. 31, as the leaders had predicted --
a demand said to have triggered the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-part tract -- with a picture of a bleeding, crucified
Christ on its cover -- rarely refers to the surrendering of goods,
noting only that the movement ''resolves that each person should
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it focuses on Uganda's afflictions, casting them as
satanic, with obedience to the Ten Commandments the only cure.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, which has killed hundreds of thousands of Ugandans since
the early 1980s, is divine punishment caused by beer-drinking and
by perverse sexual practices that ''increase the anger of the
Almighty God,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   All alcohol is ''now under the control of Satan,'' it warns.
''If anyone wants to go to heaven and is drinking he should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   For the unwary, evil lurks everywhere. Herbalists -- called
''witch doctors'' by cult members but relied on by many Ugandans
for medical care -- are in the ''company of the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Even animals aren't spared: ''Cats and dogs are already
possessed by the devil. From these animals Satan is actually
fighting against man, particularly those who own animals.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the booklet, Ugandans aren't alone in facing
judgment. Cities and countries also must repent or face punishment,
it says, giving these admonitions:
</P>
<P>
   London? ''Your desire for doing evil will be fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico? ''Heavy arms that are going to destroy five countries
will be transported through your roads.''
</P>
<P>
   France? ''Your laziness will not permit you to endure the
chastisement that will be inflicted upon you until you are
destroyed in lamentations.''
</P>
<P>
   Because their membership drew heavily on Roman Catholics unhappy
with, but still loyal to, their church, the writers were eager to
stress they were not establishing a new faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ours is not a religion, but a movement that endeavors to make
the people aware of the fact that the Commandments of God have been
abandoned, and it gives what should be done for their observance.''
</P>
<P>
   Churches and religious movements come and go frequently in
Uganda's roiling religious marketplace as people seek answers to
life's questions and relief from its burdens. ''In Kampala, you
cannot make two steps without meeting a religion,'' the writers
remark.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet also strives to buttress the legitimacy of the
sect's leaders. Joseph Kibwetere, Credonia Mwerinde and her sister
Angelina Migisha each receive a chapter devoted to the visions they
claimed to have received from Jesus and the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The visions are used to give divine sanction to the sect's bans
on conversation, sex, cosmetics and short skirts, and support for
its harsh regimen of fasting, prayer and work.
</P>
<P>
   With the death toll caused by AIDS and the reigns of terror led
by former Presidents Idi Amin and Milton Obote, apocalypse is a
familiar idiom to Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the booklet, last updated in 1996, gives little attention to
the sect's end-of-the-world prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   What it does mention is haunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lord told me that hurricanes of fire would rain forth from
heaven and spread over those who would not have repented...This
fire will also reach inside the buildings; there is no way one can
escape.''

<HEADLINE> African, European Leaders End Summit  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- With little action but lots of hugs,
handshakes and warm words, African and European leaders promised
Tuesday to mend their lopsided relationship and not let old
colonial grudges spoil their inaugural goodwill summit.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the 67 nations promised to improve cooperation to
help Africa escape the spiral of debt, disaster and war which has
turned the continent into the world's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-day summit -- where delegates in colorful African
dresses known as ''boubou'' mixed with counterparts in stern gray
suits -- was short on concrete commitments to alleviate Africa's
staggering debt and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This summit has united us formally for the first time,'' said
Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief. But he
warned that ''we need to know each other better if we are to build
a true partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit host, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said the summit
broke new ground. ''We witnessed the birth of a new partnership,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A century of colonial exploitation could not be fully expelled
from the meeting, held in a sprawling conference center between the
Nile and the desert, as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi lashed out at
Europe for lecturing and trying to divide Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stop looking at us as slaves,'' Gadhafi told the leaders late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday however, Gadhafi received a host of European and
African leaders including Germany's Gerhard Schroeder and Spain's
Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   With international ostracism of Libya fading after the
suspension of U.N. sanctions in April 1999, Gadhafi has appeared
willing to build ties with Europe, which is equally keen to do
business with Libya given its vast oil and gas potential.
</P>
<P>
   Other African leaders also chided the Europeans for lecturing
them.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe reminded Britain Monday that Zimbabwe
was no longer its colony, before going on Tuesday to smooth over
the two countries' dispute over the suppression of protests in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed out that democracy could not come without
development and insisted the old colonial masters should do more to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Germany made a promise of $350 million in debt relief for some
30 of Africa's poorest and most indebted nations and Spain added a
new promise of some $200 million. Africa's overall debt, however,
stands at $350 billion and African leaders left the summit with
little relief.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac chided European businessmen for
not investing more in the underdeveloped nations and accused them
of being ''Afro-pessimists.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing that can happen to the world economy, he said,
is for ''a fewer number of rich countries get richer and a growing
number of poor countries get poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint declaration, the leaders said they ''deplore the
intolerable fact that more than half of all Africans are living in
absolute poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   But to turn this around, EU Development Commissioner Poul
Nielson said, ''doing something credible about corruption is the
best confidence building measure to attract investment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was clear that corruption and poverty form a vicious
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Human rights must be paralleled by the right to food, water,
health and education,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are to meet again in Greece in 2003. That will be
the first summit on Africa held in Europe since the 1884 Berlin
Conference, which set of the colonial ''Scramble for Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our continent was then the hottest cake in town, and everyone
wanted a slice,'' said Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo.
''Africa's condition today is hardly a happy one.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Misuse Alleged in D.C. Bureau  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bureau of Indian Affairs officials
acknowledged Tuesday the agency has a ''department-wide problem''
with employees misusing and failing to pay bills for their
government credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   BIA managers say they have fired some employees, disciplined
others and sought criminal charges against a few.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a problem, and it's one that we will not tolerate
from the employees,'' BIA head Kevin Gover told a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Gover said he did not know how many of the BIA's more than 9,000
employees were issued cards and which misused them. He said he
would give that information to the Senate panel later.
</P>
<P>
   The Billings Gazette reported Monday that 13 BIA employees in
Montana and Wyoming have been disciplined, and one indicted, for
misusing the cards. It also quoted the No. 2 official in the
Montana-Wyoming office as saying ''virtually everyone'' got a card.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., expressed disappointment at the
latest problem to befall BIA, which has been plagued by management
lapses and has acknowledged mishandling $3 billion in Indian trust
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me it is not a good policy to issue a credit
card'' to nearly every BIA worker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gover said the agency got credit cards in employees' names to
help them pay for travel expenses and office supplies. Paying with
a credit card means vendors get their money more quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are supposed to pay their credit card bills with
reimbursements from the BIA. Charges for personal items are not
allowed, Gover said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Trustee, a semi-independent subset of the
BIA which oversees Indian trust fund reform efforts, has fired some
workers for misusing their credit cards, Acting Special Trustee
Tommy Thompson told the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did put the hammer down on people who were not paying their
bills,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gover said the BIA changed its regulations Monday to allow the
government credit card debts to be deducted from workers'
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they leave the government, our option is to sue them to get
it back,'' Gover said.
</P>
<P>
   The BIA said Leroy J. Headdress, a civil engineering technician
working on the Fort Peck Reservation in northeastern Montana, was
arraigned last month on federal charges accusing him of nearly
$8,000 in unauthorized charges, much of in the form of cash
advances. Headdress has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Other BIA employees accused of abusing their cards received
suspensions and were ordered to pay unauthorized charges.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Dow End Only Somewhat Lower  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the most volatile day ever for U.S. stocks,
the Nasdaq composite index and the Dow Jones industrial average
each plunged more than 500 points today before reversing course as
buyers flooded back into the battered market.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing pessimism among investors about the future of
technology stocks set off a 574 point slide in the Nasdaq and sent
the index below 4,000 for the first time since Feb. 1. That spurred
a steep selloff in the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   But bargain hunters looking for cheap deals after a two-day rout
entered the market in late trading and helped lift stocks from
their lows.
</P>
<P>
   At its low point, the Nasdaq fell 574.57 to 3,649.11; it climbed
as high as 4,283.45 in the first minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.85 to 11,175.08.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 12.91 to 1,493.06, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 74.79 to 4,148.89.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,065 up, 2,038 down and 381
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.5 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.02
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 15.38 at
500.66.
</P>
<P>
   The 634-point swing was the biggest ever for the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Today's losses added to a 349.15 drop on Monday. At its lowest
levels today, the Nasdaq was 27.7 percent below its March 10 record
of 5,048.62. Historically, Wall Street has considered a drop of 20
percent from a peak the hallmark of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, were reluctant to predict whether the decline
meant that the end of the long bull market in high-tech stocks is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the bottom may be in place. That's not to say that we
won't go back down and test these levels,'' said Brian G. Belski,
chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth and sharpness of the technology selloff ultimately
pulled the broad market into a powerful decline. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 196 points in early trading, then fell as
much as 503 before recovering to a loss of about 46.85 at
11,175.08. The 700.46-point swing from high to low was the biggest
on record for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Nasdaq was long overdue to drop from the
heights it reached early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it is to believe, this is a good thing,'' said Pete
Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial
Advisors in Minneapolis. ''One sector of the market was insanely
overvalued. The rest was deeply undervalued. Now we are reversing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of technology stocks sustained crushing losses,
but managed to bounce higher as buyers flooded the market late in
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Veritas Software fell 1 9/16 at 109 15/16, up from its 23-point
decline. Exodus Communications, down more than 30 early today,
finished the day up 14 7/16 at 137\.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-known names, which some investors had been
clinging to as a safe haven, plunged early today, but then erased
much of those losses. Cisco Systems, which was down nearly 9, ended
up 5/16 at $73.25, while Oracle recovered from a loss of 12 to
finish down 11/16 at 76 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Monday's rout -- Microsoft -- slipped again.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging 15] to 90~ on Monday, Microsoft fell another 2
5/16 to 88 9/16 today. After the close of trading Monday, a federal
judge ruled the company violated U.S. antitrust laws by mounting a
''deliberate assault'' on competition in the Internet browser
market. The ruling could lead to drastic punishment, including a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's pressures came from three M's: Microsoft, margin calls
and mounting anxiety,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president
at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller technology shares, which have fallen prey to investors'
worries that their prices ran up too quickly in recent months, slid
once more today, lending credibility to analysts' belief that
Microsoft wasn't solely responsible for the technology selloff
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In hindsight, technology shares had been ripe for a further
correction,'' said Scott J. Brown, chief economist at Raymond James
&AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''The Microsoft news merely
provided a handy excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   As stocks have fallen, investors who bought securities on
margin, or on credit, have had to sell their shares and repay their
loans to brokerages.

<HEADLINE> Elian Demonstrators Break Barricade  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Scores of anti-Castro demonstrators surged through
a police barricade and formed a human chain around Elian Gonzalez's
house Tuesday, vowing to resist any attempt by the U.S. government
to remove the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Miami police stood by and watched.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian won't go!'' demonstrators chanted as they linked arms
around the small white house in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd grew edgy during the hot day as they learned that a
visa had been granted to Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, so
he can come from Cuba to the United States and be reunited with his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Delrish Moss said the demonstrators would be allowed
to blow off steam for a while and would then be asked to move back.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old boy has been the focus of an international
tug-of-war since Thanksgiving, after his mother and 10 other Cubans
drowned when their boat sank during an attempt to reach the United
States. Elian was rescued from an inner tube and placed in the care
of relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There have been regular, emotional protests in Little Havana for
months, and anti-Castro groups have called on the Cuban-American
community to prepare to form a human chain around the house if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters surged through the metal barricade because of a
rumor that federal agents were en route in a bus or van to take
Elian away in preparation for a reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   While the father and his immediate family were granted U.S.
visas, it was not clear when he might travel or where a custody
transfer might take place.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been negotiating with the Miami
relatives on a plan for a handover. The talks in Miami recessed
around lunchtime Tuesday as usual, and a family attorney said they
had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators said they were ready to be arrested for
Elian's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to take all of us. We will not move,'' said Marta
Lara, 24, a mortgage broker. ''I sincerely hope he feels protected.
I don't want him to feel scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, president of the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, addressed the demonstrators through a bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will we commit any kind of acts of violence?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''No!'' the protesters shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the father to come here to this house and meet with
this family to resolve the issue,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Adorning the barricades and nearby utility poles were more than
20 white cardboard signs with the words: ''Pray for Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the cousin who has been Elian's stand-in
mother, Marisleysis Gonzalez, was hospitalized in stable condition
after becoming faint during a round of morning TV interviews.
Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said she had been vomiting and
hospital personnel were trying to feed her.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis' father, Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, urged
the government to allow an independent psychological evaluation of
Elian to determine if he might be harmed by a return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always complied with the law, and will continue to
do,'' he said in a statement. ''What we are not prepared to do is
to participate in any action that will cause harm to the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been kept out of school and taught at home recently
because the Miami relatives fear he may be taken away by federal
officials. The boy spent most of the day indoors but emerged before
noon and played with a small orange football.

<HEADLINE> Police Officer Killed in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A police officer was shot and killed
Tuesday as he tried to arrest a suspect in the beating of a white
farmer, union leaders said. The incident raised fears that the
conflict in Zimbabwe over land might escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Bothwell Mugariri said a constable had died on
the farm of landowner Ian Kay, who was beaten on Monday. Mugariri
said he had no further details and that authorities were
investigating the death.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Commercial Farmers Union said police had arrested
three suspects in Kay's beating and were believed to be carrying
out further arrests when gunshots were heard on Kay's property.
Farmers said they saw the body of a policeman being lifted into a
police vehicle, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   The death was a serious escalation in a monthlong standoff
between white landowners and squatters, who are being led by the
veterans of Zimbabwe's 1980 independence war.
</P>
<P>
   Since early February, armed squatters and veterans have smashed
their way onto white-owned homesteads and staked claims on the
land. Police have ignored a court ruling to evict illegal
squatters, who hold some 800 farms.
</P>
<P>
   Angry over Kay's beating, white farm owners threatened Tuesday
to start fighting back if nothing is done to curb the violence
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been threatened by these squatters for weeks now, but
this time they have crossed the line. If nothing is done, we'll
have no choice other than to fight back,'' one of Kay's neighbors
who asked not to be identified said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kay, 51, was hospitalized after being attacked Monday by 25
assailants who bound his wrists with wire, whipped him and beat him
in the head. He managed to run away when the attackers were
distracted by a vehicle approaching his corn and tobacco farm, near
the town of Marondera, about 75 miles east of Harare, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders met with area farmers in a bid to calm the charged
atmosphere. No details of the meeting were released, but the union
has been urging farmers not to retaliate against squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Kay was targeted because he is a known supporter
of the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party
challenging President Robert Mugabe's ruling party in elections
expected to be called in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has called the land occupations a justifiable political
protest against the descendants of white settlers who occupied land
without paying for it during the colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 white farmers own a third of the country's
productive agricultural land. About 1.5 million black families live
on the other two-thirds. A program of land reform since 1980 to
redistribute white-owned farms to landless blacks has been plagued
by corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties have accused Mugabe of inciting a potentially
explosive confrontation between farmers and squatters so that he
can declare a state of emergency that would give the government
sweeping powers ahead of national elections.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Announces Advances in Rice  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Researchers working for biotech giant Monsanto
announced Tuesday that they have created a rough draft of the
genetic makeup of rice -- a development that could lead to better
quality, higher yield crops to feed more people.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory at the University of Washington in Seattle, working
on contract for St. Louis-based Monsanto, used a gene sequencing
technique to largely decipher the genetic code for rice.
</P>
<P>
   To help speed work on completing the code, Monsanto says it will
give the data to the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project,
a 10-country consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The advance is expected to enable scientists to engineer rice
strains resistant to drought, salinity and insects. The results
will form the basis for study of crops like corn, sorghum and
wheat, said Leroy Hood, head of the laboratory where the research
was done.
</P>
<P>
   Hood spoke at a news conference in Beijing via a video link from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we decipher the rice genome, we will have the equivalent
of an encyclopedia that contains the instructions for creating a
life form,'' Hood said, likening the current level of progress to
an encyclopedia with ''occasional words misspelled or occasional
words deleted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the beginning of being able to engineer rice plants that
have higher yields, have greater food quality, that are more
protected against drought and against insects,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   While the consortium has finished sequencing 3 or 4 percent of
the rice genome, Monsanto has now very broadly mapped the overall
genome, said Gerard Barry, a Monsanto researcher in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Guerinot, professor of biological sciences at Dartmouth
College in Hanover, N.H., said the work represents ''a very
significant development'' and will help speed efforts to sequence
the entire rice genome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rice is such an important crop,'' she said. ''Over half the
world's people eat rice every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The work comes as farmers in industrialized countries, reacting
to consumer resistance, are cutting back on acreage sown with
genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Bioengineered foods are created by splicing genes from the DNA
of one organism and inserting it into another organism's genes.
Such techniques have raised worries that genetically modified
organisms could harm humans and animals, and may cause other
vegetation to mutate or create other ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that are developing the genetically engineered
seeds -- Monsanto, DuPont, Aventis, Novartis and AstraZeneca --
insist they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   In developing countries like China, which supports a fifth of
the world's population with only 7 percent of the world's arable
land, the need to ensure that food production keeps pace with
population growth has tended to outweigh worries about potential
risks from genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''This technology is very important for food security,
especially in China, India and Africa,'' said Chen Zhangliang, vice
president of Peking University and head of the college's Pioneer
Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is the world's most common staple food and China is the
world's largest rice producer. In 1999, it harvested 200.7 million
tons out of a global rice harvest of 588.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese scientists at the Beijing news conference said the
Monsanto research could, in four to five years, enable Chinese
farmers to plant crops with much higher yields.
</P>
<P>
   They applauded the company's decision to provide data obtained
through private research to the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will make a great contribution to our own research,''
said Chen. ''This will save us huge amounts of money and huge
amounts of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto officials would not say how much money the company
spent on the rice genome project.

<HEADLINE> Teacher charged with having sex with chat-room teen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A middle school teacher was suspended
with pay after being charged with having sex with a 15-year-old boy
he met in an Internet chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The offense came to light last week when Anthony Chalmers, 26,
took a routine lie detector test as part of his application to
become a Rochester police officer, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers, of the Rochester suburb of Greece, pleaded innocent
Friday to third-degree sodomy and was released without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers was a sixth-grade teacher at Monroe Middle School until
he was suspended after his arrest Thursday. According to court
records, he had sexual encounters with the teen between Feb. 19 and
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the teen, who lives in Rochester, was not one of
Chalmers' students.
</P>
<P>
   Lie detector tests are a standard practice as part of a criminal
background check for police officer candidates, Monroe County
District Attorney Howard Relin said in Tuesday's Rochester Democrat
and Chronicle.

<HEADLINE> Thomson Travel Nixes German Buyout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thomson Travel PLC, Britain's biggest chartered
tour operator, on Tuesday rejected a planned buyout offer of nearly
$2.1 billion from Germany's C&AMP;N Touristic AG.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's board of directors announced the decision after
meeting to consider the expected bid from C&AMP;N, a joint venture
between Kardstadt-Quelle AG and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
</P>
<P>
   ''The board is unanimously of the view that such an offer, if
made, would be wholly inadequate, and the board would recommend
that shareholders reject any such offer,'' Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   C&AMP;N, citing Thomson's poor financial performance, said earlier
Tuesday that it plans to make a cash offer of 130 pence ($2.08) per
share that would value Thomson at nearly $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The offer would represent a 37 percent premium to Thomson's
closing share price Monday of 95.25 pence ($1.52).
</P>
<P>
   ''Thomson's performance as a quoted company has been
disappointing, and in the last year shareholders have suffered a
collapse in the company's share price and have seen a marked
deterioration in its financial performance,'' C&AMP;N said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, the business is in a vulnerable position and
shareholder value remains exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company said it was eager to gain a foothold
in Britain, where it currently has no presence.
</P>
<P>
   The German company, Europe's third-largest tour business,
increased its holding of Thomson stock to 4.8 percent on Tuesday,
up from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Travel shares closed 36 percent higher at 129.5 pence
($2.07).
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, founded in 1965, was one of the first tour groups to
fly large numbers of Britons to Mediterranean resorts. It issued
three profit warnings last year, the most recent because of poor
sales related to millennium New Year's holidays.
</P>
<P>
   C&AMP;N was formed from a merger in 1998 of Lufthansa's charter
airline Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Karstadt Quelle's tour operator
NUR Touristic GmbH.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Targets Illness Tax Shelter  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A charitable tax shelter cannot be based on
the life expectancy of a seriously ill person unless that person is
directly related to the beneficiaries or donors, under regulations
announced Tuesday by the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the current practice ''ghoulish and grotesque,''
Treasury officials said these charitable trusts are being marketed
to help the wealthy escape taxes by inflating the amount of
interest that can be deducted on federal income, gift and estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem involves so-called charitable lead trusts in which
part of the money goes to a charity and part goes to other
noncharity beneficiaries. All of the interest of such trusts can be
deducted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tax code, some of these trusts are linked to the
length of a certain person's life -- someone selected in advance to
serve as a kind of measuring stick. The value of the trust is based
on how long this person is expected to live.
</P>
<P>
   A taxpayer can select any person, so long as they are not
''terminally ill'' under the definitions in the law -- that can
include someone who is seriously ill but not immediately in danger
of dying. In such a case, the trust's value for tax purposes is the
same as if that person was completely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   If that seriously ill person dies prematurely, the charity
ultimately will receive far less than the amount of money on which
the tax deduction was based. And the other beneficiaries will
receive far more than the amount subject to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials say the trusts are even being marketed in
packages that include the name and medical records of a seriously
ill person, who often receives a token payment. In some cases, a
charity interested in that person's particular illness is also
given some benefit from the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations proposed Tuesday would end that practice,
permitting only a donor, a donor's spouse or a direct ancestor of
any beneficiaries to be used as the ''measuring life'' for the
trust. If given final approval, they would apply to any transaction
made on or after April 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marketing schemes that exploit the misfortunes of some for the
benefit of others are contrary to public policy,'' Treasury
officials said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Gold Up on Stock Slide; Crude Falls  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold prices rallied strongly Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as investors unnerved by Wall Street's bungee-jump plunge
went fleeing into the precious metal in droves.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, falling gasoline futures dragged crude oil
lower and grains also slid as funds yanked money out of
agricultural commodities to cover their equities losses.
</P>
<P>
   Gold snapped out of the doldrums when the stock markets went
into free fall, rising as high as $291.50 per troy ounce -- a
two-week high and up 4 percent for the day -- before giving up half
that gain in a rollercoaster rally mirroring equities' dive and
climb.
</P>
<P>
   Gold for June delivery finished up $6.20 at $286.60 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the changes in the investment environment, even
high-tech hounds and the Internet generation head for the
old-fashioned metal when times are tough, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gold price is an economic and political barometer of the
well-being of the economic world,'' said George Gero, who follows
metals trading as first vice president of Prudential Securities in
New York. ''In times of great turmoil, people still turn to gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in stock indexes ''woke up the gold audience,'' he
said, after months of mostly lackluster trading since last fall's
stunning 34 percent climb to $339 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just stability that keeps investors and funds coming
back. ''Gold is liquid, has depth, has no political allegiance and
is easily liquidated,'' said Gero.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for gold bugs: Gold normally retraces its rallies
if they occur solely for reasons of economic turmoil. And there
were no other fundamental reasons for Tuesday's rise, the analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere at the New York Merc, gasoline prices tumbled on weak
refining margins and cash markets. The decline put extra pressure
on crude, already weak after OPEC's decision last week to raise
production levels.
</P>
<P>
   May unleaded gas fell 4.23 cents to 79.93 cents a gallon; May
crude fell 98 cents to $25.45 a barrel; May heating oil fell 2.90
cents to 64.36 cents a gallon; May natural gas fell .67 cent to
$2.822 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, fund managers unsettled by the
stock plunge took profits in commodities to try to make up for
their losses in equities.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans fell more than half the 30-cent-a-bushel limit before
cutting their losses in half by the end of the session as stocks
rebounded. Prices also were pressured by followthrough from
Monday's weak close and new forecasts for rain in the still-dry
Midwest late this week.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and wheat also declined because of stock prices, which were
still down significantly when the Chicago exchange closed.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 2 cents to $2.55} a bushel; May corn
fell 2\ cents to $2.32 a bushel; July oats fell } cent to $1.20\ a
bushel; May soybeans fell 8 cents to $5.38{ a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Havana Gives Visas To Elian's Dad  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American diplomats in Havana issued visas
Tuesday to Elian Gonzalez's father but Cuban officials said he will
call off his proposed trip to the United States unless he is
assured of temporary custody of his 6-year old son.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the boy's Miami relatives, who are fighting to
retain custody of Elian, said negotiations aimed at reuniting Juan
Miguel Gonzalez with his son appeared to be breaking down without
agreement. However, the talks resumed in late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not heard from the attorneys for the relatives in
Miami that they consider the talks to have been broken off,''
Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said at midday. ''We continue to
hope that we can all work together to resolve this in a fair,
orderly and prompt manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Miami home where Elian has lived since he was
rescued from a Thanksgiving shipwreck that killed his mother, about
200 angry protesters broke down a barrier and formed a human chain.
''Elian is not leaving!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Hernandez said they ''saw a bus and they thought they
(Immigration and Naturalization Service officials) were coming to
take him.''
</P>
<P>
   City of Miami Police just stood by and watched.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez was
hospitalized for exhaustion after fainting during a round of
television interviews. Hospital officials said she was in stable
condition and family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said she would
stay in the hospital overnight.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting her in the hospital, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez told reporters: ''The government is going to destroy this
family. We are only trying to protect this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have spent the past two days negotiating
with the Miami family over how to transfer temporary custody of
Elian from Lazaro Gonzalez to Elian's father. U.S. officials raised
the possibility that Juan Miguel Gonzalez could travel to Miami to
get his son.
</P>
<P>
   Absent an agreement, a Justice Department official said a letter
could be sent to Lazaro Gonzalez announcing that temporary custody
would be transferred from him to Elian's father. A follow-up letter
would provide instructions on how and when the transfer would take
place, said the official, asking not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Vicky Huddleston, the chief of the U.S. Interests
Section, delivered to Cuba's Foreign Ministry visas for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, his wife and their infant son, as well as a male cousin,
a kindergarten teacher and a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, a federal judge affirmed an INS ruling that Elian
belongs with his father in Cuba. The Miami relatives have asked the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to overturn the lower
court ruling; opening arguments are set for the week of May 8.
</P>
<P>
   If arrangements can be worked out for a transfer of custody,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez would stay at the home of the head of the
Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, Fernando Remirez.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the State Department on Tuesday afternoon for a
meeting, Remirez said the elder Gonzalez's U.S. travel depends on
''the assurance he will get temporary custody.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are reviewing 22 additional visa requests,
including 12 from Elian's classmates. Remirez said his government
believes all visa requests should be approved because the
additional 22 compatriots will help facilitate Elian's ''recovery''
after four months away from home. He stopped short of saying their
approval was a precondition for the father's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Remirez lives in a split-level brick home in suburban Maryland
near a country club.

   VIOLENT CONCERNS: Violence in the workplace results in three
deaths daily, and costs employers $36 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that workplace violence is the number one
security threat to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by Pinkerton, a security services company,
workplace violence not only topped the list for the second year in
a row, but it scored 10 percent higher than last year in
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over Internet security jumped to second place from
seventh on the Top 10 list of workplace threats.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which was mailed to corporate security professionals
at Fortune 1000 companies and completed by about a third, found
that most respondents are worried about internal threats.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 20 percent of companies do not consistently perform
criminal-records checks on job applicants, the survey found.
</P>

   YOU READY FOR THIS?: Most college students choose their major
because of the type of work it will prepare them to do.
</P>
<P>
   Of 1,218 new and prospective graduates polled by the National
Association of Colleges and Employers, 66 percent said they chose
their major based on career interests. Seven percent made their
decision based on anticipated income, while another 5.7 percent
claimed they were following the advice of friends and family.
Slightly more than 12 percent admitted they ''sort of drifted''
into their major.

   POETRY IN THE AIR: Efforts to promote poetry during National
Poetry Month are reaching new heights.
</P>
<P>
   That's because American Airlines is distributing 100,000 free
copies of the book ''Songs for the Open Road: Poems of Travel and
Adventure,'' to passengers on its international flights.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being undertaken in conjunction with the American
Poetry and Literacy Project throughout the month of April.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based flight attendant Eric W. Bergman first proposed
the idea to the company as a way to dually promote the nonprofit
poetry organization and provide travelers with reading material.
</P>
<P>
   The book, a collection of 90 poems by 50 poets, includes poems
by Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost and others.

<HEADLINE> Criticism About Standardized Tests  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Standardized tests required for high school
graduation deny poor, disabled and minority children equal chances
to earn diplomas, say critics who want to limit how schools use
exit exams.
</P>
<P>
   Such students have the most crowded classrooms, the least
experienced teachers and the least challenging courses, which makes
them less likely to pass rigorous tests, federal lawmakers said
Tuesday. They proposed legislation that would keep states from
relying solely on test scores to award diplomas or make children
repeat a grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are holding our children responsible for our own failure to
invest in their future,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. He
hopes to win over his colleagues as they decide in the next few
weeks how to spend federal education money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, introduced in the House by Rep. Bobby Scott,
D-Va., states that receive money from Washington would have to use,
in addition to test results, teacher reviews, class attendance and
letter grades in course work to make such decisions. They would
have to provide extra help to children with learning disabilities
and language needs.
</P>
<P>
   National concern over public education has fueled the state
testing movement. Currently, 29 states require or plan to require
every high school student to pass a single test to earn a diploma.
The most that pupils who don't pass can earn is a certificate of
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   All states but Iowa and Montana test younger children in various
subjects but do not automatically deny promotions to those who fail
the tests. Many districts, such as New York and Chicago, have held
children back en masse based on test scores. Sometimes, scores are
used to grade schools themselves and shut down those with deficient
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of tests say accommodations or exclusions could cheat
disadvantaged students out of fair assessments of their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups that support the Wellstone-Scott plan say
states give tests without properly financing impoverished, property
tax-dependent districts. They also neglect health care, which can
affect children's learning ability, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As states move to sound tough on education, they are giving
you simple answers to a complex question. This issue needs federal
input,'' said William Spriggs, director of research and public
policy for the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Scores show that poor and minority children often are the first
to fail such tests. In the Chicago school district, 18 percent of
black children were retained for summer school, compared with 4
percent of whites. Massachusetts failed more than 80 percent of
black and Hispanic children in its 1998 statewide test.
</P>
<P>
   In light of such results, a general parent backlash against
testing has appeared in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and New York lowered passing grades for their new
tests. State boards in Virginia and Arizona voted to re-examine
theirs. Wisconsin scuttled plans for a high school exit exam after
a protest lodged mainly by more-affluent parents.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Seek Nuclear Weapons Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will
discuss reopening negotiations to reduce U.S. and Russian
long-range nuclear weapons on a visit here April 26-27.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration is holding back until the Russian
parliament approves a 1993 treaty to cut the two countries'
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Dumas has shelved the START II arms control
accord, stalling cutbacks in U.S. and Russian long-range weapons
under that treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Stephen Sestanovich, the State Department official in
charge of the bureau that deals with Russia, said the parliament
appeared close to approving the long-delayed pact.
</P>
<P>
   He also said President Vladimir Putin's government was coming
around to the U.S. view that a space-based weapons program should
be considered by both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, in his talks here, will make the point the 1972
U.S.-Soviet treaty that banned missile defenses was untouchable,
the Russian Embassy said in an announcement of his planned visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials hope to persuade Russia to
agree to amend the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin last Friday reiterated his desire to see the START II
ratified. However, the pact is still before a committee and
hearings have not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO Secretary-General
Lord Robertson agreed Monday the alliance should have good
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson told reporters ''NATO-Russia relations are of enormous
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   The former British defense minister called Russia a ''strategic
partner'' with whom the alliance could discuss ''common security
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov will stop first in New York for a review April 24-25 of
the treaty to curb the spread of nuclear weapons technology. In his
talks in Washington ''close attention will be devoted to expansion
of Russian-American ties,'' the Embassy statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also is expected to attend NATO's annual Spring meeting
in Florence in May.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Court Stays Executions  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal appeals court Tuesday stayed
the planned executions this week of a convicted cop killer and a
child murderer. They would have been Tennessee's first executions
in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the execution of
Robert Glen Coe just 15 hours before he was to die by lethal
injection early Wednesday. The court also stayed the execution of
Philip Workman, who was set to die early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, 43, claims he is insane and shouldn't be executed for
raping and killing 8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin in 1979. His
execution had been delayed twice since October, but on Monday the
Tennessee Supreme Court refused to delay the execution further.
</P>
<P>
   Workman, 46, argues that there is new evidence showing that he
did not fire the fatal shot that killed Memphis police Lt. Ronald
Oliver in 1981. He had confessed to the shooting but now says an
X-ray shows Oliver was killed with a bullet other than his.
</P>
<P>
   The stays came as Coe and Workman seemed close to exhausting
their legal options after two decades. In issuing the two stays
moments apart, the court said it would review both men's claims. In
Workman's case, a petition for clemency was pending with Gov. Don
Sundquist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think these judges need to quit messing around and get on
with it,'' said Mickey Stout, Cary Ann's stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Coe has said he lured the girl into his car and raped her. After
she told him, ''Jesus loves you,'' he said he decided to kill her,
first trying to strangle her and then stabbing her with a pocket
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Paul Summers said the state will continue to
pursue both cases aggressively.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets With Yemen President  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Tuesday commended the
leader of the Middle East nation of Yemen for changing travel rules
to let thousands of Jews of Yemeni origin return to their ancestral
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States appreciates the religious tolerance of
Yemen, especially the right accorded to Yemini Jewish communities
worldwide, including those in Israel, to visit Yemen,'' Clinton
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   President Ali Abdullah Saleh met for about 30 minutes with
Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior
administration officials. The meeting commemorated the coming 10th
anniversary of the unification of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, many of the 50,000 Jews living in Yemen
emigrated to the new state of Israel, leaving behind synagogues and
property in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula nation.
</P>
<P>
   Yemen, which has a Jewish population of about 400, has said that
it will not establish ties with Israel without an overall Middle
East settlement in place. And while Yemen is not a direct player in
the peace negotiations, its decision in February to ease travel
restrictions is seen as a move toward easing relations among
nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a national security spokesman for the White House,
said the new rules promote greater freedom of travel to Yemen by
all people of Yemeni descent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is of most significant impact to Israelis of Yemeni
descent who wish to travel back to their homeland, and the Yemeni
government has responded and made it easier to do that,'' Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yemen's president thanked the United States for its help in
instituting democratic change. He also said his country appreciates
U.S. help in achieving needed improvements in health care and
higher education, removing dangerous land mines left from war and
providing food assistance and U.S. Agency for International
Development programs that have educated and trained Yemenis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Yemen for its democratic change, including
guaranteeing constitutional rights for women for full political and
economic participation.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the issue of terrorism did not surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not aware that it did come up, but it's something that we
are working with the Yemeni government to see in ways in which we
can cooperate to combat terrorism in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribesmen in Yemen, a rugged mountainous country once ruled by
the Queen of Sheba, have kidnapped about 300 foreigners, including
Americans, since independence. Generally hostages are used as
negotiating pawns in disputes with the government or other tribes,
as the kidnapped Polish ambassador was last month to gain freedom
for an arrested sheik.

<HEADLINE> Attempt Made To Change Flag Law  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Cliff Graves died fighting a house fire,
his buddies in Rocklin, Calif., gave him a hero's send-off, flying
the U.S. flags at City Hall and at the volunteer fire station at
half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   That's when George Magnuson learned he was violating the Federal
Flag Code, a 1942 law that says only presidents and governors can
order U.S. flags lowered to half-staff on public property.
</P>
<P>
   The violation has bothered Magnuson, a volunteer firefighter,
ever since he helped with Graves' funeral arrangements in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   When Magnuson was elected to the City Council of the Sacramento
suburb in 1991, he launched an effort to amend the code so local
officials can order U.S. flags lowered in tribute to firefighters,
police officers and other public safety officials killed in the
line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last act you do for somebody shouldn't be something that
is not a legal act,'' Magnuson said. ''I really firmly believe that
when somebody dies helping to protect fellow citizens that the
citizenry should have the right to honor them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many local officials ignore the code intentionally or out of
ignorance, and there are no criminal or civil penalties for
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Magnuson raised the issue at a National League of
Cities meeting but got nowhere. League officials said not enough
members expressed an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson now is lobbying Congress, which, along with President
Clinton, has authority to amend the code.
</P>
<P>
   And Magnuson may be making headway.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., is considering legislation or a
resolution to allow local officials to lower U.S. flags to honor
public safety officers, said Richard Robinson, Doolittle's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   National police and firefighter groups say no one has ever
approached them about trying to change the code, but that
Magnuson's idea has promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can think of no higher honor'' for slain police officers,
said Craig Floyd, chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers
Memorial Fund, a Washington group that commemorates officers killed
in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   George Burke, spokesman for the International Association of
Fire Fighters, said amending the code to include firefighters
''would be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue there is no need to amend the code. Brian Humphrey,
a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department, said he believes
the code, which allows flags to be lowered ''in accordance with
recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law,''
already gives fire officials the authority to fly Old Glory at
half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gormalley of the Veterans of Foreign Wars' national
office in Kansas City, Mo., said there is no reason to change the
code because it already calls for flying the flag at half-staff on
Peace Officers Memorial Day each May 15. Gormalley recommends local
officials lower a local flag or fly a black ribbon or drapery below
a fully raised U.S. flag to honor local heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Buss of the American Legion's national office in
Indianapolis says local officials who want to honor slain police
and firefighters can call their governor's office and seek an
official declaration to lower the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Magnuson doesn't like those alternatives. Peace Officers
Memorial Day doesn't cover firefighters, he said, and contacting
the governor is inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be an authorized procedure,'' Magnuson said. ''Just
say, 'This is OK, you don't have to worry about it.'''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese political leaders were expected to name
top ruling party official Yoshiro Mori as the new prime minister
Wednesday, replacing Keizo Obuchi, who is on life support after
suffering a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Cabinet resigned Tuesday, paving the way for the
quick selection of a Liberal Democrat to the country's top post.
After the new leader is named, a Cabinet could be installed by late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers promised to move swiftly to avoid a
political vacuum after Obuchi's collapse. The 62-year-old prime
minister suffered a stroke Sunday and lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is regrettable that the leader of the government fell ill
... in such difficult times both at home and abroad,'' the
ministers said in a statement after an emergency meeting. ''We are
determined to do our best.''
</P>
<P>
   With Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party firmly in control of
parliament, the changes were not expected to bring any major shift
in political or economic policies. A new Cabinet will most likely
be the same as the old, with only the top spot changed.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62, the second-highest official in the LDP, has a
reputation as a conservative, and analysts said he would come under
considerable pressure to continue Obuchi's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was being kept alive on a respirator in a Tokyo hospital,
where he was reportedly joined by his wife and three children and
his brother. Officials said it was clear he would not be able to
resume his duties.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of keeping a tight lid on information about
Obuchi's condition or the possibility of replacing him, the
government sought Tuesday to quickly move through the formal
process for a successor.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet resignation was the first step. Next, LDP members in
Parliament are to vote Wednesday morning on a party president to
replace Obuchi, LDP officials said. The party president would then
be put up for the approval of parliament as prime minister
Wednesday afternoon -- which is assured because of the LDP's
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Party members said the natural choice would be Mori, a former
journalist and veteran politician with a solid power base.
</P>
<P>
   Mori has refused to comment on the prospect of becoming Japan's
next leader. But he said he supports the decision to fill the
vacuum left by Obuchi's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not allow any delay in our national policy,'' Mori
said. ''Thinking of Prime Minister Obuchi, it's a very painful
decision. But we shouldn't be carried away with emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The government continued its tight hold over information about
Obuchi on Tuesday. Acting Prime Minister Mikio Aoki went to the
hospital and later only said that there was no change in Obuchi's
condition. He denied reports that Obuchi was brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership crisis came as a volcanic eruption in northern
Japan has 13,000 people in emergency shelters. Concerns were also
being raised about the LDP's ruling alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Obuchi's stroke, the smaller of two parties with the
LDP in a ruling coalition announced it was splitting off. The loss
does not seriously threaten the Liberal Democrats' power, but could
make it more difficult for them to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Though unable to block it, opposition lawmakers were expected to
resist the appointment of a prime minister from the ruling
coalition's ranks. They were expected to demand an early election,
raising the possibility of a public ballot before July's G-8 summit
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki has come under heavy criticism for failing to disclose the
crisis for almost a full day. On Tuesday, he apologized for false
reports that Obuchi had gone to bed as usual Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be careful in the future,'' Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998 and proved an
effective leader, helping stimulate the economy, boosting his
party's dominant position in parliament and championing legislation
that strengthened Japan's security role in Asia.

<HEADLINE> German Artist's Plan Sparks Debate  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- An artist's plan to place a neon sign reading ''To
the Population'' inside Germany's Reichstag -- a contrast with the
building's old, historically-charged inscription -- has sparked a
controversy over what it means to be German.
</P>
<P>
   German artist Hans Haacke's proposal consists of a wooden
trough, 23 feet wide and 70 feet long, to be filled with dirt
brought by each of the 669 legislators from their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   On top, the words ''Der Bevoelkerung,'' or ''To the
Population,'' will be lit up in white neon letters of the same
typeface and size as those above the Reichstag's entrance, which
read ''Dem Deutschen Volke,'' or ''To the German people.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ''Volk'' has long been linked with German nationalist
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's contrasting of the words ''Volk'' vs.
''Bevoelkerung'' goes to the heart of current debates over
immigration and citizenship: whether those who live within
Germany's borders are a ''people'' or a ''population.''
</P>
<P>
   It poses the question of whether being German means ''being of
German descent,'' or whether it includes anyone who feels at home
here.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives insist Germany is not a country of immigrants,
even though almost 10 percent of its 83 million people being
foreigners. New laws that went into effect this year cut the
decades-old link between blood and citizenship, but only after much
heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Lammert, a conservative lawmaker and leading opponent of
the artwork, said the artist's concept is ''more political than
aesthetic'' and has forwarded a motion to be voted on Wednesday to
block the work.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke sees the project as a statement against xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The population includes everybody who is living in Germany,''
he said in an interview Tuesday under the Reichstag's new dome,
where he was lobbying legislators to support the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions lost their lives because of an understanding about
who belongs or does not belong to the German people,'' he said.
''We know that there are again people in this country who attack
passers-by on the street if they don't look German enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, who lives in New York, is no stranger to controversy.
</P>
<P>
   His piece ''Sanitation,'' part of the Whitney Museum of American
Art's current Biennial exhibition, depicts New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani as a fascist and links him to the Nazis for trying to deny
public funds to an art museum over an exhibit the mayor considered
anti-Catholic. Giuliani and Jewish groups have criticized the piece
as trivializing the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of his Reichstag piece concede its political
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The work ''is inseparable from the political message,'' said
lawmaker Franziska Eichstaedt-Bohling, a member of the art
committee. ''Everyone that votes for this votes on this political
message too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis used the word ''volk'' in their slogans and in the
title of their newspaper. The dirt from across Germany involved in
Haacke's plan has also reminded some of the ''blood and soil''
rituals that were part of the Nazis' nationalistic fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   Lammert, however, argues that it's wrong for Haacke to assign a
negative connotation to the word, noting that ''Volk'' is used in
Germany's liberal, postwar constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why connect this with nationalism? It makes no sense,''
Lammert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Already 180 legislators from across party lines have pledged to
vote Wednesday for the motion to block Haacke's $175,000 piece from
being placed in the Reichstag's northern atrium.
</P>
<P>
   A group of artists, museum directors and gallery owners from
across Germany sent an open letter Tuesday to parliament members
urging them to stand by the committee's approval of the work.
</P>
<P>
   If the piece does make it past lawmakers, Lammert said he has no
plans to bring soil from his own hometown to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke said he has no plans to fill the trough with soil from
elsewhere if not enough lawmakers participate, but instead will
leave it to future generations of lawmakers to complete the work.

<HEADLINE> Leonardo DiCaprio Interviews Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Was Leo's interview with Bill planned, or not?
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and the White House have strikingly different versions
of whether Leonardo DiCaprio came last Friday expecting to conduct
a sit-down interview for the network with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists that DiCaprio's interview was requested
weeks earlier and his questions submitted a day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the network denies that the 25-year-old actor was meant to
play the role of a TV journalist when he taped a segment for an
upcoming ABC News special on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our expectation all along had been that this would be a
walking tour to observe some recent changes -- the 'greening' of the
White House,'' ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Tuesday. ''All of
our conversations with the White House were about a casual
walk-through tour with President Clinton, not a sit-down
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday, Murphy said, Clinton unexpectedly granted
DiCaprio a sit-down interview instead. During their exchange, which
lasted about 15 minutes, Clinton discussed his policy on global
warming and other environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the interview came about at the last minute was disputed
by White House deputy press secretary Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC crew, he said, ''knew they weren't going to stroll
around the White House, the day before. They set up their equipment
for four hours, in one place. Does that sound like they were
surprised?''
</P>
<P>
   Back at ABC News, there was grumbling when staffers heard that a
movie star had been given such a plum of a newsgathering
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said ABC News chief David Westin, who learned about the
interview after the fact, issued an e-mail Saturday assuring his
colleagues that ''all roles of journalist must be played by
journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is that stupid'' as to send DiCaprio to conduct a
presidential interview for ABC News, Westin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   According to DiCaprio spokesman Ken Sunshine, the young matinee
idol ''didn't know if it was walking or sitting, he was just
pleased to talk to President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said the interview request was submitted in February and
that ABC News indicated it was ''Leonardo DiCaprio that would ask
the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy countered, ''We're going to have to agree to disagree on
this one.'' She added, ''In the end, you should really judge us by
what we put on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to David Westin's e-mail, when the special airs on
or around Earth Day, April 22, DiCaprio's White House footage may
end up in the recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite possible we'll use none,'' Westin wrote.

<HEADLINE> Man killed in logging accident in central New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HASTINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A 20-year-old man running through a wooded
area was struck and killed Tuesday morning by a falling tree, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Warren II, of Central Square, was the victim of a logging
accident in the Oswego County Town of Hastings, troopers said.
</P>
<P>
   A crew from DK Enterprises had just finished cutting the 80-foot
tree, and it struck the man as it crashed to the ground, trooper
Edward Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Investigator Rick Hathaway said the man apparently
became curious at the sound of chain saws and was on his way to
investigate. Troopers said the logger cutting the tree noticed the
man and verbally warned him to leave the area, but the victim
didn't understand the warning.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a state prison guard was killed while supervising an
inmate work crew that was clearing some woods in nearby Madison
County.

<HEADLINE> Appellate Court hears Wendt v. Wendt multimillion divorcesettlement arguments  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Lorna Wendt, who won more than $20
million in a divorce from former General Electric executive Gary
Wendt, asked the state Appellate Court Tuesday to give her more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt deserves a better settlement because Gary Wendt's assets
appreciated by about $23 million between December 1995 -- when the
couple first separated -- and Dec. 1997 -- when the divorce decree
was handed down, her lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wendt ''got the benefit of everything,'' while her client
got no part of the then unmatured and unvested assets, said
attorney Kathleen Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Wendt is seeking over $35 million from her ex-husband, her
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wendt's attorneys argue that Lorna Wendt received a fair,
mathematically-calculated share of his appreciated assets.
</P>
<P>
   ''She received 50 percent of the assets based on her
contributions at the time of the separation,'' attorney Kurt
Hansson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, Hansson said, for Gary Wendt to just '' move on with
his life.'' Tierney's decision should stand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The previous settlement was based on the separation date. But
Hogan said there is no evidence that the 31-year-old marriage
actually dissolved in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''He might as well have picked a baseball score,'' Hogan said of
Superior Court Judge Kevin Tierney, who heard the original case.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 divorce proceedings, Gary Wendt, the former GE
Capital Services chief convinced Tierney that those assets -- a
supplementary retirement allowance, unvested options, restricted
stock, and a long-term performance plan -- were of no value, Hogan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Oldham, another of Lorna Wendt's attorneys said the case
''sets a terrible precedent,'' allowing the major breadwinner in a
family to manipulate the date of separation based on future
financial gains of which only he is aware.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women are going to be left impoverished,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wendt resigned from the Stamford-based financial arm of
General Electric in December 1998 after a turbulent relationship
with company chairman John F. Welch and the fallout from the very
messy and very public divorce. Wendt since has remarried and now
lives in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Wendt has established the Foundation for Equity in
Marriage and advocates for fair divorce settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Court is not expected to reach a decision for
several months.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: US To Sell Missile To Egypt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- In a move that will upgrade Egypt's air
defenses, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday that the
United States has agreed in principle to sell the Mideast nation a
version of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposed sale of the short-range, surface-launched
version the missile will ''update and modernize'' Egypt's system by
replacing the SA-6, an old Russian short-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cohen told reporters in Cairo after talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that a sale price had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen later arrived in Jordan on the third leg of his Middle
East tour, which has already taken him to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised ''contacts'' between Egyptian and Israeli
military personnel at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., last
year during a seminar on non-war military exercises like responding
to natural disasters and peacekeeping duties.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts, he said, ''will hopefully lead to cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Libya, Cohen said that Washington's policy on the
North African state it has been at loggerheads with for years has
not changed, despite a visit by a U.S. delegation to Tripoli last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he said, was obliged to send officials there to
determine whether Libya was a safe travel destination in accordance
with an American law governing the foreign travel by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. policy toward Libya will remain the same until
''there is a renouncing of support for terrorism and until there is
a full compensation for the Pan Am 103,'' victims, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 270 people died when the Boeing 747 airliner exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. Two Libyan men, believed to be
connected to the Tripoli government, are being tried in the
Netherlands in connection with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, Cohen said there was also no change in Washington's
policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to continue our containment policy and hope there
can be a regime change so the Iraqi people can have a new
leadership and be fully integrated in the international
community,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was specifically critical of Saddam Hussein, and blamed
him for the suffering of the Iraqi people under U.N. sanctions
imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one person inflicting harm on the Iraqi people
and that is Saddam Hussein,'' Cohen told reporters after separate
meetings with Prime Minister Abdur-Ra'uf S. Rawabdeh and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lt. Gen. Mohammad Malkawi.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with King Abdullah II, the Jordanian monarch, were
scheduled for later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Lowers Suspects Charges  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Tanzanian prosecutors reduced
charges Tuesday against a man who had been facing 11 counts of
murder in the 1998 bombing of the American embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Rashidi Salehe Hemed, a Tanzanian, now faces one count of
conspiracy to commit murder, which carries a maximum penalty of 14
years in prison. A conviction on the murder charges could meant
death by hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an admission that the prosecution has no evidence
against the accused,'' defense lawyer Fauz Twaib told reporters on
Tuesday at the Kisutu magistrate court in the Indian Ocean port of
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people, all Africans, were killed and 86 injured in the
August 7, 1998, attack of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam. A
near-simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Kenya
killed 213 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On March 20, authorities dropped all charges against alleged
Hemed accomplice Egyptian Mustapha Mahmoud Said Ahmed, and deported
him to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining charge against Hemed alleges that he conspired
with five others to carry out the bombing. Four of those are at
large. The fifth, Tanzanian Khalfan Khamisi Mohamed, faces charges
in the United States in connection with the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for Hemed's trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution will present statements by 63 witnesses, three
forensic reports from the FBI and 11 death certificates to support
the charge against Hemed, court documents filed by the prosecutors
show.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accuses Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden of
masterminding and funding the twin embassy attacks.

<HEADLINE> Rivals Facing Off in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- They were comrades in a failed coup
against a government they both thought corrupt. But now Hugo Chavez
and Francisco Arias are facing off in a battle over who will rule
this oil-rich but poverty stricken nation.
</P>
<P>
   And Arias is doing the unthinkable: gaining support in a
presidential race many believed Chavez had already won.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arias is not linked to the old political parties that
Chavez's leftist coalition has all but destroyed, he is making
inroads as an independent candidate free from ties to the
discredited politics of Venezuela's past.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this South American nation of 23 million people believe
Arias is the only man who can unseat Chavez in the May 28 election.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution pushed through by Chavez last year requires
most public offices, including the presidency, Congress,
governorships and local councils, to be ''re-legitimized'' through
the May elections.
</P>
<P>
   While Chavez speaks of ''revolution,'' Arias emphasizes good
management. Soft-spoken Arias' call for reconciliation between rich
and poor stands in sharp contrast to Chavez's rousing speeches
attacking the news media, the Roman Catholic Church and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Arias was one of three of Chavez's fellow coup leaders who
recently broke with the president, saying he had betrayed the goals
of their 1992 rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely refers to Chavez by name, instead calling him ''the
caudillo'' -- or strongman -- and accusing him of becoming an
autocrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to have all the power,'' said Arias. ''He is moving
this country toward anarchy and pitting rich against poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chavez and his supporters are busy painting Arias as
the candidate of the oligarchy, someone who would roll back the
''social revolution'' started by Chavez when he became president a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken in mid-March gave Chavez a mere 11-point lead in
the race for the presidency, indicating unexpectedly strong support
for Arias. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, El Nacional newspaper showed Chavez 28 points ahead in
a private poll published Tuesday. That survey had a margin of error
of 2.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The two polls were taken within days of each other, and the
reason for the wide discrepancy was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   Born in San Cristobal, in the western state of Tachira, Arias
was groomed for a life inside the Catholic Church, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother was very old fashioned and believed the first born
was always either a doctor or a priest,'' Arias, sitting in a
sparsely furnished office in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of
Chuao, told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Arias's mother enrolled her son in a seminary hoping he would
become a priest. But by 19, he had joined the army, where he spent
the next 20 years rising through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Arias and four other military commanders led some 15,000
rebel troops in an ill-fated attempt to overthrow then-President
Carlos Perez Andres.
</P>
<P>
   Arias and Chavez both spent two years in jail before being
pardoned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Arias joined his wife and two children in
Zulia where he successfully ran for governor of the oil-rich state
in 1995 and was re-elected in 1998. He left that job last month to
run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Like Venezuela's last presidential campaign only 16 months ago,
this one is dividing Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at what they see as Chavez's anti-democratic tendencies
and his failure to heal the economy and control crime, several
former Chavez supporters have flocked to Arias.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire process of democracy was derailed by Chavez,'' says
William Izarra, a former lieutenant colonel who also took part in
the coup attempt. ''The president makes all decisions without
consulting the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arias's critics say he isn't as squeaky clean as he claims.
He is under investigation by Venezuela's pro-Chavez interim
legislature for misuse of state funds.
</P>
<P>
   Arias has denied the charges, saying the investigation is
politically motivated.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Cult Handbook Excerpts  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from ''A Timely Message from Heaven: The End
of the
Present Times'' by leaders of the Movement for the Restoration of
the Ten Commandments of God:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --All of you living on the planet, listen to what I'm going to
say: When the year 2000 is completed, the year that will follow
will not be year 2001. The year that will follow shall be called
Year One in a generation that will follow the present generation;
the generation that will follow will have few or many people
depending on who will repent.
</P>
<P>
   --The Lord told me that hurricanes of fire would rain forth from
heaven and spread over all those who would not have repented. They
would burn them but would not die immediately. ... This fire will
also reach inside the buildings; there is no way one can escape.
</P>
<P>
   --Those who had repented were told to go in hiding to the houses
they had built for this purpose. These houses are called 'Ark' or
'Ship.'
</P>
<P>
   --We are definitely taking you to Jesus through the Blessed
Virgin Mary, who have (sic) commissioned us, and through the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   --Since the Ten Commandments of God have been abandoned and are
being broken, those who go to hell are very many. ...Those going to
heaven are few.
</P>
<P>
   --Ours is not a religion but a movement that endeavors to make
the people aware of the fact that the Commandments of God have been
abandoned, and it gives what should be done for their observance.
</P>
<P>
   --A great number of youths now move about more or less naked.
They move about putting on slit-skirts, see-through dresses without
any under-clothing. Some move about half-naked putting on back-show
dresses. Girls prefer wearing men's trousers to wearing their own
dresses. ...All these are symptoms of an urge to violate the Sixth
Commandment. Our Blessed Mother Mary says that we, the youths, are
like simpletons or fools because of having allowed Satan to dwell
in us and make us do all sorts of shameful actions
</P>
<P>
   --AIDS ... is a disaster that has befallen the world. AIDS is a
punishment that has been released to the world due to its
disobedience. The sole cure is repenting our disobedience, and the
restoration of the Ten Commandments of God.''

<HEADLINE> 7 Sentenced To Death For Genocide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A Rwandan court sentenced seven people to
death for their involvement in the 1994 genocide here, state-run
Radio Rwanda reported Tuesday, as the country observed a national
week of mourning for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences were handed down Monday in the southwestern town
of Cyangugu, where last week eight other defendants were given
death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   All were convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in
the three-month slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were lowered to half-staff and nightclubs closed
throughout the tiny central African nation this week, as part of
the annual week of mourning for the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The observance will culminate Friday, when the remains of
thousands of Tutsis hacked or shot to death in a Kigali suburb will
be excavated from a mass grave and given a proper burial. Similar
reburial ceremonies will be held countrywide.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front ousted the former
extremist Hutu government and stopped the massacres in July 1994,
victims were quickly buried in mass graves to avoid the danger of
infection, often without identification or the knowledge of their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 2,500 people have been tried, from among the
125,000 genocide suspects crowded inside Rwandan jails. About 300
have been sentenced to death; 22 were executed in public on April
24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. tribunal is trying top genocide suspects separately in
the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. The maximum sentence it can
impose is life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Record Low TV Ratings for NCAAs  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was not a shining moment for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The national rating for Monday night's NCAA men's basketball
tournament championship game between Michigan State and Florida was
14.1, the worst since the network began airing the event in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It represents a drop of 18 percent from last year's title-game
rating of 17.2, the previous low.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament as a whole finished with an average rating of
6.4, down 6 percent from 1999's 6.8, also the previous low mark.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't good news for CBS, which agreed in November to retain
the rights for the three-week tournament by paying $6 billion for
an 11-year contract, which takes effect in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's 89-76 victory over Florida drew a 23 share --
representing the percentage of in-use television sets tuned to a
particular show -- down from the 27 garnered by Connecticut's upset
of Duke a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings -- the percentage of the nation's estimated 100.8
million TV homes tuned to a telecast -- are the latest in a string
of declining numbers for basketball broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings were also off this year for the women's NCAA tourney on
ESPN -- No. 1 Connecticut's 71-52 drubbing of No. 2 Tennessee in the
title game showed a 19 percent decline from last year's final -- and
for the cable outfit's regular-season men's college broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC's coverage of the NBA has averaged a 3.5 rating through
27 games, a 19 percent drop from the 4.3 pulled in on average by
the 28 regular-season games shown last year.
</P>
<P>
   The women's final Sunday night drew a 3.5 national cable rating,
compared to last year's record 4.3. The 14 tournament games shown
on ESPN drew an average rating of 1.15, a fall of 14 percent from
1999's record 1.33, and the second-lowest in the five years the
cable outfit has had the women's Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   As with the men's final, the lopsided nature of the women's
title game did not help the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ''That rating for the 'UConn clinic' is sensational,'' Len
DeLuca, ESPN senior VP for programming development, said. ''That
number, when there was every indication that it was over after the
second television timeout, shows us that there is strong interest.
The numbers were steady. It didn't grow at the rate to hit a home
run rating that you would hope, but it is a solid foundation
looking forward.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration blasted a plan by
Senate leaders to delay a $13 billion emergency spending bill that
includes money for combating drugs in Colombia, peacekeeping in
Kosovo and cleaning up after Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I firmly believe that any action to delay consideration of
these pressing needs would impose unnecessary cost to Americans at
home, to our interests abroad and to our military readiness around
the world,'' President Clinton said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the top U.S. military commander for Latin America
implored Congress not to delay action on the portion of the package
that would help Colombia and its neighbors fight drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Gen. Charles Wilhelm, commander in chief of the U.S.
Southern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the
House-passed spending measure, which designates $1.7 billion for
drug interdiction, ''is crucial to ... plans that, if executed,
will strike at the heart of the illicit drug trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The package would ''contribute to the overall security and
stability of a region of rapidly growing strategic importance to
the United States,'' Wilhelm said. He noted that Colombia is now
the world's largest producer of cocaine and fourth among heroin
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the State and Defense Departments joined
Wilhelm in urging Congress not to delay action on the anti-drug
package.
</P>
<P>
   The administration plan ''is not perfect, it's subject to
change. But we are very concerned that if it is voted down, or
endlessly delayed, we will have lost an opportunity to cap this
drug production, which is right now out of control,'' said Brian
Sheridan, assistant secretary of defense for special operations.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would help Colombia's hard-pressed government battle
drug traffickers and the leftist rebels who protect them. The money
is mainly for training and equipping Colombian troops and police
with equipment including 63 helicopters, along with intelligence
operations, incentives for farmers to grow other crops and
assistance for neighbors Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., decided
to indefinitely postpone votes scheduled by the Senate
Appropriations Committee on the overall emergency spending package.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman, defended the decision
Tuesday. He told reporters Lott supports the spending but doesn't
see a need to consider the legislation on an ''emergency'' basis,
as the House did. ''We can use the regular appropriations
process,'' Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spoke to Clinton on Monday about the delay. After Clinton
issued his criticism on Tuesday, Lott released his own, saying that
''in fact'' Clinton had offered to help ''in getting the process
moving along'' so the money for Colombia and the other items could
be provided in Congress' regular spending process.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Lott's decision
was ''a mistake. The House passed (the package) quickly for a
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill includes $9 billion for the military, including
$2 billion to reimburse the Pentagon for costs of Kosovo
peacekeeping. It also would provide $2 billion for Hurricane Floyd,
which battered the East Coast last fall, and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm and other witnesses before the Armed Services Committee
portrayed the drug-trafficking problem in Colombia as steadily
worsening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced that we're on the right path in Colombia,'' the
Marine general said. ''The (spending package) is an important and
timely step in the right direction. Colombia is a worthy cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John Warner , R-Va., spoke of the effect of
the narcotics trade on fledging and fragile democratic governments
in the region. ''The spillover effect from the narcotrafficking in
Colombia could prove enormously destabilizing to the surrounding
nations,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
told reporters that delaying a vote on the emergency bill could
only make it grow larger, particularly with a spring recess coming
up.
</P>
<P>
   Senators go home to their states and come back wanting to add
millions to help cover economic problems faced by their
consituents, Stevens said. ''Every time they go home, they face
disaster,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> White House Promotes Saving  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, worried that
Americans aren't saving enough, is launching a new effort aimed at
helping people become more financially fluent.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department with the support of financial education
groups, banks and others is forming a national coalition, called
the National Partners for Financial Empowerment, to help people
sharpen their financial skills and educate them about ways to save.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans in Congress took the administration to task for
vetoing their efforts to help people save.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, criticized President Clinton's veto of a
big tax relief bill last year that included provisions that would
have provided tax breaks for a variety of savings options.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the best ways to encourage savings is not to tax it,
but every time we send a bill to President Clinton to cut taxes on
savings, he vetoes them,'' Archer said in a statement. Similar GOP
proposals offered this year also face a possible veto.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition will create an Internet Web site to provide people
with resources to become financially literate, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said in remarks prepared for delivery Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the coalition will set up national
conferences featuring experts to discuss subjects such as personal
financial management, saving for retirement and ways employers,
schools and other institutions can help educate consumers about
their finances.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the rate of personal savings, or savings as a
percentage of after-tax income, fell to 0.8 percent, a record low.
That rate isn't as dire as it would seem because it doesn't include
gains realized on savings from such things as rising stock market
values and higher real estate values from homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical to our economic health that we raise personal
saving,'' Summers said in his prepared remarks. ''And it is
critical for families because it influences their capacity to
manage what is new in the New Economy: not least, the fact that
people are living much longer than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the new coalition include the American Savings
Education Council, the Consumer Federation of America, Chase
Manhattan Bank, Bank of America and Fidelity Investments.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Trails Gore on Education  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has gained public trust in
handling several key campaign issues, but slipped behind Al Gore on
the issue he has given the most emphasis in his campaign --
education, says a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   Education topped the list when people were asked how important
different issues were to them in the presidential race, according
to an ABC News-Washington poll on the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who they trust to do a better job of improving
schools and education, 48 percent said Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee, and 39 percent said Bush, the expected GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates were tied on the issue a month ago, and
Republicans see a strong showing on education as a key for Bush to
cut into the traditional Democratic advantage among women.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a 10-point lead among men and Gore had a 10-point lead
among women in the poll that showed the two in a dead heat, 47
percent for Gore to 46 percent for Bush among registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also appeared to hold the upper hand on several specific
education policies -- from increasing federal funding to penalizing
poorly performing schools and subsidizing private school tuition in
districts that perform poorly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Almost two-thirds of Americans said federal spending on
education should be increased, with the majority saying it should
go up ''a great deal.'' Gore's proposals are more sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   -- Six in 10 oppose cuts in federal funding to school districts
whose students don't improve on standardized tests. Such a proposal
is a cornerstone of Bush's education portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   -- About half oppose giving federal money to parents to help send
their children to private schools in areas where public schools
aren't improving. Bush supports this idea, Gore opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush rolled out a $5 billion reading program to
combat illiteracy in elementary school students and a $3 billion
plan to help train and retain teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has gained an advantage in public trust on issues such as
taxes, crime, the death penalty, the economy, campaign finance and
moral standards. Gore leads on the issues of education, the
environment, women's issues, abortion rights and patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush were about even on the issues of Social Security,
foreign affairs, the federal budget and gun control in the poll of
1,083 adults taken Thursday through Sunday. It has an error margin
of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a lead over Bush in a New York poll out Monday, while
Bush had a double-digit lead in a survey in traditionally
Republican Indiana. The two were tied in a Wisconsin poll.

<HEADLINE> Program Trading Not To Blame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- What looked like a freefall in U.S. stock
markets Tuesday turned out to be a bungee jump. It's easy to blame
the whiplash effect on program trading, but experts say
computer-driven buying and selling was not a primary factor in the
500-point swings in the Nasdaq composite index and Dow Jones
industrials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, the markets have been volatile recently, but not because
of program trading,'' said Charles Jones, a finance professor at
Columbia University's Business School.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts said margin calls -- when investors must sell
stock that was bought with borrowed money -- and investor psychology
played a bigger role in Tuesday's volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Program trading'' became an evil phrase following the 1987
stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Program trading is the computer-driven buying or selling of
baskets of 15 or more stocks with a total value of at least $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   In one type of computer trading known as index arbitrage, a
trader uses computers that constantly monitor stocks, futures and
options markets. The computer gives buy and sell signals when there
is an opportunity to profit from a spread in price.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock is worth more in the current market than the
futures market, for example, the arbitrageur sells the stock and
buys the future, pocketing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the official reports really exonerated program trading
back then,'' Jones said. ''And if anything, it's less important now
... There's less money to be made from index arbitrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the NYSE introduced ''collars'' in 1998 that kick
in when the Dow Jones industrial average rises or falls by 200
points or more within an hour as it did Tuesday. The collars
restrict a index arbitrageurs from accelerating the market's move.
</P>
<P>
   But experts point out that index arbitrage accounts for just 13
percent of all program trading and about 3 percent of the volume on
the Big Board.

<HEADLINE> Students arrested for takeover of president's office  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State University of New York at Albany
students protesting cafeteria workers' conditions and a ban on a
kitchen workers' union took over the school president's office and
had a small altercation with university police Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 students charged with trespassing after occupying the
president's office for more than four hours are members of
SweatFree SUNY, an anti-sweatshop group that blames three recent
cases of E. coli that were traced to a campus cafeteria on
''sweatshop-like conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the university professor's union and Local 471, a
hotel and motel employees union, also passed out flyers supporting
a unionized cafeteria and ''Union Yes'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Sodexho-Marriott, the food service provider at SUNY Albany, has
refused to recognize the SUNY Albany cafeteria workers' desire to
organize, said Tim McHugh, an organizer and Local 471 board member.
He said dining hall employees work without health benefits and
pension plans, and are not allowed to talk about work conditions
while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is Sodexho-Marriot against the constitution?'' McHugh asked.
''This is stuff the Gestapo pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Skidmore College students occupied the president's
office on that campus to demonstrate Skidmore's contract with
Sodexho-Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials, saying they were speaking for Sodexho-Marriott,
would not comment on the student's charges. But SUNY-Albany
President Karen Hitchcock released a statement saying the sit-in
and a chanting protest outdoors were ''not responsible student
activism.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of SweatFree SUNY entered Hitchcock's office around 8:30
a.m. and said they would not leave until the school agreed not to
renew its contract with Sodexho-Marriot. They also called for the
president to sign a code of conduct prohibiting sweatshop labor in
the production of goods bearing the SUNY Albany name.
</P>
<P>
   While the students occupied Hitchcock's office, a group of about
25 other students, many wearing red headbands, assembled below the
second story office window. Some students beat bongos while others
sang: ''As students united, we'll never be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Students inside the president's office flashed peace signs out
the window and punched the air.
</P>
<P>
   When one student from Hitchcock's office yelled to the crowd
below at 12:30 p.m. that police had called with ''their first of
three warning, the third resulting in police action,'' the group
below began a chant of ''hell no, we won't go.''
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY Albany police department locked administration doors to
prevent more protesters from entering the building and arrested the
students in Hitchcock's office shortly before 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Kozlowski, a member of SweatFree SUNY, said she was
outraged by the administration's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Two students claimed that police struck them when they tried to
enter the administration building to watch the arrests. And while
the arrested students left peacefully, the university said two
officers went to the emergency room with minor injuries following
an altercation with protesters outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   The university police department is investigating the
altercation.
</P>
<P>
   The students charged in the sit-in were told to appear in Albany
City Court Friday.

<HEADLINE> Elian Citizenship Plan Fizzles  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Short of votes, sponsors of legislation to
declare Elian Gonzalez an American citizen or a permanent U.S.
resident indicated Tuesday that they may push instead for a
nonbinding resolution urging that the boy's custody be decided by
an impartial panel.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he may introduce such a measure
this week as an amendment to the fiscal 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   He said the panel could comprise three child psychiatrists, as
suggested by the 6-year-old Cuban refugee's relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Mack conceded that he and other sponsors of bills to block the
Immigration and Naturalization Service from returning the boy to
Cuba did not have enough support to bring up the legislation soon.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Justice Department and the INS of ''heavy-handed
tactics'' and said Vice President Al Gore's support of the
permanent residency bill has helped -- but not enough to make a
floor vote possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner met for lunch with
Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said she cautioned against any legislative action
that would make it difficult for the boy to be returned to his
Cuban father. She said it could set a bad precedent and make it
more difficult for American parents to retrieve children spirited
away to other countries, often by a non-American parent.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said that, despite
Democrat Gore's support for the legislation, very little exists for
such an approach among the 45 Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   Did Gore's announcement sway Democratic votes? ''Not that I know
of,'' Daschle told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The child was rescued last November from an Atlantic Ocean boat
wreck that killed his mother.

<HEADLINE> Demolition Begins At Love Canal  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Demolition began Tuesday of the final
concrete reminder of one of the nation's worst brushes with
hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   A backhoe tore into the 93rd Street School at Love Canal, making
way for park space for the new wave of residents who have moved
into the cleaned-up and revitalized neighborhood over the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The school was on the outermost cusp of a danger zone created by
seeping toxic waste from a canal-turned-chemical dumpsite. The
school closed in 1980 as panicked parents moved the children it
served out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in the third ring, this was the end of it, right
here,'' said 93rd Street resident Andrew Tomascik, referring to the
way the area was divided and evacuated after the state declared
Love Canal a threat to human health in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tons of dioxin, PCBs and other chemicals had been
buried at the site along the Niagara River. The dumping ground was
one of areas that led to the creation of the Superfund program,
which provides federal money for the cleanup of the worst
environmental disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Whole streets of homes and a school nearest the dump site, in
the first ring, were demolished. That area remains uninhabitable.
Other areas, however, including near the school, were declared
habitable again in 1988 and homes that sat vacant for years were
refurbished and sold.
</P>
<P>
   The school is the last Love Canal era building.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Condor Flies To Freedom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FILLMORE, Calif. (AP) -- Nearly 14 years after she was captured
to help save her species from extinction, a California condor
spread her wings Tuesday and soared to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Known only as Adult Condor No. 8, or AC-8, the vulture hopped
out of a pen and extended her wings to their 9-foot span in the
warm sunshine bathing remote cliffs of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary,
northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like she knew right where she was,'' condor recovery
team leader John Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, two younger condors raised in the Los Angeles Zoo
took off to join AC-8 and experience life in the wild for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   California condors once roamed North America. Their numbers fell
as human settlements reduced food sources. Others were shot or
poisoned by lead fragments in carcasses left by hunters, and poison
bait and pollutants killed more. By the 1970s there were only a few
dozen left.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 49 California condors flying free in California
and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was captured in June 1986, AC-8 was the last female
and the one of only six California condors remaining in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   While at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, AC-8 produced 12
offspring. She is the first condor from the breeding program to
retaste freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Condors can live for 40 years or more. AC-8 is believed to be
between 28 and 40.

<HEADLINE> Report: Runoff Damages Coastal Areas  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fish and other marine life are being killed
and marshlands damaged in more than a third of the nation's coastal
areas from algae blooms caused by the runoff of excess nutrients,
the National Academy of Sciences said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists concluded that the problem of coastal pollution
from nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers is so severe and
widespread that states require federal help. The nutrients often
travel hundreds of miles along rivers before they create problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conditions in many coastal areas are expected to worsen unless
action is taken now to reduce nutrient pollution,'' said Robert
Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at
Cornell University, and the panel's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While nitrogen and phosphorous occur in nature and are critical
to support plant life in marine environments, too much of the
nutrients causes an excessive growth of phytoplankton and other
organisms, which deprive fish and other marine life, including
plants, of oxygen. That causes marine life to die or be driven
away.
</P>
<P>
   Algae blooms caused by an overabundance of nutrients --
specifically, excessive nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers or
poultry waste -- have been linked to a decline of fisheries, the
death of manatees along the Florida coast, and the loss of coral
reefs and sea grasses, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Algae blooms have been blamed for years for the so-called dead
zone in the Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana and Texas coast.
Large amounts of nutrients flowing from the Farm Belt into and down
the Mississippi River have caused the massive dead zone -- the size
of New Jersey -- each spring in the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists
estimated the amount of nitrogen pouring from the river into the
Gulf has tripled, and the amount of phosphorous doubled, in the
past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Algae blooms also have been linked to a microbial called
pfiesteria that has killed fish in tributaries of the Chesapeake
Bay and off the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   But the report by the Academy's National Research Council said
that nitrogen and phosphorous pollution is causing environmental
damage along almost all of the nation's estuaries, with severe
problems identified in 44 of the 139 coastal areas examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Excess nitrogen in our coastal waters starts a dangerous chain
of ecological events that is exacerbating harmful algae blooms such
as red tides, contaminating shellfish, killing coastal wildlife,
reducing biodiversity, destroying sea grass, and contributing to a
host of other environmental problems,'' warned Howarth.
</P>
<P>
   Because rivers often transport chemical nutrients hundreds of
miles from inland farmland and urban centers, the most severe
problem areas, according to the report, are where rivers and bays
feed water into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Severe problem areas, where there were symptoms of low oxygen
levels, toxic algae blooms and loss of submerged aquatic
vegetation, were found along the coasts of nine states: Washington,
California, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland,
New York, and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The most severe problems were reported in the mid-Atlantic
states and the Gulf of Mexico, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, human activity -- from excessive use of fertilizers to
the burning of fossil fuels -- have caused the amount of nitrogen in
the environment to more than double since the 1960s. The wide use
of synthetic fertilizers account for much of the growth, but other
sources are animal waste, including chicken and hog manure,
discharges from wastewater treatment plants, and the burning of
fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen compounds in the air, usually from smokestacks, also
contribute to the high nutrient levels in some estuaries,
especially along the East Coast, the panel said. It estimated that
tougher pollution controls on soot being imposed by the
Environmental Protection Agency could cut such water deposits by as
much as 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are no federal laws or regulations that limit general
runoff from agricultural lands, although the EPA is beginning to
regulate nutrient releases from large factory farms and poultry
plants.

<HEADLINE> Bush Benefactor Wyly Leaves Ad Biz  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas entrepreneur who spent $2.5 million on
ads backing George W. Bush for president said Tuesday he's getting
out of political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, who with his brother has donated more than $210,000 to
Bush, stirred the presidential campaign last month with the
Republicans for Clean Air ads. Broadcast in New York state, Ohio
and California, the ads praised Bush's environmental record and
attacked rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday in Seattle, Wyly said the ads were not
effective in publicizing his message about environmentally friendly
power and that he would not be making any more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of you are aware of my recent foray into presidential
politics. I have already decided it is to be my last,'' he said
upon receiving an award from the Climate Institute. ''I thought I
had a clever idea to get America to focus on the clean air issue
and to help my presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyly burst onto the scene just days before the Super Tuesday
primaries March 7, when Bush clinched the nomination, and said he
planned to air other ads during the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was a controversial figure from the start, declining to
identify himself as the man behind the ads until they had run for a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said he regretted that hundreds of media reports about his
effort ''did not carry the message that I had hoped to get out,''
on the importance of allowing competition in the electric utility
field and of forcing old coal-burning power plants to clean up
their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Both goals would benefit his company, GreenMountain.com, which
sells renewable energy in states that allow competition.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, who has donated money to Bush family campaigns and other
Republicans for decades, plans to remain politically active -- just
not as an ad maker, said Thomas Rawls of GreenMountain.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans for Clean Air ads were widely denounced by
environmental groups. In his speech, Wyly indicated he was
uncomfortable being on outs with those organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know from time to time many of us may disagree on our
politics, our candidates and our methods, but what I do know is
that everyone in this room is committed to cleaner air through
cleaner energy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Md. Gun Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday he hoped
Maryland legislation requiring built-in locks for all new handguns
would serve as a national example, while the National Rifle
Association said the process was corrupted to get gun control at
any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maryland joins a growing number of states across the country
that are taking actions to make guns safer and to keep guns out of
the wrong hands,'' Clinton said in a statement. ''I challenge the
Congress to enact gun safety legislation before the one-year
anniversary of the Columbine tragedy on April 20th.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland bill, which passed Monday night, ends the sale of
conventional handguns in 2003. After that, new handguns will have
to be equipped with built-in locks. Until then, all guns sold will
have to be equipped with external trigger locks, beginning in
October. No other state has approved such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Massachusetts' attorney general said the state
would use consumer-protection laws to begin a ban on cheap
''Saturday night specials'' and require child-proofing devices on
any gun sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening to congratulate
him on successfully shepherding the bill through a legislative
maze. Of the 49 Republicans in the General Assembly, only five --
two in the House and three in the Senate, including the minority
leader -- voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A rare parliamentary procedure was used to go around a
conservative committee and force the bill to the Senate floor. The
Democratic governor also said he used his budgetary powers to
garner support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said the legislative
process had been corrupted by passage of a bad law in a
''gun-control-at-any-cost political strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for citizens to be heard when the governor bypasses
normal legislative procedures and unabashedly twists arms with the
state's budget resources,'' Baker said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Baker echoed a criticism from Maryland Republicans who said
Glendening, who leaves office in 2003, was rushing the bill through
to curry favor with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.

<HEADLINE> Mom Jailed for Drunk Court Showing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A mother showed up at court Tuesday to
be a character witness for her son, who was convicted of killing
two women in a gang initiation, but was herself thrown in jail
because she was drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco ''Paco'' Tirado, 18, convicted with a co-defendant
Monday of first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted murder, was
in court Tuesday for a sentencing hearing. The same jury that
convicted Tirado and Eric Queen, 21, will choose between life in
prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On her way to testify, his mother, Alice Tirado, was stopped
outside the courtroom by a deputy and submitted to an alcohol test,
which revealed a blood-alcohol level of 0.27 percent, officials
said. In North Carolina, 0.08 is considered intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Tirado told the judge she had been drinking until 4 a.m. ''I
haven't slept in three days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Gore Jr. sent her to jail on a temporary
commitment order and ordered mental counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge initially ordered her to reappear in court Wednesday,
but learned later Tuesday afternoon that she Tirado had been taken
from the jail to a hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe she'll be testifying,'' Ivarsson said in a
telephone interview Tuesday evening. ''I think she's too ill to do
that.''

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Explores Possible Sale  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOORE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn has upped his offer for
Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., just one day after its board of
directors passed on his original overture.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said Tuesday he will pay $16 in cash for each share of
Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., upping his previous offer by $3 per
share and valuing the company at $5.2 billion. Icahn already owns
30 million shares of Nabisco, worth about $435 million.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said he increased the offer to $16 per share for the
entire company because he was able to secure the necessary
financing for a friendly takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't do the financing (before) because it was an
unfriendly offer,'' he said. ''Here, we're buying it all. It's a
big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsippany, N.J.-based Nabisco Group is the successor to RJR
Nabisco Holdings which spun off its tobacco holdings to
shareholders last June amid mounting legal challenges to cigarette
companies. Icahn, who had made three unsuccessful efforts to unseat
the RJR board, wanted RJR to spin off its food holdings instead.
</P>
<P>
   Since the split, Nabisco Group has retained an 80.6 percent
stake in Nabisco Holdings, maker of Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Newtons,
Ritz crackers and Snackwells. The company also makes condiments
such as Grey Poupon mustard as well as Milk-Bone dog biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said Nabisco
Group's board is likely to find itself caught in a bidding war,
which would benefit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the board of directors will say they will consider the
offer,'' Ghez said Tuesday. ''But essentially it puts the companies
on the block and Icahn and anyone else could bid up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sometimes terse letter to Nabisco Group's board of
directors, Icahn offered to buy the company on a ''friendly basis''
and said ''there should be no problem in facilitating the
acquisition of NGH, especially in light of the large amount of
capital my companies would contribute to the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Nabisco Group's board passed on Icahn's original
offer of $13 per share saying it didn't accurately convey the true
worth of the company's operations. The company also said it was
exploring the sale of the company or its majority stake in Nabisco
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Icahn chided the company's directors, saying:
''If you are not willing to go forward with me and do not
officially put the company up for sale now, stockholders can only
conclude that your press release was simply designed to give them
false hopes and prevent your losing a proxy contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group officials could not be reached for comment on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said he believes the company is undervalued, even at $16
per share, but he didn't want to see the company given away for
something less.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my point of view I want to be sure that they're sincere
about putting it up for sale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted favorably to the news, pushing Nabisco Group
shares up $2.12{ to $14.50 on a volatile day on the New York Stock
Exchange. Shares in Nabisco Holdings were up $6.62{ to $39.

<HEADLINE> NY GOP Boss: No Support For Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of New York's Republican Party said
Tuesday he has talked to GOP leaders from across the state and
found no support for a possible run for the Senate by Rep. Rick
Lazio as an alternative to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've taken the pulse of the party and there is nothing there
for Rick Lazio,'' state GOP Chairman William Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio said that ''a handful'' of local county chairmen
''have called and pledged their support, so I know he's not
speaking for all county chairmen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Long Island congressman said he would not
identify the county chairmen who are supporting him without
checking with them first.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Lazio said the party might be ''blowing'' the Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton by lining up behind Giuliani.
Lazio said he was ready to run, if the party wanted him to.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's slight lead in the polls over Clinton has evaporated
in recent days amid criticism of his handling of the shooting last
month of an unarmed black man by New York City police.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said Giuliani, a Republican who supports abortion
rights and gun control, won't get the backing of New York's
Conservative Party. No Republican has won statewide office without
Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, a Giuliani supporter, said Tuesday that he has not yet
heard from Lazio about his possible entry into the Senate race and
has been too busy himself to call the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would urge him to support Mayor Giuliani,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani was campaigning across Long Island with
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wants to run, he should run and we'll have a primary,''
Giuliani said. ''But it's up to him.''

<HEADLINE> UN: Governing Hurts Poor Countries  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Tuesday singled out
bad governance, and not a lack of cash, in the world's poorest
countries as the main reason why they haven't been able to pull
themselves out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. Development Program report called for governments to
develop national anti-poverty programs that tackle an entire range
of related issues, not just the problem of how to increase incomes.
</P>
<P>
   If governments take this initiative, they will fill the
''missing link'' of good government and set their countries on the
road to alleviating poverty, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money has been thrown at poverty reduction, unfortunately in
decreasing amounts nowadays, but ... what has been missing has been
the organized policy environment at the national level to put in
place anti-poverty strategies,'' UNDP administrator, Mark Malloch
Brown, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this report clearly demonstrates is that governance is a
critical building block for poverty reduction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All governments need to be democratic and accountable to their
people and they should be decentralized so that local authorities
have a key role in running poverty programs, said Stephen Browne,
director of UNDP's poverty elimination division.
</P>
<P>
   While the report's key finding was that ineffective governance
gets in the way of poverty-fighting initiatives, UNDP also found
that the initiatives themselves are sometimes part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Programs to help the poor should be driven by an individual
country's needs, not the whims of donors who often look for
quick-fix projects rather than investing in sustainable programs
with local administration, said the report, ''Overcoming Human
Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Poverty plans have worked better when they're not simply large
clusters of micro-projects which may be focused on particular areas
or particular groups,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't add up. The whole is almost invariably less than
the sum of the parts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also calls for the world's wealthy countries to
provide debt relief to the developing world -- but not at the
expense of reducing direct aid and not with a new host of economic
conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
   And it urges wealthy countries open up their markets to poorer
nations, saying the ''formidable walls of protection,'' should be
eased.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous reports, the UNDP called for the world's poorer
nations to establish anti-poverty policies with specific targets,
saying the creation of a program can often be a galvanizing force
in poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that 77 percent of countries surveyed had
poverty estimates, but that only 31 percent had actual targets and
dates to eradicate or substantially reduce the problem.

<HEADLINE> Camden gives poor response to state charges, officials say  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- With the city's first response labeled
insufficient, Camden now has less than two weeks to correct what
the state calls serious errors with its fiscal management policy.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Mayor Milton Milan was indicted on federal
corruption charges, the state Department of Community Affairs
commissioner said she would consider a takeover if Camden fails to
correct the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Milan respond point by point to the state ultimatum, but his
response failed to address the state concerns, Ulrich ''Al''
Steinberg, director of the division of local government services,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just looking at a piece of paper and saying this is
our plan. It's doing it,'' Steinberg said. ''With all that is going
on in Camden, I think it's time to say enough's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Camden does not keep proper financial records, including a
general ledger and an account of city payouts, all of which are
required by state law, Community affairs Commissioner Jane Kenny
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said she could withhold the state aid that Camden needs to
balance its budget. And without that aid, the city would fail to
meet its payroll and other obligations, Kenny said, one of the
legal criteria to have the state assume city operations.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have until April 15 to meet the deadline; all of
the items ordered by the state are required by state law, Steinberg
said. Each item has been requested since a state financial review
board began overseeing city finances in July, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to get the Milan administration to address these
issues and get its financial house in order,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan did not return several calls to his City Hall office
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now free on $150,000 bail, Milan has denied the criminal charges
against him and has criticized state threats of a takeover of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a former business partner of Milan agreed to help
build the corruption case against the indicted mayor in exchange
for a plea deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gholam ''Joseph'' Darakhshan, of Mount Laurel, is the third
admitted felon to help in the government's case against Milan, who
last week was indicted by a federal grand jury on 19 charges,
including allegations to which Darakhshan pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Darakhshan and Milan were partners in Atlas Contracting Inc.
between 1994 and 1996. Milan, a Democrat, was elected to city
council in 1995 and became mayor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Darakhshan admitted that he and Milan accepted a $65,000 loan
from Jose ''J.R.'' Rivera, although he knew Rivera was associated
with drug dealers. The loan was for a 1994 contract that Atlas had
won to build a housing complex in the city. But authorities said
the loan was actually drug money disguised as a legitimate business
transaction. Rivera, a boyhood friend of Milan, last month was
convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and money laundering
and faces up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Darakhshan, who is out on $1 million bail, will be sentenced
after Milan's trial. He had faced at least 10 years in federal
prison without parole, but now could receive 12 to 18 months in
federal prison. He also could be sentenced to as little as house
arrest or probation for cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Caruso, Camden's former municipal prosecutor, also has
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Authorities say he and Milan
conspired to extort a $5,000 campaign contribution from the city's
public defender in exchange for his reappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Also cooperating with prosecutors is Ralph Natale, reputed to be
a former head of the Philadelphia-area mob. Natale, formerly of
Pennsauken, is now in federal custody.

<HEADLINE> Accused Mother Agrees To Counseling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LORAIN, Ohio (AP) -- A mother accused of taking lewd pictures of
her 8-year-old girl avoided going to trial by signing an agreement
Tuesday to undergo counseling and to give up two photos that
prosecutors said were offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Stewart, 48, also acknowledged that the two pictures
could be interpreted as sexually oriented, even though she did not
intend them to be that way, said Lorain County Prosecutor Gregory
White.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and her supporters, including the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the pictures were an artistic documentation
of the girl's life.
</P>
<P>
   White said all charges against Stewart will be dropped as long
as she complies with the agreement, which was filed Tuesday in
Lorain County Common Pleas Court. Court papers said she must
complete at least six months of counseling on adolescent sexuality
and demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes sexually
oriented material.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had faced as much as 16 years in prison if convicted of
charges of illegal use of a child in nudity-oriented material and
pandering sexually oriented material.
</P>
<P>
   White said Tuesday that he will request a court order to destroy
two of Stewart's pictures that a grand jury determined were
offensive. The rest of the pictures will be returned to Stewart,
who has taken about 40,000 photos of her daughter's everyday
activities.

<HEADLINE> Watchdog Says HUD Report Broke Law  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's chief watchdog said a report issued by Secretary
Andrew Cuomo broke the law by detailing how proposed Republican
budget cuts would hurt communities.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector General Susan Gaffney said the report, issued last
year and titled ''Losing Ground,'' violated a law barring federal
agencies from using taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''HUD's publication of 'Losing Ground' is only a small part of
the publicity and propaganda capability that the department has
built in the last two years,'' Gaffney wrote in a March 27 letter
to the U.S. Comptroller General obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' nonpartisan
investigative arm, reviewed the report late last year and found no
violation. Gaffney asked the GAO to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman David Egner said Tuesday that Gaffney was making a
''wild political accusation'' on an issue already resolved by the
GAO.
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with the inspector general's claim that the GAO is
wrong on the law,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney has been sharply critical of various Cuomo initiatives
at HUD. Her office penned a scathing audit of the Community
Builders program, created by Cuomo as a customer service and
outreach arm for the agency. Republicans say the program is a waste
of money and should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing Ground'' was distributed to Community Builders in
August 1999 with instructions to spread the word about the planned
cuts for fiscal year 2000. It also was mailed to the press, HUD
grantees, public interest groups and historically black colleges,
Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials told Gaffney they ordered more than 32,000 copies
and spent about $20,600 on printing and mailing.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time of unexpected national prosperity, Congress should
not rob the poorest Americans to provide reckless tax cuts and
create a new deficit,'' Cuomo wrote in the report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials said the proposed GOP cuts, most of which were not
enacted, would have meant 156,000 fewer housing units for
low-income families and homeless families, and would have cut
housing and other services for people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report never specifically asked members to lobby Congress,
but Gaffney said ''the message was understood by its recipients.''
She included an e-mail from one of the report's recipients, the
director of a HUD-funded community program, encouraging members of
her group to write to their members of Congress and urge them to
oppose the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a report in the over 20 years I've been
in Congress that has raised a red flag the way that this one did,''
said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who asked for the GAO
investigation last November. ''This is something that's unique to
Cuomo's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said he may ask the House Appropriations Committee
to cut Cuomo's next budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to send a clear message to any Cabinet secretary ...
that if you use taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress in a way that
violates the law, your personal empire is going to get cut,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eggner questioned Gaffney's impartiality, saying ''it is a
well-known that the inspector general is a political tool of the
Republicans in Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Communist Files Provoke Questions  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Eastern Germans came to dread revelations from the
files of the former communist secret police after the Berlin Wall
fell. Now they're asking why westerners -- even former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl -- should be treated differently.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl stood accused Tuesday of setting a double standard with his
vow to block any release of former East German files that could
help investigators track shady campaign money used by the
conservative party he led for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the files has exposed the lingering
east-west gap in the nation that Kohl himself united in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern politicians were upset that the same records used to
weed out one-time collaborators with the communist secret police
from public jobs in united Germany should be off-limits now that
revelations could affect prominent western Germans.
</P>
<P>
   That would have a ''catastrophic'' effect on eastern Germans'
respect for democracy and could widen the east-west gap, Reinhard
Hoeppner, governor of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, told the
Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Files kept by the former East German secret police, the Stasi,
were used as evidence in the past against leading eastern
politicians accused of acting as informers for the communist
regime. Several withdrew from politics amid the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas they were caught having helped the Stasi spy on
others, at issue now are some of those who were spied upon: Stasi
wiretaps and other snooping against Kohl and other West German
leaders during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Recent revelations on Stasi records have shown former Kohl aides
talking about flows of secret campaign money for the Christian
Democratic party he led until his 1998 election defeat. A newspaper
reported last week that the Stasi followed the party's financial
dealings as far back as 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With parliament examining whether political decisions were
bought during Kohl's 16 years in power, the former leader has said
he will go to Germany's highest court to keep Stasi files out of
investigators' hands. He maintains there is no way of knowing if or
how the information was doctored to suit the Stasi's goal of
undermining the West.
</P>
<P>
   He got support from the parliamentary investigating committee,
whose leaders reiterated Tuesday that they don't intend to ask for
Stasi wiretap records because the information was obtained
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl even phoned the official overseeing the Stasi archive,
Joachim Gauck, apparently to urge him not to release records. But
Gauck, a former East German pastor, said in a newspaper interview
Tuesday that he brushed Kohl off.
</P>
<P>
   The need for public disclosure outweighs Kohl's privacy rights
in this case, he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   Former East German spymaster Markus Wolf said Tuesday that the
Stasi decided in the 1980s not to try to discredit Kohl with its
data on his party's finances, partly because of a thaw in east-west
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as he knows the material remains in the former Stasi
archives, Wolf said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's Christian Democrats, meanwhile, named a little-known
legislator, Ruprecht Polenz, as the new party secretary-general
Tuesday. He replaces Angela Merkel, who is due to take the top
chairman spot, abandoned by Wolfgang Schaeuble in the wake of the
Kohl scandal.

<HEADLINE> Judge to decide on request to unseal Skakel arrest warrant  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Evidence used to obtain an arrest warrant
accusing Kennedy nephew Michael Skakel in a 1975 murder could be
made public if a judge sides with news organizations seeking the
file.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maureen Dennis heard oral arguments Tuesday on a motion by
five newspapers and The Associated Press seeking court records in
the case, particularly an affidavit used to obtain the warrant. The
judge did not immediately rule on the request. She did not say when
she would issue her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, a nephew of the late Robert F. Kennedy, was charged in
January in the killing of 15-year-old Martha Moxley, more than 24
years after she was found bludgeoned and stabbed with a golf club
on her family's Greenwich estate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Skakel, 39, was also 15 at the time of the killing, he
is being treated as a juvenile in the courts, at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile proceedings are ordinarily closed to the public. But
Judge Dennis, acting on a request from the media, agreed to open
Skakel's March 14 arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that as an adult, Skakel no longer requires the
types of protections usually given to juveniles. The judge also
noted that Skakel did not object to his arraignment being open.
</P>
<P>
   David Fein, a lawyer for the media, said Skakel's court file
should be opened because of Skakel's age now and intense public
interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, what we are seeking is the same material that would
be available if this were an adult criminal case,'' Fein said
during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman, told the judge he does not
oppose releasing Skakel's arrest warrant, but said he does object
to the use of several anonymous witnesses in the warrant. Those
witnesses, former classmates of Skakel's at a Maine substance abuse
center, claim Skakel admitted some involvement in Moxley's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said although prosecutors have provided him with the
names of the witnesses, leaving them anonymous in the arrest
warrant could give the jury pool the impression that they are being
protected from Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives the impression that they must be in fear of their
lives because we won't say who they are,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the judge to release the names of the witnesses if she
decides to release the arrest warrant affidavit itself.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel and Moxley were neighbors in the exclusive Belle Haven
community in Greenwich when Moxley was killed on Oct. 30, 1975.
Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., the brother of Robert F.
Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed in 1998, Bridgeport State's Attorney
Jonathan Benedict said he had been told by several former students
that Skakel made ''admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley''
while he attended the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine, from
1978 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict told the judge he did not oppose releasing Skakel's
arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel did not attend Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers seeking Shaklee's file are The Hartford Courant,
The Advocate of Stamford, the Greenwich Time, The New York Times
and Newsday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Walks Tightrope on Cuban Case  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National sentiment supports returning Elian
Gonzalez to his father in Cuba while the politically influential
Cuban-American community in Florida desperately wants the
6-year-old boy to stay. It's a situation that has Al Gore walking a
political tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Tuesday
that the boy's father should be allowed to take his son home ''if
the father says on free soil that he believes the son should go
back to Cuba with him.'' But Gore also said that a family court
should decide custody.
</P>
<P>
   Likely GOP nominee George W. Bush's position seems clearer: The
question should be decided in family court.
</P>
<P>
   ''My own personal judgment is I don't trust the Cubans to let
this man make an informed decision,'' the Texas governor told
reporters Tuesday. Asked if the boy's father should be allowed to
stay in America permanently, Bush said, ''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians routinely say the boy's case should be above
politics. But political scientist Susan MacManus of the University
of South Florida says that's impossible on such an emotional issue
in a state with 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his basic motivation is protecting Florida for
Democrats,'' MacManus said of Gore. The situation is politically
trickier for him than for Bush, she said, for several reasons --
because Democrats have been losing their grip on Florida politics,
the administration would actually have a role in sending the boy
back to Cuba and Bush has been more consistent in his position.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Cuban-American relatives have suggested the boy's fate
should be decided in family court or by a panel of psychologists,
not by federal immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, almost two-thirds of Americans approve of the
government's decision to send the boy back to Cuba to be with his
father, according to a Gallup Poll released Tuesday. Just over half
of those polled said the Clinton administration is making the
decision on the boy based on what it feels is in the best interest
of U.S. relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore finds himself being asked, as he was on NBC's ''Today''
show Tuesday, whether he was pandering to voters in Florida when he
split from the Clinton administration last week concerning
legislation that would grant ''permanent resident'' status to the
boy and his immediate family, allowing them to stay in this country
while his case is decided in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his position hadn't actually changed.
</P>
<P>
   His backing of legislation seeking permanent residency for the
boy and his family brought protests from some Democratic lawmakers
worried about the feelings of immigrant populations outside Miami
who might want the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, a Democratic
Cuban-American, said he thinks Gore is not taking that position for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nationally, it will end up hurting him more than helping
him,'' said Penelas. ''Locally it won't help him because most
Cuban-Americans vote Republican. I think he's speaking from the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president says he's been consistent for months, ''that
the father and his family should be given visas to come here and
state what the father's wishes are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also has consistently said the boy deserves due process
in the courts, at the same time he has said the father's wishes for
the boy, if stated freely in this country, should determine the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Tuesday on ''Lifetime,'' a cable channel aimed at
women, that Elian's case should go to family court regardless of
what the father says when he and his family come to the United
States, although ''the views of a surviving parent are very
persuasive, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said late Tuesday he is uncertain
of Gore's position on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to the future of Elian Gonzalez, it's becoming
increasingly hard to understand what Al Gore believes in or what he
thinks should be done,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Visas were issued Tuesday in Havana to the boy's father and
immediate family, but it was unclear when the family would fly to
this country or how they would be reunited with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is viewed by many in Miami's Cuban-American community as a
''miracle child'' after his mother drowned trying to bring him to
Florida and he was found on an inner tube in November.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Gore won Florida in 1996, the first time a
Democratic ticket had done so in 20 years. Clinton got 40 percent
of the Cuban-American vote, including many younger Cuban-Americans,
in a bloc that has voted Republican for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Another political element in Florida this year is the Senate
race, where Bill Nelson is a strong Democratic candidate running
for the seat of retiring Republican Connie Mack. With Democrat Bob
Graham holding the other seat, the Senate is a last refuge for
Democrats in a state that has seen a GOP takeover in recent years,
including the 1998 election of Gov. Jeb Bush, younger brother of
the likely Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's put himself between a rock and a hard place,''
said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who said Gore ''risks
adding to the impression that he is 100 percent pure-blood
politician, who makes decisions based on political and electoral
calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This may put him in play in Florida, but most Cuban-Americans
in Florida will prefer someone named Bush.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. GOP Settles Delegate Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts Republicans said Tuesday they have
settled a dispute over who will represent the party at its national
convention this summer by deciding that the majority of delegates
will be supporters of Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the state's presidential primary in March, and state
party rules entitle him to all 37 of the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's Republican Party -- including Gov. Paul Cellucci
-- is run by backers of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Bay State backers had hoped McCain would ''release'' his
delegates after he left the race, and allow delegates who support
Bush to go.
</P>
<P>
   The party announced Tuesday that Bush's supporters would send
seven delegates to the convention and McCain would send 30
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's delegates will be allowed to nominate him for president,
but only McCain's delegates will be elected to the committees that
craft the party's platform and the rules for the convention.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers, Serbs Hurt in Kosovo Melee  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Serbs angry over the arrest
of a Serb for illegal weapons possession clashed Tuesday with NATO
peacekeepers, leaving 11 Americans and one Pole injured, the U.S.
military said.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Yugoslav news agency Beta said 14 Serbs were
also hurt, including 10 who were struck by rubber bullets fired in
an attempt to break up a Serbian crowd.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. military said it could not confirm the number
of Serbs injured in the melee -- reportedly involving shoving,
clubs, dogs and rubber bullets -- which began Tuesday in a
southeastern mountain region near the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Vic Warzinski said
the confrontation lasted about eight hours before the crowd of
Serbs who confronted a U.S. unit was dispersed and the U.S. and
Polish troops left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Warzinski said the most serious injury to U.S. troops was a
broken hand. A U.S. military spokesman in Kosovo, Capt. Russell
Berg, said the other injuries were contusions and abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest number of injuries in a single incident to
U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo so far. The clash also marked the first
major incident between Serbs and NATO peacekeepers since a tense
situation in the enclave of Kosovska Mitrovica calmed down last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO force is devoted largely to policing and disarming
militants. But nine months after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign
forced an end to the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and the pullout of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces, new violence in the
region has thwarted efforts to establish normality in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   According to a U.S. statement, the trouble started when American
military police and Polish soldiers of the 18th Air Assault
Battalion seized two hand grenades in a Serbian house in the
village of Sevce, about 40 miles south of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 Serbs surrounded the house and refused to allow the
troops to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Beta said several thousand Serbs from four villages in southern
Kosovo set up the barricades after peacekeepers detained a Serb man
in Sevce and took him to Camp Bondsteel, the main U.S. base in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Beta report, Serbs from the villages of
Gotovusa, Jazince, Sevce and Strpce massed near roadblocks a short
distance away set up by Polish troops serving in the American
sector, demanding that the man be released.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops later brought him back to the barricade in attempt
to ease the tension, saying he would be released in 48 hours under
normal procedure, according to Beta.
</P>
<P>
   Beta said, however, that several women attempted to wrest the
man from the soldiers. The peacekeepers then released attack dogs
to try to disperse the crowd. The villagers responded with clubs
and dogs of their own, Beta said.
</P>
<P>
   Beta said four Serbs and one peacekeeper were injured at Sevce
and 10 Serbs were injured by rubber bullets fired at the barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reinforcement units were sent to assist in dispersing the
crowd,'' the U.S. statement said. ''Currently, 11 U.S. soldiers,
one Polish soldier, and one translator have been treated for
non-life threatening injuries. The number of injured civilians has
not been confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement gave no further details and no indication whether
the injuries occurred at the house or the roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10,000 Serbs live in the mountain area near the
border, making it the second largest concentration of Serbs in
Kosovo after Kosovska Mitrovica.

<HEADLINE> Committee passes MLK holiday bill  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- On the 32nd anniversary of Martin Luther
King's assassination, a key legislative committee approved a bill
which would force the town of Wallingford to close its offices in
honor of the civil rights leader's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Appropriation Committee approved the bill Tuesday on a 39-6
vote after defeating an amendment which would have required all
towns to close their offices on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Wallingford is the only municipality in the state that has not
voluntarily closed its offices for Martin Luther King Day, despite
a 1986 law making it a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Wallingford Mayor William Dickinson has said the controversy is
not about race, but a dispute with the town's labor unions.
Dickinson wants town workers to swap another holiday for King Day,
but union leaders want workers to get the day off as an extra paid
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson and union leaders are currently negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jan. 17 holiday this year, three people wearing Ku
Klux Klan hoods and robes walked along Main Street in Wallingford.
On the holiday, one of those people stood near a church where a
celebration honoring King was being held.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the Appropriations Committee and the entire
Legislature for dealing with our embarrassment in Wallingford,''
said Sen. Brian McDermott, D-Wallingford. ''Wallingford ... is not
a racist community. Quite frankly, I'm embarrassed that this bill
is here before us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Alfred Adinolfi said the bill is unfair because it
singles out Wallingford.
</P>
<P>
   ''It discriminates against one town,'' said Adinolfi,
R-Cheshire. ''All I'm asking is that all towns ... observe Martin
Luther King Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee killed Adinolfi's proposal to require all towns to
close their offices on the holiday, but McDermott said he will push
for that provision when the bill is debated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill still must clear the General Law Committee before
reaching the Senate, and McDermott said amending it now may hurt
its chances for easy passage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Bozek, D-New Britain, said the controversy in
Wallingford was a ''labor issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's fair for labor to come up and push the
envelope and twist it ... and make it a race type of issue,'' he
said. ''The bill should be defeated.''

<HEADLINE> Watchdog says HUD report violates the law, calls for probe  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo's report
detailing how proposed GOP budget cuts to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development would hurt various communities is illegal,
the department's inspector general alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office reviewed the report ''Losing
Ground'' late last year and found no violation. But Inspector
General Susan Gaffney asked the GAO, Congress' nonpartisan
investigative arm, to reconsider. She said the report violates law
barring federal agencies from using taxpayer dollars to lobby
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''HUD's publication of 'Losing Ground' is only a small part of
the publicity and propaganda capability that the department has
built in the last two years,'' Gaffney wrote in a letter to the
U.S. Comptroller General obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney is an independent watchdog within HUD, charged with
overseeing its programs. She was appointed by President Clinton in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman David Eggner responded that the inspector general
was making a ''wild political accusation that deals with a question
that was already resolved by GAO.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We disagree with the inspector general's claim that the GAO is
wrong on the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney has been sharply critical of various Cuomo initiatives
at HUD, and her office penned a scathing audit of the Community
Builders program. The Community Builders program was created by
Cuomo as a customer service and outreach arm. Republicans say the
program is a waste of money and have called for it to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing Ground'' was distributed to Community Builders in
August 1999 with instructions to spread the word about the planned
cuts. It was also mailed to the press, grantees, public interest
groups and historically black colleges, Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   The report never specifically asked members to lobby Congress
but Gaffney said ''the message was understood by its recipients.''
She included an e-mail from one of the report's recipients, Chandra
Western, Director of the National Community Development
Association, that asked association members to write their members
of Congress to oppose the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cuts did not go through.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials told Gaffney they printed more than 32,000 copies
of ''Losing Ground'' and spent about $20,600 on printing and
mailing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a report in the over 20 years I've been
in Congress that has raised a red flag the way that this one did,''
Rep. James Sensenbrenner said Tuesday. Sensenbrenner initially
asked the GAO to investigate the report in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that's unique to Cuomo's leadership,'' the
Wisconsin Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said if it becomes clear that the report violated
the law he would ask the Appropriations Committee to penalize
Cuomo's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to send a clear message to any cabinet secretary ...
that if you use taxpayer dollars to lobby Congress in a way that
violates the law, your personal Empire is going to get cut,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eggner questioned Gaffney's impartiality saying ''it is a
well-known fact that the inmspector general is a tool of
Republicans in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials said the GOP cuts would have meant 156,000 fewer
housing units for low-income families and 16,000 homeless families
and persons with AIDS who would not receive vital housing and
related services.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time of unexpected national prosperity, Congress should
not rob the poorest Americans to provide reckless tax cuts and
create a new deficit,'' Cuomo wrote in the report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, is considering
running for his father's old job in 2002.

<HEADLINE> 2 Plead Innocent To Synagogue Arson  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Two white supremacist brothers already
accused of murdering a gay couple pleaded innocent Tuesday to
federal charges that they set fire to three synagogues and a
medical center that houses an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   James Tyler Williams, 29, and Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, are
charged with 13 counts of conspiracy to commit arson, arson,
destruction of religious property and the use of fire to commit a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were brought to federal court here from the Shasta
County Jail, where they have been held since their July arrests for
allegedly killing Winfield Mowder, 40, and Gary Matson, 50.
</P>
<P>
   Shasta County District Attorney McGregor Scott is seeking the
death penalty in the murder case. Both men have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal charges carry a maximum penalty of 235 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Magistrate Judge John Moulds read the two defendants
their rights and accepted their pleas. Both requested jury trials.
</P>
<P>
   They are due back in court in Redding on Friday to determine the
date of the murder trial -- the same day a federal judge in
Sacramento will determine a trial date on the arson charges. They
waived their right to appear at the federal hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams brothers are accused of torching Congregation B'nai
Israel, Kenesset Israel Torah Center and Congregation Beth Shalom
early June 18, causing $1 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   They are also charged in a July 2 arson at the Country Club
Medical Center, which houses the Choice Medical Group abortion
clinic. No one was injured in the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Violence Blamed on Adversary  </HEADLINE>
By PEGGY ANDERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Police Department concedes it was not
ready for trouble at the World Trade Organization meeting last
fall, though it had ample warning that tens of thousands of
demonstrators hoped to shut the gathering down.
</P>
<P>
   ''In retrospect, SPD commanders put their faith in historical
precedent -- the Seattle tradition of peaceful protest -- in
assessing the needs for policing the WTO event,'' Assistant Chief
Clark Kimerer wrote in the report made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report was given to Chief Herbert V. Johnson, whose
predecessor -- Norm Stamper -- resigned over the handling of the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Police were overwhelmed Nov. 30 when marches by several groups
converged on the core of downtown. In addition to clogging streets
and hampering the WTO gatherings, the crowds provided cover for a
small number of people who smashed windows and looted stores,
resulting in an estimated $3 million in property damage. More than
500 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Some officers ran out of the tear gas and pepper spray used to
disperse crowds. Many officers spent hours without food, water or
rest. Two hundred National Guard troops and 600 state troopers were
enlisted to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends better planning next time, noting the city
had only about nine months to plan for the event, rather than the
14 to 24 months considered standard by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was that officials based plans on the 1993
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, held here without
incident, Assistant Chief Ed Joiner said. In future, the WTO
meeting will be the model, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joiner said he had been confident the 400 officers he assigned
to WTO -- the largest force ever fielded here -- would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the department was ''taught a hard lesson by a well-trained
and equipped adversary,'' the report says. It cites demonstrators'
use of the Internet, walkie-talkies and cell phones and the
''critical mass achieved with the rapid marshaling of forces from
all directions nearly simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point WTO delegates were attacked as they were leaving
their hotels, Joiner said -- while police were out in force at the
meeting sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the report's findings, the marches, the number of people
involved and their intention of shutting down the meeting all had
been well advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're unfunded people largely, who do this without pay,'' said
Dennis Moynihan of Direct Action Network, which helped promote the
demonstrations and was one of several groups that met with police
to tell them what to expect. ''I do have a cell phone and a decent
pair of sneakers. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says police did not prepare for a worst case
scenario because of ''the lack of outside funding sources'' to
reimburse the State Patrol, King County Sheriff's Department and
other area police agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Direct city costs for the WTO operations are estimated at about
$9.3 million -- $6.9 million of it incurred by the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that there were no deaths or serious injuries,
and that ''much if not all'' of the $17 million in estimated
holiday-shopping business losses was recovered by late December.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by crowd- and riot-control experts is to be
completed in about three weeks, followed by City Council review.

<HEADLINE> Hastert To Reveal China Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert will announce on
Wednesday a late May date for a House vote on granting China
permanent normal trade privileges, supporters of the legislation
said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert planned a morning news conference to announce floor
action the week of May 22, said supporters, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dates for the debate are similar to a timetable
outlined this week by House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pushing for an early vote on
the legislation, fearful that delaying it into the summer could
make passage more difficult as the fall elections near.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would end annual congressional reviews of
China's trade status, is being opposed by organized labor. Although
support in the Senate seemed assured, the battle in the House was
viewed as difficult because of divisions among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., a leading supporter of the
measure, welcomed the decision of House GOP leaders to schedule a
vote in May as ''good news.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he now counts about 70-80 of the House's 211 Democrats
in support of the legislation. That's below the 90-100 Democrats
that House Republican leaders have said President Clinton should
produce -- but might be enough to produce a victory, given strong
GOP support, Matsui said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said in an interview, ''it will be a tough.''
</P>
<P>
   There remain many undecided votes, both sponsors and opponents
of the legislation said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a whole slew of undecideds. A lot of them still don't
think there's really going to be a vote -- so why commit?'' said
Matsui.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a leading opponents, predicts that
as many as 150 Democrats will vote against the measure -- a number
Matsui and other sponsors dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is asking Congress to give China the same
permanent low-tariff access to U.S. markets it routinely gives all
but a handful of other trading partners. China's status now must be
renewed annually. The change would ease China's long-sought entry
into the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization
that oversees rules for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Labor opposes the legislation, citing China's poor record on
workers' rights. Labor unions also fear that expanding trade with
China will hurt U.S. manufacturing jobs.

<HEADLINE> Judge Thomas Learns Lessons  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said
Tuesday that it took his younger brother's death to put the rigors
and benefits of public life into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A grieving Thomas described for a gathering of attorneys an
intensely private moment after his brother Meyers died in January
after collapsing while jogging near his home in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sat there and looked at the lifeless body of my brother, the
body without the spirit.'' Thomas said. ''I tried to make sense of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it did was it put my life in perspective about what's
important. What's the purpose? Is it important to be popular? Is it
important to have agreement, to have unanimity? Or is it more
important to be principled?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said it became clear to him at that moment that the
permanent things in life -- family, friends and faith, what he calls
the three Fs -- overshadowed all others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being on the Supreme Court was meaningless suddenly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a justice since 1991, endured perhaps the most
controversial confirmation hearings in history when Anita Hill
accused him of sexual harassment. But he told the 300 members of
the Tampa Bay Chapter of the Federal Bar Association that the past
few weeks of work at the Supreme Court also have been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the longer I was there the cases would get easier,''
Thomas said. ''But frankly they are harder. They get harder when
you try to get them right.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Wants Hearing in TV Marriage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- TV's instant bride isn't getting an instant
annulment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Family Court Judge Steven E. Jones has set a court
hearing for Wednesday on annulling Darva Conger's marriage on the
Fox network special ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Conger filed for an annulment March 7, saying her marriage to
Rick Rockwell was a mistake and that she was never told about the
groom's ''history of problems with women.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, a judge can either grant the annulment based
simply on the court filing or schedule a hearing. Janice Boyle,
spokeswoman for the Clark County clerk's office, said it's not
uncommon for a judge to call a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear from court papers when Jones made the decision to
order a hearing in Conger's case.
</P>
<P>
   Conger, 34, has said that a contest she signed up for on a lark
went unbearably wrong when Rockwell, 42, selected her from 50
contestants on the show. They married on the spot in Las Vegas
during the Feb. 15 show, with more than 22 million viewers
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the smash ratings, Fox canceled a rebroadcast of the
show and swore off a sequel and similar program after it was
disclosed that a former fiancee obtained a restraining order
against Rockwell in 1991 for allegedly hitting and threatening her.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Conger and Rockwell both signed an agreement before the show
that they could annul the marriage.

<HEADLINE> IMF Adapts Harder Auditing Demands  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund, seeking to
respond to growing calls for reform, adopted tougher auditing
standards Tuesday for countries seeking to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's 24-member executive board approved a requirement
that countries seeking loans will have to agree to publish annual
financial statements of their central banks that have been reviewed
by outside auditors using internationally accepted auditing
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement, to take effect in July, was a response to
allegations that the central banks of both Russia and the Ukraine
lied to the IMF about the status of their financial reserves during
recent fiscal crises.
</P>
<P>
   That the IMF did not immediately uncover the true state of
finances in Russia and the Ukraine has triggered renewed criticism
of the lending agency on the part of many in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, testifying last month to a
congressional committee examining IMF operations, said the Clinton
administration also was deeply bothered by the incidents. Also
worrisome, Summers said, was that IMF staff members did not
disclose the Ukraine situation to its executive board until this
year even though the staff knew about the developments in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Acting IMF Managing Director Stanley Fischer told reporters the
new auditing requirements were intended to make sure that IMF loans
in the future are used properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cases that have hit the headlines are cause for grave
concern,'' Fischer said. ''It is critical that when the IMF makes
loans, they are used for the intended purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   When the IMF extends a loan to a country in financial distress,
the money usually is placed in that nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has never before required all countries to agree to
independent audits of its central bank as a condition for getting
loans, although it has required occasional spot audits in cases
where improper use of the funds was alleged, as in the case of
Russia and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging news conference late Tuesday, Fischer told
reporters that the IMF has a full agenda of reform proposals to
address at its annual spring meetings with the World Bank on April
16-17.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the groups that disrupted the meetings of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle in December are making plans to have
thousands of demonstrators on the streets of Washington to vent
unhappiness with the IMF and World Bank, two organizations they
have accused of being more responsive to multinational corporations
than the needs of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer acknowledged the potential for disruptions in Washington
in light of the vandalism that occurred in Seattle, but he said he
believes Washington authorities would be prepared to handle
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The local police forces and those responsible for security are
taking this very seriously -- the possibility of disruptions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a naturalized American, is heading the IMF after the
resignation in February of Michel Camdessus, who stepped down after
13 years.
</P>
<P>
   After an intense global power struggle, Germany's Horst Koehler
was selected as Camdessus' replacement but duties at the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will
keep him from taking office until after the IMF's spring meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said he planned to meet Saturday with Koehler in London
and was being fully briefed on proposals that will be considered by
the world's finance ministers at the agency's spring meeting.

<HEADLINE> Israel Defends Withdrawal Option  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the absence of a peace agreement, Israel
alone will decide the scope of its withdrawal from Lebanon, even if
it means a continued occupation of small areas of Lebanese
territory, a senior defense official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh also said Israel will not
disarm its paid Lebanese militias, something the U.N. has said
Israel must do in order to bring peace to southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israeli officials warned that remaining inside even a tiny
part of Lebanon would cost Israel the international support it
seeks for the pullout, promised for July.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no party that can judge what is the border -- we will
decide from where to withdraw,'' Sneh told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said Israel would more or less pull back to a line to which
it withdrew following its 1978 invasion of Lebanon, marked by a
surveillance fence that approximates the international border.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, Israel reserves the right to retain about
seven outposts along the border, possibly including some located
several hundred yards into Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin countered that anything less than
a full withdrawal would ruin attempts to enlist an international
presence to prevent attacks from within Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Europeans told me very clearly that a precondition for
their assistance to both sides is the withdrawal of Israel to the
international border and not to any other line,'' he told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had hoped to withdraw through a security agreement with
Syria, the main power in Lebanon, but negotiations broke off in
January and show no signs of being renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah group fighting to oust Israel from south Lebanon
said Sunday that even a withdrawal from 100 percent of Lebanese
territory would not guarantee the safety of Israel's border until
an overall Israeli-Arab peace agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon,
Timor Goksel, said that if Israel does not disarm the Lebanese
militia it pays and trains, the withdrawal will not be considered
complete, and U.N. troops will not be able to restore peace to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said Israel had no plans to disarm the militiamen, who fear
retaliatory attacks from Hezbollah following an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday assured U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Israel will cooperate with United
Nations forces during the withdrawal from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Fixes Electric On Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- All of Boeing's 717-200 jetliners are flying
again without restrictions now that electrical problems have been
checked and fixed under a federal directive, a Boeing spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman John Thom said the 13 aircraft covered by the Federal
Aviation Administration order had been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the FAA ordered immediate inspections of the new
jets to check for potential electrical problems in altitude
indicators and to make necessary modifications. The order followed
reports of two instances of intermittent loss of information on the
captain and first officer's primary flight and standby displays.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA described the problem as an ''unsafe condition,'' which
if left uncorrected could result in loss of all altitude
information and other essential data for safe flight and landing.
</P>
<P>
   Both incidents -- the first in January and the second March 28 --
involved AirTran jets, AirTran spokeswoman Sarah Duffin said. The
airline previously known as ValuJet was Boeing's first customer for
the 100-passenger 717-200, which began service in October.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- West African intervention troops
began formally pulling out of Sierra Leone, officials said Tuesday,
amid fears the withdrawal may leave a security vacuum following the
country's brutal eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 soldiers from the Nigerian-led multinational force,
known as ECOMOG, flew out of Lungi airport near Freetown on Monday

   Force spokesman Chris Olukolade has said the withdrawal of the
remaining 2,000 soldiers would be complete by in mid-April. About
2,500 former ECOMOG troops will remain under the command of U.N.
peacekeepers until late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''A dangerous security vacuum may arise when the pullout of
ECOMOG's remaining troops, mostly Nigerians, is finished,''
Freetown's For Di People newspaper in a Tuesday editorial. The
force was first posted here in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's spokesman, Septimus Kai Kai,
played down the fears, saying rebel and government officials
continued to make peace gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pullout not withstanding, I feel positive about the
general situation in the country,'' Kai Kai said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government and rebels signed a peace accord last July,
ECOMOG's main contributor, Nigeria, has gradually scaled down its
role, complaining it could not afford the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the U.N. force is expected to be boosted from 6,500
to 11,500 soldiers by July. But many Sierra Leoneans have expressed
skepticism that the U.N. troops can enforce the fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   While authorized to use force if necessary, the peacekeepers --
mainly Indians, Kenyans, Nigerians -- have avoided confronting
ex-rebels who continue to rape and pillage many rural villages with
impunity, according to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, U.N. peacekeeping contingents have themselves
been robbed in broad daylight by rebels, who killed tens of
thousands of civilians and intentionally maimed many more during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials themselves have said the international force is
intended as ''peacekeepers, not peace-enforcers.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 21,000 pro-government militia and rebel fighters had
disarmed by the end of March, Kai Kai said, adding that rebel and
government officials continued to hold regular talks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet tens of thousands of rebels have so far refused to give up
their guns, U.N. officials say, and some have set up refuge in
remote bases in Liberia, which aided the rebel struggle during the
war.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Japan Volcano Dangerous  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- As the sun set Tuesday on Mount Usu, clouds
of thick black smoke poured from of one of its gaping craters, and
scientists warned that a massive eruption could be brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,416-foot volcano on the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido broke its 22-year silence Friday, spouting gas, smoke and
debris. More craters have since burst open on its flanks, and magma
is straining upward against the mountain's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Hokkaido University geologist Tadahide Ui said he and other
experts have seen signs of a developing ''lava dome'' -- a
cone-shaped mass of magma that nudges its way through the Earth's
crust.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the dome could be accompanied by a huge
eruption of hot gas and rock.
</P>
<P>
   It would dwarf the puffs now spewing from the volcano, racing
down the slopes and incinerating everything in its path, Ui said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a pyroclastic flow, such an occurrence would be similar
to the eruption of Mount St. Helens in the United States in 1980,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars were not sure when or even if the huge eruption would
happen, though they said the volcano's history suggested it could
be months away.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13,000 people were still barred from their homes Tuesday as
they waited to see what the volcano would do. Some stayed with
friends and relatives, while others remained in emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Video taken from helicopters showed major destruction in the
scenic resort towns that surround the mountain: buildings smashed
by boulders, a highway torn in half, walls blackened with volcanic
soot.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Toya, rock and steam burst forth from a crater
that opened up next to a kindergarten, and flying boulders punched
window-sized holes through its walls. Sticky black mud stained the
building's white surface.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Usu is different from the more familiar, picturesque
volcanoes found in Hawaii, which spout fountains of red-hot lava
into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The magma moving under Usu's surface is very hard, and the
volcano spits rock and gases rather than liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Usu erupts very infrequently -- about once every 30 years,
compared to about once a month for some Hawaiian volcanoes. It is
also a relatively new volcano, its first eruption occurring in
1663. Its last, in 1977-1978, claimed two lives in mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Locals have watched it drastically change shape over the past
few decades, going from two separate peaks to a squat and rugged
lump.
</P>
<P>
   Usu is the source of numerous hot springs, and soil enriched by
volcanic ash makes its slopes perfect for growing vegetables and
melons.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers, as well as merchants, are unable to tend to their
crops or their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Local business owners predicted that their difficulties will
continue long after the danger has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like I'm hanging in there, but inside I'm crying,''
said Setsuko Hasegawa, 52, who had to close up the three bars she
runs in Toya village and flee to the nearby town of Date.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa worried her staff of some 20 hostesses and dancers will
have found work somewhere else by the time the evacuation order is
lifted, and that regular customers will not have the money to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hasegawa holds no hard feelings. After 34 years in the
close-knit Usu community, she can't imagine leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the mountain, and I can't live somewhere else,'' she
said. ''I'll go back to business there eventually. There's no
question about that.''

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Pillow Student Expelled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Columbia University has expelled a Chinese
graduate student who officials say tainted a pillow in her
apartment with a radioactive material in an attempt to force the
school to let her switch majors from biology to business.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Yao Cheng, claims she didn't know how her pillow
became tainted with the radioactive stain.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng, who works in a lab in a building where the radioactive
material, phosphorus-32, is used in research to tag cells and
genes, has appealed the expulsion. If she loses the appeal, she
could forfeit her student visa and be forced to leave the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A Columbia spokesman declined Tuesday to comment on Cheng's
claims. A telephone number for Cheng could not be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng and her husband, Lei Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in computer
science, initially said a routine test on Feb. 8 showed she had
slight contamination on her hands, chin and hair. The next day she
borrowed a Geiger counter, scanned her apartment, found the pillow,
and reported it to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia suspended the couple when an investigation determined
the radioactive substance had been intentionally placed there.
Columbia officials said that during the investigation, Cheng
suggested that she might have to transfer her current studies from
biology to business.

<HEADLINE> Senator Seeks End To Smoke Grants  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the government urges people to stop
smoking, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has given
$4.2 million to build Indian-run smoke shops selling discount
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond proposed a halt Tuesday to the HUD grants
and was quickly seconded by Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, whose
agency previously has sparred with the senator over the shops.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is $4.2 million in HUD grants to American Indian smoke
shops and truck stops that sell cheap cigarettes. Bond, chairman of
the spending panel that controls HUD's budget, argues that cheaper
cigarettes encourage smoking among minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter where it happens, awarding government subsidies to
sell cheap cigarettes is a bad idea,'' Bond said Tuesday at a news
conference with the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids and the American
Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheaper cigarettes mean more kids smoking, and these grants
mean more cheap cigarettes,'' said Matthew L. Myers, president of
Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate begins a weeklong debate on a $1.83 trillion
budget for the coming fiscal year, Bond said he will introduce an
amendment to bar HUD from using tax dollars for smoke shops where
discount cigarettes are sold. While the spending resolution isn't
legally binding, it sends a powerful political message further
reinforced by Cuomo's support for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bond learned last spring of a 1997 grant to the Reno Sparks
Indian Colony in Verdi, Nev. While HUD told Bond ''only one'' smoke
shop received such a grant, the senator discovered a half-dozen
such grants.
</P>
<P>
   Small Business Committee counsel John Stoody narrated videotapes
Tuesday that he took of Oklahoma smoke shops and their advertising.
''Rows and rows of tobacco products of all kinds,'' Stoody said.
''Contrary to it being called a convenience store, this is all
cigarettes. If you call them on the phone, they'll answer,
'Thackerville Smoke Shop.'''
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials have insisted the agency has no legal authority to
ban sales of tobacco products in stores that get federal funds. But
Cuomo immediately embraced the senator's move Tuesday. ''This
legislation will give HUD the ability to refuse funding to tobacco
stores in all parts of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman David Egner said the agency told Bond last June
that it could not stop the grants without action by Congress and
would support restrictions like those proposed by Bond to stop
funding tobacco stores.

<HEADLINE> Klink Leads Early in Pa. Senate  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rep. Ron Klink led in early returns Tuesday
night in the race for the Democratic nomination to challenge
freshman Republican Sen. Rick Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 percent of precincts reporting, Klink had 45 percent, or
82,928 votes, while former state Labor Secretary Thomas P. Foley
had 24 percent, or 44,734 votes. State Sen. Allyson Y. Schwartz had
22 percent, or 39,981 votes. Three other candidates shared 8
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns were heavily from the western part of the
state, where Klink is well known because of his service in Congress
and his years as a news anchor on a Pittsburgh TV station.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum had no competition for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, Foley and Schwartz largely refrained from attacking each
other, choosing instead to take shots at Santorum, a key player on
welfare reform and the effort to ban what abortion foes call
''partial birth abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the final week of the primary campaign, the candidates
criticized one another's views on gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum has moderated his views since arriving in the Senate in
1995 as a conservative rebel after beating Democratic Sen. Harris
Wofford, who won a special election to succeed the late Republican
Sen. John Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   The last Democrat elected to a full term in the Senate was
Joseph Clark in 1962.

<P>
	   MENDHAM, N.J. (AP) -- Two private school students were slightly
injured Tuesday morning when their minibus overturned on the way to
school.
</P>
<P>
   The five students aboard were headed for The Pingry School in
Martinsville, Somerset County, when the vehicle flipped onto its
side in the road at about 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The minibus, owned by the Laidlaw Bus Co., had been privately
contracted by parents to take their children to the school for
grades 7 through 12, said Mark Maben, a Pingry School spokesman.
The school has another campus in Short Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The students were taken to Morristown Memorial Hospital. All
were treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Two students needed stitches for cuts on their heads. The others
were not hurt, Maben said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver had a small cut on her head, Maben said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Delivers 50 Fewer Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. delivered 50 fewer jetliners than
planned in the first quarter because of delays caused by the 40-day
strike by engineers and technical workers, the company reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the aerospace giant still plans to deliver about 490
jetliners by year's end as projected, down from last year's record
620, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to have our engineering and technical team back,''
chairman and chief executive officer Phil Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000 employees who returned to work March 20 have been
working to get the company back on track, said company spokesman
Larry McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be some impact in the first quarter, maybe in the
second quarter, but nothing to change our margins for the year,''
McCracken said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered 75 commercial planes, down from the 125
originally planned, in the first three months of the year. Fifteen
planes were delivered in March.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing delivered 26 military aircraft in the
quarter, including three C-17 transports, 14 fighter jets, two
Apache helicopters, one Chinook helicopter, four training jets and
two Delta II rockets.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike ended, Boeing chief financial officer Debby
Hopkins said the company would still meet its year 2000 financial
goals, with revenues remaining at $50 billion and profit margins at
around 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said deliveries in the second quarter would also be
affected by the strike, but she expected the declines to be offset
by increased commercial deliveries in the year's second half.

<HEADLINE> France Hunting Reform Bill Advances  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Some 50 hunting dogs joined the protest Tuesday,
but that didn't stop lawmakers tentatively passing a bill that to
revise French hunting traditions so they conform with European
Union standards.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial bill passed by a thin margin -- 275-252. The
five deputies from the Green Party of Environment Minister
Dominique Voynet, sponsor of the legislation, voted for the bill at
the last minute despite reservations so as not to endanger their
minister's standing.
</P>
<P>
   A first reading, the bill must now go to the Senate for possible
modification. However, the government hopes the bill will become
law by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters from the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition
parties had threatened to turn up in front of the National Assembly
with 577 dogs -- one for each deputy. However, only some 50 leashed
hunting dogs howled while lawmakers cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The small but vocal party complains that the bill fails to
recognize the local traditions ''that add to the originality of
French hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, debated for 25 hours last week, makes concessions to
hunters, like allowing night hunting in 20 regions where it is a
tradition and extending for two hours before dawn and after
nightfall waterfowl hunting.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the bill forbids hunting one day per week in
the hunting season and sets up controls over hunting the finances
of hunting federations so that funds won't go to demonstrations or
Saint-Josse's party.

<HEADLINE> Terry Nichols Bids For New Trial  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Terry Nichols on Tuesday appealed his conspiracy
conviction in the Oklahoma City bombing, claiming he was unfairly
denied a new trial after FBI tip sheets surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Susan L. Foreman argued the district court
erred last September when it denied Nichols' motion for a new trial
based on what the defense said was the prosecution's failure to
disclose evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening brief, Foreman also claimed the district court
improperly refused to order the government to turn over all of its
FBI ''lead sheets'' or order certain court proceedings about the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lead sheets,'' which are used to record information taken
during informal interviews or from callers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they failed to produce the lead sheets, which were
later shown to be material to Mr. Nichols' defense, Mr. Nichols'
trial was fundamentally unfair and a new trial is required,''
Foreman argued.
</P>
<P>
   The brief was filed in 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was convicted in 1997 of conspiracy and involuntary
manslaughter in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building that killed 168 people. He is serving a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' former Army buddy, Timothy McVeigh, was separately
convicted of murder and weapons counts and sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, Nichols' defense attorneys filed a motion
for a new trial, arguing prosecutors withheld information that
could have aided his defense until his trial was almost over.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 3-year-old boy kidnapped from a wealthy
suburb and held for more than two weeks for a $1.5 million ransom
was rescued by an FBI SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   The San Marino boy was safely returned to his parents Monday
night, and kidnapping charges were filed Tuesday against five men
and two teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found when FBI agents raided an apartment in South
Central Los Angeles where the kidnappers had left him in the care
of two women, said agent Stephen Wiley. The rescue operation was
peaceful, Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the victim and his family were not released.
Authorities would only say the father is a prominent Asian-American
executive in the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
   All of those arrested are of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   San Marino Police Chief Arl Farris said the 3-year-old boy was
taken on March 20 by two masked men who forced their way into the
family's home at midafternoon. The police chief said no ransom was
paid.
</P>
<P>
   San Marino is a wealthy enclave northeast of downtown Los
Angeles better known for the Huntington Library than for major
crimes. Almost entirely residential, the city's median home price
is $750,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Tommaso Buscetta, a top Mafia turncoat who helped
convict hundreds of mobsters in Italy and testified in the ''pizza
connection'' trial in the United States, died Sunday of cancer. He
was 71.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Buscetta turned Italian state witness after he was
arrested in Brazil on murder charges and extradited to Italy. Over
45 consecutive days, he revealed some of the Mafia's darkest
secrets, including its alleged relationship with Italy's political
class.
</P>
<P>
   Buscetta later moved to the United States, where he was given a
new identity under the U.S. witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, in the ''pizza connection'' trial in New York
City, Buscetta testified against 22 people charged with smuggling
$1.65 billion in heroin to the United States. The drugs allegedly
were sold through a network of pizza parlors in the Northeast and
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Buscetta testified that he had held many conversations in Brazil
in 1982 with one of the defendants, Gaetano Badalamenti, who was
convicted of running the international drug ring and sentenced to
30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a star witness in a series of trials in Italy in the
late 1980s that convicted over 350 Mafia figures.
</P>

<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Patrick Lalime stopped 19 shots for his
third shutout this season and Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson
scored twice as the Senators beat the Washington Capitals 4-0
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa set a franchise record with its 23rd home victory before
16,902 fans at the Corel Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Petr Schastlivy -- with his first NHL goal -- and Joe
Juneau also scored for the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Division-leading Capitals wasted an opportunity to
tie New Jersey atop the Eastern Conference standings. Both teams
have two games remaining. Washington, which has the league's best
record (30-10-4-1) since Jan. 1, lost for the third time in four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Barrasso was scheduled to make his eighth start in the
Senators' goal in nine games, but bruised his left index finger
when he was hit on the first warmup shot by Kevin Dineen.
</P>
<P>
   Lalime improved to 18-13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Billington, a former Ottawa goalie, started for Washington
and withstood a couple of flurries early in a scoreless first
period.
</P>
<P>
   Schastlivy, 20, called up from Grand Rapids of the IHL last
Thursday, scored at 9:17 of the second. Marian Hossa found the
Russian left-wing with a pass from the boards and Schastlivy deked
Billington.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson scored on a power play with 41 seconds left in the
period. He one-timed Sami Salo's pass, beating Billington from the
left faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa outshot Washington 21-7 in the middle period.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson scored his 20th goal just 39 seconds into the third.
Juneau added a one-timer from the edge of the crease at 3:17.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, winners of three of nine games, returned after an
0-3 road trip. Ottawa's home record improved to 23-11-5-2.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Despite a poor start from All-Stars Glenn
Robinson and Ray Allen, the Milwaukee Bucks got enough help Tim
Thomas and Ervin Johnson to defeat the Chicago Bulls 92-73 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (36-38) remained two games behind Orlando for the
eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Magic
defeated San Antonio 107-97 for their seventh consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas scored 11 first-quarter points and Johnson added six to
help pick up the slack as Robinson missed his first five shots and
Allen his first four.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, in quickly off the bench due to two fouls on Darvin Ham,
made all five of his shots in first period as the Bucks took a
24-18 lead. The Bucks pushed the lead to 18 points at the half and
30 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell led Milwaukee with the way with 19 points and 12
assists, while Allen scored 18 and Robinson 14.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand topped Chicago with 18 points and fellow rookie Ron
Artest scored 16.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee's Vinny Del Negro saw his first action in 11
games. He had been sitting out with a stress reaction in his right
leg. Bucks coach George Karl was going to call on the veteran guard
Sunday at Golden State, but Del Negro was in the restroom when his
name was called, and Karl instead inserted Rafer Alston ... Brand,
the NBA's rookie of the month in January and February, has led the
Bulls in scoring for 11 consecutive games, averaging 22.6 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Stan Drulia scored with a minute left in the
third period and relief goalie Dieter Kochan stopped 31 shots as
the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Boston Bruins 5-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Drulia scored from in-close after a Boston turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier had two goals and an assist for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Just 19 seconds after Tampa Bay took a 4-3 lead on Mike
Johnson's goal at 7:39 of the third, Steve Heinze tied it for the
Bruins, completing a 2-on-1.
</P>
<P>
   The power-play goal by Johnson, who also had two assists,
snapped the Lightning's 1-for-46 drought with the man-advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Boston outshot Tampa Bay 44-19, but went 0-for-7 on the
power-play.
</P>
<P>
   Kochan replaced Zac Bierk -- who allowed three goals on 13 shots
-- late in the first period. Kochan made his only other NHL
appearance on March 28, allowing four goals on 17 shots in a 4-2
loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The game between teams eliminated from postseason play featured
22 players with less than 90 games of NHL experience.
</P>
<P>
   Lecavalier's second goal and team-leading 25th -- which tied it
3-3 in the second period -- came as he was being pulled down by
Darren Van Impe. The center made a nifty move on goalie Robbie
Tallas, and then reached back one-handed and sent the puck into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Modin and Lecavalier scored on Tampa Bay's first two
shots of the game. Modin scored his 22nd goal 1:03 in, and
Lecavalier made it 2-0 just 43 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Boston responded with three straight goals. Cameron Mann and
Eric Nickulas scored 90 seconds apart midway through the first
period, and Brian Rolston put the Bruins ahead 3-2 just over four
minutes before the first intermission.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Anthony Mason scored 27 points as the Charlotte
Hornets shot a season-high 57 percent while rallying for a 112-105
victory over the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mason added 11 rebounds while Derrick Coleman had his own
double-double with 25 points and 14 rebounds as the Hornets won
their seventh straight.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, vying for home-court advantage in the first round of
the playoffs, moved into a fourth-place tie in the Eastern
Conference with Philadelphia (42-31).
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson scored 23 points for the Celtics, who lost their
eighth straight. Antoine Walker added 22 points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte never trailed again after Mason's free throw broke a
96-96 tie with 4:38 left. Seven straight points from the line gave
Charlotte a 103-98 advantage. A three-point play from Coleman with
1:23 left put Charlotte ahead 110-104, and Boston could manage only
a free throw from Paul Pierce the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Robinson scored 10 points off the bench on 5-of-5 shooting
in the second quarter to help Charlotte take a 54-53 lead into
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   With Coleman and Elden Campbell each going to the bench with a
fourth foul in the third quarter, Boston opened an 86-82 lead
entering the final period.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-1 run began when Anderson made a free throw from a
technical foul on Coleman, putting the Celtics ahead 67-61 with
7:22 left. The lead grew to 80-71 when Walker scored his eighth
point of the period with 2:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Mason scored five points in the final 1:24 as the Hornets
closed the quarter with an 11-6 run.
</P>
<P>
   Boston shot 55 percent in the first half, but Charlotte wasn't
far behind (54 percent). Four Hornets -- Eddie Jones with 14,
Coleman with 12 and Robinson and Mason with 10 apiece -- reached
double-figure scoring before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Jones finished with 25 points and eight assists.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Charlotte activated center Brad Miller, who had missed 21
games after Feb. 25 surgery to repair torn meniscus cartilage in
his left knee. The Hornets placed guard Michael Hawkins on the
injured list (tendinitis of the left knee) to make room for Miller.

<HEADLINE> Mandela: US, Britain Creating Chaos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela
criticized the United States and Britain for their handling of
conflicts in Iraq and Kosovo, saying they are creating chaos by
ignoring the views of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Wednesday by The Guardian newspaper,
Mandela said the United States and Britain were wrong not to seek
explicit permission for military action from the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message they're sending is that any country which fears a
(U.N.) veto can take unilateral action,'' Mandela was quoted as
saying. ''That means they're introducing chaos into international
affairs: that any country can take a decision which it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan along with Russia and China
criticized NATO for not seeking approval from the U.N. Security
Council before its 78-day air campaign against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   While there was also a wide consensus that the swift NATO action
was necessary to avert a humanitarian disaster, Mandela said such
actions set a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a totally wrong attitude,'' he said, noting that U.S. and
British officials ''must persuade those countries like China or
Russia who threaten to veto their decisions at the U.N.. They must
sit down and talk to them. They can't just ignore them and start
their own actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue also came up when the United States and Britain were
accused of unilaterally going ahead with bombing Iraq in 1998 after
the failure of U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to African issues, Mandela said the foreign armies
involved in Congo's civil war must honor a pledge and withdraw
their troops, or risk reducing the country ''to ashes.'' He said
the United Nations will not consider sending peacekeepers to Congo
until the violence has completely halted.
</P>
<P>
   He was also confident of a brighter future for war-stricken
Burundi where he is leading peace talks: ''A breakthrough is in the
offing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, 81, is frequently sought out as a mediator, but is now
turning down invitations. ''Three other countries have asked me to
sort out their problems,'' he said. ''But I'm not going to do so.''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 86, Hawks 76 (OT)  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rookie Will Avery filled in for point guard
Terrell Brandon and guided the Minnesota Timberwolves past the
Atlanta Hawks 86-76 in overtime Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jackson started in place of the flu-ridden Brandon but he
was largely ineffective. Not so Avery, whose 3-pointer with 1:56
left in OT gave the Wolves their biggest lead of the night, 82-73.
</P>
<P>
   Avery finished with a season-best 13 points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett had another poor shooting performance (9-for-26)
but managed 18 points, as did Joe Smith, who scored four baskets in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves nearly had a franchise first -- holding an opponent
scoreless in overtime. But Dion Glover swished a 3-pointer with
three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jackson's 13 points led the Hawks, who lost their ninth
straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 73 after regulation. Garnett missed an
18-foot jumper at the buzzer after Atlanta's Jason Terry drove the
lane and scored against Jackson with 3.6 seconds left to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves missed their first 11 shots, three by Jackson, and
Minnesota's starters were just 6-for-29 from the field in the first
half. They trailed 43-40 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   After Jim Jackson's jumper capped a 19-6 run spanning halftime
that gave Atlanta a 52-46 lead, the Wolves called a timeout and a
flustered fan behind the home bench yelled, ''These guys (stink)!''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett turned from the huddle and told the heckler: ''Get out
the gym, then. Leave!''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves were coming off back-to-back losses in which Garnett
scored just 14 points in each defeat, a 24-point loss to Indiana
and a one-point loss to Phoenix in which Minnesota blew a 13-point
fourth-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   The skid all but buried the Wolves' hopes of moving into fourth
place in the Western Conference and gaining homecourt advantage in
the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon's illness comes at a particularly bad time for the
Wolves, who play six of their next seven games on the road.
Saunders said he didn't know if Brandon would make the team's trip
to the West Coast on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wolves forward Tom Hammonds also sat out. He bruised his
right knee in a collision with Joe Smith at practice on Monday and
didn't dress for the game. ... Brandon missed his 10th game this
season. ... Atlanta leads the all-time series 14-6. ... Hawks
forward Chris Crawford sat out with a sprained left ankle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Recchi fed Simon Gagne for a breakaway goal
with 1:35 left as the Philadelphia Flyers held off the Atlanta
Thrashers 5-3 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Berube, Valeri Zelepukin and Andy Delmore each had a goal
and an assist to move the Flyers into a tie with Washington for
second place in the Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who trail Atlantic Division-rival New Jersey by two
points, have three games remaining, including a Thursday matchup
with the expansion Thrashers. New Jersey and Washington, a 4-0
loser at Ottawa on Tuesday, each have two games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Recchi's NHL-leading 60th assist, fired between the goal line
and the bottom of the right circle, hit Gagne right at the top of
the crease for a 5-3 lead. Gagne punched the puck under the right
leg of goalie Damian Rhodes for his 20th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers rookie Brian Boucher improved to 18-10-3 by making 22
saves. Boucher, who faced only 16 shots in a 1-0 loss at Carolina
on Sunday, made his third straight start. He entered with an
NHL-best 1.78 goals against average on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who made his 11th straight start, stopped 26 shots.
Rhodes, who dropped to 5-17-3, has faced 30 or more shots for six
straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers, whose 39 points are an NHL low, fell to 1-16-2 at
Philips Arena since beating the Flyers 1-0 on Jan. 14. But Atlanta,
owner of the league's third-worst power play unit, scored its first
two goals with a man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Primeau put the Flyers up 2-0, by extending his scoring
streak to four games at 11:26 of the first. Four minutes later,
Atlanta rookie Sergei Vyshedkevich scored his first career goal on
a slap shot from the center of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Karlsson, who scored Atlanta's second power-play goal,
was in front of the crease 9:15 into the second when he redirected
Frantisek Kaberle's slap shot just outside the top of the right
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson's fourth goal cut Philadelphia's lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Berube made it 3-1 by firing to the stick side of Rhodes 7:42
into the second. With 13:43 remaining, Delmore put Philadelphia up
4-2 with a rebound shot from the right side of the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which improved to 26-1-4 when leading after one
period, went up 1-0 just 1:50 in when Valeri Zelepukin fought off
Petr Buzek and Steve Guolla to take Keith Jones' feed from the left
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Sylvester's 16th goal, a rebound shot with 11:27 to go, cut
the Atlanta deficit to 4-3.

live on NHK-TV in Tokyo because of the presence of Seattle closer
Kazuhiro Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Jay Buhner, Seattle's regular right fielder who had
been in its opening night lineup for nine straight years, did not
start Tuesday night's opener against Boston's Pedro Martinez. He
was 0-for-8 lifetime with eight strikeouts against the two-time Cy
Young Award winner. Mariners manager Lou Piniella said Buhner would
be back in the starting lineup against the Red Sox on Wednesday and
Thursday nights. ... DH Edgar Martinez took batting practice before
the game and then was put in the lineup by Piniella. Martinez was

   CHICAGO: The White Sox are beginning their 100th season in the
AL with a 10-game, 11-day road trip that will take them to three
different time zones. After opening with four games in Texas, they
play three in Oakland and three in Tampa Bay before finally playing
their home opener April 14. ... Pitcher Kip Wells made his first
start in his home state of Texas. The native Texan and former
Baylor standout defeated Texas last year in Chicago He was the
first White Sox player from the 1998 draft to reach the majors.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Rafael Palmeiro was at first base and David Segui was at
designated hitter on Tuesday night, a switch from opening day.
Manager Johnny Oates is alternating the two in those positions for
the first four games. ''After that, we'll just look at the lineup
card and see where they are,'' Oates said. ... Palmeiro won his
third Gold Glove last year despite playing just 28 games at first
base. Segui, acquired in a trade with Toronto during the spring,
needs just 34 more games at first base to join Palmeiro on the list
of top 10 defensive first basemen in major league history. ...
Another change in the starting lineup was Frank Catalanotto at
second base, instead of Luis Alicea, a .201 hitter last year who
had three hits in the opener.

   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays are trying to start 2-0 for the first
time in their three-year history. ... How rare was leadoff hitter
Gerald Williams' home run Monday in Tampa Bay's first at-bat of the
season? The Elias Sports Bureau said it has only happened 17 times
in the last 25 seasons, and only three times in the 1990s.
Toronto's Shannon Stewart also homered to lead off the bottom of
the first Monday vs. Kansas City. ... Fred McGriff's grand slam
Monday marked the second game in a row Tampa Bay hit a grand slam --
Randy Winn hit an inside-the-park slam in the final game of 1999.

<P>
   MINNESOTA: Twins starter Eric Milton won his last three
decisions of 1999 in the Metrodome, including a Sept. 11 no-hitter
vs. Anaheim. ... Marcus Jensen made his Twins debut starting at
catcher. The other new starter from Monday's lineup is David Ortiz
at first base (for Ron Coomer). ... The Twins are trying to end a
nine-game losing streak dating back to last September.

Tigers-Athletics
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Since the beginning of last season, the Tigers have the
best save percentage in the major leagues. As a staff, Detroit has
converted 34 of 43 save opportunities, including Todd Jones' save
in Monday night's season-opening 7-4 win at Oakland. ... The
Tigers' Tony Clark finished one RBI shy last year of becoming the
first Tigers player ever to drive in at least 100 runs in each of
his first three full big league seasons. ... Luis Polonia was the
only Tiger to hit above .300 last season (.324). ... Dean Palmer
matched his career high with four hits in Monday night's
season-opening 7-4 win at Oakland. It was the fourth time he's had
four hits in a game but the first time since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Oakland's Tim Hudson, who went 11-2 last year, had the
best ever win-loss percentage (.846) by an Oakland rookie. He also
had the distinction of beating both of the Cy Young Award winners
on the road, defeating Randy Johnson at Arizona on July 10 and
Boston's Pedro Martinez on Aug. 19. ...

replaced Brosius at third. ... The Yankees are wearing black arm
bands this season in memory of former manager and Hall of Fame
pitcher Bob Lemon, who died Jan. 11.

   ANAHEIM: Closer Troy Percival, recognized at Monday's opener as
the reliever on the Angels' all-time team, was honored again
Tuesday morning by his former high school. Percival's No. 14 was
retired by his alma mater, Moreno Valley High, some 40 miles from
Anaheim. The school's baseball field also was dedicated in his
name. ''Much of who I am today was established at that high
school,'' he said. ''It might sound corny to say I'm humbled, but
believe me, that's truly the case.'' ... Anaheim's roster features
players from six different countries, including Jason Dickson of
Canada, Shigetoshi Hasegawa of Japan, Ramon Ortiz of the Dominican
Republic, Bengie Molina and Edgard Clemente of Puerto Rico, and
Benji Gil of Mexico.

NATIONAL LEAGUE
Brewers-Reds
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Ken Griffey Jr. sometimes faced an infield shift
while playing for Seattle, with teams moving the shortstop to the
first-base side of second. The Brewers copied it in the opener with
success -- shortstop Mark Loretta threw out Griffey on a grounder up
the middle. ''It's been done before,'' manager Davey Lopes said.
Reds manager Jack McKeon thinks Griffey will see the shift until he
beats it. ''He'll fool them one of these days. He'll hit the ball
right through that hole.'' ... P Steve Woodard got soaked on
opening day and wondered if there was a connection. When the Reds
finished their regular-season schedule in Milwaukee last Oct. 3,
heavy rain forced a five-hour, 47-minute delay. The two teams drew
a deluge and a three-hour delay before Monday's game was called.
''Maybe we should wait until there's a drought before we play
them,'' Woodard suggested.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Attendance for Tuesday night's makeup game
technically was zero. The attendance figure reflects the number of
tickets sold, and the Reds didn't sell any. Instead, fans who had
ticket stubs from Monday's called game were allowed in. ... Manager
Jack McKeon made two lineup changes, starting Benito Santiago at
catcher and Alex Ochoa in left field. McKeon likes to use his bench
players to keep them sharp. ''We got those guys in shape, we might
as well play them,'' McKeon said. ''You don't want them to sit too
long. I'll try to do it like I did last year, when we rotated
guys.''

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Following his grand slam on Monday night, Dodgers
first baseman Eric Karros has 212 career homers, second only to Ron
Cey's 228 on the Los Angeles career list. Karros' homer placed him
one ahead of Steve Garvey. Duke Snider's 389 leads all players on
the Dodgers franchise list, followed by Gil Hodges (361) and Roy
Campanella (242).
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: While the Expos signed a deal with French-language
radio station CKAC just hours before Monday night's season-opening
10-4 loss to Los Angeles, with no deal in place on the English
side, there was no local English language radio broadcast again for
the second straight game Tuesday night. ... Expos pitcher Dustin
Hermanson and general manager Jim Beattie attended a funeral
service in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., for Cindy Lloyd, the
26-year-old wife of Montreal reliever Graeme Lloyd, who died Monday
as a result of complications from Crohn's disease.

Giants-Marlins
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Several Giants said Florida's Alex Fernandez
pitched better on opening day than last year, when he was coming
back from shoulder surgery. ''This year I think he has more
velocity on his ball, and he has a better sink,'' outfielder Marvin
Benard said. ... Livan Hernandez, who was traded from Florida last
season, visited the Marlins clubhouse, a day after giving up five
runs and picking up the loss in the season opener. He joked most
with Marlins 1B Kevin Millar, one of Hernandez's five strikeout
victims.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Manager John Boles had trouble falling asleep after
Monday's 6-4 win over San Francisco in front of a sellout crowd:
''It took a while to calm down after that game. It was exciting.''
... Boles said he won't hesitate to use 1B Derrek Lee and OF Mark
Kotsay as defensive replacements early in games, especially if they
keep hitting. They both got hits in their first at-bats off the
bench Monday.

<P>
   HOUSTON: New CF Roger Cedeno was a late scratch Tuesday because
of a sore right elbow. Richard Hidalgo moved from LF to CF, with
Bill Spiers starting in LF. .. Because of Monday night's rainout,
Shane Reynolds' next start was pushed back from Saturday to Sunday.
Dwight Gooden makes his first Astros start Saturday at Enron Field
against Philadelphia. ... Several Astros complained following
Monday's rainout that it always seems to rain in Pittsburgh.
However, the Pirates had only one rainout last season, a mid-April
game against St. Louis. ... Astros president Tal Smith was among
the representatives of six teams attending a presentation about
holding spring training in Las Vegas. Smith said the Astros are
happy with Kissimmee, Fla., and attended the Las Vegas meeting only
to see what was being proposed there. ... Right-hander Scott
Elarton, on a rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A New Orleans,
starts Thursday on opening night against Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: How things have changed dept.: Catcher Jason Kendall
was the only opening night starter Tuesday who also started the
1997 opener, the Pirates' first under manager Gene Lamont. Kendall
made his fifth consecutive opening day start. ... Owner Kevin
McClatchy treated construction workers at the new PNC Park to a
lunch of hamburgers, hot dogs and salad, then distributed 200 free
tickets to the Pirates' opener. The stadium workers also will be
saluted before a home game later this season. Most of the new
ballparks have a 27-month construction schedule, but the Pirates
are trying to build PNC Park in 23 months. ... Kris Benson, 3-0 in
spring training, lost two of his three starts to Houston last year.
He starts Wednesday night against the Astros. ... Some Pirates
entertained themselves during Monday night's rain delay by watching
the Penguins game.

Rockies-Braves
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Tuesday night's start against Atlanta was the first
for Rolando Arrojo in the National League. He came to the Rockies
in a winter trade from Tampa Bay. The right-hander did pitch
against the Braves in 1998 when he won 14 games, giving up three
earned runs in 7 1-3 innings in a loss. This is his first visit to
Georgia since he defected in Albany in 1996 from the Cuban national
team before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Tom Glavine is hoping for a better start than last
season. The Braves left-hander went 3-6 last April and May with a
4.99 ERA, but finished the season at 14-11 with a 4.12 ERA. ...
John Rocker worked out with the club Tuesday prior to the game with
Colorado. Rocker, suspended for the first 14 days of the season,
said he will probably leave Wednesday for Orlando to begin extended
spring training. He's eligible to pitch again April 18 when
Philadelphia comes to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Phillies-Diamondbacks	   PHILLIES: Curt Schilling will pitch on opening day,
after all --
on Thursday for Class-A Clearwater. Manager Terry Francona says
Schilling's rehabilitation from shoulder surgery is progressing
well and is hopeful he will join the Phillies by late April. ''I'd
rather have him tonight, but he's doing terrific.'' Francona said.
... In his fifth season with Philadelphia, Francona says this is
the most optimistic he's been. ''We've got a closer (Mike Jackson).
We've got (Andy) Ashby and all our guys are a year older,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   DIAMONDBACKS: Closer Matt Mantei, on the 15-day disabled list
with biceps tendinitis, will begin throwing again Friday, Saturday
or Sunday, manager Buck Showalter said, and then will do some
rehabilitation with one of Arizona's minor league clubs. Until
Mantei returns, Arizona plans a closer-by-committee approach. ...
Left-handed reliever Greg Swindell was on hand for opening night
but leaves Tuesday for Texas and the funeral of his father, Harold,
who died after a long fight with cancer. Showalter said Swindell
will be gone at least Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mori Elected Japan Ruling Party Head  </HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Yoshiro Mori was elected president of Japan's
ruling party Wednesday, virtually ensuring he would become prime
minister later in the day. He replaces Keizo Obuchi, who was on
life support after suffering a massive stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The full Parliament was to meet later Wednesday to approve Mori
as the country's leader. Obuchi held both posts, but has been in a
coma since his sudden collapse on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Cabinet resigned Tuesday, paving the way for the
quick selection of a new prime minister. Mori is expected to be
named to that spot later Wednesday and a Cabinet could be installed
shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party president is assured of
approval as prime minister because of the party's majority in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Mori indicated shortly before the vote that he would accept the
prime minister post.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that is my fate, I will do my utmost for the people and for
the nation,'' Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers had promised to move swiftly to avoid a
political vacuum after Obuchi's collapse. The 62-year-old prime
minister suffered a stroke Sunday and lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   With Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party firmly in control of
parliament, the changes were not expected to bring any major shift
in political or economic policies. A new Cabinet will most likely
be the same as the old, with only the top spot changed.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62 -- who held the secretary-general post, the
second-highest official in the LDP -- has a reputation as a
conservative, and analysts said he would come under considerable
pressure to continue Obuchi's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had prayed for the prime minister's recovery,'' Mori said in
accepting the party presidency. ''I will do my best to live up to
the nation's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of a slight improvement in Obuchi's condition
Wednesday, said an aide to Tamisuke Watanuki, one of Obuchi's
closest allies. Details were not clear, but the aide said movement
had been detected in Obuchi's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials confirmed Obuchi remained in intensive care.
He was joined by his wife, Chizuko, his three children and his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mori emerged as the most viable replacement as soon as it became
clear that Obuchi's condition was grave. As LDP secretary-general,
Mori was the party's second-in-command after Obuchi and has a solid
power base.
</P>
<P>
   A former journalist and trade minister, Mori, 62, is considered
a conservative with considerable political savvy. But he has a
tainted past
</P>
<P>
   He is also not known for being strong on international affairs,
but that could be tested soon.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership crisis came as a volcanic eruption in northern
Japan has 13,000 people in emergency shelters. Concerns were also
being raised about the LDP's ruling alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Obuchi's stroke, the smaller of two parties with the
LDP in a ruling coalition announced it was splitting off. The loss
does not seriously threaten the Liberal Democrats' power, but could
make it more difficult for them to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Though unable to block it, opposition lawmakers were expected to
resist the appointment of a prime minister from the ruling
coalition's ranks. They were expected to demand an early election,
raising the possibility of a public ballot before July's G-8 summit
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki took over as Acting Prime
Minister Monday -- but was never seen as a contender to permanently
replace Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki has come under heavy criticism for failing to disclose the
crisis for almost a full day. On Tuesday, he apologized for false
reports that Obuchi had gone to bed as usual Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be careful in the future,'' Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998 and proved an
effective leader, helping stimulate the economy, boosting his
party's dominant position in parliament and championing legislation
that strengthened Japan's security role in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 104, Raptors 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Grant Hill had 32 points and Jerry Stackhouse
added 28 as the Detroit Pistons beat Toronto 104-88 Tuesday night,
extending the Raptors' slide and causing them to be booed in their
own building.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was 12-of-25 and added nine rebounds while Stackhouse shot
10-of-21 as the Pistons won their third straight road game.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, which held a three-hour team meeting Monday, lost its
fourth in a row. The Raptors were booed for the second straight
game by a sold-out crowd at the Air Canada Center.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit had 11 steals to Toronto's two, and went to the line 39
times compared with 17 for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady led Toronto with a career-high 28 points and added
11 rebounds while Vince Carter, who bruised his right shoulder on
Sunday, had 24 points. Dell Curry had 14 points in 18 minutes off
the bench, Antonio Davis had 12 rebounds and Charles Oakley grabbed
10 boards.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Raptors, who have lost eight of their last
nine and are only 1 1-2 games up on Detroit for the sixth seed in
the Eastern Conference, had complained about coach Butch Carter's
substitution patterns and play calling after the Indiana loss.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit let Toronto close a 15-point deficit to four when Carter
hit one of two free throws midway through the fourth quarter, but
Curry later threw the ball away on a Toronto possession which led
to a layup by Mikki Moore. Stackhouse then hit a 3-pointer with
2:50 to go to give the Pistons a comfortable 93-84 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons took advantage of the Raptors' sloppy defense and
took a 58-50 lead into the half on 50 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was allowed to drive to the basket all night. He tied it
38-38 4:19 into the second quarter on a layup and then gave the
Pistons the lead for good on a couple minutes later on a tough
drive in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto showed some life in the first quarter when McGrady
slammed down an alley-oop pass from Oakley to cap a 17-4 run and
open a 22-13 lead eight minutes into the game, but it was all
downhill after that.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start time was changed from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. to
accomodate the TNT telecast. ... The Pistons have a stretch of 11
games in 19 nights, including four sets of back-to-back games. ...
Detroit is 15-4 overall against Toronto. ... Carter turned the ball
over three times in the first quarter. ... The Raptors haven't had
a lead entering the fourth quarter for the last 12 games. ...
Detroit is 6-1 on the road under interim coach George Irvine.

<HEADLINE> Japan, NKorea Begin Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- North Korean and Japanese
negotiators on Wednesday began their first talks in eight years on
establishing diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they would try to bridge their many differences,
including Tokyo's concerns over a North Korean ballistic missile
that was fired over Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Difficult problems exist, but I want to achieve mutual
understanding so we can overcome those issues,'' Kojiro Takano,
Tokyo's chief negotiator, told his counterpart, Jong Thae-kwa, as
the meeting began at the People's Palace of Culture. ''We have a
great determination to bring these talks to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In his brief speech, Jong agreed that reaching an accord would
not be easy, but added: ''Where there's a will there's a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar normalization talks between Japan and North Korea broke
down in 1992, and swift progress now is not expected.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang needs help from richer countries to feed its
impoverished people and modernize its decaying infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also demands compensation and an apology for
suffering caused by Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule over
Korea. That obstacle was clear in Pyongyang's state-run media.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 5, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jeff Cirillo hit three doubles, including a
three-run drive in the seventh inning that rallied the Colorado
Rockies over the Atlanta Braves 5-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 26,132 was the smallest ever at Turner Field, which
opened for the 1997 season. The previous low was 26,990 last April
27 against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett, in relief of Tom Glavine and making his first
appearance with the Braves, managed to get only one out before
being hammered by the Rockies in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (0-1) gave up one-out singles to pinch-hitter Aaron
Ledesma and Tom Goodwin and a walk to Mike Lansing, loading the
bases. Cirillo then lined his double down the line in left.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, subbing for an ailing Brian Jordan, hit a two-run
homer off Colorado starter Rolando Arrojo in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, who homered Monday in his triumphant return
from cancer, put the Braves ahead 3-2 in the fifth when he was hit
by a pitch with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez (1-0) came on to get Quilvio Veras for the third
out and earned the win. Jose Jimenez pitched three scoreless
innings of one-hit ball for a save.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Arrojo had an RBI double for his first hit in the
majors. Goodwin followed with a triple off Bonilla's glove in left
field to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine pitched six innings. The left-hander gave up five hits
and two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, making his NL debut after being acquired from Tampa Bay,
was taken out after 5 2-3 innings. He left after giving up a
two-out single to Rafael Furcal -- the first major league hit for
the 19-year-old rookie -- who stole second, and an intentional walk
to pinch-hitter Wally Joyner.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jordan, originally in the Braves lineup and batting fourth,
was a late scratch. He said he's had some soreness in his right
side the last 3-4 days and team doctors have scheduled tests for
Wednesday to determine the cause. ... Furcal, who made the jump
from Class A to the majors after stealing 96 bases last season,
made his debut at shortstop. In his first at-bat in the second
inning, he fouled off eight straight pitches before striking out on
the 12th pitch. ... The start was No. 400 for Glavine, who has a
187-116 career record. ... Atlanta reliever John Rocker, suspended
for the first 14 days of the season, will make his first extended
spring camp appearance in Orlando, Fla., on Friday. He's eligible
to pitch with the Braves on April 18. ... Colorado's Larry Walker,
the two-time defending NL batting champion, was scratched from
Tuesday night's game with a mild right calf strain. He was
available to pinch hit. Walker, who missed the last five games of
the spring with the injury, started in Monday's season opener and
went 2-for-4.

<HEADLINE> Gore Takes Stand on Social Security  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush converged on the
presidential battleground of Pennsylvania Tuesday, with the vice
president announcing a plan to increase Social Security for
millions of women while Bush focused anew on education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also took aim at the Texas governor's proposal to allow
private retirement accounts in the Social Security system, telling
senior citizens, ''If he gets his hands on America's retirement
system, it will quickly become a system of social insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Bush met with Latino leaders and held an education
roundtable discussion. After rolling out new literacy and teacher
aid programs last week, he reviewed his plans to pass federal
education money to states with few strings if they develop
accountability systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded to both Gore's Social Security criticism and
proposal by telling reporters: ''I can't think of a better reform
than allowing women to manage their own personal savings
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months before the election, with the Democratic and
Republican nominations essentially assured, Gore and Bush are
beginning to focus on five or six swing states that could determine
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   While most are in the Midwest, one is Pennsylvania, which has 23
electoral votes. Tuesday was primary day in the state, and Bush and
Gore easily won their party contests.
</P>
<P>
   The race remains close nationally. According to a new Gallup
Poll, Bush had 46 percent and Gore 45 percent among likely voters,
a dead heat given the poll's error margin of plus or minus 5
percentage points for 498 likely voters interviewed last Thursday
through Sunday. Bush had a 49 percent to 43 percent edge among
likely voters in the poll in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania voted Republican in the 1988 presidential election,
but Democratic in the last two. It has a Republican governor, Tom
Ridge, but a nearly equally split congressional delegation of 11
Democrats and 10 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   To capture such states, Bush and Gore are anxiously courting
independents and women. Polls show women in particular are
concerned about issues such as education while many voters worry
about the solvency of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed Social Security revisions that would benefit
widows and an estimated 8 million working parents -- most of them
women.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said parents should receive credit for up to
five years of work if they take that time to raise their children.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Social Security payments are based on average
earnings over 35 years of work. Because many women leave the work
force for several years to raise children, the typical woman works
27 years -- penalizing her when it comes to Social Security
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Giving her credit for some of that lost time would increase
Social Security benefits by about $600 per year, Gore's campaign
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said widows should receive larger Social Security
payments when their husbands die.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, a widow's payment can be as much as halved
when her spouse dies. The vice president wants to increase the
payment to three-quarters of the former amount.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you entrust me with the presidency, I make you this
promise,'' Gore told seniors at the Fels Community Center, some
using walkers and others wearing large sunglasses to block the
harsh TV lights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make the modest but crucial adjustments in our Social
Security system that will make it fairer for American women to
honor their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides did not offer a cost for the proposals but said both were
accounted for in Gore's overall Social Security plan.
</P>
<P>
   While talking about Social Security, Gore repeatedly labeled
Bush's proposed five-year, $483 billion tax cut a ''risky tax
scheme'' that would not leave any money to reform Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has committed to ensuring that all payroll taxes be spent
only on Social Security, not borrowed for other government
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said: ''To those who play around with raising the
retirement age to 70, and play around with cutting deeply into the
benefits or privatize part of Social Security, I say, 'Not if I
have anything to say about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he welcomed the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the status quo, an administration that has not tried to
reform Social Security, versus an administration that will put
capital on the line to say to both Republican and Democrats, 'Let's
come together to make sure there's a Social Security system
available to both women and men in the long run,''' the governor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore went to New York for two fund-raising events on Long
Island to benefit the Democratic National Committee. A reception
with 50 people was raising $50,000 while guests at a dinner
featuring rack of lamb was to net $250,000. Bush was returning to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At the smaller gathering at the Northshore Day Camp in Glen
Cove, N.Y., Gore described his contest against Bush as a
''mountaintop moment'' and said their opposing positions on such
issues as taxes, education, health care, guns and the environment
present ''as stark and clear and sharp a contrast as in any
election in American history.''

   ''We're asking the Yugoslav government to reconsider this and
rescind it,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Gall, a British citizen based in Belgrade, had been working in
Kosovo when her visa expired more than a month ago, Rosenthal said.
The Yugoslav government declined to renew it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Testa had traveled to Montenegro, which is part of the
Yugoslav federation but apparently imposed no visa restriction. On
Sunday, they were headed back to Kosovo by car when they missed a
turn on a road.
</P>
<P>
   They mistakenly entered Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic,
where they were arrested, Rosenthal said. A magistrate accused them
of entering Serbia without a Yugoslav visa, issued the ban and
imposed a fine of about $160 for each.
</P>
<P>
   Gall was released and allowed to travel back to Kosovo, said
Rosenthal, and ''she remains our Yugoslav correspondent.'' He did
not immediately know Testa's whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 105, Kings 102  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Finley scored 38 points and converted two
key free throws with 15.4 seconds left as the Dallas Mavericks beat
the Sacramento Kings 105-102 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had four second-half 3-pointers and the Mavericks went
13-for-19 from 3-point range to win for the ninth time in their
last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were without leading scorer and rebounder Chris
Webber, held out as he rested a strained left hamstring. Webber
suffered the injury in the second half of Sunday's victory over
Philadelphia and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss Williamson's 20 points paced the Kings, who had won six
of their previous nine. Vlade Divac added 16 points and 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Strickland had 21 points and Dirk Nowitzki added 13 for
the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings rallied from a 17-point third-quarter deficit and were
within 103-102 with 19.8 seconds left on Jason Williams' layup.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley made two free throws with 15.4 seconds left to extend
Dallas' advantage to 105-102.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento tried to work Predrag Stojakovic free for a
3-pointer, but Stojakovic stepped out of bounds in the left corner
with 2.7 seconds left before he was able to get a shot off.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento took a 97-96 lead with 3:38 left on Stojakovic's
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley converted two free throws, then hit a short jumper
with 2:40 left to give Dallas a 100-97 advantage with 2:40
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were in front by as many as 17 in the third
quarter before the Kings went on a 13-2 run to reduce the deficit
to 72-66. Sacramento was within 80-75 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mavericks reserve guard Robert Pack missed the game after
undergoing root canal surgery earlier in the day. ... Dallas shot
58 percent (25-for-43) in the first half and held a 58-46 halftime
lead. ... Finley's season high is 39 points. ... Webber is
averaging 24.2 points and 10.6 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 2, Mariners 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Pedro Martinez started this season the same way
he ended last year -- with pure dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 11 and held Seattle to only two hits in
seven sharp innings Tuesday night, pitching the Boston Red Sox past
the Mariners 2-0 in a season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Playing their first season without Ken Griffey Jr. since 1989,
the Mariners could not touch Martinez, the unanimous AL Cy Young
winner last season after going 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez finished last year with 17 shutout innings in the
postseason. He did not come close to allowing a run against Seattle
-- he has given up only one earned run in his last 42 innings.
</P>
<P>
   A Safeco Stadium record crowd of 45,552 saw Martinez (1-0) give
up a bloop single by Carlos Guillen in the third inning and a
ground single by John Olerud in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez walked the Mariners' main offensive threat, Alex
Rodriguez, with two outs in the first and sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who traded Griffey to Cincinnati in February, did
not have any other runners against Martinez. Mike Cameron, one of
the players acquired for Griffey, was 0-for-4 and struck out three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe relieved to start the eighth and completed the
combined two-hitter. Before the game, he agreed to a four-year
contract worth about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer (0-1) was even with Martinez until the sixth when
the Red Sox scored their first run on Troy O'Leary's infield
single.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin and newcomer Carl Everett singled and Mike Stanley
walked to load the bases. O'Leary hit a slow roller and barely beat
second baseman David Bell's throw.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Red Sox drove Moyer from the game when Jason
Varitek walked, Darren Lewis sacrificed and Jose Offerman hit an
RBI double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez had 10 or more strikeouts 19 times last season.
... Moyer, 37, got his first opening night assignment. ... Mariners
right fielder Jay Buhner was held out of making his 10th straight
opening night assignment because he has eight strikeouts in his
0-for-8 lifetime appearances against Martinez. ... The temperature
at the start of the 5:05 p.m. PDT opener was 50 degrees with a
north wind of 13 mph. The retractable roof was open for opening
ceremonies and then closed for the game. ... Martinez was taken out
after making 108 pitches, 60 for strikes.

Nasdaq, Dow Dive, Recover
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fueled by an exodus from all things technological, the stock
market went into a stomach-churning rout today, with the Nasdaq composite index
and Dow Jones industrials each dropping more than 500 points before recovering.
The selloff came amid a collapse of the euphoria over high-tech issues that had
driven the Nasdaq to unprecedented gains in recent months. Analysts said they
couldn't point to any one factor in today's massive selling, but most said the
purge was long overdue. The Nasdaq was down 574.57 points at midday, then clawed
back to finish down 74.79 at 4,148.89. The Dow rose 196.31 points this morning
before diving to a loss of 504.15 in early afternoon. It finished down 57.09 at
11,164.84.

Mori Elected Japan Ruling Party Head
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Yoshiro Mori was elected president of Japan's ruling party
Wednesday, replacing Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was on life support after
suffering a massive stroke. The full Parliament was to meet later Wednesday to
approve Mori as prime minister. Obuchi held both posts, but has been in a coma
since his sudden collapse on Sunday. The entire Cabinet resigned Tuesday, paving
the way for the quick selection of a new prime minister. Mori is expected to be
named to that spot later Wednesday and a Cabinet could be installed shortly
after that. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party president is assured of approval
as prime minister because of the party's majority in Parliament.

   PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- North Korean and Japanese negotiators on
Wednesday began their first talks in eight years on establishing diplomatic
relations. Both sides said they would try to bridge their many differences,
including Tokyo's concerns over a North Korean ballistic missile that was fired
over Japan in 1998. The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.
Similar normalization talks between Japan and North Korea broke down in 1992,
and swift progress now is not expected. Pyongyang needs help from richer
countries to feed its impoverished people and modernize its decaying
infrastructure.

23 tonight as the Orlando Magic beat the San Antonio Spurs 107-97 for their
season-high seventh straight victory. Chucky Atkins, who had 16 points, led a
fourth-quarter surge by reserves who helped Orlando pull away for good. The
rookie had five points and three assists in the 13-4 run that put the Magic up
93-78 with just under six minutes to go. The Spurs, who got 30 points from David
Robinson, cut their deficit to 97-91 with 1:44 left. But Amaechi made a one-hand
runner on the baseline and Atkins followed with a clutch jumper to put the Magic
back in control.

5-3 tonight. The crowd of 26,132 was the smallest ever at Turner Field, which
opened for the 1997 season. The previous low was 26,990 last April 27 against
Pittsburgh. John Burkett, in relief of Tom Glavine and making his first
appearance with the Braves, managed to get only one out before being hammered by
the Rockies in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> 530 Guerrillas Surrender in India  </HEADLINE>
By WASBIR HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- More than 530 separatist guerrillas armed
with guns and explosives surrendered their weapons to authorities
Tuesday, giving up their fight for independence for the eastern
state of Assam.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 532 insurgents belonged to the middle and senior
ranks of the United Liberation Front of Asom, a group that has
fought Indian security forces for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels laid down nearly 100 weapons, including assault
rifles, explosives, pistols, and communication gear in the Rang
Ghar, an amphitheater used from the 13th century by the royalty of
the Ahom tribe, the major ethnic group of Assam.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender in Sibsagar, the former capital of the Ahom
rulers, was the biggest since the United Liberation Front of Asom
was created in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. D.B. Shekatkar, the commander leading operations in
Assam, said 1,800 to 2,000 fighters remained in the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Assam is the biggest of the seven states in India's remote far
east, separated from the rest of India by Bangladesh and linked by
a narrow corridor along the border with Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 have been killed in the campaign by ULFA. Dozens
of people, especially executives of the area's huge tea
plantations, have been kidnapped for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall be providing the surrendered militants with all
possible help and support, including vocational training, to enable
them to lead a normal life,'' said Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar
Mahanta.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends Fund-Raisers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton extended birthday wishes to
a Senate ally and lent his fund-raising talents to the Democratic
National Committee Tuesday night in back-to-back receptions.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop was at a gathering for Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
The event was part fund-raiser, part birthday party for Leahy, who
turned 60 on Saturday. Elected to a fifth term in 1998, Leahy has
not announced whether he will run again in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The reception was hosted by Bobby Muller, president of the
Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation. Leahy and Muller worked
together in the international effort to ban the use of land mines.
Muller's foundation finances the International Campaign to Ban
Landmines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and Muller are also allies in an effort to broaden legal
protections for defendants facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's next stop was a dinner fund-raiser for the Women's
Leadership Forum, an arm of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Forty people paid $20,000 each to dine on sea bass and asparagus
and mingle with Clinton, DNC chairman Joe Andrews and event host
Carol Pensky, founder of the Women's Leadership Forum.

<HEADLINE> London Gang Family Member Kray Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Charlie Kray, a member of a well-known British
crime family, died Tuesday. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Kray was a prison inmate with 10 years to go on his latest term
for masterminding a $64 million cocaine deal in 1997. Kray was
hospitalized outside of the prison in March with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   A former professional boxer, he was the eldest son in a criminal
family that was especially active in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray ran the London underworld until
they were sentenced to 30 years in jail in 1969 for the murder of
rivals Jack McVitie and George Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Kray denied his role in the murder but was jailed for 10
years for helping to dispose of McVitie's body, and was released in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   He lacked his brothers' reputation for violence, but police
suspected he was the brains behind a criminal empire which targeted
bookmakers, pubs, clubs and gambling bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie died in 1995. Charlie Kray is survived by his wife,
Roberta, and his brother Reggie, 66, who is still in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral details were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Twins 6, Devil Rays 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- David Ortiz singled home Cristian Guzman with
two outs in the ninth inning Tuesday night, leading the Minnesota
Twins to 6-5 come-from-behind victory over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota stopped a nine-game losing streak that include a
season-ending eight-game skid last year.
</P>
<P>
   John Flaherty homered and tied his career high with five RBIs
for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker reached second with one out in the ninth on second
baseman Miguel Cairo's two-base error, then scored the tying run on
Guzman's double off Roberto Hernandez. Matt Lawton fouled out and
Ortiz followed with the winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (0-1), who was 43 of 47 in saves last year, blew his
first opportunity of the season. Hector Carrasco (1-0) got one out
for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty hit a three-run homer to put the Devil Rays ahead in
the second following one-out singles by Greg Vaughn and Herbert
Perry, then made it 5-2 with a two-run double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, signed as a free agent during the offseason, was 2-for-3
with a double and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Rupe allowed three runs and six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Milton allowed five runs and seven hits in six innings and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota closed to 3-2 in the second on two-out singles by
Jacque Jones and Marcus Jensen, and Torii Hunter's two-run double.
Jones, who went 3-for-4, added RBI singles in the fourth and the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Gerald Williams homered leading off the game Monday,
it was only the 17th time in 25 seasons a player homered leading
off a team's season, according to the Elias Sport Bureau. It
happened only three times in the 1990s but already twice in 2000s:
Shannon Stewart homered Monday against Kansas City in Toronto's
first at-bat. ... For the second season in a row, the Twins had a
huge dropoff in attendance from opening day, going from 43,830 to
7,020. Last year's dropoff was from 45,601 to 9,220. ... Jensen, in
his Twins debut, started at catcher and went 2-for-4. The other new
starter from Monday's lineup was Ortiz at first base (for Ron
Coomer). Minnesota was 1-87 last year when trailing after eight
innings.

<HEADLINE> Russia Arrests Suspect in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Authorities have detained a suspect in the March
1999 bombing of a Russian market that killed 50 people, the news
agency ITAR-Tass reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blast devastated the main market in Vladikavkaz, capital of
the Caucasus republic of North Ossetia, and was the worst violence
to hit the republic since a 1992 war with ethnic Ingush.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions from that war occasionally still flare up in
house-bombings and clashes between ethnic Ossetians and Ingush.
Also contributing to tensions is the stated aim of separatists in
neighboring Georgia's South Ossetian region to unite with North
Ossetians.
</P>
<P>
   The report, citing sources in the Federal Security Service, said
the suspect has a Georgian surname and gave his first name as
Gabit, but did not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
   It said he was arrested in Sochi, a Russian resort town on the
Black Sea, and taken to Vladikavkaz for interrogation.

<HEADLINE> Striking LA Janitors Block Streets  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Striking janitors blocked intersections in
downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, the second day of a walkout that
threatens to leave three-fourths of the county's commercial space
without cleaning services.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no injuries or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed an offramp of the downtown Harbor Freeway for 25
minutes starting about 8:30 a.m. as dozens of strikers sat down in
the middle of a nearby intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Later, hundreds of janitors seeking higher pay marched through
downtown and blocked traffic in front of government and office
buildings. The tactics at least drew the attention of harried
rush-hour drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't care what the issues are. I'm just trying to
get to work,'' driver Lorecca Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,500 union-affiliated janitors are pressing for a
$1-an-hour raise each year for the next three years. They began
walking off the job Monday night and say their ''rolling strike''
will grow building by building until most of Los Angeles County is
without cleaning services by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers also won symbolic support Tuesday from the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors, which voted 3-2 to back their effort
after union head Mike Garcia pleaded for their support.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts between Service Employees International Union Local
1877 and the 18 cleaning companies who hire the janitors expired
Friday night. No new talks were scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested For WWII Machine Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILTON KEYNES, England (AP) -- A 50-year-old man was under arrest
Tuesday in connection with the theft of a World War II Enigma
encoding machine, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, used by the Nazi's to send top secret messages, was
stolen from a glass cabinet at the Bletchley Park museum, northwest
of London.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the machine, worth an estimated $150,000 and and
a bit larger than a typewriter, was taken overnight on Friday or
during a public open day held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was being questioned by police but charges had not
been laid Tuesday evening, police said. The Enigma machine itself
was not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, one of only three left in the world, was part of a
display at Britain's top-secret World War II intelligence center
where teams of mathematicians, linguists and chess champions
famously cracked the secrets of Nazi Germany's Enigma code, used to
direct German U-boats to their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that the cracking of Enigma was a major factor in
the Allied victory and may have helped to shorten the war.

<HEADLINE> Senegal President Appoints Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Senegal's new president has named a
broad-based Cabinet that includes representatives of the major
opposition parties and members of civil society.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdoulaye Wade, a longtime opposition leader,
appointed 11 members of his Senegalese Democratic Party to the
25-member Cabinet on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The party of Prime Minister Moustapha Niasse, a rival opposition
leader who backed Wade in the second round of elections last month,
received four posts.
</P>
<P>
   A Senegalese national living in the United States, Mokhtar Diop,
was named finance minister, and a World Bank official, Cheikh
Tidiane Gadio, became foreign affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet includes a record five women, but most were assigned
relatively junior portfolios, such as family affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's election, which ended the Socialist Party's 40-year rule
in Senegal, was a rare victory for democratic change on a continent
plagued by election fraud, coups and civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Abdou Diouf, who came to power in 1981, did not
wait for the official results before conceding defeat to his rival
in the runoff ballot.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Mayor Elected To 4th Term  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Mayor John Norquist won a fourth four-year term
Tuesday, defeating a downtown businessman who targeted Norquist's
record on crime, taxes and keeping jobs in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist had 56 percent of the vote to George Watts' 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates spent about $1 million on the campaign, with the
50-year-old Norquist running upbeat ads showing him jogging around
Milwaukee streets and closing up drug houses alongside police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Watts largely played to the right of the Democratic mayor in
this Democratic city, questioning his dedication to local
businesses and law enforcement. Watts challenged Norquist's
assertion that crime in Milwaukee is going down and called for the
ouster of the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   In one TV commercial, Watts read off a list of Milwaukee's ills,
such as the recent closing of a leather plant. Asking what Norquist
did about the problems, Watts looked up at a silent mannequin of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 miles to the northwest in the small town of Tomah, Ed
Thompson, the younger brother of Gov. Tommy Thompson, beat
incumbent Mayor Bud Johnson 1,179 to 909.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I'm king of the world,'' said Ed Thompson, 55, who
has been a professional poker player in Las Vegas, a prison cook, a
snow plow driver, and a boxer in ''Toughman'' contests.
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided to run for mayor after his supper club, Mr.
Ed's Tee Pee, was raided for allegedly operating illegal video
gambling machines. Thompson settled out of court and agreed not to
operate video poker machines for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he hoped to whittle down Tomah's $32 million debt
and sounded ready to continue his campaign to legalize tavern
gambling, which he says would allow competition with Wisconsin's
tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not campaign in Tomah for his brother.

<HEADLINE> Madagascar Cyclone Creates Homeless  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Cyclone Hudah has created a
desperate situation in northern Madagascar with 100,000 people
homeless and in need of shelter and food, aid officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really a disaster. No houses are untouched. There is
no power. The winds were so strong there are no trees,'' World Food
Program spokesman Salha Halado said Tuesday after returning from a
survey flight over Antalaha, the northeast town where Hudah made
landfall on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, residents of northeastern Madagascar picked through
the wreckage left by the cyclone and fashioned makeshift shelters
from the debris of their former homes that had been ripped apart by
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials worried about possible food shortages because
the storm also destroyed food storage warehouses and access to the
area was limited.
</P>
<P>
   Hudah charted a devastating course across the Indian Ocean
island Sunday night and Monday, killing two people. About 100,000
people in Antalaha, the heart of the country's vanilla growing
region, were thought to have been left homeless by the storm, the
National Disaster Committee said.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclone, now downgraded to a tropical storm, was over the
Mozambique Channel on Tuesday, moving slowly towards Mozambique
where flooding from torrential rains and an earlier cyclone left
699 dead and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hudah was expected to land early Wednesday morning in northern
Mozambique, the South African Weather Bureau in Pretoria said
Tuesday evening. The storm was gaining power as it crossed the
Mozambican Channel, and it was expected to bring heavy rains, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudah was not expected to cause as much damage as previous
storms, but there were fears of more flooding.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 12, White Sox 8  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro hit a three-run homer in
the first inning and added an RBI single in a seven-run sixth,
leading the Texas Rangers past the Chicago White Sox 12-8 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, Texas got big production from the
guys that came over from Detroit in the Juan Gonzalez trade.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalonotto started the winning rally with a two-run homer
that tied the game at 6, reliever Francisco Cordero (1-0) picked up
the victory and opening-day hero Gabe Kapler went 3-for-5 with a
double and a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer continued the sixth-inning comeback with a bloop RBI
double off reliever Bill Simas (0-1), then scored on Palmeiro's
chopper up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui's RBI groundout with one out and the bases loaded
made it 9-6. Kapler appeared to have ended it with a roller to
third base, but Paul Konerko's throw to first was so wide not even
6-foot-5 Frank Thomas could get a glove on it, allowing two more
runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox went ahead 4-3 by getting six hits in a
seven-batter span off Rangers starter Rick Helling. The first three
hits were doubles and the fourth was an RBI triple by Chris
Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton singled home a run in the fifth, upping the lead to
5-3, but Texas got the run back on an RBI single by rookie Ruben
Mateo. The hit chased Chicago starter Kip Wells, a Houston native
and Baylor product looking to win in his first big league game in
his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had an RBI single in the sixth that again gave the White
Sox a two-run cushion. Then, after Chicago was down by five, Carlos
Lee hit a two-run homer in the seventh that cut the deficit to
11-8.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' nerves showed early as he walked two of the first three
batters, then hung an 0-1 breaking ball to Palmeiro and saw it end
up 431 feet away in the upper deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   He settled in a bit, but lost control again in the fourth and
walked the Nos. 8 and 9 hitters with two outs. In 4 1-3 innings, he
gave up four runs on four hits and tied his career-best with six
strikeouts. He also walked six.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who led the majors with 41 homers allowed last season,
got through the order once despite tossing many high, hittable
pitches, but it caught up to him in the fourth. He allowed four
runs on seven hits in 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero allowed Chicago's runs in the fifth and sixth, but got
the win thanks to Texas' rally in the bottom of the sixth. He also
gave up three hits in his 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ivan Rodriguez drew a full-count walk for the second
straight game, despite his vow Monday to walk even less than the 24
walks he had last season. ... Jeff Abbott, who came into the game
4-for-6 against Helling, had the hit that knocked Helling out of
the game. ... Singleton seemed to have stolen second base on
Rodriguez, but it didn't count because Carlos Lee interfered with
the Gold Glove catcher for the last out of the second inning. After
swinging and missing strike two, Lee's follow-through caught the
back of Rodriguez's right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Episopal Bishops Disagree on Gays  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE ARROWHEAD, Calif. (AP) -- During a five-day retreat that
ended Tuesday, 135 of the nation's Episcopal bishops agreed to
disagree over the issues of ordaining homosexual priests and
blessing gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the House of Bishops discussed but did not take
any official stand on the matters during the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Griswold III, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church,
said the 2.5-million-member U.S. denomination will maintain its
tradition of respecting dioceses' rights to make their own
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the retreat admitted there was tension between
conservative and liberal clergy, but said frank group discussions
helped create an atmosphere of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Gay issues have created a rift between liberal and conservative
Episcopalians, as they have in other denominations. Some dioceses
have ordained gay priests and blessed gay marriages, even though
the church's parent group, the worldwide Anglican Communion, called
homosexuality ''incompatible with Scripture'' two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rift widened in January when two American priests who oppose
homosexuality were consecrated as bishops in Singapore -- without
church approval -- by two conservative bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold said the church is taking no action against the
priests, but added that they ''may very well be the beginnings of
another breakaway church.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to be a focal point during the triennial
General Convention in July in Denver. Bishop Fred Borsch of the Los
Angeles diocese said one reason the House of Bishops did not issue
a resolution on the issue of homosexuality was because the
convention is so soon.
</P>
<P>
   The General Convention has final authority on matters of
doctrine and policy. It is composed of about 300 members of the
House of Bishops and about 800 clergy and lay people.
