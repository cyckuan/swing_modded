<HEADLINE> Tajik Opposition Leader Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Unified
Tajik Opposition was killed in the republic's capital of Dushanbe
on Tuesday morning, said an Itar-Tass news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Otakhon Latifi, chairman of a subcommission for legal issues
under the Commission for National Reconciliation, was shot to
death when he was leaving his house in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
There were no details about the murder. And the source
interviewed by Itar-Tass refused to give any comments.
</P>
<P>
Latifi came to Dushanbe together with other opposition members
of the commission in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
He was a correspondent of the Pravda newspaper for Tajikistan
in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1990s, he was deputy prime
minister in the national reconciliation government.
</P>
<P>
While condemning the killing, the United Nations mission in
Tajikistan said Latifi made a significant contribution to the
peace process of the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission called on the Tajik government and the
opposition to adhere to their commitments on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign ministry also condemned the murder, saying
the event shows there are forces in Tajikistan that are not
interested in the stabilization of the country's situation.

UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday appealed to the Security Council members to
fully support the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(UNMIBH) in its efforts to create multi-ethnic police services in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In a new report on the UNMIBH, Annan also emphasized that the
strong and consistent support of the NATO Stabilization Force
(SFOR) will continue to be critically important in providing
adequate security arrangements for the successful implementation
of the UNMIBH's mandate.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general described the progress in police
restructuring in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but
added that in Republika Srpska, "there has been less progress."
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that the UNMIBH's mandate of police restructuring
had grown to include independent investigation into human rights
abuses by the local police and the identification of impediments
to achieving a depoliticized judiciary capable of delivering
impartial and neutral justice.
</P>
<P>
"The quick recruitment of highly qualified legal experts for
the Judicial System Assessment Program was a positive development
worth noting," the U.N. chief added.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Calls for Balance Development in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Burundi Tuesday called
for balance development across the world in the process of
globalization, and more official development assistance to boost
the growth of African fragile economies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to general debate of the 53rd General Assembly
session, which entered the second day Tuesday, President Pierre
Buyoya of Burundi said, "At this time of globalization, sustained
efforts must be made by the international community to promote
balance development in all parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
Most of African countries, together with other underdeveloped
nations, are being marginalized by the process of globalization,
which took shape on the basis of the development of regional
trade, the flow of information and technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
"Africa deserves special attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If development through trade is being activated, then the
official development assistance must be increased in order to
encourage the growth of our economies which are still fragile," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is being crushed under the weight of debt, it must be
eased and done away with the poor countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the sanctions imposed on his country in July 1996, the
president said, "In fact, the impact of embargo on the people of
Burundi is devastating." For example, school attendance has
dropped from 70 percent to 43 percent in the east African country
following the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, a land-locked country, is suffering from the
sanctions, and "the situation of Burundi is no worse than any
other country in the Great Lakes region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Burundi "needs international solidarity, and
humanitarian assistance must be increased to help our people
affected by the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions are the main obstacles on the way towards lasting
peace in Burundi, the president said, while calling for
international cooperation with his country without any further
delay.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Burundi is resolved to do its utmost to
ensure the success of the peace process" in the country, he said,
adding that his government is advocating solution of the crisis
through political dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Indian Prime Minister Leaves for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee left here Tuesday evening for New York to attend
the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
During his stay there, Vajpayee is scheduled to meet his
Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif Wednesday for talks on the
disputes between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee will deliver a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said India is likely to come under intense
pressure from the world body during its current session over its
nuclear tests conducted in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The world community has strongly condemned the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan, and urged them to stop nuclear weapons
development programs and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT). The United States, which has imposed economic sanctions
against India and Pakistan following their nuclear tests,
initiated negotiations on the CTBT with the two countries in June,
yet there has been no tangible result yet.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said last Wednesday that India was not prepared to
sign the CTBT in its present form, saying his government was
seeking a different arrangement, especially with regard to
transfer of high technology and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
At his scheduled lunch together with Sharif in New York on
Wednesday, Vajpayee will discuss modalities with him for
resumption of bilateral dialogue on all outstanding issues between
their two countries, including Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Small Parties, Big Roles in German Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Under Germany's proportional
representation voting system, a party needs to score at least five
percent of the votes in order to win any seats in the federal
parliament, a hurdle designed to promote political consensus and
prevent weak governments.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, all of the small German parties are
hovering at the dangerous point: the Greens at six or seven
points, the FDP at around five percent and the PDS at about four.
</P>
<P>
The FDP, the traditional kingmaker in German politics, has been
in every German government for nearly 30 years, first in alliance
with the SPD and then with Kohl's conservatives since 1982.
</P>
<P>
But the party known for its pro-free-market policies has seen
its public support dip sharply in the past decade and has been
kept out 12 of the country's 16 state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, however, say that he will only rule with the FDP, no
other small parties.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, founded in 1980 and replaced the FDP as the third
strongest party in Germany in 1994, are hoping to come to power
this time in alliance with the SPD.
</P>
<P>
But they have also lost support heavily since earlier this year
after making a series of radical demands, including a call to
triple gasoline prices over a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that a possible SPD-Greens coalition would
largely depend on the fate of the PDS.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing party, which is supported mainly by East Germans,
got 30 seats in the German parliament in the 1994 vote by winning
three voting districts outright, an alternative condition to get
into parliament if a party falls short of the five-percent hurdle.
</P>
<P>
The PDS has said it wants to enter the federal parliament again
by winning four direct mandates this time.
</P>
<P>
If it failed, the SPD and the Greens might be able to muster
the majority to govern. But if the party made it, a SPD-Greens
government would have to count on the support from the PDS, a
possibility that has been ruled out by Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, it has been widely speculated
the two largest parties, the CDU and the SPD, might be forced to
form a so-called "grand coalition" between themselves, something
Germany has not seen since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show such a "grand coalition" is increasingly
popular with the German voters who want some political change
after 16 years of Kohl but meanwhile fear too much risks.
</P>
<P>
The SPD candidate Schroeder has not ruled out leading such a
grand coalition government but Kohl has said he does want to do
that.
</P>
<P>
In such an event, Kohl has noted that he would rather step down
and make the way for his anointed successor and CDU parliamentary
leader Wolfgang Schaeuble. More

<HEADLINE> Polls: Clinton Job Approval Holds Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Opinion polls conducted
after U.S. television showed President Bill Clinton's grand jury
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal showed Tuesday that
the airing was less damaging than his critics had predicted.
</P>
<P>
A Gallup poll conducted for CNN and USA Today showed that 66
percent of respondents still approved of the job Clinton is doing,
six points higher than the figure Sunday, the day before the
broadcast. The approval figure on the previous Sunday was 64
percent.
</P>
<P>
The same percentage rejected impeachment, but 39 percent
thought Clinton should resign, the poll showed. USA Today said 81
percent of respondents believed Clinton definitely or probably
lied under oath to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
In an NBC News poll, only 28 percent of respondents believed
the president was telling the truth but 57 percent did not believe
the president should resign.
</P>
<P>
An ABC News poll showed that 70 percent believed Clinton was
right to refuse to talk about the sexual details of his
relationship with Lewinsky and 59 percent thought prosecutors were
wrong to ask detailed, probing, explicit questions.
</P>
<P>
The ABC poll showed Clinton's job approval holding steady at
around 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Small Parties, Big Roles in German Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- With opinion polls show that
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party is closing the gap with the
rival Social Democrats (SPD), the small German parties have become
critical in deciding the outcome of the country's upcoming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
With the national vote just five days away, German polls put
the support rates for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
party and the main opposition SPD both at about 40 percentage
points, with the CDU trailing the latter by only two to three
points, far less than the 12 points registered in April this year.
</P>
<P>
It was the closest election race in Germany's post-war era,
German pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 68, has been leading a center-right ruling coalition --
consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union (CSU), and the junior coalition partner, the Free
Democratic Party (FDP) -- uninterruptedly since 1982.
</P>
<P>
He is already the longest-serving German chancellor since 1945
and Europe's most durable statesman.
</P>
<P>
Pinning his hope on a large number of undecided voters, Kohl
has stressed that he has good chance to make it again this time.
</P>
<P>
A serious challenge, however, comes from Gerhard Schroeder, the
54-year-old SPD chancellor candidate and a political fresh face,
who many analysts say represents a broad public desire for change
after 16 years of rule by Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Riding on a public outcry about the near-record high
unemployment and a reform standstill in Germany, Schroeder, who
pledges to adopt policies to combine modernity with social justice
in Germany, is leading Kohl all the way since last year in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, as the election draws near, it seems more likely that
neither Kohl nor Schroeder would win absolute majority in order to
govern alone, thus making it necessary for a ruling coalition with
the smaller parties as was the case in most of Germany's post-war
history.
</P>
<P>
The future lineup of the German government will hinge on
whether the smaller parties, such as the ecologist Greens, the
pro-business FDP, and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)
which grew out of the former East German Communist Party, would
get into parliament, German commentators said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sees No Real Change in U.S. Attitude Towards Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that there was no real changes in
the behavior or attitude of the United States towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that despite U.S. President Bill Clinton's more
respectful tone towards Islam, Iran had not seen real changes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference with Western reporters, Khatami
listed a series of negative actions by the United States,
including economic sanctions and efforts to prevent oil and gas
pipelines crossing Iran.
</P>
<P>
"These examples and others show that in behavior and in
attitude there has been no real changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president renewed his call for dialogue between the Iranian
and American people, including scholars, cultural figures and
leaders of civil society, to remove misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that political government-to-government
relations depended on actions, not just words.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also called for a change in U.S. policy to press Israel
into giving more territory and rights to Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Not to Suspend Loans to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank said here
Monday it would not suspend its loans to Albania in the wake of
recent violent turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
Karlos Elbirt, head of the World Bank's office in Tirana, said
his office is fully operational as the bank continues its funding
for various projects in this Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
Elbirt hoped that the 27 ongoing projects, with a total of 350
million U.S. dollars pledged by the Washington-based official
bank, would be accomplished as initially scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 200 million dollars have been executed to finance
projects in the transportation, road construction, education,
electricity, environmental protection and agriculture sectors.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were to address the fear that the international
financial institution might suspend its loans in light of the tiny
country's political turbulence starting about 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations and subsequent riots were triggered by the
September 10 murder of Azem Hajdari, a leading opposition deputy
at the parliament and a co-founder of the Democratic Party.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed and three others wounded in south Lebanon Tuesday by a
Lebanese guerrillas' roadside bomb, the official National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb exploded when a patrol of Israeli
soldiers passed by the village of Dir Sarayan on the edge of the
Israeli occupied security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying one of its guerrilla units
detonated the bomb.
</P>
<P>
But, Israeli army said in a statement that the soldiers were
killed and wounded when the tank they were riding turned over at
the village, calling it an "accident."
</P>
<P>
The agency said following the incident that Israeli helicopters
arrived at the site and took the casualties to the Israeli
territory.
</P>
<P>
The fresh attack has brought to 14 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been engaged in a war of attrition trying to oust
Israeli troops and their proxy militia South Lebanon Army out of
the country.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Parties Slam Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South African
opposition parties, except for the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP),
were sharply critical of the government's military intervention
in the neighboring Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Speaking immediately after Acting President Mangosuthu
Buthelezi had briefed the parliament on the issue, the National
Party foreign affairs spokesman Boy Geldenhuys said on Tuesday
South Africa's intervention was short-sighted.
</P>
<P>
It had serious implications for South Africa's future
relations with the mountain kingdom, he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Party expressed sympathy to South African
soliders injured and condolences to the families of those killed.
</P>
<P>
At least five South African soliders were killed and more than
10 others wounded when some 600 South African peacekeeping troops
crossed into Lesotho Tuesday morning to help restore stability in
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
"We also wish to convey our apology to the people of Lesotho,"
Geldenhuys said.
</P>
<P>
The National Party urged the South African government to
immediately pull out its forces and to facilitate a new general
election in Lesotho under international supervision.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen expressed
dissatisfaction with the fact that Buthelezi had read out a
letter from the Lesotho government dated September 16 asking for
aid, but South African parties were only being informed of
this after the event.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen, a former South African defense force chief, said the
Lesotho Defense Force should take over in that country and the
South African troops be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
He also questioned the constitutionality of South Africa's
intervention, saying he did not think a request to the Southern
African Development Community could be regarded as enough of an
international obligation.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said South Africa's
intervention had made a political resolution of Lesotho's
problems more difficult, with opposition parties there saying the
chances of a breakthrough in peace talks was now less possible.
</P>
<P>
However, the IFP, the largest black opposition party in South
Africa, insisted that South Africa's intervention was a right
choice.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Mangasuthu Buthelezi, top leader of the IFP,
said that South Africa's intervention was aimed at restoring law
and order and to support the legitimate government.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Sends Letter to U.N. Chief on Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has brought the issue
of recent destruction of cultural and religious heritage in
Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus to the attention of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. chief, published here Tuesday, Cyprus'
permanent representative to the U.N. Sotos Zakheos noted that the
Church of Saint Theodoros in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
village of Lapithos was vandalized after being abandoned and
desecrated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Shrine of Saint Kourmoutas in Lapithos has
been profaned and defiled.
</P>
<P>
"The documented large-scale destruction of over 500 churches,
which continues unabated, is an effort to turkify the occupied
areas," Zakheos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was done "in violation of the 1954
Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event
of Armed Conflict and the Declaration of the Principles of
International Cultural Cooperation, adopted by the General
Conference of the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific
and cultural Organization) in 1966."
</P>
<P>
Zakheos said that despite the zealous protection of places of
worship belonging to all faiths by the Cypriot government, Turkey
"has been resolute in its policy of religious intolerance in the
occupied areas and refuses to adhere to international law and the
relevant U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the other gross violations against religious,
cultural and historical monuments, reported to you in previous
correspondence, Turkey, as the occupying power for more than 24
years, is entirely accountable and fully answerable for these new
illegal and wanton acts of vandalism," the Cypriot diplomat
said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> 35 Percent of Zambians Die Before 40: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) said in a report Tuesday about 35
percent of Zambia's population die before 40 years of age due to
poverty, according to Zambia News Agency (ZANA).
</P>
<P>
In its report released here, the UNDP also said that by 1999,
35.1 percent of the total Zambian population were expected to be
wiped out before age 40 as most citizens lived below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
The Development Cooperation Report for Zambia which was handed
over to Finance and Economic Development Minister, Edith Nawakwi,
further added that as a result of this, poverty was the most
worrisome problem in Zambia today.
</P>
<P>
More than two thirds of the 9.5 million Zambians are said to
be living below the poverty line and the per capita income in the
country continued to drop with a fall of 1.1 percent registered
in 1996, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Besides poverty, the report also attributed the short life
expectancy to poor access to safe water in the country, with 73
percent of the population having no access at all.
</P>
<P>
However, it said due to these grim observations, the Zambian
government had set several objectives for national development
with reduction of poverty being one of the issues on the top of
its agenda.

<HEADLINE> Efforts on Cyprus to Continue: U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Presidential
Emissary for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke has stated that he will
continue his efforts to push for a bizonal, bicommunal federation
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke voiced his resolution after a meeting Tuesday in New
York with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, who is attending the
53rd U.N. General Assembly there, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that he will continue to serve as the U.S.
envoy for Cyprus pending the confirmation process for his
nomination as U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was nominated earlier this year as the U.S. permanent
representative to the U.N. to replace Ambassador Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke noted that he will "gradually phase out of the direct
full-time responsibility (in Cyprus), but will remain very actively
involved."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway republic
in northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island
through a bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
But the peace talks have been deadlocked since a year ago when
Turkish Cypriots opted out of the negotiations to protest against
a decision by the European Union (EU) to start accession talks
with Cyprus, not their close ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has recently proposed to
establish a Cyprus confederation of two equal states as a basis
for resuming peace talks, but this has been rejected by the
Cypriot government dominated by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke reiterated that "we support a bizonal, bicommunal
federation and there has been no change whatsoever in our
position."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke also said he will meet Clerides again later this week
and is expected to hold talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem and Denktash who is due in New York next week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government spokesman Christos Stylianides has described
the Clerides-Holbrooke meeting as "very useful" toward a solution to
the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho FM Defends Foreign Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Foreign
Minister Tom Thabane Tuesday defended the presence of South
African and Botswana troops in his country, saying they were
forced to fight a war.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't come to fight a war, but rather (to) stabilize
the situation so that we could sit down and talk," South African
Press Association (SAPA) quoted Thabane as saying in an interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-government elements were not interested in
peace, but wanted war, Thabane said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
forces in Lesotho had to intensify their actions, while their
political masters had to do away with basic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
Thabane acknowledged that SADC and the Lesotho government
misjudged the response from anti-government protesters, including
troops loyal to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"We did not foresee it. We knew a lot of people were opposed,
but we did think there would be peaceful overtures."
</P>
<P>
Thabane said opposition supporters systematically destroyed
the homes of Lesotho ministers in Maseru and the private
residence of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili in neighboring
Roma.
</P>
<P>
Thabane's own home was also among those targeted by
anti-government protesters.
</P>
<P>
"They hit it with a bazooka. There was a hole and then they
firebombed it. Nothing was saved. I'm very angry. I've lost
everything, all my papers."
</P>
<P>
The residences of the ministers of finance and education and
Mosisili's house in Roma were also razed, Thabane said.
</P>
<P>
After his house was attacked, Thabane rejected proposed talks
with opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not sure he was prepared to talk to people who
burned his home. "How can we have talks when you burn my house?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said the burning of government homes was criminal, not
political.
</P>
<P>
South African forces TucIe*\
=U9QInexpected strong
resistance from Lesotho soldiers and civilians. So far five South
African soldiers have lost their lives in fighting.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 South African National Defense Force personnel
crossed the border early Tuesday morning to try to restore order
in the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The mission was part of a SADC operation which also involved
about 200 Botswana troops.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho was plunged into anarchy by opposition party
supporters who stopped civil servants from going to work and
hijacked government vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The seven-week-old crisis in Lesotho resulted from the
opposition's dissatisfaction with the outcome of the May 23
general election.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties believed that the election was rigged in
favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy which won 79
of 80 seats in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Fair South-North Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana Tuesday called
for fair relations between developing countries and developed
nations because no nation "can play outside the rules" and no
country "can stand alone."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Ghana's President J. Rawlings was
addressing the 53rd session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The present approach of certain industrialized countries which
require of developing countries standards or policies which they
themselves do not observe, or seem unable to, will severely test
the state of relations between the developed and developing world
in the next century," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We must stand together if we are not to jeopardize the
prosperity enjoyed by the hundreds of millions today and the hopes
of billions more for a life of dignity and comfort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Policy makers and opinion leaders in the developed countries
bear great responsibility in this regard in providing clear
leadership, for those countries share a great part of the blame
for the present state of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even though it had been clear for some time now that
sustainable development across the globe could not be achieved
without a measure of fairness in the economic relations between
the north and the south, because of short term considerations of
profit and advantage the countries benefitting from the unjust
economic order chose to ignore the serious impact of that
situation on living standards in most parts of the world as well
as in limiting world economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
On African economy, the president said, "the persistent
critical economic situation in African should be of great concern
to the international community and should urge us all to take
effective and urgent measures to address its underlying causes."
</P>
<P>
Many African countries, particularly the poorer ones, "continue
to suffer from a heavy burden and crippling debt servicing
obligations which, by diverting resources away from development,
prevent us from providing adequate social services to our
populations in basic areas such as education and health, and
reduce our capacity to compete in the global market," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, we stress the need for debt relief measures to
be accompanied by concessional financial assistance, particularly
to the least developed countries, with the aim of enhancing the
implementation of economic reforms, and creating a stable
environment that enables countries to extricate themselves from
the debt overhang," he added.

NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi opened their talks here
Tuesday to seek ways to deal with the worsening economic and
financial situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the U.S. and Japanese leaders were
meeting at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York city where
Clinton has been staying on a three-day trip to the largest U.S.
city.
</P>
<P>
But earlier press reports said that the long-scheduled
U.S.-Japan summit would be held at the Rockfeller family estate in
Tarrytown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been pressing Japan to take quick action
to pull itself out of recession. Washington believes that Japan is
the key to helping Asia countries out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The actions the U.S. is looking for from Japan include speedy
bank reform, tax cuts and greater public spending.
</P>
<P>
But Obuchi said in the general debate of the 53rd session of
the U.N. General Assembly Monday that his country has already

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Send 2,000 Eritreans Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 of those
Eritrean family members who stayed behind in Ethiopia are now
ready to join their family members in Eritrea, according to a
government statement issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of claims to the contrary by the Eritrean
government, the Ethiopian government was not seeking to divide
families but was allowing them time to dispose of their property
and arrange their affairs." the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Ethiopia has asked the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to monitor this process of family
reunion in its entirety," it said, adding that "the ICRC has
preferred to limit its involvement, for logistical reasons, to
the start of travel in Ethiopia and to arrival at the Eritrean
border."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Ethiopia takes this opportunity to
reiterate its call upon the international community, including
the United Nations, to ensure that Ethiopians in Eritrea -- most
particularly in Assab -- are assisted to escape from the tragic
conditions they are being forced to face," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea says up to 17,000 of its nationals have been expelled
from Ethiopia since the border dispute between the two countries
erupted in May, this year. But Ethiopia says those deported for
security reasons were only around 4,000.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran has condemned the
Tuesday assassination of a Tajik opposition leader Otahon Latifi
in Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that agents responsible for
such measures are enemies of peace and stability in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tajik parties concerned should prevent activities
of the enemies of calm and peace in Tajikistan through their
wisdom, vigilance and timely implementation of mutual agreements.
</P>
<P>
Latifi, 63, former premier, was gunned down outside his home in
downtown Dushanbe Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Tajikistan last year following the signing of an
accord between the government and the mainly Muslim opposition to
end a five-year-old civil war. Since then, he has been in charge
of legal affairs under the National Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
He had been attacked twice in the past few months by unknown
assailants.

<HEADLINE> Iran Favors Diplomatic Solution to Dispute With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (xinhua) -- Iran was trying to
prevent a war between Iran and Afghanistan, and Iran welcomed U.N.
moves to promote a diplomatic settlement, Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference with Western reporters, Khatami,
who is here to attend the 53rd session of the General Assembly,
said "Iran is ready to defend its security and territorial
integrity, but it is trying to make all efforts so that there will
not be a war."
</P>
<P>
The president said the eight-power meeting at the United
Nations Monday had taken acceptable steps to remove the problem in
a diplomatic way.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "We have deep concern about the Taliban, so no
matter how much diplomatic effort there is, it will not be in
proportion to the concern we have."
</P>
<P>
The most immediate concern was to prevent a massacre of
defenseless people living in the regions captured by the Taliban,
Khatami noted.
</P>
<P>
The eight-power meeting, initiated by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, urged the Taliban and other parties in Afghanistan to
declare an immediate cease-fire and undertake negotiations to
achieve a political settlement culminating in the establishment of
a broad-based, multi-ethnic, representative government in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also called for an international investigation into
the killing of Iranian diplomats and United Nations staff in
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov Tuesday called for joint efforts to overcome
the current upheaval in the world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd General Assembly session, the Russian
foreign minister said, "The current upheaval in the world
financial markets can be overcome only by joint efforts that do
not pursue unilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global
economic stability."
</P>
<P>
"Interaction of states in this process, including within the
framework of the United Nations, should be elevated to a
fundamentally new level," he said, adding that this is important
because the world monetary and financial crisis "has hit hard many
countries."
</P>
<P>
Russia, whose economy is going through a process of sweeping
reforms, is making vigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and
financial situation. "This is not an easy task but the solution
will be found," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not deviate from the path of reforms and will do
its best to pass with dignity this highly critical test so as not
only to preserve the accumulated democratic gains but also to
score new ones," the Russian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian foreign policy, the minister said, "Russia's
foreign policy will continue to be as consistent and constructive
as it has been before."
</P>
<P>
"It is firmly geared to building a democratic multipolar world,
ensuring interaction with other states in the interests of
settling international problems by political means and developing
broad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas," he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Small Parties, Big Roles in German Election  (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- With opinion polls show that
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party is closing the gap with the
rival Social Democrats (SPD), the small German parties have become
critical in deciding the outcome of the country's upcoming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
With the national vote just five days away, German polls put
the support rates for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
party and the main opposition SPD both at about 40 percentage
points, with the CDU trailing the latter by only two to three
points, far less than the 12 points registered in April this year.
</P>
<P>
It was the closest election race in Germany's post-war era,
German pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 68, has been leading a center-right ruling coalition --
consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union (CSU), and the junior coalition partner, the Free
Democratic Party (FDP) -- uninterruptedly since 1982.
</P>
<P>
He is already the longest-serving German chancellor since 1945
and Europe's most durable statesman.
</P>
<P>
Pinning his hope on a large number of undecided voters, Kohl
has stressed that he has good chance to make it again this time.
</P>
<P>
A serious challenge, however, comes from Gerhard Schroeder, the
54-year-old SPD chancellor candidate and a political fresh face,
who many analysts say represents a broad public desire for change
after 16 years of rule by Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Riding on a public outcry about the near-record high
unemployment and a reform standstill in Germany, Schroeder, who
pledges to adopt policies to combine modernity with social justice
in Germany, is leading Kohl all the way since last year in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, as the election draws near, it seems more likely that
neither Kohl nor Schroeder would win absolute majority in order to
govern alone, thus making it necessary for a ruling coalition with
the smaller parties as was the case in most of Germany's post-war
history.
</P>
<P>
The future lineup of the German government will hinge on
whether the smaller parties, such as the ecologist Greens, the
pro-business FDP, and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)
which grew out of the former East German Communist Party, would
get into parliament, German commentators said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Small Parties, Big Roles in German Election  (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under Germany's proportional representation voting system, a
party needs to score at least five percent of the votes in order
to win any seats in the federal parliament, a hurdle designed to
promote political consensus and prevent weak governments.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, all of the small German parties are
hovering at the dangerous point: the Greens at six or seven
points, the FDP at around five percent and the PDS at about four.
</P>
<P>
The FDP, the traditional kingmaker in German politics, has been
in every German government for nearly 30 years, first in alliance
with the SPD and then with Kohl's conservatives since 1982.
</P>
<P>
But the party known for its pro-free-market policies has seen
its public support dip sharply in the past decade and has been
kept out 12 of the country's 16 state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, however, say that he will only rule with the FDP, no
other small parties.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, founded in 1980 and replaced the FDP as the third
strongest party in Germany in 1994, are hoping to come to power
this time in alliance with the SPD.
</P>
<P>
But they have also lost support heavily since earlier this year
after making a series of radical demands, including a call to
triple gasoline prices over a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that a possible SPD-Greens coalition would
largely depend on the fate of the PDS.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing party, which is supported mainly by East Germans,
got 30 seats in the German parliament in the 1994 vote by winning
three voting districts outright, an alternative condition to get
into parliament if a party falls short of the five-percent hurdle.
</P>
<P>
The PDS has said it wants to enter the federal parliament again
by winning four direct mandates this time.
</P>
<P>
If it failed, the SPD and the Greens might be able to muster
the majority to govern. But if the party made it, a SPD-Greens
government would have to count on the support from the PDS, a
possibility that has been ruled out by Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, it has been widely speculated
the two largest parties, the CDU and the SPD, might be forced to
form a so-called "grand coalition" between themselves, something
Germany has not seen since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show such a "grand coalition" is increasingly
popular with the German voters who want some political change
after 16 years of Kohl but meanwhile fear too much risks.
</P>
<P>
The SPD candidate Schroeder has not ruled out leading such a
grand coalition government but Kohl has said he does want to do
that.
</P>
<P>
In such an event, Kohl has noted that he would rather step down
and make the way for his anointed successor and CDU parliamentary
leader Wolfgang Schaeuble.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China said Tuesday
that developing countries need to increase their capacity to
participate effectively in the formulation of new "rules of game"
in multilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
This is a way to safeguard their legitimate interests, said
Shen Guofang, Chinese deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second session of the Council of Representatives
of the South Center, Ambassador Shen said that for many developing
countries, the external economic environment continues to worsen.
</P>
<P>
The prices for primary commodities are in a downward spiral,
causing serious damage on exporting developing nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are turning more and more to trade
protectionism, while environmental and labor standards are
becoming new non-tariff barriers targeted at the products from
developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Developed nations, with their dominance of world economy, are
promoting selective new areas of trade liberalization, and are
pressuring developing countries to shoulder responsibilities
beyond their levels of development, thus putting new restraints to
their development efforts, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the South Center for its function of promoting
South-South cooperation and South-North dialogue, Shen called on
the center to continue to serve as a think-tank for developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
The South Center, headquartered in Geneva, is an
inter-governmental body set up in 1995, with 46 countries as its
members.
</P>
<P>
Its main objectives include experience exchange between member
states and the provision of information, research on the current
international issues and policy recommendations to member states.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Says His Talks With Clinton "Very Candid" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi Tuesday held what he called "very candid" talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton about his country's efforts to carry
out economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, both in New York for the opening of the 53rd
session of the U.N. General Assembly, met privately for about one
hour at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
They had been scheduled to meet at the Rockefeller family
estate north of the city, but bad weather forced them to cancel
the trip.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the one-to-one discussions with
Clinton, Obuchi said that he and the U.S. president reviewed the
current global crisis and Japan's efforts to deal with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"We talked in a very candid manner," Obuchi told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he understood that the government of the new
Japanese prime minister can only do what is "politically possible"
to deal with the worst economic problems in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were followed by broader discussions among
officials from both countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the U.S. and Japanese leaders is widely believed
to be very important to easing Asia's crisis and stabilizing world
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, senior U.S. economic and financial officials
have been urging Japan to be more aggressive in carrying out
economic reforms, particularly in financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Washington says that the earlier recovery of the troubled
Japanese economy is essential to helping other Asian nations out
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the one-to-one discussions, Clinton invited Obuchi to
come back for a formal state visit some time next year.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi succeeded Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto this summer.
Hashimoto was forced to resign because of growing unhappiness over
his handling of the economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique: Military Intervention in Lesotho Is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The military intervention in
the chaos in Lesotho is a decision made by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to restore peace in the country, the
Mozambican government said in a communique issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The military operation, at the invitation of the Lesotho
government, is aimed at creating an environment for peace talks
so as to find a solution acceptable to all parties, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that peace, security and stability are the
fundamental conditions for development and regional economic
integrity in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration and conflicts between people backed by the
opposition parties and the Lesotho defense forces have rendered
casualties in the country, disturbed the normal operation of the
government, and paralyzed the economy of the country, the
communique noted.
</P>
<P>
The military intervention in Lesotho by South Africa and
Botswana, both SADC members, started earlier Tuesday morning,
with reportedly five South African soldiers having been killed
and more than 10 wounded in fighting with troops loyal to the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Situation started to deteriorate in Lesotho in May this year,
after the opposition accused the government of rigging the May 23
general elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government said
Tuesday that European Union (EU) sanctions against Nigeria were
likely to be eased soon as the African country was undergoing
various reforms.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair held talks in London with
visiting Nigerian leader General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who is
trying to improve his country's relations with Western countries.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman was quoted by Reuters as saying
early Tuesday that Blair was "confident that all measures except
the arms embargo could be lifted soon."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria, including an arms
embargo and a visa ban on the country, in 1995 after former
Nigerian leader Sani Abacha ordered the execution of writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa and his eight fellow Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Blair was also working for "positive
steps" within the Commonwealth, from which Nigeria was suspended
in 1995 following the alleged human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
Blair also expressed the hope that his government would be able
to work with Nigerian leaders in bringing Nigeria back into the
international community, the spokesman said.

MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin Tuesday signed a decree appointing former Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov to the post of deputy chairman for the
Local Self-Government Council, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The council's chairman is the president himself, the
presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
The council's function is to work with mayors of cities and
towns. Nemtsov will have to maintain regular contacts not only
with mayors of cities whose population exceeds a million, but also
with mayors of smaller cities whose opinions do not necessarily
reach the federal bodies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov was chosen because he has experience in working in both
regional and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin will pay increasing attention to local and regional
problems, especially to the expertise of local leaders and
managers in resolving economic problems and tackling the crisis,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov was relieved of his duty of the first deputy prime
minister when Yeltsin fired the government headed by Sergei
Kiriyenko on August 23. After that, he submitted his resignation
of position as acting first prime minister.

MAPUTO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- About 300,000 people out of
Mozambique's total population of more than 16 million are facing
starvation till next April when the new harvest season comes,

Police Department said Tuesday that it will start a compulsory
inspection on vehicles across the country Friday in a bid to
reduce traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the department said that passenger
buses, lorries, pick-ups and other service automobiles will be
inspected and those which are not roadworthy are to be stopped
from operating.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection, a driver should come with his or her
automobile together with driving license, original registration
card of the automobile, uniform, identification badge, insurance
premium certificate and receipt, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Vehicles which will not be sent for inspection by October 25
will not be allowed to drive on road," it said.
</P>
<P>
Even with relatively fewer motor vehicles, Tanzanian drivers
caused 23 times more accidents than their British counterparts,
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government launched a road safety week from
September 14 to September 20, following reports that 5,098 people
were killed and 37,624 others were injured in more than 42,000
road accidents during the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho King Took Side in Conflict: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili said Tuesday that he was unable to consult
King Letsie III about a request for foreign military
intervention, because the king was part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mosisili as
saying in an interview that the king harbored anti-government
protesters in the grounds of his royal palace for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho king was purely ceremonial and was not allowed to
interfere in politics.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili denied claims that he acted unconstitutionally by
requesting military intervention from his Southern African
Development Community (SADC) allies.
</P>
<P>
"I used the Lesotho Defense Force ACT, which empowers me as
minister of defense to invite foreign forces."
</P>
<P>
There was nothing in his country's constitution saying that
the head of state should be the one to invite foreign troops to
restore order, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili asked twice in writing for urgent SADC military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi
said Tuesday that a virtual coup in Lesotho prompted South
Africa's military action.
</P>
<P>
He said information received by Monday night indicated that a
coup has occurred.
</P>
<P>
Mutineers were in charge of the military and they refused to
take orders form the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The general situation in Lesotho had become ungovernable with
the police paralyzed against lawlessness such as looting,
Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
About 600 South African soldiers were sent to Lesotho Tuesday
morning to try to restore order in Lesotho's capital Maseru. So
far five soldiers have been killed in fighting with Lesotho
civilians and soldiers loyal to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 Botswana troops were also dispatched, but arrived
only late Tuesday morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A convoy of more than 100
vehicles carrying foreign nationals, mostly Chinese, was waiting to
cross the Lesotho-South African border early Tuesday evening, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles, many heavily loaded with refugees, will be escorted
under military guard to nearby Ladybrand on the South African side,
where the foreigners will be given temporary asylum.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have been trapped at the border post, many since early
morning, because they were not in possession of visas allowing them
access to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Fighting began in Lesotho's capital Maseru Tuesday morning when
South African and Botswana troops moved in to try to restore order in
the strife-torn city.

NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here Tuesday that he was now concentrating on state affairs
instead of the impact of his sexual scandal.
</P>
<P>
"I think its important that I focus on what I'm doing for the
American people," he told reporters before his meeting with
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came one day after the videotape of his
August 17 grand jury testimony was broadcast nationwide. During
the four-hour broadcast on major U.S. TV networks, the president
was addressing the United Nations General Assembly on
anti-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
His three-day trip to New York started Sunday, with a busy
schedule of meeting with world leaders who came here to attend the
General Assembly debate kicked off Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not I haven't read the reports," Clinton said,
referring to news reports and comments on the release of the tape
recording -- what he told the grand jury about his encounters with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
He said he had nothing to add to whatever the White House had
said about the Lewinsky affair.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Implement Licensing System in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Angola has decided to
implement a licensing system in merchandise trading, the Angolan
News Agency Tuesday quoted sources from the ministry of planning
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the licensing system in import
and export is aimed at strengthening the state "control of the
currency and exchange rate."
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, any exchange of merchandise goods between
local residents and foreigners will be regarded as import or
export trading.
</P>
<P>
Such activities will be put under the regulation of the
licensing system. The icense for import or export will be
issued by the Trade Ministry and the ministry will also be
monitoring the legality of the ensuing trade.
</P>
<P>
No license will be needed for the import or export involving
only provisional trading or trading with small quantity,
according to the new rule.
</P>
<P>
Other activities enjoy the exemption of license include the
provision of goods and logistics services for foreign maritime or
air shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
The licenses are effective within 180 days after issuance and
their effectiveness could be extended to the longest of 360 days,
the new rule reads.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Angola will notify the Trade Ministry of
the ceiling of foreign exchange volume for the importers so that
the ministry can decide whether to grant the license or not.
</P>
<P>
With the new rule in effect, the liquidation in import, export
and transfer trade will be under the supervision of the state
loaning authorities to ensure that the trade involving foreign
exchange be conducted within the territory of Angola.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
expressed grave concern Tuesday about credible reports that more
countries are involved in the fighting in Congo.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Sudan and Chad have become involved
along with former Rwandan Army members and Hutu extremists, known
as Interhamwe, spokesman James Rubin said at a regular State
Department briefing.
</P>
<P>
These forces supplement those from Rwanda, Uganda, Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. calls for all foreign forces to withdraw from the
Congo, and urges countries and armed movements not currently
engaged in the conflict to "desist from intervening," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the United States especially deplores
reported efforts by the Congolese government to enlist support of
Rwandan fighters linked to the genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The involvement of these ethnically motivated killers would
have extremely serious consequences, including fomenting the
resurgence of genocide," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl: Grand Coalition With SPD Possible in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- As Germany's national election
set to be a close race, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
Wednesday it is possible in principle for the country's two
largest political parties to form a grand coalition government,
but he is still against such an idea.
</P>
<P>
"I naturally reckon a grand coalition possible in principle,"
Kohl said in an interview with the German ZDF television network.
He added that it was quite normal for democratic parties to be
able to form a coalition with each other.
</P>
<P>
However, Kohl stressed that he did not expect a grand coalition
between his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) after the September 27
elections.
</P>
<P>
"A strong government needs a strong opposition," Kohl said,
adding he did not believe that a government which holds 90 percent
majority in parliament would do a productive job.
</P>
<P>
Speculations about a possible grand coalition take the center
stage in the German media recently as many commentators predict
that neither the CDU nor the SPD would be able to muster a
majority in parliament even in alliance with their respective
partners, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's challenger, the SPD chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder, has never ruled out leading a grand coalition with the
CDU, but Kohl has said repeatedly that he wants no part of it.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who is running for a record fifth term in office,
reiterated Wednesday that he would not lead such a coalition and
also did not expect his CDU to join a SPD-led government as a
junior partner.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Moves Against Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Struggles in Nepal over the
Local Autonomy Bill heated up again Wednesday as the main
opposition sought to remove the Lower House speaker from office by
registering a motion against him.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-
UML), which blocked the house session by shouting slogans, alleged
that Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel could not discharge his duty in a
fair and impartial manner.
</P>
<P>
K. P. Oli, a key member of the CPN-UML, told the house session
Wednesday that the role played by the speaker in passing the bill
in the house last Thursday was against the parliamentary
democratic system, so his party was compelled to register the
motion.
</P>
<P>
When the opposition MPs, who had blocked the house session for
four days, were voicing their protest against the Local Autonomy
Bill, Speaker Poudel conducted voice voting on the bill and
declared that it had been passed by the house.
</P>
<P>
Then the MPs of the ruling and opposition parties manhandled
one another and caused seven MPs from the CPN-UML injured. In
addition, chairs and microphones valued at about 500,000 rupees
(about 7,460 U.S. dollars) were damaged in the manhandling.
</P>
<P>
The next day, the CPN-UML alleged that "the speaker created an
abnormal and violent situation in parliament and showed his
incompetence, arrogant and undemocratic attitude."
</P>
<P>
It charged that the speaker, who is from the ruling Nepali
Congress (NC), had failed to manage the crisis and rise above the
party politics when executing the house procedures.
</P>
<P>
The party, which sought but failed to add into the bill a
provision that automatically terminates one's post if a locally
elected official defects to another party, had announced that it
would not accept the bill.
</P>
<P>
It fears that with the passage of the bill, more of its local
workers may defect to the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which broke away from it in March this
year and joined the government late last month.
</P>
<P>
It takes one week for the motion to be mature before the house
can discuss it.
</P>
<P>
A two-third majority is needed in the house to force its
speaker out of power.
</P>
<P>
But the motion is sure to be defeated in the 205-seat house
where the NC and the CPN-ML enjoy a comfortable majority of at
least 128 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NC and the CPN-ML registered a similar motion
against Deputy Speaker Lila Shrestha Subba who is from the CPN-
UML.
</P>
<P>
Her fate is unpredictable as her party cannot muster a two-
third majority in the house to defeat the motion.

<HEADLINE> Iran's MPs Support Khamenei's Remarks against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of 180 deputies of the
270-seat Iranian Majlis on Wednesday issued an open letter
pledging their support for the recent remarks by supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against Western "cultural assaults."
</P>
<P>
The letter, read at the open session of the
conservative-dominated Majlis (Parliament), thanked the Islamic
revolutionary court, which closed down the popularly welcomed
moderate daily Tous and arrested its several staff members last
week, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Tous, named after an ancient Iranian city, was banned for
publishing articles against the national security and interests
on September 15, the same day when Khamenei called on the
country's officials to repel western cultural assaults in disguise
of press freedom to target people's faith.
</P>
<P>
"I keep waiting to see what the responsible bodies will do"
with the group of the press that started targeting the people's
faith, Khamenei told a group of commanders of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps.
</P>
<P>
Targeting people's faith is a flagrant attempt to damage
Islamic principles and those of the Islamic system, the letter of
the Majlis deputies said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that those who write against principles of Islam
should be confronted as those working against security of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance
with the cooperation of Information (Intelligence) Ministry to
identify all those in the press who have targeted faith of the
people to enable the judiciary to deal with them within the
Islamic penal code.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Guidance and Arts Commission of the Majlis
issued a statement on Wednesday, calling on journalists and
writers to abide by law and preserve values of the Islamic
society.
</P>
<P>
The commission called on the relevant authorities to adopt
necessary measures to prevent "destructive acts of certain
publications trying to poison the atmosphere of the Islamic
society."
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on officials to give proper
explanation of the duties of the mass media and a real definition
of social freedom in order to lead the society toward calmness
and tranquillity.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Non-Cooperation Intolerable: U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to
Kuwait James Larocco said Wednesday that Iraq's non-cooperation
with the United Nations will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) quoted Larocco as saying "the
non-cooperation of the Iraqi regime has been happening for quite a
long time. This is something we are vigilant about all the time."
</P>
<P>
This move will not be tolerated, "not now or in the future," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Larocco's words were made to reporters at the launching of a
U.S. marine training exercise, featuring landing, deployment in
the desert and live fire exercises near the Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 U.S. marines participated in the unilateral
war game, part of the U.S.-Kuwaiti defense cooperation agreement,
and will spend the next few weeks in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended its cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors on
August 5, which led to a U.N. decision to stop the regular review
of the economic sanctions, imposed on Iraq following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspections began in 1991 after the Gulf War, which
ended the seven-month Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, to ensure Iraq
eradicates all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Larocco said Iraq's suspension of cooperation with the U.N. "is
a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions and this is
something the U.N. must take up with the Iraqi regime."
</P>
<P>
In response to questions about contingency plans, the U.S.
ambassador said, "there are always contingency plans, the fact is
we are pursuing a diplomatic option at this time and we will
continue to do so, there are no options off the table."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Mourns PAL Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday mourned the loss of Philippine Airlines (PAL) hours
before its scheduled shutdown at midnight after 57 years of
service.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada told reporters that he had already
done all he could to save the airline from closing down.
</P>
<P>
"I have already exhausted all remedies to settle this dispute
between labor and management so if they do not agree by midnight,
everything is over. PAL is lost," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier press briefing, Estrada's spokesman Jerry Barican
said the government was saddened with the loss of Asia's first
airline.
</P>
<P>
Barican also said the government is no longer too hopeful that
last-minute talks between labor and management can save the
airline after PAL employees voted against an ownership-sharing
scheme Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senator John Osmena lambasted radical PAL union leaders for the
airline's impending closure, saying their stubbornness caused
great harm to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management last week decided to shut down the airline
after PAL unions rescinded an earlier agreement with the
management and refused to accept the co-ownership plan in exchange
for a 10-year suspension on collective bargaining agreements
(CBA).
</P>
<P>
PAL's management said that with no fresh capital infusion, the
airline could not operate viably in the face of enormous losses
amid the harsh business environment.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of CBA, which is expected to guarantee
industrial peace and harmony in PAL, is a key requirement for any
rehabilitation plan to revive the debt-ridden company.
</P>
<P>
Osmena cited a letter PAL union leaders had presented to
management, in which they laid down difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
Among the conditions were a yearly review of employees'
salaries, the maintenance of PAL's grievance mechanism, the
maintenance of benefits for employees and the maintenance of the
present work force.
</P>
<P>
Osmena said these conditions were "outrageous," noting that
normal collective bargaining agreements provide for a review of
salaries every three years.

<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam said Wednesday the Irish Republican
Army's arsenal would be scrapped and progress was being made in
implementing the province's peace deal on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I consider that progress is being made because it's no longer
a question of if decommissioning is going to take place -- it's a
question of when," Mowlam told reporters in Dublin after meeting
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also made clear that she believed the issue would
be solved in the end, just as a peace deal was eventually signed
in April after nearly two years of stop-start talks.
</P>
<P>
"As so often has happened in this process over the months, you
begin to look for momentum and make progress step by step. That is
what's happening," she said.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and first
minister in Northern Ireland's new assembly, met Ahern and Sinn
Fein president Gerry Adams Tuesday in Dublin to try to break a
deadlock over the right of the IRA's political wing to sit in a
new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very obvious difficulty at the moment," Trimble
said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has consistently stated in public that it does not plan
to hand in its weapons, but is expected to destroy at least some
of its arms in the end in return for the release of IRA prisoners
within two years.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Reject Clinton Censure Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of
the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday rejected talk of an
immediate deal with President Bill Clinton to avoid a possible
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House accused Gingrich of unnecessarily
dragging out the investigation into the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
"For anybody to talk about doing anything before we finish the
investigative process simply puts the cart before the horse,"
Gingrich, a Republican, told reporters following a meeting of
House Republican and Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said, "There's an awful lot of evidence that hasn't
been gathered yet. People need to allow the process to go forward
in an orderly manner and not assume that they know what the final
outcome will be either way."
</P>
<P>
At the White House, press secretary Mike McCurry said the idea
of a lesser punishment such as a congressional censure and a fine
is a "bipartisan idea" that better reflects public sentiment.
McCurry said Gingrich and his top lieutenants appear mainly
interested in delaying the matter for partisan political
advantage.
</P>
<P>
"It is some concern to the White House that people who are
genuinely motivated, who want to bring this matter to some
resolution, seem to be drowned out by those who want this matter
to drag on and on and on," McCurry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about polls showing Americans seem to agree, Gingrich
said, "I think people would be frankly horrified if the Congress
was simply a polling institution that enacted a grotesque version
of justice based on the latest poll or the latest talk show."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt called
on Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to turn over all material on
Clinton's potentially impeachable conduct that was held back in an
earlier report "for totally unexplained reasons."
</P>
<P>
Gephardt's letter was sent in advance of a meeting Wednesday in
which he, Gingrich and other leaders of the House and its
Judiciary Committee searched for ways to curb the nastiness that
has enveloped the impeachment review into Clinton's conduct with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"How can we decide on the fairness of the process without
determining what is in the interviews, grand jury testimony and
boxes of documents that for totally unexplained reasons the
independent counsel withheld?" Gephardt said in a letter asking
Gingrich to join him in the request.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt made the move a day after Clinton's attorneys
complained that Starr's report failed to include direct statements
from Lewinsky that no one asked her to lie about the affair or
promised her a job in exchange for her silence.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Showing Recovery Signs: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
showing positive signs of recovery, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is evident from the fact that the country's foreign
reserves have improved significantly since currency exchange
controls were implemented on September 1, 1998, Mahathir, who is
also First Finance Minister, said when addressing Chinese
community leaders at his office here.
</P>
<P>
"I think the signs of recovery are already there. In the first
three weeks' of this month, after currency exchange controls were
implemented, the country's reserves have gone up by 90 million
U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ringgit (local currency) has begun to flow back into the
financial system following the exchange controls which have also
stemmed the outflow of the ringgit abroad, he said. "Now the money
comes in and does not go out."
</P>
<P>
A lot of savings have gone into the country's reserves, as a
result of the new measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goods are exported and sold in U.S. dollars and that the
greenback earned is then used to buy goods, he said. "We are now
exporting more than we are importing as such we have lots of
savings that have gone into the country's foreign exchange
reserves."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia was more fortunate when compared with
its neighbors because the government did not borrow too much money
from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
"We were very strong economically. The government and the
business community in Malaysia did not have to borrow too much
money from abroad," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures to protect the ringgit from foreign
currency speculators were aimed at reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that to revive the economy, the property sector must be
first stimulated as this sector supports some 150 other connected
industries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy got a setback as a result of the regional
financial crisis which flared up in July last year. The country's
gross domestic product fell 2.8 percent in the first quarter of
this year and further down to 6.8 percent in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Sound Alarm to U.N. on Possible Iranian Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
have sounded warning to the U.N. on a possible Iranian attack amid
heightened tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a report Wednesday by Radio Shariat, Taliban
official responsible for foreign affairs Mullad Hassan Akhund has
conveyed the Taliban's concern about a possible Iranian invasion
in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The message asked the U.N. to take "effective measures in
defusing international tensions," the radio report said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities said on Tuesday that they would
cooperate to defuse tension after six Afghan neighbors along with
the U.S. and Russia reached understanding on the Afghan issue and
agreed to send Lakhdar Brahimi, a U.N. envoy, back to the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready as always to extend all possible cooperation to
the United Nations," the Afghan Islamic Press quoted Taliban
spokesman Abdul Hae Mutmaen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of religious scholars were meeting in the
Afghan capital of Kabul to advise the Taliban on how to handle the
Iranian threat, the radio report said.
</P>
<P>
The religious scholars denounced Iran's deployment of 200,000
troops along Afghanistan's western border and said it showed
Iran's intention to invade.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Warns Against Establishment of Interim Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian leader
Hun Sen warned the opposition Wednesday that any attempt to form a
provisional government could be met with force.
</P>
<P>
"I have warned in yesterday's all-party crisis talk that no one
has the right to dissolve the current government," he said,
"Otherwise, we will consider it as a military coup d'etat and use
military force to deal with the situation."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks to reporters at the hotel he was
staying after attending the all-party crisis talk Tuesday, which
was presided over by King Norodom Sihanouk. He was staying in
Siem Reap to attend the inauguration ceremony of the newly elected
parliament, which is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the formation of a new government is just a matter
of time and that the allocation of power is negotiable with the
principle of the CPP taking 60 percent of the government posts and
FUNCINPEC 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that he also told the opposition in talks Tuesday
not to oppose his candidacy as prime minister and said the current
government could rule for five more years if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"I warned in the meeting, don't dream about changing the
candidate of prime minister," he said, "The CPP had designated me
as the only candidate for prime minister. Now that the CPP wins,
I have every reason to take up the job in the new government.
This cannot be changed."
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out any possibility of forming a coalition
government with the Sam Rainsy Party, saying that it has totally
different political position with the CPP.

MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday expressed
regret over the decision of the Finnish authorities to expel two

Finland officially confirmed on Wednesday that the two Russian
diplomats had already left Helsinki, one of them about six months

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Eyes Manageable Disruption From PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
hopes to keep the economic losses caused by the impending closure
of Philippine Airlines (PAL) as manageable as possible, the
Presidential News Desk said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We think we can keep the disruption to the economy to at least
a level we can manage," Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the government expects that the economic harm to
be caused by the airline's closure, which is scheduled for
midnight Wednesday, will be limited.
</P>
<P>
He said other domestic airlines had been given 25 days to take
over PAL's domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the damage would only be similar to that caused by
an earlier strike by the PAL Employees Association (PALEA) which
lasted 22 days.
</P>
<P>
Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said the extent of
the losses would depend on how quickly other airlines can expand
their services.
</P>
<P>
Economists here have warned that the shutdown of PAL, the
country's only major airline, is expected to do much harm to the
economy since other domestic airlines are small and aviation is
vital for the archipelago country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said PAL's closure may hike
interest rates on non-performing loans by 0.5 to 0.7 percent, but
added that this was still a safe margin.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also said the government plans to collect its
investments from PAL once the airline files an application for
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will appoint
independent members (of an interim receivership committee) once
PAL closes," he said.
</P>
<P>
PAL's management announced last week that PAL will close down
at the midnight of Wednesday after the unions refused to accept an
ownership-sharing scheme for a 10-year suspension on their
collective bargaining agreement (CBA).
</P>
<P>
The management said the loss-making airline could not continue
its operations due to its devastating financial situation
aggravated by the currency crisis and a series of strikes by its
employees.

<HEADLINE> EU Annuls Frauded Recruitment Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
annulled on Wednesday its recruitment examination that had been
alleged to be rife with frauds.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, made the decision after reviewing a report by European
Personnel Administration Commissioner Erkki Liikanen.
</P>
<P>
Liikanen said in his report that annulment had to be initiated
after sufficient evidence had so far been amassed to prove that
there had been wrongdoings prior to and during the examination
that took place on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The commission organized its recruitment examination in 38
testing centers scattered in the 15 EU member states. A total of
31,000 applicants sat in the examination that was designed to
serve as a pre-selection process.
</P>
<P>
But after the examination, the commission received, especially
from Rome and Brussels, complaints that some examination takers
had resorted to illegal means to get an upper-hand edge.
</P>
<P>
The means complained about included the use of mobile
telephones and pre-examination tips and leaks from examination
organizers.
</P>
<P>
Liikanen suggested to the commission that the results of the
recruitment examination be scrapped and a new recruitment
examination be organized for the candidates as soon as the
investigation into the fraud is complete.
</P>
<P>
The recruitment examination, aimed at recruiting some 2,000
commission staff workers, cost the commission 1.2 million ECUs
(1.32 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Prepares for PAL Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
started implementing emergency measures to minimize the economic
disruption to be caused by the closure of Philippine Airlines
(PAL) at midnight on Wednesday, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the government has received commitments from at
least four local airlines to immediately expand their operations
so they can ply the domestic routes which PAL will abandon
starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said Air Philippines, Cebu Pacific, Asian Spirit and
GrandAir have pledged to upgrade their capacity from 230,000 to
510,000 passengers within the next 25 to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said Air Philippines also pledged to obtain two
foreign McDonnell-Douglas aircraft, complete with crew members,
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Senator John Osmena, who attended a meeting called by President
Joseph Estrada with congressional leaders in an effort to save
PAL, also disclosed that the Civil Aeronautic Board will allow
foreign airlines to ply domestic routes in emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to see to it that we are able to immediately
cover the vacuum that will be there over the next few days," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the government is also ready to speed up the
entry of other airlines that will fill in the void left by PAL,
particularly the domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican disclosed that the Labor
Department is supervising last-minute conciliation talks between
PAL's management and its workers.
</P>
<P>
PAL's management last week decided to cease operations at
midnight of Wednesday after PAL unions refused to accept a
co-ownership offer and push through a rebuilding plan to save the
debt-ridden airline.
</P>
<P>
Under the offer, the unions would get 20 percent of shares of
PAL in exchange for a 10-year suspension on their collective
bargaining agreement, with every employee receiving some 60,000
shares worth 300,000 pesos (6,967 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Experience Sharing With Mediterranean Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission --
the executive body of the 15-member European Union -- proposed on
Wednesday the sharing of the European Union's single market
experience with its Mediterranean partners.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed initiatives of experience sharing in
the fields of training, technical assistance, advice and
cooperation in relation to the internal market, customs and
taxation.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives will need discussion and approval by the
European Union and its Mediterranean partners.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that the proposal was designed to
facilitate the creation of a free trade area with the
Mediterranean by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Mediterranean partnership was formed by the Barcelona
Declaration in November 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The most important objectives of the EU-Mediterranean
partnership are economic and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, European single market commissioner, said that the
proposal was to provide the Mediterranean partners with a higher
degree of economic cooperation and concerted action with the aim
of building an area of shared prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission was ready to share the experience
it had acquired in setting up the internal market.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to demonstrate to the Mediterranean
partners the advantages of the creation of the EU internal market,
and advantages in terms of growth, competitiveness and job
creation by removing trade barriers.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Premier Encourages Clinton to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli prime
minister Shimon Peres has encouraged U.S. President Bill Clinton
not to quit from his presidency, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Clinton on Wednesday, Peres said "The
winner does not quit and quitters are not winners."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's sex scandal has caused a lot of worries in Israel,
which regards Clinton as its strong supporter no matter how the
situation in the Middle East changes.
</P>
<P>
Although the Israeli government takes a cautious stand towards
the Clinton issue, the majority of Israelis support Clinton to
continue to stay in the office, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Peres was the first Israeli influential figure expressing open
support to Clinton after Monday's videotaped broadcast of
Clinton's August 17 grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the videotape broadcasting, an opinion poll
conducted by the local media among 500 households on Monday
showed that 80 percent of them said the tape was nothing but an
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Local English paper the Jerusalem Post said in its Wednesday
editorial that "people throughout the world can not understand why
the U.S. is doing this to itself."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also expressed their worries about the sex
scandal, which they believe could affect Clinton's policy of
pushing the stalled Mideast peace process forward, even though the
U.S. did not pressure Israel very much in the recent past.

<HEADLINE> Planning Minister Says China's Economic Target Attainable (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China will be able to realize
its goal of eight percent economic growth this year if the
government's stimulation policies continue to be well implemented,
State Development Planning Minister Zeng Peiyan told a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the current economic situation in China is good and
the measures the government has taken to expand domestic demand
and stimulate the economy have already started to take effect," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng added that August marked a turning point for the Chinese
economy, as economic indicators showed an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the nation's fixed-asset investment growth
has picked up speed, rising 26.9 percent in August over the same
1997 period, 4 percentage points higher than that in July this
year. Consumer goods retail volume in August was up 13 percent,
1.3 percentage points more than in July. Industrial value-added
rose 7.9 percent from the same 1997 period, 0.3 percent higher
than in July.
</P>
<P>
Also, the consumer price index, a major inflation indicator,
rose 0.6 percent over July after a five-month decline, signaling
rebounding domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade sector registered a surplus of 31.3 billion
U.S. dollars during the first seven months of this year, with the
export turnover rising 5.5 percent year-on-year to 118.7 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment totaled 23.9 billion U.S. dollars,
almost the same as last year, but investment for newly signed
contracts rebounded by 7.3 percent to 28 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
The money supply also grew, as money in circulation (M0) and
narrow money (M1) increased by 8.6 percent and 10.9 percent
respectively over the first eight months of last year.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be easy for the economy to keep this good momentum
given the worsening Asian financial crisis, and the most severe
summer flooding since 1954," Zeng stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zeng attributed the good economic performance to the
government's timely and stimulating policies, including those
adopted to intensify investment, increase fiscal expenditures,
accelerate extension of bank loans, and expand domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the summer flooding may cause the
economy to drop one percent this year, but considering the
contribution the reconstruction effort could make to the economy,
the losses are expected to diminish to 0.5 or 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Problems still exist for realizing the annual growth goal,
since the impact of the Asian financial crisis on the economy is
still worsening, and we are faced with the strenuous task of
redeveloping the flooded areas. We need to work even harder to
solve them."
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government will need to guarantee more timely
investment in those key projects already under construction, and
ensure an early start and smooth construction for new projects.
</P>
<P>
A good autumn harvest, further expanded domestic consumption,
and exports are also necessary to reach the growth goal,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction of the flooded areas, resettlement of people and
the harnessing of rivers also demands greater effort, which could
offer economic opportunities, Zeng concluded.

<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, China's leading
lawmaker, met today with Lithuanian Procurator-General
Kazys Pednycia.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, told Pednycia that the education and rectification
campaigns China's Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) and Supreme
People's Court (SPC) have carried out over the past few months
have achieved what he termed "phased results".
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign should be continued to achieve even
greater results which will enable China's judicial departments to
fulfill their responsibilities according to law and guarantee
effective law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the procurator-generals from the two nation's had
reached a consensus during "productive talks". He expressed hope
that procuratorates in the two countries will enhance exchanges
and cooperation in order to contribute to the growth of friendly
Sino-Lithuanian ties.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate shoulders important
responsibilities for promoting and guaranteeing strict law
enforcement, said Li. He added that the SPP and the SPC carry out
their law enforcement activities under the supervision of the NPC
and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs recently
heard work reports submitted by the SPP and SPC, said
Li, adding that the positive effect of their recent education and
rectification campaign "should be acknowledged".
</P>
<P>
Pednycia said the Lithuanian delegation has gained a better
understanding of China's judiciary through its current China
visit. He noted that Lithuania is also carrying out reform and can
learn from China's judicial practices.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope for expanded exchanges and cooperation
between judicial departments in the two nations.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeal For Disaster Relief For China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The representative offices
of the United Nations' various organizations in Beijing has made
an appeal on behalf of the Chinese government for emergency relief
and assistance for China's flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The UN asked governmental, inter-governmental and private
donors to contribute to the relief efforts of the Chinese
government and the Red Cross after receiving a request from the
Chinese government at the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva. The appeal is based on field
studies done by humanitarian agencies verifying the scale of the
disaster and the urgent need for shelter, food, medical care, and
potable water.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to help 5.8 million people in 9 of the worst hit
areas in Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Jilin,
Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, and to get 139 million
U.S. dollars for shelters, food, health care, water, sanitation,
and emergency repairs for schools and clinics.
</P>
<P>
The appeal covers a four-month period from the end of
September to the end of January 1999. According to Kerstin
Leitner, UN coordinator in China, the UN will probably later look
into longer-term rehabilitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ambassador to China James Sasser said that the
U.S. has decided to donate 1.12 million U.S. dollars to China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the American donation will help
alleviate the hardship of the Chinese flood victims, and said that
the U.S. will also encourage other nations and international
organizations to support the UN appeal, which parallels the appeal
of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to the
international community for 13.6 million Swiss francs to purchase
food, water, purification tablets, medicines, sanitation supplies,
quilts, and winter coats.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains Most Efficient Air Cargo Hub: Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A manager of Hong Kong's
air cargo terminal said Wednesday that Hong Kong will remain one
of the world's most efficient air cargo hubs despite the bumps and
unwelcome dislocations at the beginning of the operation of the
new airport.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Charter, managing director of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Ltd. (HACTL), told a gathering of the General Chamber of
Commerce of Hong Kong that Hong Kong is now endowed with an air
cargo terminal that is "certainly the largest, and perhaps the
most sophisticated in the world, capable of handling growth well
into the second decade of the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
After the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok on
July 6, the air cargo services was once dislocated. The new
airport resumed full operation on August 24.
</P>
<P>
Charter said the HACTL is committed to recovering services as
speedily as possible to normal high levels and is "determined to
enhance and broaden" those service standards.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the bumpy start, I am confident that before very
long you will discover that Super Terminal 1 (at the new airport)
is indeed one of the world's most sophisticated and efficient air
cargo handling facilities, providing you with the quality and
efficiency of service that you need to protect and enhance your
competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Charter, Hong Kong overtook Narita of Japan in
1996 to become the world's busiest international cargo handling
airport. And the HACTL has also grown to provide one of the
world's most efficient and technologically sophisticated air cargo
handling systems.
</P>
<P>
At Kai Tak, Hong Kong's old airport, where cargo was all
handled in a single complex, "we handled more than that handled by
the 16 airline warehouses combined at Heathrow Airport," Charter
said.
</P>
<P>
The manager believed that Hong Kong's air cargo handling
ability will remain strong in spite of the regional downturn in
trade over the past year as a result of the Asian economic
turmoil, and in spite of the emergence of a number of competitor
hubs around the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the other regional hubs like Taibei or Manila will give
the clients choice and enable them to benchmark the quality and
efficiency of the services Hong Kong gives them. The competition
"will be welcome to all of us."

<HEADLINE> Scenic Mountains, a Model in Ecological Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Touring on Huangshan Mountains,
one of the noted scenic places in China, visitors are marveled at
its excellent environment and how local people could keep the
ecological balance in such an elegant way.
</P>
<P>
Trees are well cared, many of them protected with bamboo
fences, while dustbins are made in the shape of a tree stake and
handrails assemble tree branches.
</P>
<P>
"We regard trees, stones and all other natural things here as
valuable properties," says an official from the Huangshan Mountains
Scenic Zone Administration. Local people have done their
best to protect the ecological environment while developing a
fledging tourism industry, he says.
</P>
<P>
Located in southern Anhui Province, east China, Huangshan
Mountains is on the Unesco List of World Heritage.
</P>
<P>
After an assessment trip in the area early this month, a two-
member Unesco expert team comes to the conclusion that Huangshan
Mountains could be an example for other World Heritage sites to
follow.
</P>
<P>
"The management of Huangshan Mountains is a miracle," says one
of the experts. The team's work was focused on the ecological
protection, sustained development and diversification of living
things.
</P>
<P>
They agree that local people have made remarkable achievements
in environmental and ecological protection, management in tourism,
protection of various resources, as well as in education of tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Huangshan Mountains was made a world cultural and
natural heritage by Unesco.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local authorities have paid much attention to
protecting the ecological environment by bringing into full
consideration the relationship between natural things and man-made
facilities.
</P>
<P>
No trees have been fallen down in road construction and all
tourist facilities have been built in accordance with their
environmental surroundings.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Modalities for Indo-Pakistan Talks Finalized:Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said Wednesday that India and Pakistan had
finalized modalities for resumption of the stalled bilateral
dialogue, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen aboard a special plane on his way to New
York for the 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly, Vajpayee
said that at his luncheon meeting with his Pakistani counterpart
Nawaz Sharif later Wednesday they would direct their officials to
restart talks on all outstanding issues, including peace and
security and Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan broke
down last September over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and Sharif met on the sidelines of a summit of South
Asian leaders in Colombo in July, but failed to reach agreement on
the issue. Sharif termed his meeting with Vajpayee as a waste of
time, while New Delhi responded by saying that Islamabad's focus
on Kashmir was "neurotic."
</P>
<P>
Groundwork for the New York meeting of the two Prime Ministers
was prepared by the foreign secretaries of the two countries when
they met on the fringes of the summit of the non-alignment
movement in Durban, South Africa earlier this month. Their
proposals would be considered by the two Prime Ministers before
the schedule for resumption of the dialogue process is announced,
officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- About 23,000 Palestinians
were allowed to enter Israel as of Wednesday as Israel eased its
closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after its Jewish New Year
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army resumed the seal-off last Friday following a
three-day partial lift because the militant Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) threatened to commit terror attacks against
Israel during its three-day Jewish New Year holidays starting
Sunday night to avenge the killing of its two military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army shot dead Adel and Imad Awadallah brothers on
August 10 near the West Bank town of Hebron and closed the West
Bank and Gaza the following day.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the closure was once eased and 10,000
Palestinians were given entry into Israel, but the seal-off
resumed following Hamas' threat.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear when the closure will be totally lifted.
</P>
<P>
Tight security measures were imposed across Israel during the
holidays and no terror attacks were reported.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials have said that the closure has
caused a direct loss of 4-5 million U.S. dollars every day to the
Palestinian economy, the indirect damage doubles that amount
and the long-term damage is incalculable.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Death Rates Rise Due to Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The death rate of Iraq's
children and elderly has risen significantly due to the crippling
U.N. economic sanctions, official figures said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry statistics published by the Iraqi News Agency
show that 2,917 children under the age of five died of diarrhea
in August, 2,560 cases more than in the same month of 1989.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait, barring it from exporting oil, its
main revenue earner. This has led to acute shortage of food and
medicine in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said deaths due to lung and respiratory diseases
have risen to 1,191 cases last month from 52 in August 1989. Over
2,600 children died of malnutrition in August, 2,510 more than in
August 1989.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the death toll of the elderly above 50 increased to
466 last month from 81 in August 1989. Deaths due to diabetes
stood at 316 cases, rising by 235 cases. Deaths caused by
malignant tumors increased from 216 cases in August 1989 to 1,375
cases in the same month this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ministry attributed the high death rate of the
children and the elderly to the acute shortage of food and
medicine, especially among the poor, which has been confirmed by
international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Extends Deadline for Party Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Independent
Electoral Commission (NIEC) has extended the exercise of party
registration by 19 days until October 12, media reports said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The extension was announced at a press conference Tuesday in
Abuja, capital of the west African country, by NIEC Chairman
Justice Ephraim Akpata.
</P>
<P>
By the new move, the release of provisionally registered
parties due to out Wednesday will be shifted to October 19.
</P>
<P>
According to guidelines earlier released by the NIEC,
political associations will be registered as true parties only if
they prove their strength in the coming local government
elections by winning at least 25 percent of all votes cast in
each of at least two-thirds of all the 36 states.
</P>
<P>
The NIEC chairman explained that the extension is at the
request of many political associations and will not affect the
time-frame of other activities under the current transition to
civil rule process.
</P>
<P>
By September 9, a total of 25 political associations had
applied to the NIEC for registration.
</P>
<P>
The NIEC has since sent teams nationwide to verify the
associations' claims, including checking the address of their
state secretariats.
</P>
<P>
According to Akpata, it has been found that some associations
have given incorrect addresses which could not be verified and
some even changed their address previously submitted to the NIEC.
</P>
<P>
NIEC sources had described the results of the verification as
poor and disencouraging, adding that in most places visited, only
five associations have identifiable offices and some staff, while
most of the associations are far from meeting NIEC's conditions
for registration.
</P>
<P>
Akpata also called on the associations to mobilize their
supporters for the forthcoming nationwide registration of voters
from October 5 to October 29.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerian government announced the appointment
of resident electoral commissioners for the 36 states Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They will be inaugurated Friday in Abuja by Akpata, according
to statement by Alhaji Gidado Idris, the Secretary to the
Government of the Federation.

BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today reached an agreement with
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan on the specifics
of SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's mainland visit in October.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jincheng, secretary general of the ARATS, and Shi Hwei-yow,
vice-chairman and secretary general of the SEF, met at the Diaoyutai
Hotel in Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
In a press release that followed, Li Yafei, deputy secretary
general of the ARATS, said that the ARATS has agreed to make
arrangements at SEF's request that Koo Chen-fu pay his respects at
Sun Yat-sen's tomb in Beijing and visit Beijing University and the
Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Li said the ARATS hopes that the SEF will fix Koo's tour
schedule as soon as possible so that it can fully prepare for a
successful visit.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the ARATS suggested initially that Koo came to
Shanghai before arriving in Beijing, to meet with Wang Daohan,
president of the ARATS, because Wang works in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, the SEF proposed that Koo came to Beijing first, and
the ARATS agreed with it on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue to exchange views on the specifics
of the visit this afternoon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said this morning's meeting was to make arrangements for
Koo's mainland tour, and it did not involve the topics of the
discussions between Wang and Koo.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS believes that the talks should begin with
negotiations on procedural issues of political talks, and any
political dialogue that is helpful to the peaceful reunification
and the development of cross-straits relations can be carried on.
</P>
<P>
Shi Hwei-yow said that both sides aired their views this
morning and that he hopes detailed arrangements can be made
this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Asks Senior Palestinian Negotiator to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat has turned down the resignation of
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, praising him for his
role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Israel Radio reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's rejection came after Erekat, who has led talks
with Israel for the last two years, asked Monday to be
relieved of his post as chief of the Palestinian negotiating
team.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of resignation to Arafat, Erekat said he
wanted to concentrate on his cabinet position in the PNA as
minister of local affairs.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Erekat is angry that he has been
sidestepped by Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed
Queria (Abu Ala) in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He had held talks with the Israelis on behalf of the
PNA since the two sides resumed direct negotiations in July.
Since mid-August, however, it was reported that Arafat has
beefed up the role of Abu Ala by giving him the job to
talking directly with chief Israeli negotiator Yitzhak Molcho,
personal attorney of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Arafat has asked Erekat to accompany him
to go to the United States later this week when he is due
to attend the United Nations' General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The radio also said that Molcho has held talks with Abu
Ala and Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) during the
Jewish New Year, which began on Sunday night and ended on
Tuesday night, but no progress has been reported.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker in Uncertain Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Wednesday on an uncertain market.
</P>
<P>
Developments overseas appeared to spell bad news for the local
currency, with traders saying it might have no choice but to ride
out the storm.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange manager at Colonial State Bank, Peter
Whitley, said the weaker Japanese yen was a major contributor to
the local currency's problems on the day.
</P>
<P>
"While the world remains in this state of flux in terms of
emerging markets and the problems with Japan's banking system
there is no rush to buy Aussie," he said.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 57.73 US cents, its low for the day,
from Tuesday's close of 58.43.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony
Wednesday night may also have implications for the local currency.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie could see 57.50 U.S. cents on the downside, if
Greenspan said something in terms of interest rate cuts, then we
might see it back at 58.50, so it could be a big night," Whitley
said.
</P>
<P>
Other international developments include key economic data due
in New Zealand this week.
</P>
<P>
Whitley said New Zealand's rating is already too high, above
that of Australia's, and the market has already factored in a
downgrading of one notch.
</P>
<P>
He said the local market would continue to take direction from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was trading at 78.75 Japanese yen from 78.69
and 0.9707 German marks from 0.9889 previously.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Team to Release Final Report on May Riots By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Joint
Fact-Finding Team on the May riots will release its final report
on its findings within the next 30 days, the team's leader Marzuki
Darusman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now processing the facts and information collected
during our latest searches. We will release our final report to
the public by October 23 at the latest," he said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the team's findings or conclusions might not accord
with the government's, Marzuki said on the sidelines of a
roundtable discussion on "Strategy to Build Indonesia's Overseas
Image" here.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team has been established by the government
to investigate reports that the May riots, in which more than
1,200 people were killed, were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian rights activists have said that 168 women and girls,
most of them ethnic Chinese, were raped or sexually assaulted
during the May riots, and about 20 of them died.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said his team had told the government at a meeting on
Monday that sexual violence against women did occur during the May
riots. What the team would still try to clarify was the scale of
the violence.
</P>
<P>
"The team's work has not been easy. It was equally difficult to
explain to the government how psychologically painful it is for
the victims to tell their experience to the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The most important part of his team's task had been devising a
simple method to collect accurate data on the number of the sexual
violence victims without having to actually meet them, Marzuki
added.

jointly started by Ford and what was then the State Science and
Technology Commission in May of 1995. The three-year program will
focus on developing compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles in China.
</P>
<P>
The two will jointly develop a prototype CNG diesel dual-fuel
engine, assess the commercial prospects of CNG and LPG cars in
China, develop low-cost auto parts in China, and train Chinese
engineers.
</P>
<P>
Ford already has more than a million alternative fuel vehicles
operating in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Ford has helped China develop its
first methyl-fuel car and set up a foundation in China to sponsor
research and development of alternative fuel technology.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueyong, the vice-minister of science and technology, said
here today that because China has limited petroleum resources but
an abundant supply of natural gas and coal, natural gas would be
an ideal clean fuel resource.
</P>
<P>
China has over 6,000 alternative fuel vehicles and over 60 CNG
and LPG fueling stations in a dozen major cities. The first CNG
public transport line went into operation in Xi'an in Shaanxi
Province last week.
</P>
<P>
China has plans to build 150 to 200 CNG and LPG fueling
stations and to manufacturer or re-fit 50,000 alternative fuel
vehicles by the end of the century. It has already set up an AFV
technology standardization board to promote development.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Internet Appeal For Donations For China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of
China (RCSC) and the Bank of China have opened a site on the
Internet to solicit donations for flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Donations will go into a special account in the Bank of China
that will be used to help prevent epidemic diseases and build new
houses for people in flooded areas, according to Wang Lizhong,
RCSC's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
He says that the Chinese Red Cross Society will try to use the
donations in accordance with donors' requests on the Internet and
will tell people how the disaster relief is used in the same way.
</P>
<P>
David Aaron, a senior American Commerce Department official who
was at the opening ceremony for the website in Beijing today, said
that it will allow people from around the world to make donations
via the Internet to help Chinese in flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Vast areas along the Yangtze, Nenjiang, and Songhua rivers were
hit by floods this summer, with losses estimated at more than 160
billion yuan (19.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Provincial branches of the RCSC have raised 180 million yuan
worth of cash and material donations for the disaster relief. The
Internet addresses are http:// www.dragonpulse.com;
http://www.chineseredcross.org.cn; http://www.bank-of-china.com;
http://www.cyberash.com; and http//://www.sparkice.com.cn.

<HEADLINE> Real Sociedad's Kovacevic Banned for Four games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Real Sociedad's Yugoslav
international striker Darko Kovacevic has been suspended for four
games , the Spanish soccer federation's disciplinary committee
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kovacevic was shown the red card for abusing and insulating a
linesman a minute before the end of Sunday's league match against
Mallorca, which the San Sebastian side lost 1-0.
</P>
<P>
"It's rather excessive because it's the first time I've been
sent off in Spain. I was carried away because we were losing and
lost my head. I offer my apologies to the linesman, and my
teammates for letting them down." said Kovacevic.
</P>
<P>
However the Spanish federation still took a dim view of
Kovacevic's strong language and he got little support from his
club president Luis Uranga.
</P>
<P>
"The ban is fair and within the established guidelines. I just
hope it does not happen again," Uranga said.
</P>
<P>
Kovacevic was the team's leading scocer last season with 17
goals and was a key player to lift Real Sociedad to third and
getting a place in this season's UEFA Cup.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asked to Pressure Turkey on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has asked his United States counterpart Bill Clinton to
pressure Turkey into facilitating a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the request to Clinton in New York at a lunch
hosted by the United Nations chief Kofi Annan for the heads of
state or government attending the 53rd U.N. General Assembly,
Cyprus News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told the news agency
that Clerides briefed Clinton on the latest developments of the
Cyprus problem and asked him to exert pressure on Turkey in a bid
to reach an overall settlement for the issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton assured that he would seriously consider what Clerides
has said, Stylianides added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is maintaining more than 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., alongside other members of the international
community, has been trying to help reunify Cyprus under the
U.N.-sponsored bi-zonal and bi-communal formula. But no tangible
results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Showing Interest in China's Chemicals Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- At the International Chemical
Industry Fair '98, the South Africa Trade and Economic Delegation
is made up of representatives of 14 major chemical businesses and
some small companies.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa established diplomatic relations in
December 1997, and according to Yusuf Adam, South Africa's
Economic Counsellor to China, this is the first South African
delegation to attend a specialized exhibition in China.
</P>
<P>
He says they hope this exhibition can kick-off their business
opening in China. The companies involved are in manufacturing and
research in organic and inorganic chemicals, and fine and
daily-use chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
Sasol Limited and Agrocrop Corp., two large South African
chemical companies, are already doing business in China, Adam
says, and the products are exported to other markets.
</P>
<P>
An official with China's State Bureau of Petroleum and Chemical
Industry who is in charge of the exhibition says that there is
cooperation potential in imports and exports of chemical products
and machinery for chemical machinery, and in technology transfers
from South Africa to China.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries in 1997 was worth 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars, 18 percent more than in 1996. The figure this year
is estimated at 1.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Adam says, trade is featured by low-grade,
low-technology goods and products with a low added value, but the
advanced technology of South African companies will probably help
bring up the level of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The Polifin Company, a subsidiary of Sasol, specializes in
making plastics out of coal and related chemicals and industry
analysts say this technology is valuable to China, the world's
largest producer of coal.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Biggest-Ever Jewelry Fair Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is hosting Asia's
biggest-ever jewelry show although local traders admitted a
decline in exports this year because of the regional economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a decline in overseas visitors to Hong Kong, the local
jewelry industry suffered a drop of 20 to 30 percent in overall
sales in the first six months this year than the same period in
1997, Leung Sik Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Jewelers' and
Goldsmiths' Association, said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong's jewelry exports to some specific areas showed a
considerable increase, with a rise of 13 percent for the Untied
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leung was speaking at a press conference after the opening of
the Hong Kong Jewelry &AMP; Watch Fair at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One out of every three jewelry shops opened here closed due to
poor business or lack of interest in the business among the shop
owners' younger generations, said Aaron Shum, chairman of the Hong
Kong Jewelry Manufacturers' Association. Some of the shops managed
to survive after the property owners agreed to reduce the rents,
he continued.
</P>
<P>
But in the first half of this year, the ratio was about one to
one, which meant no increase of jewelry shops in general, Leung
said.
</P>
<P>
Shum brought about good news for the local industry. There had
been a 13-percent increase in demand for titanium alloy and white
gold jewelry products in the U.S. market, which could offset Hong
Kong's loss caused by the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
And the steady market demand in South America and the Middle
East and an improving economic situation in East European
countries represents a good market potential for Hong Kong's
jewelry industry, Shum said.
</P>
<P>
As the exhibition space had been expanded by 55 percent over
last year to 42,000 square meters, the five-day Hong Kong fair
this year attracted a record attendance of 1,643 exhibitors from
41 countries and regions. The United States is the most active
single country in attendance, with 135 exhibitors participating.
Local exhibitors capped the field with an overwhelming attendance
of 765 exhibitors, according to the organizers.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Use French Satellite Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use data from
France's Spot Image satellite, one of the two most popular
resource satellites in the world, for its economic expansion and
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Spot Image Corporation Ltd, which was formed by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and France's Spot Image
Corporation, made the announcement here today. The joint venture
will handle sales of data obtained from the French satellite at
CAS's Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station.
</P>
<P>
Data from the French satellite will be used for China's urban
planning, disaster reduction, agriculture, forestry
development, military affairs, telecommunications, and mapping,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is known for its accuracy and wave band and can
clearly pick out something as small as a brook or a small plot of
ground, explains Pan Xizhe, director of the China Remote Sensing
Satellite Ground Station.
</P>
<P>
A Spot-4 satellite was put up this past March. By 2010, two
Spot Image satellites will be in service.
</P>
<P>
A majority of remote sensing ground stations around the world
use either the U.S. Land satellite ot the French Spot Image
satellite. China began to use the Land satellite in 1986. But,
because of economic growth, the country is in bad need of the Spot
Image satellite data, Pan said.

<HEADLINE> China Looking To Use Geothermal Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China is paying close
attention to geothermal energy resources and plans to build
medium-sized geothermal power stations in the southwestern part of
the country, according to a senior State Development Planning
Commission official.
</P>
<P>
He says that these power stations will be built in Tibet and
western parts of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces by the year 2020 and
that priority will be given to geothermal resources with reservoir
temperatures above 200 degrees centigrade in Tibet's Yangbajing.
</P>
<P>
The country will build lesser power stations in Ruili in the
western part of Yunnan province and study geothermal resources in
Tengchong in Yunnan and the western part of Sichuan province by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The official says that 3,000 hot spring sites have been
discovered, about 2,200 of which have temperatures above 25
degrees centigrade. China's high-temperature resources are mainly
in Tibet, Yunnan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of using geothermal energy, but
large-scale exploration began only 20 years ago. Geothermal energy
has been used in various sectors of industry and agriculture, and
for greenhouses and heating, the official says.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises Sharply in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's consumer
inflation continued to rise in August, from 6.6 percent in July
to 7.6 percent, Statistics South Africa said.
</P>
<P>
This was largely due to the hike in mortgage rates in July and
August, which followed the increase in the central bank's lending
rates in a bid to save the country's plummeting currency, Rand,
Business Day paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks raised their home loan rates to around 24
percent in late August, compared with below 17 percent in late
May when speculators began attacks on the South African financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The August leap is the second straight sharp rise in consumer
inflation in the country. The inflation rate hovered between
five and 5.4 percent from February to June, and then jumped to
6.6 percent in July due to the financial upheaval.
</P>
<P>
The latest rise was broadly in line with economists'
expectations and largely reflected the combination of increases
in fuel prices and interest rates, both the result of the Rand
fallout.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, which excludes mortgage rates, certain fresh
and frozen foods and value added tax, climbed 7.6 percent year on
year in August, or 0.6 percent month on month, as compared with
7.2 percent and 0.7 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Economists said they were confident that core inflation would
remain in single digits and the pressure from the Rand's weakness
would be limited, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Month on month, the overall consumer price index rose 1.1
percent, of which housing costs contributed 0.8 of a percentage
point. But food prices recorded a month-on-month fall of 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the effects of market turmoil and the weak
Rand would be felt well into next year, with inflation peaking
around Easter, at just below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The onerous interest rates and the failure so far of the Rand
to show a sustained rally would probably combine with imported
inflation - rising costs of imports because of the weak exchange
rate - to ensure prices would continue climbing, they said.
</P>
<P>
But they also foresaw a drop in inflation next year once the
Rand stabilizes. The rate could fall to below four percent by
late next year, some economists said.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China's Economic Restructuring  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's economic
restructuring of the past 20 years has had some clear results with
a coordinated industrial structure and optimization and escalation.
</P>
<P>
A study by the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) on the structural
changes of three industries released today says that improvements
in the country's economic set-up are largely attributable to the
government's placing priority on light industry, imports of
durable consumer goods, basic industry and infrastructure, and
tertiary industry development.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1997, China's economy and all industries had
fairly rapid development. The GDP grew 9.8 percent on average
annually, with added value of primary industry growing at 5
percent, secondary and tertiary industries by 11.9 percent and
10.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that structural changes in the three industries
are basically in accordance with international development rules,
with the proportion of primary industry declining and secondary
and tertiary industries growing. Changes in industrial structure
since the reform and opening-up began in the late 1970s indicate
that the three industries have more proportional representation.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, the relations between the public and private
economy has been adjusted and improved by encouraging private and
other non-public economies. Public ownership as a part of GDP has
declined somewhat, while private ownership has increased quickly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts give the following reasons for changes in China's
economy: a series of opening and reform policies promoting
structural readjustment; state industrial policies providing
guidance for economic readjustment; changes in domestic demand
pushing structural readjustment; changes in incomes and spending
and investment and fund-raising reforms had a new impact on
structural readjustment.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China's industrial structure has completed the
readjustment and rationalization period and started a process of
optimization and escalation, but that the country's economic
structure still has weak points. For example, the foundation of
agriculture is weak; the internal structure of industry is not
fully rational; tertiary industry has problems in volume,
irrational structure, and efficiency; repetitive projects exist in
many districts; and the existing ownership structure does not fit
the industrial structure in many ways.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, they suggest that the central
government increase various reforms to provide systematic
guarantees for escalation and optimization of the economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state should adopt new and still more active
measures to expand its opening efforts and participate in
international competition and exchanges, and proper industrial
policies should be formulated for better distribution of social
resources and coordinated development of different industries.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reconfirms Support for U.N. Resolutions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia has reconfirmed its
support to U.N. resolutions on Cyprus as well as negotiations to
reach a bizonal, bicommunal federation on the island.
</P>
<P>
The position was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov in a meeting Tuesday with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides on the sidelines of the 53rd U.N. General Assembly in
New York, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's support to U.N. resolutions and the two High
Level Agreements as well as its support to the present basis
of the negotiations for a bizonal, bicommunal federation were
reconfirmed," CNA quoted government spokesman Christos Stylianides
as saying at a press briefing in New York.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said President Clerides and Ivanov had discussed
latest developments of the Cyprus problem, in the presence of
Russian Foreign Ministry Cyprus Envoy, Vladimir Tchizov, and
other officials.
</P>
<P>
The two High Level Agreements, reached between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides in 1977 and 1979, stipulate for the
establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal federation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last month Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash put forward
a proposal for a confederation of two equal states in Cyprus,
which has been rejected by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the possibility of a debate of the Cyprus
problem at the U.N. Security Council was also discussed at the
meeting, but he refrained from disclosing Russia's position.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a controversial deal with Russia last year to
buy surface-to-air S-300 missile system to boost its air
defense.
</P>
<P>
The deal has triggered threats from Turkey which vowed to
strike the missiles if they are deployed on the island,
scheduled for November this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized only
by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expects Peaceful Solution to Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said here on Wednesday that Iran expects a peaceful
solution to the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon return from the 53rd United Nations General
Assembly, Khatami said that Tehran does not welcome war, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Afghan issue was one of the most important issues
discussed at the 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly and the
U.N. would send a team to Afghanistan to probe into the crimes
committed by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team would also investigate the issue of killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a reporter by the Taliban forces in Mazari
Sharif, northern Afghanistan, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that Iran reserves the right to defend
itself, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The moderate Iranian government stressed to resort to peaceful
means to solve the issue of the killing of Iranians, despite of
the popular demand for military action to take revenge on the
Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
have deployed over 270,000 troops along the country's
850-kilometer eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army has announced to launch a grand maneuver
with 200,000 troops in an area of 5,000 square kilometers in
the border area in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Terming his visit to the U.N. as "fruitful," Khatami also said
that Iran, with a logic and principled system, has new words for
the world, the Islamic world in particular.
</P>
<P>
He referred to his speech on the dialogue among civilizations
at the U.N. General Assembly held in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed satisfaction with the common view at the
General Assembly on establishing just peace in the world.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Woman Could Win Oldest People Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan woman, who is now
registered as 125 years old, is fit to win oldest people title in
the world, the Daily Nation newspaper revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-independence (1963) census, Naomi Kakuvi Muamba was
assessed to have been born in 1873, and this puts her age at 125
now, challenging the edict that Jeanne Calment, the French woman
who died at the age of 122, to be the oldest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Never mind the variance that's probable in such age
assessments, Naomi's own history leaves no doubt that she has
lived that long, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As a grand matriarch, Naomi has seen four generations spawned
in her lifetime, with a number of 284 children in the lineage.
She lives in a farm over 200 kilometers east of capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Skin shrunken, eyes sunken, and the mouth drooling, Naomi's
story dates back to those olden days when she and her brothers
went to graze in the fields, and when people trod for miles to
get soda ash, and then traded this for food or beer.
</P>
<P>
She remembered the raids by the neighboring Maasai people, in
whose hands two of her brothers met their deaths. She belongs to
the Kamba tribe.
</P>
<P>
By the time she was ripe for marriage, both her parents were
dead, and her elder brother married her off to Muamba, a wealthy
herdsman who took her as his third wife.
</P>
<P>
It was in 1892 that she gave birth to her first child,
Munyw'ovii, who died in 1993 at the age of 99.
</P>
<P>
All in all, she has eight children, and the last born, Mbesa,
was born in 1930. She also recalled that she lost another child
while in its infancy, but cannot remember its name.
</P>
<P>
Her children gave her 48 grandchildren, who in turn gave birth
to 179 great grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
Naomi enjoys relatively good health, though she hit her toe
while supporting herself out of bed two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The toe is now healing, although it had developed into a big
wound, which occupied the better part of her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, she gets incoherent, and keeps repeating
what she said before.
</P>
<P>
These are the complications that come with old age, especially
when her only surviving brother, Peter Kitemu, died in 1993, and
her grandson Titus Kaunda Mutiso, who was very close to her,
passed away.
</P>
<P>
Naomi quitted active life about 35 years ago, and the last
time she traveled over long distance was in 1985 when she visited
daughter Lois.
</P>
<P>
She used to eat pawpaws, but now only consumes bananas, not to
mention that she also takes milk and eats pumpkins.

The detention followed a complaint lodged against IRNA by head
of the Foundation for the Oppressed and Disabled Mohsen Rafiqdoust
for its report about an assassination attempt on him.
</P>
<P>
An unknown gunman opened fire on Tuesday at Rafiqdoust, who
escaped the killing.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times daily reported on Wednesday that IRNA said the
assailant was a disgruntled war disabled who was not satisfied
with the performance of Rafiqdoust, whose foundation is
responsible for securing the life of the war disabled.
</P>
<P>
Rafiqdoust blamed IRNA for revealing the identity of the
assailant.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in 10 days that reporters were arrested
in Iran after the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned
against a tendency of "freedom abuse."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the moderate Tous daily was banned and some of its
editors were detained by the conservative judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary's moves have sparked harsh reaction of the
Iranian media, which criticize it for misinterpreting and abusing
Khamenei's speech.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the judiciary's measures are contrary to the
spirit of the leader's warning," Tehran Times quoted an analyst as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Increase on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices closed higher
Tuesday on the U.S. market amid hurricane disrupting operations in
the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Gulf of Mexico, according to
market sources.
</P>
<P>
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for October
delivery closed 18 cents higher at 15.67 U.S. dollar a
barrel. October gasoline ended 0.75 cent a gallon higher at 46.22
cents and October heating oil 0.17 cent a gallon higher at 42.16
cents.
</P>
<P>
Market sources pointed out that Hurricane Georges, which closed
oil refineries in the Caribbean and are threatening the operations
in the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic, had
contributed to the latest increase of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
As the Hurricane Georges headed toward the Dominican Republic
and Haiti, they said, two new tropical storms, Ivan and Jeanne,
loomed farther out in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forecasters said the storms were still too far off
to affect the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that several weeks of hurricanes and tropical
storms have interrupted offshore oil production and Gulf tanker
loading schedules, leading to drawdowns in U.S. oil stocks.

<HEADLINE> Rural Telephone Users On Increase In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 420,000 telephones
were installed in the rural areas of east China's Zhejiang
Province in the January-August period this year, a 52-percent
increase from the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The increase is much higher than that for the urban areas in the
province and has brought the number of telephone users in rural
areas to 2.05 million, or one telephone for every 5 families.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the number of telephone users in rural areas has
grown by 29 percent annually, thanks to the growth of local
economy.
</P>
<P>
There is still great potential for phones in Zhejiang's rural
areas, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> 276 Die of Dengue in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 276 people died of
dengue fever in the Philippines in the first nine months of 1998,
while the number of dengue cases reached a 10-year high of more
than 15,000 during the period, health authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health said that with dengue fever yet to
peak in October, the reported dengue cases nationwide from January
to September totaled 15,650, much higher than the 1996 figure of
14,648.
</P>
<P>
However, the department declared that the number of dengue hot
spot areas in the country has been reduced to two from a high of
18 early this month.
</P>
<P>
An area is declared as "hot spot" when an increasing number of
cases is observed for at least two consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Dengue cases continue to rise but they are sporadic," Health
Secretary Alberto Romualdez explained.
</P>
<P>
The health chief said that not all dengue fever cases reported
were from outbreak sites.
</P>
<P>
Dengue outbreaks are still going on in Dumaguete City in
southern Negros Oriental province and in the towns of San Antonio
and Jaen in central Nueva Ecija province.
</P>
<P>
Dengue control lies in the hands of the people, Romualdez said,
stressing that the key to dengue control is the elimination of
mosquito breeding sites.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is transmitted only by the bite of the infected female
Aedes mosquitoes.

<HEADLINE> India to Sign CTBT Only After Conditions Met: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said Wednesday that India would sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as a nuclear weapon power
only its conditions were fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen on board a special aircraft on his way to
New York to participate in the 53rd session of the United Nations
General Assembly, Vajpayee said that India was in no hurry to sign
the treaty without getting adequate assurances.
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not give any details about India's conditions
for the signing of CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Officials accompanying the prime minister explained that New
Delhi was primarily pressing for a minimum nuclear deterrent and
there no hurdles in dual use technology to formally adhere to the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether India was close to signing the treaty,
Vajpayee said that talks are still going on.
</P>
<P>
India has firmly rejected artificial deadlines the United
States has been trying to set for New Delhi to sign CTBT by
attempting to link it to President Bill Clinton's visit to India,
Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Disapproval of such attempts (to sign the treaty) was expressed
by the prime minister's special emissary, Jaswant Singh, when he
met some of the representatives of Indian community in Washington
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jaswant Singh was in Washington for his fifth round of talks
with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and they
decided to meet again in November.
</P>
<P>
India and the U.S. started their talks on CTBT on June 11
following India's nuclear tests in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Jaswant Singh was reported to have told Strobe Talbott that
India would sign CTBT when it is convinced that it is in New Delhi
security interest, not because Clinton will or will not come to
India.

<HEADLINE> Study: Shift Work Affects Blood Pressure Cycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 22 (Xinhua) -- People who work evening
and night shift are less likely than day shift workers to show a
"dip" in blood pressure levels while asleep, according to a study
published in the latest issue of American journal Hypertension.
</P>
<P>
Fumiyasu Yamasaki and his colleagues in the New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center studied a group of 93 nurses,
including 58 day shift workers and 35 evening and night shift
workers.
</P>
<P>
The researchers monitored the nurses' blood pressure over a
24-hour period and asked them to keep "sleep diaries."
</P>
<P>
They found that late shift workers had higher systolic blood
pressure and saw a smaller dip in systolic blood pressure during
sleep than the day workers.
</P>
<P>
The night and evening shift workers were more than 6 times as
likely to be "nondippers" -- to show a negligible dip in blood
pressure during sleep -- as the day shift workers, the researchers
reported in the study.
</P>
<P>
Blood pressure levels usually dip somewhat during sleep, but
working the late shift seems to disrupt this natural diurnal
cycle, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a group of researchers led by Allan
Geliebter with Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York reported that
people who work the late shift may be more likely to pile on the
pounds than their day-working counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In the study, the researchers asked 85 hospital employees, who
had worked their current day shift, evening shift and night shift
respectively for an average of 8.6 years, about weight changes as
well as changes in food intake, exercise and sleep.
</P>
<P>
The evening and night shift workers reported that they gained
an average of 4.3 kilograms while working the late shift. In
comparison, day workers said they gained only 0.9 kilograms during
the same period.

<HEADLINE> Paris Club Agrees to Reschedule Indonesian Govt Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen creditor countries
have agreed to extend by 20 years the repayment of 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars in Indonesian sovereign debts, a minister told
reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the Paris Club meeting which

</P>
<P>
After reporting to President B.J. Habibie here, Bambang told

</P>
<P>
The debts that were rescheduled were those signed before July
1, 1997 whose principals are scheduled to be repaid from August 6,
1998 until March 31, 2000. These include export credits amounting
to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bank Indonesia Sjahril Sabirin told reporters that
the rescheduling of the country's sovereign debts will ease the
government's burden and reduce the pressure on the state budget.

<HEADLINE> US "Science" Magazine Has More Readers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The American journal
"Science," one of the most authoritative academic periodicals in
the world, is attracting more readers in China.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year more than 24,000
Chinese have visited the "Science" website on the Internet, said
Ellis Rubinstein, editor in chief of the magazine, who is here
attending a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the China
Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
"There were only 13 subscribers to "Science" in China 10 years
ago. But now there are about 800 subscribers of the printed
edition in the mainland and Hong Kong," said Rubinstein. "This is
a good number compared with other countries."
</P>
<P>
Since "Science" became available on the Internet in Beijing in
January, Chinese researchers and students have been accessing the
lastest editions of the journal on both the China Science and
Technology Network and the China Education and Research Network.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said he hopes the Chinese government will
continue to support the development of the Internet, through which
Chinese scientists may obtain instant information on the World
Wide Web and thereby enjoy fair competition with their foreign
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"Science" is published weekly and enjoys a high reputation in
international scientific research circles, especially for its
articles on biology and medical science.
</P>
<P>
Although more and more Chinese read "Science," the number of
Chinese scientists who publish their papers in the magazine remains
very small.
</P>
<P>
Only two or three papers written by Chinese scientists are
published in the magazine every year, along with about ten papers
written jointly by scientists of China and other countries,
according to Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it's difficult for scientists anywhere in the world
to have their papers published in our magazine. Lots of scientists
submit their very best papers to us, but only one in eight or one
in ten can be accepted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But there's no nation we expect more papers from than China in
the long run because of its devotion to science. So I expect
very large changes."

<HEADLINE> China Using Steel Chambers To Develop Bohai Gulf Oilfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China has started using steel
chambers to build drilling and storage platforms in offshore oil
operations at the Jinzhou 9-3 oilfield in the Bohai Gulf in the
North.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil
Bohai Corporation (COOBC), this is the first time this kind of
technology has been used.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou 9-3 is located in icy seas 20 km from the city of
Jinzhou in Liaoning Province in northeast China. It has proven oil
reserves of more than 30 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Lin says that oil development by conventional methods in there
would be very costly and very difficult to recover the
investment. So, after eight years of studies, petroleum engineers
decided to put steel chambers down in the water instead of the
conventional oil exploration methods for efficiency and safety.
</P>
<P>
Round containers 13.8 m. tall and 38 m. in diameter are being
used.
</P>
<P>
This oilfield now has 27 producing wells, 26 water filling
wells, and one natural gas well, and a designed annual oil
capacity of a million tons. It will go into production in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Sound Economic Record Fails to Win Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Wednesday called on voters to support his tax plan as
his sound economic record and his strategy of centering the
current election campaign on economic management has failed to
gain him a decisive edge in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister spent one hour Wednesday in Sydney on the
nationally syndicated John Laws radio program selling his
controversial tax plan, calling on listeners to look at the
long-term benefit the plan will provide the nation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as the latest opinion poll Newspoll found the
ruling Liberal Party of Australia and National Party coalition has
yet to work harder to sell their tax plan to get a clear lead in
the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the latest survey, published
Tuesday by the nation's leading national newspaper The Australian,
the primary vote for the Australian Labor Party, the opposition,
is up one percentage point in a week to 43 percent while the
coalition's is steady on 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the day he announced the October 3 poll date, the prime
minister said the election campaign would be fought on economic
management, citing his government's sound economic management
record as well as the government's ambitious plan to reform the
nation's 60-year-old taxation system in a bid to build an
economically secure and "stronger Australia".
</P>
<P>
With the nation's jobless rate as high as 8.1 percent and its
failures in industrial reforms and controlling rising racism, the
nation's economic management remains the government's only bright
spot.
</P>
<P>
The government's economic achievements include turning budget
deficit left over by the previous Labor government in 1996 into an
expected surplus in this financial year, and delivering the lowest
interest rates in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Savage budget cuts in welfare, education and government
services by the Howard government since 1996 have helped it turn 6
billion U.S. dollar budget deficit into an estimated surplus of
1.5 billion U.S. dollars for the first time in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
The deep cuts are certain to cost the coalition many votes, for
example, from students, but the government has gained much support
from those benefiting from lower home-loan interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The home-loan interest rates have been brought to their lowest
levels since 1970 due to cuts in interest rate reduction, which
represents a saving of about 185 U.S. dollars a month for a family
with a 58,000 U.S. dollar mortgage.
</P>
<P>
The latest official gross domestic product statistics also gave
the government high scores, showing the nation's economy grew at
an unexpected 3.9 percent during the past financial year ending
June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, to the nation's 12 million voters, what matters most
is whether they would be better off or worse off under the
coalition's tax plan, which was released two weeks before the
campaign began on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a 10 percent goods and services tax would be
imposed, which would cut business costs by 6 billion U.S. dollars
each year but inflation would go up by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the coalition centering the election campaign on its
economic competence, the opposition party has been focusing its
attack on the negative impact of the tax reform, saying the plan
is unfair to middle class and low income earners.
</P>
<P>
But with the polling date just 10 days away, the two sides have
not yet achieved substantial advantage in their publicity war
against each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to send 4,000
construction workers abroad this year, Vietnam News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current Asian financial crisis has caused a drop in demand
for Vietnamese workers in some Asian countries which usually
receive most of Vietnam's exported labor, especially Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
So far, Vietnam has a total of 50,000 laborers working abroad,
among whom 24,000 construction workers were dispatched by the
country's Import-Export Construction Corporation under the
Construction Ministry in the past ten years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam started to export construction workers in the early
1980s with the first group sent to the Turkmenistan Republic of
the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Britain, U.S. to Lift Sanctions Against Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United States
of America are expected to lift sanctions against Nigeria in a
bid to normalize their relations with the country, according to
local press reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting in London Tuesday between British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Nigerian Head of State Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, British Prime Minister's office said that Blair was
"confident that all measures except the arms embargo could be
lifted soon."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Blair had been personally impressed by
Gen. Abubakar and hoped to be able to work with him in bringing
Nigeria back into the international community.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister's office noted that Britain
expected the European Union (EU) sanctions against Nigeria to be
lifted soon as a reward for the government's commitment to
restoring democracy.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria including an arms
embargo and a visa ban on the country's leadership in 1995 after
former Nigerian Head of State Sani Abacha ordered the execution
of writer Ken Saro Wiwo and his eight fellow Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
The office stated that Blair was also working for "positive
steps" within the Commonwealth from which Nigeria was suspended
over the same reason in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who is on a visit to Britain, The United States and
France and to address the 53rd U.N. General Assembly, Tuesday
held talks with Commonwealth Secretary General Chief Emeka
Anyaokwu shortly after he concluded his meeting with Blair.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Anyaokwu invited Gen. Abubakar to speak at the
Commonwealth Summit next month on the situation in Nigeria,
indicating that the relations between the Commonwealth and
Nigeria may be normalized soon, the local paper Nigerian Tribune
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Embassador to Nigeria William Twadell said in
Lagos Tuesday that steps are being taken by his government to
lift the sanctions placed on Nigerian armed forces in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a U.S. military delegation is scheduled to
visit Nigeria within next few weeks to have talks with Nigerian
top military officers on the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A larger delegation is also expected in Nigeria to address
issues related to law enforcement and counter-narcotic
cooperation between the United States and Nigeria, the ambassador
added.
</P>
<P>
Another delegation is expected to discuss with officials of
Nigerian Ministry of Aviation on the reopening of direct flight
from Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Twadell noted that "the purpose of those visits is really to
reinitiate dialog to discuss the whole range of areas in which
our two military establishments and indeed our two governments
can work together."
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper New Nigerian quoted the ambassador as saying
that "we have been very encouraged by the initiative by the Head
of State Gen. Abubakar in his political program and efforts he
has undertaken in the last few months."
</P>
<P>
"We are in for an accelerated progression of events that will
enable us to reconsider those measures (sanctions and
restrictions) and move forward in a very mutually cooperative and
reinforcing manner," Twadell stressed.

BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The standard of living of the
Chinese has improved along with the economic development of the
past 20 years, according to the State Statistics Bureau, and
people are now earning more in more different ways.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997 per capita disposable income of
urban Chinese was 5,160 yuan, 3.1 times that of 1978, and per
capita net income of rural residents was 2,090 yuan, 4.4 times
1978's figure.
</P>
<P>
Spending habits have also changed, with Chinese now spending
more on entertainment and services, instead of just food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Sales of grains and non-staple foods have increased while
coarse food grain sales have decreased and people now spend more
on dress and clothes are not just something to keep a person warm
any more.
</P>
<P>
Chinese also have more durable goods now and their living
conditions have improved a great deal.

and the country has adopted an income distribution system that

</P>
<P>
The bureau says that the government still needs to pay closer
attention to some problems like the plight of the poor, the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to craft effective ways to support the operations of
other remaining commercial airlines before they suffer the
ill-fate of the debt-ridden Philippine Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed Wednesday by Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu who expressed doubts that the operations of PAL will be
nursed back to life considering its huge obligations which are
more than the selling value of its assets.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that the focus of Wednesday's discussion by
members of a special task force created by President Joseph
Estrada is to ask other airline management to upgrade their
capacities in order to serve the interests of the riding public.
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing attention on how to revive PAL, he said, it
is still better for the government to discuss matters that would
be beneficial to other airline companies to improve their
operations.
</P>
<P>
He discounted earlier reports that the government will still
have to pump in some 1.5 billion pesos (34 million U.S. dollars)
in fresh funds to help PAL stand on its feet again due to the
failure of the PAL management and labor to agree on a rebuilding
plan for PAL.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that the on-going row could not be settled unless
the unions will reasonably cooperate with what the PAL management
wants.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management declared last week it will shut down the
airline at midnight Wednesday after the unions refused to accept a
co-ownership plan in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their
collective bargaining agreement.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Go Down in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) in most parts of Southeast Asia is seen to taper off in the
remaining months of this year, contrary to the substantial
increases experienced by the regional economies in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development in its assessment report available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the FDI flows into the countries stricken
by the financial crisis since July 1997 were found to be resilient
despite the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Inflows last year to the five Asian economies most affected by
the financial crisis -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, the
Republic of Korea and Thailand -- remained at a level almost
unchanged from that in 1996," the report said.
</P>
<P>
This was different from the bank lending and portfolio equity
investment which fell sharply in 1997, it added.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. body said that foreign direct investment inflows
to these affected countries may not return to its 1996-1997
levels.
</P>
<P>
It said a number of factors had influenced investment inflows
as well as the operations of transnational corporations in the
affected countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors enumerated in the report is that dollar
costs for foreign investors in expanding their investments have
decreased because asset prices fell considerably.
</P>
<P>
Another visible consequence of the financial crisis is the
reduced domestic demand and slower economic growth that could lead
to the canceling, scaling down or postponement of FDI in these
affected countries.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Vice-President
Christon Tembo has warned that gay lobbyists and other champions
of acts against the order of nature would, from Wednesday, be
arrested and charged with conspiring to commit criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
When clarifying the Zambian government's stand on the status
of gays and champions of their cause in parliament Tuesday, Tembo
said the government policy was very clearly reflected by
legislation and in particular the country's Penal Code which
criminalized acts against the order of nature and morality,
government-owned Times of Zambia said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody promotes gay rights after this statement the law
will take its course. We need to protect public morality. Human
rights do not operate in a vacuum," said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Penal Code provides that anyone who has carnal
knowledge of any person against the order of nature or permits a
male person to have unnatural carnal knowledge of him or her is
guilty of a felony.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for imprisonment of up to five years if
convicted of practising homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, a group called the Lesbians, Gays and
Transgender Persons Association (LEGATRA) has emerged in Zambia
and is trying to register with the Registrar of Societies.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Zulu, a champion of the group and president of the
Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT), a non-governmental
organization, once said there were 500,000 gays or lesbians
throughout the country and last week, he claimed that some of the
senior government officials and parliament members were also gays
and they even had registered with the LEGATRA.
</P>
<P>
However, Tembo denied this claim and said the gay organization
would never be registered because the country's Societies Act
gave the Registrar of Societies the obligation to refuse
registration of any society whose terms of constitution were
repugnant or inconsistent with the law.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to all Zambians, especially the young, that
it was not to be modern to champion new and ugly causes such as
homosexuality as this was against the Zambian norms and values.

<HEADLINE> China Vows not to Repeat Sang Lan Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- For every Chinese gymnast,
the 1998 China Cup International must be the safest tournament
they have ever competed in, both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
A protection cushion will be placed close to the apparatus for
the gymnasts to land, and coaches will be allowed to step forward
to serve protection on every setting.
</P>
<P>
And even more, if unfortunately and to the worst, a Chinese
gymnast gets hurt in the China Cup, which opens tomorrow, he/she
could obtain a guaranteed insurance as high as 100,000 yuans
(some 12,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"It sounds good and gives us a psychological boost," Chinese
top woman gymnast Liu Xuan said, "We do not have to worry about
getting wounded any more."
</P>
<P>
These are the latest measures being taken by the Chinese
Gymnastics Association (CGA) to prevent the Sang Lan tragedy from
repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lan, a 17-year-old national vaulting champion, accidently
broke her neck in a practice vault at the Goodwill Games this
July, and still lay paralyzed in a hospital in the United
States. As she was the only athlete suffering major injury at
the Games, the tournament's insurance money totalling 20 million
US dollars will all be contributed to her recovery.
</P>
<P>
As CGA vice president Zhang Jian revealed, to go on with its
efforts to establish a safe environment for the Chinese athletes,
the Chinese State Sports General Administration will have applied
insurance for 1,400 athletes by the end of the year, including 70
gymnasts. The highest insurance will be up to 300,000 yuans
(36,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhang urged every gymnast to develop a high sense
of safety awareness in both training and competition. Thus,
gymnasts will be "attentive, more in tune with what is going on
around them and more apt to avoid mistakes and injuries", he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, CGA also complained to the International
Gymnastics Federation (FIG), suggesting that FIG should promote
artistry, execution and originality in gymnastics instead of
focusing too much on difficulty as in the new Code of Points.
</P>
<P>
Although women's head coach Lu Shanzhen had earlier said
"enthusiasm for training in China is not as high as it was
before", most Chinese gymnasts claimed they had not been affected
much by Sang Lang's brutal accident.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going on as usual," World Cup uneven bars
champion Bi Wenjing said, "We are not afraid."

ANKARA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Ministry officials reiterated Tuesday that
Turkey will continue its policy of supporting the territorial
integrity of Iraq, saying any arrangement for northern Iraq
should be reached within this framework.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Kurdistan Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, signed a peace
accord in Washington last Friday, ending the bloody conflicts
between the two rival factions in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has called on the
European Union (EU) to make more efforts to improve the
EU-Turkish relations, saying that a sluggish attitude would harm
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Turkish relationship dropped to a freezing point last
December when the EU leaders excluded Turkey from the ranks
of prospective member states in a Luxembourg summit.
</P>
<P>
Yeni Yuzyil (New Century)
</P>
<P>
-- Addressing the school-opening ceremony of Sakarya University
Tuesday, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel stressed that

<HEADLINE> Mia Vows to Shoulder Indonesian Women's Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JARKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Olympic silver
medallist Mia Audina of Indonesia had her mind made up Monday to
carry on her country's flag in the badminton world by taking over
the role of pregnant Susi Susanti.
</P>
<P>
"I have determined to take badminton great Susi's place and to
concentrate on capturing the women's single title in the
up-coming Asian Games," said Mia after her training session
outside the country's training campus.
</P>
<P>
The teenager said: "I'll do my best to prove that I have the
ability to become Indonesia's top player and to score good
results in the Asian Games."
</P>
<P>
Mia made a sensational international debut by winning the
decisive match against Zhang Ning of China, bringing the 1994
Uber Cup to Indonesia at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian teenager took the silver medal in the women's
singles at the Atlanta Olympics by losing to South Korean Bang
Soo-hyun.
</P>
<P>
Once ranked first in the world in 1997, Mia was plunged into
bad form this year as she lost her concentration in every match
against her chief rivals.
</P>
<P>
Mia took the Chinese Ye Zhaoyin, Gong Zhichao and Dai Yun as
her archrivals in the Asian Games as the Chinese overwhelmed her
several times. "The possibility of beating the Chinese still
exists if I can fully prepare for the Games," added Mia, who was
currently ranked 12th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Susi Susanti, 27, who has collected all kinds of titles with t
he exception at the Asian Games, vowed to take the last title she
eagerly wanted but had to step back from the Asian Games as she
found a fews days ago that she was on her way to motherhood.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Back U.S. Trade-Not-Aid Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been
urged to support the U.S. trade-not-aid policy which is designed
to encourage increased trade and investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going fifth African Stock Exchanges
International Conference held in Lusaka Tuesday, Erastus Mwencha,
secretary general of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA), said the policy should be supported for the good
of Africa, Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 14 members of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) rejected at an annual summit the proposed U.S.
trade-not-aid policy to Africa, saying the region still needs
development aid.
</P>
<P>
There were some concerns that the U.S. policy to Africa still
had inadequacies, said Mwencha, but it was clear that several
countries were bound to benefit from the initiative.
</P>
<P>
There was need to endorse the policy by Africa as a continent
and later to make necessary amendments where there were
inadequacies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha, in the same presentation, differed with the stand
taken by South Africa who have called for a rejection of the U.S.
trade initiative.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is a little selfish in making that stand because
they already have an existing bilateral agreement with the
U.S.A.," he said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that while it was true that not all clauses
of the proposed act were acceptable, the little benefit that it
yielded would trickle down to other countries on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. policy initiated by President Bill Clinton early
this year, said the secretary general, would allow for an
expansion of sub-Saharan opportunities to trade with the U.S. and
create numerous job opportunities in the region.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Countries Coordinate Stances on Issues: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Ezzidine Laraki said
on Wednesday that Islamic countries are coordinating stances on
issues raised at the ongoing 53rd United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Egypt's Sawt al Arab (Voice of
Arab) radio from Moroccan capital Rabat before he flew to New
York, Laraki said that Islamic countries' foreign ministers will
hold a meeting late this week for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The OIC is concerned with the Middle East peace process, the
Afghan situations and other regional and international issues, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated OIC's support for the establishment of a
Palestinian state, saying the international community should halt
Israel's attempts to judaize the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has announced that an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital will
be declared next May when the Oslo Accord signed with Israel in
1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
Referring to OIC's role in helping settle the disputes between
Iran and the Afghan Taliban group, Laraki said the organization
believes in the need to solve the problem peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Taliban's killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a
reporter in northern Afghanistan last month, Iran has threatened
to take military actions against the group.
</P>
<P>
The OIC chief said that his organization is arranging for an
international conference on integration of cultures to assert the
role of Islam in serving human development.

<HEADLINE> Gabon to Host C. African Summit on Congo (k) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- President Omar Bongo of
Gabon will host a summit of central African countries Thursday,
trying to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Democratic
Congo, a report from Libreville said.
</P>
<P>
Its aim was to look for "a peaceful settlement to the
Congolese crisis" and guarantee "the territorial integrity and
sovereignty" of Congo (K) and other countries in the region, a
statement from the Gabonese presidency, issued after talks
between Bongo and President Laurent Kabila Tuesday, said.
</P>
<P>
Bongo said during a visit by Kabila on September 13 that a
summit of central African leaders would take place in the near
future on the conflict, which started on August 2 when soldiers
of Congo's ethnic Tutsi rebels rebelled against Kabila, who
accuses Rwanda and Uganda of invading to back the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The two countries deny direct involvement.
</P>
<P>
Central African republic, Chad, Cameroun, the Congo Republic
and Equatorial Guinea are Democratic Congo's neighbors in central
Africa along with Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Chad had already expressed support for Kabila, saying it might
send troops to join Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola in helping
Kabila fight the rebellion.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 China Cup
International Gymnastics Tournament is to kick off tomorrow here
in the Tianjin Sports Center, the stadium to host next year's
world championships.
</P>
<P>
A total of 194 gymnasts from 17 countries will participate in
the annual event which, in the viewpoint of the organizers, will
serve as a rehearsal to gain experiences in competition
organization and reception for the 1999 worlds.
</P>
<P>
The participating gymnasts are from Australia, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, DPR Korea, France, Germany, Hungary,
Japan, Norway, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United
States and host China.
</P>
<P>
"The tournament will lay sound foundations for the successful
holding of the 1999 World Gymnastics Championships," said Zhang
Faqiang, president of the Chinese Gymnastics Association.
</P>
<P>
However, the event, which spreads over two days with the team
and individual all-round competitions on September 24 and ten
apparatus finals on September 25, could hardly claim to be a
showcase of the world's best with no Russian gymnasts present and
other participating countries apparently having not dispatched
their first-string teams.
</P>
<P>
The top Chinese men's gymnast, world and World Cup champion
Zhang Jinjing who won five titles in the previous edition, is not
to show up as he was instead attending an exibition in Belgium
together with woman gymnast Meng Fei.
</P>
<P>
The host China will send three teams to the competitions:
China A, headlined by Goodwill Games pommel horse champion Huang
Xu and World Cup beam champion Liu Xuan, China B, led by World
Cup double champion in floor and bars Li Xiaopeng, and the local
Tianjin team.
</P>
<P>
The next year's worlds is scheduled on October 8-16 in
Tianjin, 120 kilometers from the capital of Beijing.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- American Shane Mosley
retained his International Boxing Federation lightweight title by
stopping Argentine challenger Eduardo Morales in the fifth round
in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the battle of unbeatens, Mosley kept his slate clean with
29 victories after his fifth successful title defense while
Morales fell to 26-1 after referee Arthur Mercante stopped the
fight two minutes and six seconds into the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
It was the 18th time in the past 19 fights Mosley stopped his
opponent early.
</P>
<P>
With both at the age of 27, Mosley stunned Morales with a
combination to the head, sending him to a sitting position
against the ropes 70 seconds into the round.
</P>
<P>
After Morales rose, Mosley continued the beating until
Mercente stepped in less than one minute later.
</P>
<P>
Mosley also sent Morales down in round three. Mosley caught
Morales with a left hook to the body and used another combination
to send him up against the ropes and down to the canvas.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will float foreign
exchange bonds to create an Industrial Development Fund designed
to help finance the country's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet meeting on economic affairs on Tuesday approved the
introduction of the bonds worth 200 million U.S. dollars, to be
sold to non-resident Bangladeshis, the English-language daily The
Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund, to be administered by a proposed "Industrial
Development Company," will be used to meet the demand for
industrial loans, Commerce and Industry Minister Tofail Ahmed
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of non-resident Bangladeshis who are interested
in the investment in the country" and "introduction of the new
bonds will fulfill their interest as well as the country's need
for funds to be invested in the industrial sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, to be sold by the national Sonali Bank, would be
issued "as soon as possible," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minimum value of a bond is 2,000 dollars or 1,000 British
pounds.
</P>
<P>
The five-year term dollar bonds would have an interest rate of
7.75 percent and pound bonds a rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
All the payments including interest payment or payment upon
maturity would be made in the same currency the bond was bought
and in case of immature cashing, the bond holder would not suffer
any penalty or loss, according to the newspaper.

SHIJIAZHUANG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The port city of
Qinhuangdao in north China's Hebei Province has become one of
China's leading dry red-wine producers, turning out 20,000
tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The city turned out 8,500 tons of red wine last year,
one-third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Areas along a section of Great Wall near Qinhuangdao are
suitable for growing grapes due to its fertile soil, plentiful
sunshine, mild climate and appropriate rainfall.
</P>
<P>
In Changli County, one of the leading grape producers, 20,000
farmers are now engaged in growing grapes. According to the county
development plan, the vineyard area will eventually sprawl to
12,000 hectares by the year 2000 and to 46,600 hectares by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the area's annual output of red wine is expected
to reach 130,000 tons by 2000 and soar to 500,000 tons by 2010, a
county magistrate said.

COLOMBO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Twenty elephants have been
killed during the past 40 days in Sri Lanka, the Wild Life
Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Department officials told Xinhua that the elephants had been
shot and died due to the lack of medical care.
</P>
<P>
Most of the elephants were males and were killed for their
tusks. The highest number of killings was recorded in Polonnaruwa
and Anuradhapura in North Central Province of the country, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that with only three specialized wild life surgeons
available in the country it is not possible to give immediate
emergency treatment to the elephants which have been shot.
</P>
<P>
Although villagers also killed elephants when their crops were
destroyed, a large number of the killing incidents are the result
of poaching, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said they have appealed to the government for necessary
measures to prevent elephant-human conflicts in the areas.

<HEADLINE> Jute, Forest Sectors Suffer in Bangladesh Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The jute and forest industries
in Bangladesh have recorded huge losses this year due to floods
which are the worst in the century.
</P>
<P>
The jute sector alone suffered an estimated loss of 3.56
billion taka (about 75.74 million U.S. dollars), State Minister
for Jute A.K. Faizul Huq said Tuesday, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the preliminary estimate has been made on the basis of
reports of crop damage and losses of public and private sector
jute mills and traders.
</P>
<P>
The devastating floods hampered production of jute, damaged the
finished goods and jute stocks in mills and godowns the machinery
and equipment of jute mills and caused a colossal trade loss
during the last two and a half months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The forest sector sustained losses amounting to 1.103 billion
taka (about 23.46 million dollars) and its rehabilitation may cost
almost the same amount of money, Forest and Environment Minister
Begum Sajeda Chowdhury said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The losses include 57.6 million taka (about 1.23 million
dollars) in damage to forests under the Forest Division, 920
million taka (about 19.57 million dollars) to rural forests and
125 million taka (about 2.7 million dollars) to nurseries.
</P>
<P>
A scheme has been taken up to assess the short- and long-term
impact on the environment. "The environmental impact assessment
will be for the first time in the country," Chowdhury was quoted
by The New Nation daily newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The study is essential considering factors like sanitation,
housing, transportation, vegetation, infrastructure, people's
response, institutional approaches and capabilities, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diarrhea is spreading fast in the flood-hit
districts affecting more people.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 people have been reportedly attacked by the
disease with 306 of them dead in 52 flood-hit districts since
July.
</P>
<P>
Medical teams have been deployed in the districts to attend the
patients and check the spread of the disease.

Ltd., the 100-percent subsidiary of Italian car major Fiat Auto
will officially launch its car model Palio here next month, Fiat
India Automobiles Ltd. sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palio car is expected to hit showrooms by mid-1999. Fiat
India's move follows a recent spurt in new car launches in India
and the Palio will have to compete with Hyundai's Santro, Daewoo's
Matiz and the upcoming Tata Indica, among others.
</P>
<P>
Fiat has also decided to slash the prices for spare parts of
the Uno car, which is being produced by Ind Auto Ltd., a joint
venture between Fiat Auto and India's Premier Automobiles Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will absorb the costs so that the spare parts cost the
same as those of its established competitors in India. The Fiat
Palio range is expected to be priced competitively at the compact
and mid-size car segment in India. The company is aiming at 50
percent of the compact car segment and 10 to 12 percent of the
overall car market in the next three to four years.
</P>
<P>
The Fiat group has decided to invest over 1 billion U.S.
dollars in India over the next two years. It has already invested
100 million dollars in the Indian operation which includes Ind
Auto and Fiat.

<HEADLINE> PM: Yugoslavia Feeling Internal and External Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister
Momir Bulatovic said Tuesday that Yugoslavia is not only
experiencing external pressure from major world powers, but is
also facing serious internal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav News Agency Tanjug reported that Bulatovic made
the remark at a meeting of the Belgrade economic coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said his country continues to feel pressure from the world's
more powerful countries. The European Union has eliminated
Yugoslavia's most favored nation status, prohibited Yugoslavia's
airlines from landing in any EU countries, and suspended the
country's privileges to participate in many international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
On domestic difficulties, the prime minister said his
government has to resolve the Kosovo issue, while the political
conflict between Yugoslavia's Montenegro Republic and Yugoslavia
has actually divided the Yugoslav economic system. The Montenegro
Republic has not made a payment to the central government of
Yugoslavia in the past two months, Bulatovic said.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the difficulties, he said the Yugoslav government
will make efforts to resolve the existing political conflicts and
guarantee long-term economic stability.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Criticizes Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers of U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Tuesday accused independent counsel Kenneth Starr
of distorting Monica Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's attorneys fired off a letter to the House Judiciary
Committee, urging members to "proceed with due caution" as they
review materials provided by Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr's report to Congress "distorted the testimony of Ms.
Lewinsky, quoting it when it suited the OIC (Office of Independent
Counsel)'s purposes and downplaying it or ignoring it when it did
not," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The White House seized on a statement from Lewinsky's first
grand jury appearance: "I would just like to say that no one ever
asked me to lie, and I was never promised a job for my silence."
The remark seems to back up part of Clinton's story.
</P>
<P>
Presidential lawyers said that statement stands in direct
contradiction to Starr's conclusion in his impeachment report.
</P>
<P>
"The Office of Independent Counsel found room for hundreds and
hundreds of salacious details that embarrassed this country,...but
it didn't find room for one sentence from the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky," White House press secretary Mike McCurry said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a grievous wrong to the president," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, a Republican and chairman of the Judiciary
Committee of the House of Representatives, told reporters that his
staff advised him "this is not so," but he said he would consider
anything the president's lawyers brought up.
</P>
<P>
Democrats also reportedly found other pieces of Lewinsky's
testimony promising to counter allegations that Clinton tried to
obstruct justice or influence witnesses.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Sell Jet Fighters Worth $5 Billion to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
sell jet fighters worth Five billion U.S. dollars to Israel, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Pentagon stressed that the "I" models of
the F-15 jets, manufactured by Boeing Co., and the F-16 C and D
models, made by Lockheed Martin, would help maintain Israel's
military edge over its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Both F-15 and F-16 would be equipped with sophisticated
electronic targeting pods and increase the Israeli Air Force's
ground-attack capabilities, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The F-15I jets would be equipped with AN/APG-70 or AN/APG-63
radars and "LANTIRN" (Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting
Infrared for Night) navigation and targeting pods used to enhance
ground-attack capabilities, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and
national security of the United States by helping to improve the
security of a friendly country which has been and continues to be
an important force for political stability and economic progress in
the Middle East," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel already has F-15s in its inventory, but the "I" models
would represent a major step forward in both air-to-air and
ground-attack capability for the United States' closest ally in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed sale of this equipment will not affect the basic
military balance in the region," Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced last Wednesday that it had offered two
billion U.S. dollars in sophisticated AMRAAM (Advanced
Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles) and other aircraft military
missiles made by Raytheon Co. to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., who has urged other countries not to sell weapons to
the Middle East, is the biggest salesman of weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the sale to Israel may be resulted from the
progress in the Palestine-Israel talks. The U.S. is trying to
persuade Israel to compromise in the negotiations.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Florence Griffith Joyner
felt "a little tired" but showed no clear signs of illness the
night before she died, her former coach said Tuesday in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"Losing Florence suddenly was a shock to the family," Bob
Kersee said at UCLA's Drake Stadium, where he once coached
Griffith Joyner."It took me whole flight from St. Louis to
believe it. I don't know if I accept it, but as a Christian, I
understand it."
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, a 38-year-old triple Olympic gold medalist,
was found "unresponsive and not breathing" by her husband, Al
Joyner, on Monday at their home. Medical examiners were working
to determine why yet another outwardly healthy athlete died at
such a young age.
</P>
<P>
Three-time world champion hurdler Greg Foster said he was told
by the family that Griffith Joyner died of a heart-related
problem.Kersee, however, said she never had any heart problems
but did suffer from exercise-induced asthma and migraines.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of heart seizures, heart attacks, all of that --
none of that is true," Kersee said. "We, unfortunately, have no
idea why Florence left us."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Griffith Joyner went to Santa Barbara to appear at
a gymnastics meet and had stopped by her mother's house, Kersee
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kersee, Al Joyner told him that she reported
feeling "a little tired" and went to bed, but otherwise there
were"no signs whatsoever that Florence was ill."
</P>
<P>
Asked about a seizure Griffith Joyner had in St. Louis two
years ago, Kersee said she was hospitalized overnight but doctors
could find nothing wrong and released her.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a mystery to us," he said.

<P>
Her death reignited questions about whether Griffith
Joyner,mother of a 7-year-old girl, had ever used
performance-enhancing substances during her track career.
</P>
<P>
Her sister-in-law, six-time Olympic medalist and world
heptathlon record-holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee, urged everyone to
wait for the autopsy results and not to jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"At this time I don't feel that it is appropriate, but I do
know that there is going to be speculation, but right now we
don't have time to be concerned about that," Joyner-Kersee said
today.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner denied using any drugs after winning three
golds in the Seoul Olympics. Kersee was adamant that no athlete
he has coached ever failed or avoided a drug test.
</P>
<P>
"How would you feel if someone was spreading false rumors
about you and your daughter had to read about this," Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
This decade, at least three well-known athletes died of heart-r
elated conditions.
</P>
<P>
Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sergei Grinkov died
during a 1995 practice session at age 28. An inherited genetic
condition caused his death.
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed during
a game in 1990 and died. He had been sidelined that season
because of a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
Boston Celtics forward Reggie Lewis collapsed and died while
casually shooting baskets during a postseason workout in 1993. He
had collapsed on the court a few months before during a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
Symptomless deaths can often be the result of inherited health
conditions, said Dr. Andy Pruitt, director of the Boulder Center
of Sports Medicine in Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Half of Italian Women Harassed: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 percent of Italian women
have been the victims of sexual harassment and four percent have
been raped, showed a survey released by the National Statistics
Bureau, Istat, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20,000 women between the ages of 14 and 59 who had
been interviewed, 61.9 percent reported having been sexually
harassed, a term which also covered receiving obscene telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
Based on the study's figures, Istat estimated that 714,000
Italian women had been the victims of rape or rape attempts, while
over 9,000,000 had been sexually harassed.
</P>
<P>
Almost 30 percent of rape victims were attacked in their homes,
10.5 percent in their cars and 8.1 percent at work.
</P>
<P>
And in most cases, the attacker was known to the victims: 23.5
percent of the victims said they had been raped by a friend, 17.7
percent by an acquaintance, and 14.5 percent by relatives,
partners or former partners.
</P>
<P>
The survey said 82.7 percent of the rape victims failed to
report the crime to the police and 93.2 percent of attempted rapes
were unreported.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of rape victims said they had been unable to
get over their traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the women interviewed said they did not feel
safe in today's society.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that women between the ages of 14 and 24
living in northeastern Italy or southern urban areas were most at
risk from sexual violence.

COLOMBO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Movement for the
Liberation of Tamils which is affiliated to the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka has threatened all members of
local government bodies in the Jaffna peninsula, the Island
newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The movement in a letter has asked all Jaffna Municipal
Councilors to quit their offices forthwith.
</P>
<P>
Two mayors of Jaffna, Sarojini Yogeswaram and P. Sivapalan,
have been assassinated in recent months. On the more recent
occasion when a bomb was exploded in the Jaffna Municipal Council
premises on September 11, Sivapalan and 11 others top army and
police officers were killed.
</P>
<P>
About four months ago judicial courts in Jaffna, Mankulam,
Kayts, Point Pedro, and Chavakachcheri ceased functioning after
threats from the LTTE, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which was routed in the Jaffna peninsula in May 1995
by government troops who now control of the peninsula, is making
every effort to destabilize the civil administration in Jaffna
city, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> China to Re-Forest, Reinforce River Banks After Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China will improve
environmental management and change the mode of economic
development along its great rivers after suffering severe losses
during this summer's flooding.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State Development Planning Zeng Peiyan told a press
conference here today that in the next 20 to 30 years, China will
increase forests to 45 percent and 27 percent of the total land
area respectively in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and
the Yellow River, the two longest rivers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Logging and timber markets in these areas will be totally
prohibited. In addition, ten million hectares of grass will be
planted in ten soil erosion control areas in central and western
China in the next ten years so that 60 percent of the land
plagued by soil erosion and desertification can be reclaimed in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will stop land-fills around lakes and turn
current farm land around the lake back into the water. In the
process of establishing a number of huge flood diversion tracts in
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, China will move local
residents to new towns specially designed and developed to suit
local economic conditions. The central government will provide 2.6
billion yuan for building the new towns.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises destroyed by the floods will not be restored in
their former locations. Instead, the most profitable of them will
be moved to new towns or merged with other enterprises, while
those which pollute the environment or lack advanced technology
will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that in the next two years reinforcement works along
the banks of the Yangtze, Yellow and other rivers will be
completed, enabling them to withstand the highest flood levels
recorded since the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
In combination with the bank reinforcement project, dredging of
the Yangtze and Yellow rivers will intensify, and 540 million
cubic meters of silt will be removed from the river beds in the next
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
He said China will combine post-flood reconstruction,
management of rivers and lakes and water conservation with
expansion of the domestic market and the promotion of economic
growth.

BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has asked Thai
authorities to prevent the supporters of former Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim from escaping into
Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur has requested the application of strict
immigration procedures along the Malaysian-Thai border, the report
quoted border officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The request followed reports that supporters of Anwar, now
detained under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, were planning
to flee to Thailand.

<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday that
Anwar had been plotting an Indonesian-style uprising. Anwar is
facing coup plot accusation.

Malaysia has stepped up security and immigration measures along
the border since Anwar was arrested on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia border police have been posted in the border area
around the clock while Thai marine police have stepped up sea

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese government
official reiterated today that the country's currency, the
Renminbi yuan, will not devalue.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference today, Minister of
the State Development Planning Commission Zeng Peiyan said that
there is no reason for the yuan to devalue.
</P>
<P>
"A depreciation of the yuan can hardly help China's export," he
said, "on the contrary, it may have negative effect on the
country's economic development."
</P>
<P>
He said that a yuan devaluation might harm the confidence of
overseas investors' confidence in China and cause inflationary
concerns.
</P>
<P>
In addition, depreciation of the yuan may set off another round
of regional financial crisis and negatively affect the pegging
system of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has confidence in maintaining a stable
yuan, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Outlines Canada's Electronic Commerce Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien laid out his country's electronic commerce strategy on
Tuesday, a new step in making Canada the most connected nation in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce refers to business conducted by means of
advanced communications and computer technologies, such as
transactions by automated banking machines, credit and debit cards,
electronic data interchange and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy is one of 'firsts', with the goal of recreating in
cyberspace, the same expectations of trust, confidence and
reliability that now exist in everyday commerce," Chretien said at
SoftWorld'98, a business event held in St. John's, provincial capital
of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
The 'firsts' includes having privacy legislation to protect
personal data, a policy on the use of encryption technology, and a
world-class public key infrastructure in place.
</P>
<P>
Canada will also have new consumer protection guidelines that
ensure Canadians enjoy the same protection online that they do at
the corner store, and a revenue neutral taxation regime that is
aimed at avoiding duplicated taxes.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make Canada a world leader in electronic commerce by
the year 2000," Chretien was quoted as saying by a government news
release.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the world's electronic commerce will grow to
about 337 billion U.S. dollars by the year of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Early next month, Canada is to host a ministerial-level
conference on electronic commerce of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.

LIMA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Latin
America Enterprise Capital company, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, said
Tuesday that the negative effects of the world financial crisis
on Latin America have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian-American banker told a group of businessmen that
the harshness of the crisis on the region "is based more on
perceptions than on concrete realities".
</P>
<P>
Kuczynski criticized the allegations that Latin America's
current foreign debt was considered high, "since in reality it is
lower than 1982's level", when the so-called "debt crisis"
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The 1982 debt levels of the main countries in the region
amounted to 325 billion U.S. dollars. Exports were valued at 85
billion, which supposed a relationship of four to one between both
factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the debt level is 600 billion dollars. Exports are
valued at almost 300 billion, a ratio of two to one, the banker
added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Aims for High GDP Growth Starting 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is planning to
achieve a 5-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth beginning
year 2000 after taking steps to revive the economy which is facing
recession due to the current regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The plan is contained in a memorandum on economic and financial
policies reached recently between the government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in connection with its
precautionary arrangement signed with the IMF early this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are aiming at a GDP growth of about 1 percent in 1998,
followed by a recovery to around 3.5 percent in 1999 and averaging
over 5 percent thereafter," said the memorandum which is published
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account recent developments, our main priority at
this juncture is to sustain economic growth, limit the adverse
effects of the crisis and provide for an early, strong, and
lasting recovery," it said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said the government has formulated policies to
prevent a slide of the economy into recession including keeping
the budget deficit at a manageable level while limiting the
inflation rate to 8 percent next year and 5 to 6 percent in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country's inflation rate is expected to hit an
average 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
To improve the fiscal position, the government is also
committed to imposing a tax on land conversion, tax on idle land,
road users tax, increase in registration fees for luxury cars and
3-percent tariff on imports of capital equipment for firms located
in special economic zones.

CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard Tuesday night gave his bluntest

competence offered voters a safe haven in times of trouble.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Lift Import Duty on Auto Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
reportedly considering lifting both the import duty and
value-added tax (VAT) on automotive parts in a bid to salvage the
crippled automotive industry and the transportation sector.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently studying the possibility of
slashing the 25-percent import duty and 10-percent VAT on car
spare parts to lower their skyrocketing domestic prices, Minister
of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan was quoted Wednesday by the
Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Officials of our ministry and the Finance Ministry are
currently in discussions to finalize the removal of the two taxes
soon," Rahardi said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's 75-percent drop against the U.S. dollar since
August last year has pushed up prices of spare parts drastically,
debilitating all 300,000 public transportation companies across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Only 331,000 of the country's 2.4 million public transportation
vehicles are still road-worthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spare parts which are particularly in high demand in the
country include tires, batteries, oil filters, air filters, fuel
filters, fuses, brake pads, clutches, clutch covers, timing belts,
fan belts, distributor contacts, tire bearing and light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
The Land Public Transports Organization said spare parts
contributed 44.74 percent of its members' operation costs if the
rupiah was 10,000 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has gradually strengthened to about 11,000 to the
greenback recently after it bottomed out at about 17,000 earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of public transportation drivers held a massive
strike in Medan, capital of North Sumatra province, on September
14 to demand the lowering of prices of automotive spare parts. The
strike led to a vandalism and looting spree.
</P>
<P>
In Banjarmasin, capital of South Kalimantan province, a strike
by thousands of public vehicle drivers entered its second day on
Tuesday, causing difficulties to thousands of commuters, including
school children. The strikers are demanding a reduction in the
prices of vehicle spare parts.

<HEADLINE> Crimes in Indonesian Capital Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,600 crimes have
occurred in Jakarta over the last three months, the Indonesian
Observer Wednesday quoted city police officers as saying.
</P>
<P>
That is an increase of almost 4 percent over the same period of
the previous year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In Central Jakarta alone, from the beginning of the year up
until August, almost 1,000 crimes were committed in this area,
ranging from fraud to motorcycle theft.
</P>
<P>
According to Central Jakarta Deputy Police Chief Major Ronny
Sompie, there have been 450 car and motorcycle thefts, of which
350 involved murder. All of the stolen motor vehicles ended up in
South Sumatra province or the provinces of Java.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Police Chief Major General Noegroho Djajoesman
acknowledged that robberies have increased greatly this year.
</P>
<P>
He predicts violent crime will go up as many bandits are
joining forces and committing robberies in groups. Most of those
arrested had turned to crime as a result of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Most of Jakarta's criminals frequently failed to obtain
legitimate work due to a lack of skills or qualifications,
Noegroho added.

<HEADLINE> Vegetable "King" in China's Desert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Gao Zhendong, a farmer in Yulin
city in northwest China's Shaanxi Province never imagined that
growing vegetables in the desert could bring him a fortune.
</P>
<P>
Since early last year, his 18-member Desert Vegetables Company
has produced more than 1.8 million kg of vegetables, bringing a
net income of over 800,000 yuan (96,700 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Stalwart and with dark skin, 37-year-old Gao said the over
1,300 hectares of sandy land he leased could " well keep me
busy all my life".
</P>
<P>
Born in a village in Yulin's Mizhi County, Gao left home to go
into business after graduating from senior high school. But a trip
to Israel kindled his desire to grow vegetables in desert.
</P>
<P>
That was in May 1996, when he went to Israel to investigate a
possible agricultural investment project. During his 20-day tour,
he was amazed by Israel's highly efficient agriculture in a land
severely short of water resources.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis irrigate vegetables just like feeding babies,"
he said, " every drop of water is used scientifically."
</P>
<P>
If Israel can export vegetables," why can't I turn the desert
in Yulin into a vegetable basket," Gao returned home with this
idea in mind.
</P>
<P>
He then shuttled between China's elite universities and
agricultural research institutes, and invited 20 experts to become
his personal advisers. When told that his plan was workable, he
resolutely went ahead to put it into practice.

TIRANA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading member of the

But his wife thought he must be crazy and wouldn't agree to
investing in desert. " You are burying our hard-earned savings in
sand," she said, " what will our two children and I live on in the
future?"
</P>
<P>
Gao insisted, and at last managed to get the money from his
wife.
</P>
<P>
He bought 13.2 hectares of desert land near a Yulin village
called Liuputan and set up his Desert Vegetables Company, which
grows vegetables in plastic greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Half a year later, when he put the first sum of money he earned
into his wife's hands, she gave it back and then followed him out
to the desert.
</P>
<P>
Gao said it is not so difficult to grow vegetables in the
desert so long as scientific methods are used. He first bulldozed
the sand dunes, dug wells and then built greenhouses designed by
experts.
</P>
<P>
"I grow vegetables with high-tech methods," he said proudly, and
indeed he is the first person to introduce Israel's drip-irrigation
technique and vegetables into the Yulin desert.
</P>
<P>
In the 87 plastic greenhouses, more than 20 species of
vegetables are grown, including cherry tomatoes, bell peppers and
eggplants from Israel and balsam pears from south China.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM: Aid to Russia Should not End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi said Tuesday evening that financial aid to
Russia should not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Instead, those countries providing assistance should hold
round-table meetings to discuss conditions for offering
assistance, he said after meeting Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.
</P>
<P>
He said they were concerned over Russia's situation and they
were willing to provide aid, but it must be clear what they (the
Russians) intend to do with it.
</P>
<P>
He hoped his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov would succeed
in solving the political and economic crisis facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Prodi arrived here Tuesday afternoon for a brief visit. He also
discussed with the Finnish president and the prime minister the
crisis in Kosovo and reforms in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
On the conflicts in the Serbian province of Kosovo, he said
Italy will work hard to seek a political solution to the
crisis.

Now, Gao's vegetables are found not only in the markets of
Yulin, but are also being sold to other provinces. In July, Gao
signed a contract with an Israeli demonstration farm based in
Beijing to sell 85,000 kg of vegetables to Beijing in October.
</P>
<P>
Gao said his vegetables sell well, except in the summer off
season.
</P>
<P>
Although Gao and his wife live in the vast desert, they are not
lonely since many people come to visit their farm, including the
governor of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
After Israel's desert expert Milko P. Pazoff visited Gao's
greenhouses, he told Gao that he could be awarded the title of
honorary doctor if he were in Israel.
</P>
<P>
This year, Gao bought 133 hectares and leased 1,320 hectares of
desert land. He plans to expand his vegetable growing to include
wheat, corn and grapes, and is considering building recreational
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Many things remain to be done in the desert," Gao said,
"perhaps I will never leave this land."

QUITO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Immigration Police
confirmed Tuesday that nine Brazilians were detained at Quito
airport when they tried to enter the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations said that the Brazilians had paid
about 800 U.S. dollars to "coyoteros", or illegal immigrant
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The group was posing as tourists when they were stopped, but
later admitted attempting to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Ecuador has become an illegal immigration
stopover. Illegal immigrants from South American countries first
travel to Ecuador before trying to enter the United States via
Panama or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador has been consumed with illegal emigration fever.
About 25,000 Ecuadorans attempt to enter the United States
illegally every year. More than 200,000 Ecuadorans now live and
work abroad illegally.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets Names D'Antoni as Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Denver Nuggets named on
Tuesday Mike D'Antoni as its head coach after one of the worst
seasons in the club's franchise.
</P>
<P>
Thus, D'Antoni, who joined Nuggets as director of player
personnel last year, becomes the club's seventh coach this decade
by replacing Bill Hanzlik who was fired after an 11-71 season.
</P>
<P>
With seven seasons in the Italian League, D'Antoni, who
briefly served as interim general manager last season, was hired
by general manager Dan Issel who took over the team in March.
</P>
<P>
Before joining Nuggets, D'Antoni compiled a 144-68 coaching
record with Benetton of the Italian League. His teams made the
playoffs each season, and Benetton won the 1997 Italian League
Championship.
</P>
<P>
D'Antoni, 47, also had success as a player, helping Milan to
five league championships, two European Cup titles and two
Intercontinental Cups in 13 seasons. He spent four years in the
NBA and one in the American Basketball Association, a former
rival to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
D'Antoni served as e Nuggets' interim general manager after
Allan Bristow was fired in February. Issel took over the team in
March, and D'Antoni finished the season as an assistant to
Hanzlik.
</P>
<P>
As interim general manager, his most notablove was signing
point guard Cory Alexander, who played a pivotal role in helping
the Nuggets avoid the worst record in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
They avoided that dubious distinction by winning six of their
final 19 games to finih two games better than the 9-73 record set
by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers.

WASHINGTON -- Two-thirds of Americans surveyed after the airing
of President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony say he was
evasive in his answers and even more don't buy his narrow
definition of sexual relations, but most people don't want him
removed from office either, polls show.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's job approval rating still ranges from 60 percent to
66 percent, according to surveys taken Monday night by ABC News,

UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ministers of
Foreign Affairs of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand,

reaffirming their intention to introduce at the current session of
the General Assembly a draft resolution on establishing
Nuclear-weapon-free world.

The draft resolution is entitled "Towards a Nuclear-Weapon-Free
World: The need for a New Agenda."
</P>
<P>
The eight ministers, who are all here to attend the 53rd

non-proliferation following the issue of the Joint Declaration
"Towards a Nuclear-Weapon-Free World" in June 9, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed the firm hope that this resolution,
which reflects the repeated calls of the international community
for urgent action on the important issue of nuclear program,
will receive overwhelming support from the Member States of the
United Nations.

<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The English Premier League on
Tuesday dismissed suggestions it is trying to block BSkyB's
takeover of Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Reports had indicated that the League was joining up with the
Professional Footballers' Association to oppose the bid in a
submission to the Office of Fair Trading.
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Mike Lee confirmed that a submission would be
made - as requested - to the OFT, who are investigating the
proposed takeover. But he added they would be doing so on their
own and would only be "seeking clarification on competition
issues".
</P>
<P>
Some Premier League chairmen have expressed possible
reservations about the takeover, suggesting it could lead to a
conflict of interests in future television deal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Yet, for the time being at least, the League seems determined
to maintain the neutral position already publicly outlined by
chief executive Peter Leaver.
</P>
<P>
Lee said: "This is a matter, at this point, for the
competition authorities. We are happy to co-operate with their
enquiries."

Booth was quoted in newspaper reports as saying she had met a

Griffith-Joyner had been administered performance-enhancing drugs.

But in a statement to PA Sport, Boothe said: "I am saddened to
hear of the death of Florence Griffith-Joyner - she was a young
woman and most importantly perhaps, a young mother. Contrary to
some press reports I have never trained with Florence
Griffith-Joyner nor have I claimed that she took drugs."

She continued: "I did live in Los Angeles between 1984 and
1991 when I was working in banking but I have no evidence to
suggest that she used performance-enhancing drugs or illegal
substances.

<HEADLINE> English Soccer League to Launch Pay-per-view </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The first pay-per-view
experiment in English football is set to start early in the New
Year following a ground-breaking announcement by the Football
League on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of six or seven matches between Christmas and the end
of the season will be chosen as the guinea pigs for a live
experiment which could go some way to determine the future of the
game's television coverage.
</P>
<P>
The matches will be shown, for a cost to the viewer of between
5 and 10 pounds each, on a variety of days and times in addition
to the current Nationwide League games already shown on Sky
Sports on Friday evenings and Sunday lunch-times.
</P>
<P>
They should feature a cross-section of teams, although bigger
clubs such as Sunderland and Manchester City, local derbies and
table-topping clashes are expected to dominate.
</P>
<P>
No deal has yet been finalised, although BSkyB is the
favourites to win the broadcasting rights, and the profits are
set to be split between the two competing clubs in each fixture
as well as the rest of the Nationwide League teams.
</P>
<P>
The Football League board put forward the plan to gather
evidence about the market for pay-per-view ahead of the
renegotiation of the existing TV deals in the next two years,
when they hope to resurrect a joint contract with the Premier
League.
</P>
<P>
The idea is by no means revolutionary yet the impact on
football may well be.
</P>
<P>
Many of the biggest fights in the boxing world are already
only available on pay-per-view, while Manchester United and other
leading clubs would be assured of sizeable audiences if the
Premier League gave the go-ahead to BSkyB or set up on their own.
</P>
<P>
If it is proved that viewers are also prepared to pay extra to
watch chosen Nationwide League games, then - like it or not
-pay-per-view could well become enshrined as part of the national
culture in Britain, as it is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Apart from worries over saturation coverage and cost, there
remains one other huge obstacle to overcome - a hearing in the
Restrictive Practices Court in January which the League admit
could "torpedo" all of their potentially lucrative plans.
</P>
<P>
If the court agree with the Office of Fair Trading that clubs
should be allowed to negotiate TV deals individually - and not
through the Football League or Premier League - then the game is
set for a monumental shake-up.
</P>
<P>
Football League chairman, David Sheepshanks, told BBC: "Any
experiment must be on the basis that it is for the benefit of
all, not just the clubs which are featured.
</P>
<P>
"It must also be seen as something additional, we must
ring-fence the current TV diet of our supporters.
</P>
<P>
"Will it lead to saturation coverage? Well, no one is forcing
people to pay for this."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Reports First Federal Surplus in 29 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
likely to record its first federal budget surplus in 29 years as
the 1998 fiscal year is approaching to the end, the Treasury
Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The department reported a deficit of 11.2 billion U.S. dollars
in August, down 68 percent from a year ago. That put the surplus
for the first 11 months of the budget year at 31.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
With quarterly tax payments flowing into federal coffers in
September, the surplus for the full year should easily double that
amount and surpass the latest government projections. The
September surplus last year was 49.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the Congressional Budget Office projected a 63
billion dollars surplus for fiscal 1998, which ends September 30.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit hit a record 290 billion dollars in 1992 and
declined to a 23-year low of 22 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Spending for fiscal 1998 through August totaled 1.51 trillion
dollars, up 2.2 percent, or not much more than the inflation rate.
However, revenue, at 1.54 trillion dollars, is up 9.7 percent from
the same period during the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In August, receipts totaled 111.7 billion dollars, up 8 percent
from August 1997, and spending totaled 122.9 billion dollars, down
11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the largest spending categories for the month were:
Social Security, 31.7 billion dollars; Department of Health and
Human Services programs including Medicare and Medicaid, 25.4
billion dollars; interest on the 5.42 trillion dollar national
debt, 24 billion dollars; and the military spending, 17.4 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Rally but Close off Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- European share prices rallied
on Tuesday from steep losses suffered during the previous session.
However, analysts were braced for further volatile times ahead.
</P>
<P>
London shares have held onto strong gains to close well up
despite Wall Street lurching into the red and eroding some of the
advance.
</P>
<P>
The leading FTSE 100 index ended the session with a gain of 113
points at 5103, having peaked at 5124 just ahead of New York's
opening.
</P>
<P>
Markets everywhere showed relief at indications that U.S.
President Bill Clinton will weather Republican moves to impeach
him, as his approval ratings even climbed after yesterday's
televised videotape testimony to the Congressional Grand Jury.
</P>
<P>
Even Tokyo managed gains overnight, despite signs that a
hoped-for agreement on banking reform was crumbling.
</P>
<P>
But uncertainty reigns. Market players remain worried about the
outlook for Latin American markets, particularly about how
regional collapses could prove dangerous for the US.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been a dearth of domestic and
international data ahead of Thursday's second quarter GDP
revisions for both the UK and the US.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices rallied by a strong 3.19 percent as
the Dax 30 index, which had fallen by 3.58 percent on Monday,
finished at 4,575.15 points. The market was boosted, too, by
firmer markets in Asia and by the reaction to President Bill
Clinton's televised grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
But traders said the gains did not signal a change in the
market's mood as concerns about Asia and Russia still continued.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed well below the day's highs,
paring early gains as a result of continued uncertainty and
volatility in global markets. The Cac 40 index finished just 5.33
points higher at 3,347.98.
</P>
<P>
Opening gains on Wall Street had little effect on the French
market, but as the Dow Jones began to lose ground the Cac 40
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said: "Today I don't think Wall Street's gains
helped us very much. Yesterday they were much more significant.
But when it went down, we followed it."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Vice-President Calls for Eliminating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President
Christon Tembo Tuesday called on African countries to make
greater efforts to prevent more people from descending into
abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the Southern Africa Region
Microcredit Summit here, Tembo said, "We do not have to be told
by any one from out of the continent that unless we do something
about poverty, we are going to be the only continent that enters
the new millennium with decreasing standards of living and also
decreasing life expectancy."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to let this happen," the Zambian
vice-president said, calling for a great effort to prevent more
people from descending into abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The problem of poverty is one that no country in the African
continent can afford to take lightly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said when the current Zambian government took power
early 1990s it adopted a market economy and the choice to change
course has and continues to be a painful one.
</P>
<P>
In the process of restructuring the economy, there are many
casualties, he said, a government has to have a strong nerve to
remain on the course especially when it sees the resultant
suffering of its people.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government strongly believes that the
liberalization of the economy will encourage Zambians to work
harder for themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said that because of the extent of breakdown the economy
had suffered, its rejuvenation will take a long time and Zambian
people will not be patient for ever with the real live problem of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit gives both the governments of southern
Africa and the microcredit practitioners an opportunity to
work together.
</P>
<P>
But the Zambian vice-president said that in terms of giving
loans, the experience in his country has not been good at all
because over the years people believe that services by government
or money belonging to government need not be paid back as they
belong to the people.
</P>
<P>
Tembo therefore urged the microcredit practitioners to build
into their programs checks and balances that win people from this
dependence, thereby re-orienting their outlook in the proper use
of credit and the obligations.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed and three others wounded in south Lebanon Tuesday by a
Lebanese guerrillas' roadside bomb, the official National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb exploded when a patrol of Israeli
soldiers passed by the village of Dir Sarayan on the edge of the
Israeli occupied security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying one of its guerrilla units
detonated the bomb.
</P>
<P>
But, Israeli army said in a statement that the soldiers were
killed and wounded when the tank they were riding turned over at
the village, calling it an "accident."
</P>
<P>
The agency said following the incident that Israeli helicopters
arrived at the site and took the casualties to the Israeli
territory.
</P>
<P>
The fresh attack has brought to 14 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been engaged in a war of attrition trying to oust
Israeli troops and their proxy militia South Lebanon Army out of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Weakens Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Kenyan Shilling weakened
against the U.S. Dollar in trading Tuesday after a bout of
corporate demand for the greenback, currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said there was some activity from corporates seeking to
purchase U.S. Dollars when the markets opened at 9.00 a.m. (0600
GMT), which drove the Shilling lower against the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
One commercial bank moved from its opening rate of 60.30 to
60.50 while another opened at 60.10/20 and quickly eased to
60.10/40, according to a press report here.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the sudden flurry of demand for the Dollar
fizzled out quickly and that demand was not high enough to move
the market drastically, in view of high Dollar inflows from the
tea sector.
</P>
<P>
"Demand is not high enough to make the Shilling weaken any
further," one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
"Margins have widened a little. But there is tea money coming
in to meet current demand," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Citibank said in a market report that importers' demand for
foreign exchange was down this year by approximately 20 percent
compared to last year -- "a true indication of the slowdown in
Kenya's economy."
</P>
<P>
Citibank said limited foreign currency flows showed the
effects of a failing economy on the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan economy is in decline, with gross domestic product
(GDP) growth forecast to fall to 1.6 percent in 1998 compared to
2.3 percent last year, according to the Central Bank of Kenya
data.
</P>
<P>
The central bank posted the Shilling at a mean indicative rate
of 60.1000 against the greenback compared to 60.0678 on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Encourages Japan to Speed up Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday encouraged Japan to speed up financial reforms and help
restore economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the United States wanted to help Tokyo find a
way out of its problems but he avoided any public comments
pressing Japan to accept specific policies.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is virtually unanimous support in the world for
the kind of financial reforms that would restore economic growth
in Japan," Clinton said during a picture-taking session with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held what Obuchi described as "very candid
talks" earlier in the day on spreading Asian financial and
economic crisis as well as on Japan's efforts to deal with its own
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks, White House spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters:"We obviously have our concerns about the reforms we
believe are necessary in the Japanese banking system and its
financial system generally."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "both sides understand the importance of
moving swiftly."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President's message to Obuchi was that it would be in
the interests of the people of Japan" to institute reforms to help
the recovery of Japan and be a role model for all of Asia, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, Obuchi acknowledged that
the steps Japan ultimately takes will have "very large
implications worldwide."
</P>
<P>
"I intend to make my very best effort at addressing this
issue," he said. "I am convinced that we will be able to do
something."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters
after the meeting that Obuchi told Clinton his government planned
to implement measures to restart economic growth quickly.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Obuchi made it clear that it was his intention
to take appropriate measures to secure an early turnaround in the
Japanese economy," Summers said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete will attend the Wednesday funeral
ceremony for a Japanese woman who was shot dead by car robbers in
Dar es Salaam last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued here Tuesday said that Kikwete
will deliver a condolence message on behalf of the government
during a two-hour ceremony to be held at the Japanese
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) premises in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Rieko Hanaoka's parents and family members jetted in Dar es
Salaam on Tuesday morning for the funeral ceremony.
</P>
<P>
They were met at the Dar es Salaam International Airport by
Japanese Ambassador to Tanzania, Keitato Sato and senior officials
with Tanzanian foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Hanaoka was killed by armed bandits attempting to rob her car
outside the gate of her residence in the Mikocheni area in the
northeastern outskirts of the city last Thursday night. Several
suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
The late Hanaoka, 30, was a medical technician with the
Maternal and Child Health Service Project financed by JICA at the
Dar es Salaam-based Muhimbili Medical Center, the largest
hospital in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Deputy Minister of Health Tatu Ntimizi
will also give a statement on behalf of the staff of her
ministry.

<HEADLINE> High Potassium Diet May Protect Against Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Diets rich in fruits,
vegetables and whole grain cereals may reduce a person's risk of
stroke, especially in individuals with high blood pressure,
according to a study in the latest issue of Circulation, Journal
of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
"This beneficial effect appears to be due to the high potassium
content of these diets, but other components of fruits and
vegetables may also contribute to the reduced risk of stroke,"
said Dr. Alberto Ascherio, associate professor of nutrition and
epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
In a study of 44000 men, researchers found that those whos'
diets with high potassium had a 38 percent lower risk of stroke
than those whos' diets with lowest potassium.
</P>
<P>
Ascherio said there is strong support for a stroke-preventive
effect from diets rich in potassium, magnesium and cereal fiber.
This was found to be particularly true in individuals with high
blood pressure, but further study in a bigger scale is still
needed to prove their finding.
</P>
<P>
Sources of dietary potassium include tomatoes, spinach,
bananas, oranges and other fruits and vegetables.

<P>
The Nigerian leader will address the U.N. General Assembly
Thursday afternoon, which will be broadcast home live, NTA said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar is also expected to meet with U.S. President Bill
Clinton. The U.S. president has said that he is eager to meet
with the new Nigerian leader.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader will leave New York for home Sunday via
France where he will meet with French President Jacques Chirac.

Abubakar's three-nation tour marks the climax of Nigeria's
return to the international society after years of sanctions by
the West during the reign of late leader General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The new warm-up has been made possible by Abubakar's series of
new policies toward national reconciliation and democratization,
including the release of all political detainees and a new
transition to civil rule program that will usher in an elected
civilian government by the end of May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho King Not Informed of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Head of State,
King Letsie III, was kept in the dark about South Africa's military
intervention in his country, South African television reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) quoted King Letsie's
younger brother as saying that neither the king nor any other members of
the royal family had been informed of the foreign intervention in the
Lesotho crisis, either by South African or Lesotho government.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had a lot to answer for and the invasion had
soured bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties also released a statement, saying the
king was not informed of the South African operation.
</P>
<P>
South African Democratic Party Leader, Tony Leon, confirmed that the
Lesotho monarchy was not givem knowledge of the military operation
before hand.
</P>
<P>
He said the royal family only heard of the invasion when one of its
members went to the border at about 4.30 a.m. (0230 GMT) in response
to rumors that an invasion was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Leon said he was contacted by the royal family and was advised that
the royal family believed the military intervention was "precipitate
and counter-productive since peaceful means to restore order to
Lesotho had not been exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili earlier Tuesday accused
King Letsie of siding with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili said he was unable to consult the king about a request for
foreign military intervention because the king was part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the king harbored opposition supporters in his palace for
seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 600 South African soldiers entered Lesotho early Tuesday
morning to help restore peace in the capital of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 Botswanan troops arrived in Ladybrand near Lesotho-South
African border Tuesday afternoon and were expected to join South
African soldiers Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
South African troops encountered fierce resistance from Lesotho
mutinous soldiers and civilians and there were unconfirmed reports
that 30 people had been killed in skirmishes. Among the dead were five
South African soldiers and 17 Lesotho soldiers.
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswanan soldiers were dispatched as Southern
African Development Community peacekeepers at the request of the
Lesotho government.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Shooting and looting
are continuing into Tuesday night in the center of Lesotho
capital Maseru, South African television reported.
</P>
<P>
Gunshot were heard in some sections of the city, which is
situated near the South African border. There was no soldiers
and police in sight, unidentified witnesses were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Many shops, mainly South African-owned ones, have been looted
by hundreds of people, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The streets of Maseru have become littered with glass from
broken shop windows, and youths who earlier went on the rampage
through the city streets were setting around drinking.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said many Lesotho people had expressed strong
anti-South African sentiments.
</P>
<P>
"People are upset about the decision to send troops here,"
said a Lesotho youth, who asked not to be identified. He blamed
South Africa for chaos that erupted after South African troops
entered Lesotho in the early hours of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"On Tuesday morning we were woken by choppers and army
vehicles with troops who shot some of our soldiers, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Acting South African President Mangosuthu Buthelezi defended
that South Africa and Botswana's military intervention in Lesotho
was to help restore stability and to find a lasting political
solution to the crisis in the tiny mountainous country.
</P>
<P>
The current military intervention was not that of South Africa
but an operation of the Southern African Development Community,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that a 200-strong Botswanan peacekeeping
troops are due to cross into Lesotho to join their 600 South
African counterparts Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association earlier quoted an unnamed
South African government officia as saying that Zimbabwe had
also joined the intervention.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no detailed report about Zimbabwe's
participation in the operation.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Says He Supports Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela pledged support for U.S. President Bill Clinton
even if everybody else deserts him hours before the two leaders
meet here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon at the South African Embassy, Mandela
said he extends the support because no other American president
has identified himself more with the aspirations of black people.
</P>
<P>
"He has my full support in everything that he does," Mandela
said. "In the jurisprudence of many... civilized countries, a
person is regarded as innocent until he's convicted."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he refrains from interfering in domestic affairs
of other countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I want to tell you that although I do not know
the history of the United States very well, in my view there is no
(prior) president who has identified himself with the aspirations
of blacks inside this country and in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"I will support my friends even if they have been deserted by
the entire group," added Mandela. "I will support him."
</P>
<P>
Mandela also decried the "grave injustice" of Western countries
judging South Africa by their standards.
</P>
<P>
"We have parents who have never seen the inside of a school,
who cannot write their names," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who served 27 years in prisons before his relase in
1990, admitted the new black-run government has made mistakes
since South Africa rid itself of the white supremacist apartheid
system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But he said the missteps were partly due to inexperience of the
rulers and the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, without any previous training, they are called upon
to run a developed country with modern ports and harbors, with
modern communications,... with a sophisticated banking and
financial system," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"For you to judge us on the basis of what happens in America,
in Canada and in Europe is a grave injustice," added Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"Judge us from the background from which we come.... We came
from years in prison, from the bush, from exile and from the
underground," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela asked for U.S. investment and help in rebuilding the
society and economy of his country.

<HEADLINE> Germany Urges World Unity to Face Global Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany on Tuesday
called upon the international community to come together under the
flag of the United Nations in its efforts to find joint solutions
to the current and future global challenges.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd General Assembly session, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said, "The age of globalization is the age
of the United Nations. Only here do all nations of the world
come together. Only here can we find joint solutions to the
global challenges of today and tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"Managing globalization also means weaving a network of
partnerships between the big regional groupings and the big
countries," he said, adding "The regional groupings are the
components of a new global order under the roof of the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
"All nations must be given a fair chance in global competition,
the poorest ones in particular. Hence it is up to the rich
countries to help the poor make the most of their opportunities
for development," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Africa shows what can be achieved when the international
community and the countries pull together, he said, adding that
"We want the Africans to know: We will not abandon this vast
continent with its 800 million people despite the heavy burdens
it still has to bear."
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo conflict, the German foreign minister said that
"The Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europe's side. A
humanitarian disaster is looming."
</P>
<P>
While sticking to a political solution to the Kosovo
conflict, he said that "the international community will react
with military force if necessary."
</P>
<P>
What he said echoed a policy line by the NATO, which has staged
military exercises close to the border of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, to flex its muscle.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Two-thirds of Americans
surveyed after the airing of President Bill Clinton's grand jury
testimony say he was evasive in his answers and even more don't
buy his narrow definition of sexual relations, but most people
don't want him removed from office either, polls show.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's job approval rating still ranges from 60 percent to
66 percent, according to surveys taken Monday night by ABC News,
CNN/USA Today/Gallup and NBC News. About six out of 10 oppose his
resignation or impeachment, said the polls taken hours after the
videotape was shown nationally.
</P>
<P>
While most say Clinton should not be removed from office, 68
percent in the Gallup poll said the Lewinsky matter is causing
significant harm to the country.
</P>
<P>
Six out of 10 said Congress was wrong to release the videotape
and prosecutors were wrong to ask about such intimate details. And
the president was right not to answer such questions, according to
70 percent of those in the ABC survey.
</P>
<P>
Among those who saw the videotape, 45 percent approved of the
president's handling of the testimony and 41 percent disapproved,
the ABC poll said.
</P>

"The overnight polling data suggest that the American people
now have a more sympathetic view of the president than they had
before," said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
But 68 percent of those who saw the videotape described
Clinton's answers as evasive and four out of five disagreed with
Clinton's narrow legal definition of "sexual relations."
</P>
<P>
The percentage who think the president should be impeached and
removed from office, 41 percent, has not grown significantly in
the last week but has increased by 11 points in the ABC poll since
September 13, just after the report from Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr was released.
</P>
<P>
However, Henry Hyde, a Republican and chairmen of the Judiciary
Committee of the House of Representatives, said, "Poll-taking is
an art and not a science."
</P>
<P>
Such reactions are understandable, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
"People want there to be more reaction. There's frustration,"
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. "It's sort
of a 'shoot the messenger' reaction. There's been a consensus
within the polls on this that gives them legitimacy. But people
should stay tuned."
</P>
<P>
The CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of 631 adults had a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The ABC poll of 523
adults and the NBC poll of 508 adults had margins of error of plus
or minus 4.5 points.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Leader Urges U.S. to Lower Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Singapore's Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Tuesday the United States should
consider cutting interest rates to help the Asia's economy to
grow.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce here, Goh said the
outlook for Asian economies was bleak.
</P>
<P>
"What are the prospects for the Asian economies? There is no
doubt that the short-term economic prospects for the region are
bleak," he said, adding, it still remained to be seen whether the
crisis would worsen substantially and how long it would take to
recover.
</P>
<P>
He said much would depend on the steps taken by Asian
governments themselves but he also added that the United States
could play an important role. He asked the United States to
support the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"As the world's only economic superpower, the U.S. must take
the lead in mobilizing international support to tackle the Asian
crisis," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Asked during the forum whether a U.S. interest rate cut was
also needed, Goh said it would help make the Japanese yen more
fairly valued versus the dollar and would thus help the rest of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"It is an option that the U.S. ought to look at to stabilize
the situation in the world," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that a rate cut by the Group of Seven rich
nations would be less likely because of reluctance on the part of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Goh urged the U.S. and Europe to resist the temptation to try
to isolate themselves from the world turmoil by closing their
markets, saying they would miss out once Asia did recover.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Singapore's economy, Goh said he expected a
minimal amount of growth next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sells Jet Fighters Worth $2.5 Billion to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States
announced on Tuesday that it would sell a package of 30 advanced
F-15 fighter jets to Israel for 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Pentagon stressed that the "I" models of
the F-15 jets would help maintain Israel's military edge over its
neighbors
</P>
<P>
The attack jets would be equipped with sophisticated electronic
targeting pods and increase the Israeli Air Force's ground-attack
capabilities, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The F-15I jets would be equipped with AN/APG-70 or AN/APG-63
radars and "LANTIRN" navigation and targeting pods used to enhance
ground-attack capabilities, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel already has F-15s in its inventory, but the "I" models
would represent a major step forward in both air-to-air and
ground-attack capability for the United States' closest ally in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Pentagon announced last Wednesday that it
had offered two billion U.S. dollars in sophisticated AMRAAM and
other aircraft military missiles made by Raytheon Co. to the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., who has urged other countries not to sell weapons to
the Middle East, is the biggest salesman of weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the sale to Israel may be resulted from the
progress in the Palestine-Israel talks. The U.S. is trying to
persuade Israel to compromise in the negotiations.
