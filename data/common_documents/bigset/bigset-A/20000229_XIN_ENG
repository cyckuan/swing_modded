<HEADLINE> Targets, Dates to Be Set for EU Development Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- European Commission chief
Romano Prodi on Monday proposed to the European Union (EU) that
targets and dates be set for the 15-nation bloc's development
program.
</P>
<P>
In an agenda sent to the EU's rotating presidency Portugal,
European Commission President Romano Prodi said that the EU should
make most of the current favorable economic conditions to proceed
with the economic reform so as to prepare the union for a
knowledge-based economy and society.
</P>
<P>
The commission is the executive body of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the coming EU summit in Lisbon would be the
opportunity for establishing targets and dates besides identifying
priorities and setting long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
The commission president pinned down on six priorities to be
focused by the entire union. They included the implementation of
an information society via electronic networking, the further
improvement of the internal market by 2004 and the full
integration of the financial markets by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said, "The measures proposed are ambitious but achievable.
If the commission, the EU member states and European citizens at
all levels summon the political energy and courage to implement
this ambitious integrated program, Europe will see a new
renaissance with full employment and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
The EU has, through the last decade, formed an internal market,
an economic and monetary union, by the launch of the single
currency for 11 member states.
</P>
<P>
The commission has projected the economic growth at 3 percent
for this year and next and a net job creation of above 1 percent,
that converts to 1.5 million new jobs each year.
</P>
<P>
Other favorable economic conditions included low inflation and
reduced public sector deficits while the stock of government debt
as a percentage of gross domestic product has been on a downward
path, commission sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's agenda also included as a second strategy investment in
the European citizens. This strategy includes increased investment
in education, training for the knowledge-based economy and the
promotion of life-long learning.
</P>
<P>
One tangible target set for this strategy is all EU schools
will be connected to the Internet in the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Opposition Demands Scrapping of PSA By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition launched
a countrywide dawn-to-dusk general strike Monday, demanding the
scrapping of the controversial Public Security Act (PSA).
</P>
<P>
The strike ended in the evening peacefully barring few stray
incidents of violence which left at least 15 people injured.
Police arrested six people on charges of violence during the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Life in the capital was almost normal during the general strike.
Leaders and workers of the ruling Awami League and its front
organizations marched through city streets protesting the strike
called by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party urged people to become more active against the
anti-development activities.
</P>
<P>
Monday's strike, the third of its kind this month, was prompted
by the passage of the tough PSA in the government's bid to come to
grips with serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance launched a two-day general strike on
February 2-3 and a staggering three-day shutdown from February 15
to 17 demanding the scrapping of the law which they said was
enacted to suppress the opposition's oust-government movement.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed on February 14 gave his assent to
the controversial PSA passed in parliament on January 30. The bill
seeks summary trials for crimes like damaging property and
vehicles, obstructing traffic, mugging and extortion. It proposes
to make those offenses non-bailable.
</P>
<P>
After the PSA was adopted, leaders of the BNP-led opposition
and the 11-party left-democratic alliance met the president and
asked him not to assent to the PSA, arguing that the PSA was
adopted in parliament as a "Money Bill," violating the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition is intensifying its oust-government movement,
the controversy on the PSA between the president and the prime
minister in the past few days again made the political situation
in the country more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question during the "face-to-face with the
countrymen" program on TV last Friday, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina noted that the president signed the draft of the PSA before
it was presented to parliament as a "Money Bill."
</P>
<P>
The President House last Saturday took the unusual step of
issuing a public statement to dispel "the impression being created
" in the country. "This idea is completely wrong," said a press
release issued by the President Press Secretary from the President
House.
</P>
<P>
"It has been clearly stated in the prime minister's proposal
that it involves expenses from the public exchequer. But the
question of involvement of public money does not necessarily mean
Money Bill," the press release stressed, adding that the speaker
is to decide if it is a "Money Bill" or not after the passage of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
Leading jurists of the country Sunday said the debate between
the president and the prime minister was undesirable after the
bill had been signed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that politically, the PSA melodrama
signaled the end of a possible role of the president as a
moderator in the power struggle between the ruling party and the
opposition.

<HEADLINE> hke022870 --Vietnam, Turkey to Boost Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam and Turkey Inter-
Governmental Committee held its first meeting here on Monday to
discuss measures to boost bilateral trade, Vietnam News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Turkish Minister of State M. Ali Irtemcelic
noted that despite a considerable growth, trade turnover between
Vietnam and Turkey over recent years has yet to meet the potential
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ali Irtemcelic stressed that the two countries should work out
concrete measures to diversify the forms of trade and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed measures to encourage the business circles to
further participate in trade fairs in their respective countries
and accelerate other trade promotion activities so as to open up
opportunities for business executives and investors of the two
countries to better understand each other's markets and win more
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Minister of Trade Vu Khoan reaffirmed that the
Vietnamese government will continue to make efforts to promote
cooperation among the business circles of the two countries in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
Khoan also set Vietnam's goal of expanding cooperation with
Turkey in new areas such as banking, aviation, agriculture and
construction.
</P>
<P>
Trade turnover between Vietnam and Turkey in the first 11
months of last year reached 15.9 million U.S. dollars with Vietnam
enjoying a surplus of 7.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey exports to Vietnam mainly electricity transformers,
copper wire, conductive materials and steel products, while
importing footwear, latex and crude oil from Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> India, Singapore Launch Joint Naval Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian and Singaporean naval
forces began on Monday an 11-day anti-submarine warfare joint
exercise in the Andaman Seas off Port Blair of India, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Two frigates and a submarine of the Indian navy are taking part
in the exercise, while Singapore has sent two missile corvettes
and two anti-submarine patrol ships, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is aimed at promoting inter-operability and
understanding of operational methods of the two navies, the PTI
quoted an Indian navy spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Navy officials from both sides started mutual briefings shortly
after the Singaporean ships arrived at Port Blair on Monday
morning, and the navies would be out in the sea very soon, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh exercise of its kind between the navies of
the two nations since 1993, the PTI said.

<HEADLINE> Sharif's Entire Defense Team Boycotts Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The entire defense team for
Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and the co-accused
Monday boycotted the case to protest the court's restriction on
Sharif's testifying in public.
</P>
<P>
"We are boycotting this hearing because we have been denied the
right of defense...we are walking out in protest," Iqbal Raad, a
member of the defense team said.
</P>
<P>
He said that no defense lawyer would be in the Anti-Terrorism
Court when it resumes proceedings on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Special Public Prosecutor in the plane hijacking
case, Barrister Zahoorul Haq, expressed astonishment over the
boycott by the lawyers, saying the judge of the Anti-Terrorism
Court on February 25 accepted his application and decided that the
statements of Sharif and the other accused in the case should be
of two parts.
</P>
<P>
In the second part, the accused may give oral or written
statements as required by the law. If they give written statements
then they can be examined by the court and if the accused give
oral statements, whatever they will say will be recorded and then
the court will decide at the appropriate stage as to whether the
same or part of the statements should not be released to the
public or media for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Nawaz Sharif's statement could not be allowed
appearance in the press because he (Sharif) may touch upon state
secret in his statement or may cast aspersions on the conduct of
the judge.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil rebels release Four Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) Monday released four Sri Lankan military personnel
they had been holding for more than six years, official television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Three Sri Lankan army soldiers and a naval cadet were handed
over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) at
Mallavi in the north of the island country Monday afternoon, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony took place at the political office of the
LTTE at Mallavi.
</P>
<P>
The six military persons were to be taken to the government-
held town of Vavuniya for debriefing and medical checks, according
to ICRC sources here.
</P>
<P>
No explanation has been given by the LTTE for the releases,
which came at the end of a visit to the men by their relatives
arranged through the ICRC, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a 17-year-old war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of Sri
Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Recount Votes in Tehran to Ascertain Accuracy of Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Ballots from 500 boxes of
Tehran constituency are to be recounted and double-checked to
ascertain accuracy of the 6th Majlis (Parliament) polling results,
an Interior Ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In light of the feelings of the Central Council for Polls Watch,
and of the recommendations of the Executive Council, ballots from
500 boxes of a total of 3,111 would be recounted Tuesday night,
said Seyed-Javad Qadimi Zaker, director general of national polling
at the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The recounting of the votes will be in the presence of observers
from the Council of Guardians and the Interior Ministry and will
take five days or probably less, the official was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that results would be released for public information
as soon as the recounting ended.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed hope that the recounting of ballots from
those boxes would "dispel any anxiety about the likelihood of
faulty counting of ballots, in the first counting, at Tehran
constituency."
</P>
<P>
The final election results of Tehran constituency was announced
last Saturday after a two-day delay, during which votes from 105
boxes were recounted by related bodies to "remove all doubt."
</P>
<P>
According to the results, reformers supporting President
Mohammed Khatami won most of the 30 seats, while former president
Hashemi Rafsanjani got only 25.58 percent of the votes, ranking
30th in the list.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently heading the powerful State Expediency
Council, posed as a centrist in the elections, but he is widely
believed to an ally of the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said Ali Akbar Rahmani, who ranked 31st in the
Tehran constituency, doubted the accuracy of the vote counting,
claiming that his seat might have been unjustly taken by
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The 6th Majlis polling, held on February 18, was rather
sensitive, because it was another major fighting between reformers
and the conservatives since the 1997 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Latest polling results showed that 225 of a total of 290 seats
in the expanded new Majlis have been confirmed, with reformists
pocketing 170, the conservatives 45, and independents 10.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Breakthrough on Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is no truth to these rumors, reports, suggestions that
there is an imminent announcement of a breakthrough n the Syria
track. I wish that were true. It's not true," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was answering questions that some Arab diplomats in Amman
had suggested Syria and Israel would resume peace talks in late
March.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with the Syrians and the Israelis on a number
of levels to try to make that possible, but there is no imminent
announcement that I am aware of," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Monday that there was still an "enormous
amount" of work to be done before the two sides can agree to
resume the talks, which suspended in January because of no
agreement was reached on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told reporters in
Washington that his government would not agree to the other side's
terms on the Golan Heights before negotiations starts.

WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Tuesday that he remains committed and hopeful about the Middle
East peace process despite his envoy's failure to bring Israel and
the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.

unsuccessful efforts to restart talks on implementing an interim
accord and negotiating a peace treaty between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it would be a great mistake to overread the
significance of Ross's coming home. "He's coming home because we
need to talk about where we are now and where we're going, but
there's no throwing in the towel here," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Exports Weaken As Domestic Demand Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Household spending in Britain
is rising at its fastest annual rate since the late 1980s, fueling
fears that the pace of domestic demand growth has become
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative effects inflicted upon growth by the
recent drop in exports, the UK's economy as a whole grew by 2
percent in 1999, which was more than initial estimates.
</P>
<P>
David Clementi, deputy governor of the Bank of England, told a
business gathering that there could now be "an opportunity to wait
and see how the economy develops," indicating the possibility of
an interest rate standstill.
</P>
<P>
Sharp rises in spending in the shops and on financial services
helped household expenditure to rise 0.8 percent in the last three
months of 1999, according to new official data.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the weakness of exports seemed a little
peculiar, given they had contributed positively to growth in the
previous two quarters.
</P>
<P>
"I an a little wary of these figures," said Danny Gabay, UK
economist at J.P. Morgan. "Net trade seems surprisingly weak, and
stockbuilding surprisingly strong. I would expect to see some
revisions to the composition of demand. "

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Reiterates Security Council Sets Policy on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday reiterated that it is up to the United Nations
Security Council to set the policies on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Annan said it was not Von Sponeck, the
departing U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq who will quit the
job on March 31, or anybody in the U.N. Secretariat to set the
policies.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Sponeck, who has served the United Nations for 32
years, did gave him indications to some of the difficulties with
the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq and the appropriate ways to
improve it.
</P>
<P>
U.N. civil servants had to implement U.N. policies, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of U.N. resolutions on Iraq had not been
easy for anyone and it was not going to be any different for Hans
Blix, executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) who will take
office Wednesday, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He was very experienced, a good diplomat, a good leader and a
good manager, and he would be able to work with the Iraqi
authorities to make progress, the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck met the U.N. chief Monday and briefed him on the
implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, whose resignation is widely seen here to protest the U.
N. sanctions against Iraq, has on occasions criticized the U.N.
policy, saying it has resulted in "a true human tragedy and the
oil-for-food program was not even meeting the minimum requirements
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the sanctions against and the arms inspections
in Iraq be separated.
</P>
<P>
He will brief the 15-member Security Council on the program
Tuesday afternoon. Some of the members have expressed their deep
concern over the failure of the program.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Form Disaster Rehabilitating Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean member of parliament
Moses Mvenge Tuesday urged the country to establish a committee to
draw up a long term program to prepare against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The strike by the tropical Cyclone Eline last week exposed
Zimbabwe's lack of disaster preparedness, he said while addressing
the House.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the country had been warned a week
before, nothing was done promptly to assist those to be affected.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, long term solutions such as resettling program are
required as there is likelihood of a similar disaster striking
again, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same motion, parliamentarian Aaron Baloyi said
the government should be prepared for such disasters and not wait
for them to happen to take action.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 Zimbabwean people were killed and 250,000 others
rendered homeless by the cyclone last week, with extensive damage
to infrastructure such as schools, bridges, roads and houses in
the southern and eastern parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges for Improvement of Water Resources Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
called for the people to target the problems and challenges facing
the water resource management sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a statement released at the country's
first Water and Sanitation National Workshop titled "Challenges of
Managing Sustainable Water and Sanitation in the 21st Century in
Zambia" held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the government stressed the need for the
public, private sector, non-governmental organizations and all
other partners in the water and sanitation sector to join hands in
addressing the challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, and the region as a whole, faces enormous demands on
water resources with the population growing rapidly, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that this problem cannot be addressed by the government
alone, noting that it is for this reason that the government has
welcomed the establishment of the Water and Sanitation Association
of Zambia (WASAZA) at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Being a corporate member of the Eastern and Southern African
Region Chapter of the International Water Association, WASAZA aims
to assist in the development of professional competence and the
best practical performance standards for water and sanitation
management at both national and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to provide a forum through which all matters
relating to the management of water and sanitation can be
integrated through interdisciplinary discussions and agreements.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Forecasts Higher World Oil Demand This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) has predicted that the world
oil demand will rise throughout this year compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
The world will need some 78 million barrels of oil per day in
the first quarter of 2000, up 1.5 million barrels from the first
three months of 1999, OAPEC said in its monthly newsletter
available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The global demand for oil is likely to drop by 2.9 million bpd
in the second quarter to reach 75.1 million bpd. But the amount is
still 2.1 million barrels higher than that of the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter will witness an increase of some 700,000
barrels in the world oil demand with the total amount expected to
rise to 75.7 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil demand in the last quarter of 2000 will reach around 78.9
million bpd, up by 1.6 million bpd compared to the corresponding
period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
With regard to oil supply, the Kuwait-based OAPEC said that the
supplies and demands are likely to be kept in balance, hinting that
oil producing countries will pump more oil into the international
market.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Attend Tripartite Committee Meetings on MIAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hamadi said Iraq is ready to attend
the Tripartite Committee meetings handling the missings in action
(MIAs) in the Gulf War, the Iraqi News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the European Parliament, Hamadi said that Iraq
will be present at the meetings of the Committee, which comprises
Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, but under the auspices of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The Committee was formed after the 1991 Gulf War to handle the
issue of prisoners of war (POW) and MIAs, under the supervision of
the U.S., Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
Iraq quit the Committee after the U.S. and Britain launched air
strikes in December 1998 to retaliate what they called Iraq's
failure to fully cooperate with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament adopted a resolution last month, calling
on the Iraqi government to abide by the relevant U.N. resolutions,
and free all Kuwaiti POWs it still keeps.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the resolution, Hamadi expressed deep sorrow and
pointed out that the European Parliament failed to take into
consideration of Iraq's viewpoints regarding such an important
issue relating to two rival parties.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said that Iraq has repatriated all Kuwaiti POWs in
accordance with Geneva treaties, and has exerted continuous efforts
to probe into the fate of the MIAs.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait has alleged that Iraq still holds more than 600
Kuwaiti POWs. Iraq, on the other hand, claims that the Kuwaiti
authority fails to account for the whereabouts of some 1,100 Iraqi
MIAs.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Turkey Common in Fighting Separatism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov, who started an official visit to Turkey on Tuesday,
said that Ankara and Moscow share same ideas and have mutual
understanding against separatism in each country.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said Russia has never supported Turkey's rebel group,
the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting since
1984 for an independent Kurdish state in the southeast of Turkey,
the Anatolia News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He praised Turkey's support for Russian struggle against Chechen
terrorists in the Northern Caucasus, saying that "Russia's
initiatives to destroy the international terrorism in Chechnya is
in the benefit of both Russia and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Russia has made sweep victory in fighting Chechnya separatism.
Klebanov said that Russia is launching a crackdown against Islamic
fundamentalism in Northern Caucasus as Turkey did.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov brought Turkish President Suleyman Demirel the response
letter from acting Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Turkey's
proposal to maintain stability in the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey is the prior and most important partner of
Russia, so both countries should coordinate positions on regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Demirel and Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit to discuss issues ranging from economic cooperation to
regional policies including the Caucasus and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Russian firms have been struggling to secure Turkey's lucrative
attack helicopter and tank tenders which big western firms are
competing for. Bargaining between energy-shortage Turkey and Russia
has also continued over buying electricity from Russia via Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey meets its gas demands by buying natural gas from Russia.
In addition to the existing pipeline through the Balkans, Russia is
constructing another pipeline, the Blue Stream project, under the
Black Sea to supply gas to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Has Full Confidence in Barak: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has full confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
intention on peace, an Egyptian envoy said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's political adviser, stressed during his
meeting with Barak that Mubarak believed Barak is determined to
move forward the peace process with the Arabs, a statement released
by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Barak briefed el-Baz on the current deadlocks in the peace
process with Syria and the Palestinians, and promised to seize all
chances to advance on both peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
The senior adviser's 20-hour visit was regarded by most analysts
here as an effort to improve the Egyptian-Israeli ties and those of
their leaders, which suffered a confidence crisis in the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was fueled by Israel's air raids on Lebanon's
infrastructure targets in retaliation for Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas' attacks in the Israeli-occupied security zone in south
Lebanon, which had killed seven Israeli soldiers and wounded a
dozen since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
After the air strikes and Israel's further threat to attack
civilian targets in Lebanon, Mubarak made a surprise visit to
Lebanon earlier this month, the first by an Egyptian head of state
since 1952, to demonstrate Egypt's support for Lebanon and justify
its resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Mubarak reportedly told Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat during one of their meetings that Barak had repeated his
commitment in a recent telephone call to move forward the peace
talks with the Palestinians, but the Egyptian leader didn't believe
he was serious.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's remarks were noticeable as Egypt, the first Arab
country in the region to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979,
usually is careful with criticizing Barak in public. Egypt had
indeed used its political leverage on Arafat to prevent crises.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Egypt's stepped-up criticism was meant to
send Barak a signal that Cairo is increasingly disappointed at the
pace of the peace talks and Mubarak fears that a freeze in the
process could create regional instability.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again in January after two rounds over
Israeli troops withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, all talks, interim and the final-
status, were suspended indefinitely after a summit meeting earlier
this month between Barak and Arafat failed to resolve their
difference over Israeli troops withdrawal map of 6.1 percent West
Bank land.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also missed a February 13 deadline for a framework
agreement on final peace as stipulated by the Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
To mend fences with Egypt, Barak had sent his top aide Danny
Yatom and Foreign Minister David Levy's adviser Alon Pinkas to
Cairo to explain Israel's policy on peace and clear the air between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel and Egypt made peace more than two decades ago,
Israel always complains that no mutually warm relationship has
evolved between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> PLO to Never Sign Partial Peace Deal With Israel: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu
Mazen) said Tuesday the PLO will never sign any peace deal with
Israel that does not guarantee the full legitimate rights of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a live interview with Voice of Palestine radio this afternoon
Abu Mazen reaffirmed Palestinians' opposition to the Israeli
proposals conveyed by U.S. coordinator of the peace process Dennis
Ross during his recent tour of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The proposals provides for integrating the third redeployment of
the Israeli troops into the final status issues, according to the
PLO official.
</P>
<P>
Israel failed to meet the minimum of its commitments especially
regarding the dismantling of settlement and the return of
Palestinian lands, he added.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen reasserted the right of all Palestinian refugees who
were forced to leave their home as a result of the 1948 war to
return to their home, adding that the PLO had a full register of
the Palestinian properties including 5 million documents.
</P>
<P>
The detailed register will be raised in the proper time, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian cause is the clew of peace in the Middle East.
The PLO will never conclude any peace deal that does not guarantee
the full legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PLO official stressed the importance of the U.S.
role in the Palestinian-Israeli talks to help push the stalled the
Palestinian-Israeli track forward.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long tour of the Middle East countries that
ended on Monday, Ross failed to bridge the gaps between Israel and
the Palestinians and to re-launch the talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli new proposals, the highly-populated
Palestinian areas on the outskirts of Jerusalem, claimed by the
Palestinians, will be transferred to the next redeployment stage.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side turned down the proposals on the
grounds that they went against the signed deals and the peace
process principles, terming them as "waste of time."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday expressed the hope that Iraq would show
flexibility in dealing with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to the remarks by Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's
ambassador to the United Nations, who said Tuesday that Iraq still
rejects a U.N. resolution adopted last December.
</P>
<P>
"I think that other governments are also in touch with the
Iraqi authorities. I think we are still at the early stages of
this vote," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blix will start formally on the 1st of March and begin to
work out his plans. I am sure at an appropriate time he will be in
touch with the Iraqi authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that their position will be flexible," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution last
December which created the United Nations Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to replace the now defunct
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM has been barred by Iraq from returning to the
country to resume the weapons inspection. The UNSCOM withdrew from
Iraq days before the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hans Blix, executive chairman of the UNMOVIC, will take office
on March 1. Under a U.N. resolution of last December, he will have
45 days after taking office to make up the UNMOVIC and to draw the
UNMOVIC's work plan.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has refused to accept the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Reaffirms His Condemnation of Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin Tuesday reaffirmed his condemnation of the Lebanese Shiite
guerrilla force Hezbollah, accusing it of deliberately using
violence to block the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a debate at the French National Assembly, Jospin indirectly
accused President Jacques Chirac of adopting a policy of
impeachment toward those who use force and said that such a policy
would make France appear weak in front of "violence and fanaticism.
"
</P>
<P>
Jospin said last Thursday during a visit in Israel that France
condemns the attacks by Hezbollah and all other terrorist attacks
upon Israeli troops and civilians.
</P>
<P>
His remarks triggered fury among Arab countries and resulted in
a violent attack upon himself by stone-throwing Palestinians when
he visited the University of Bir Zeit in the West Bank Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was also sharply criticized by Chirac and France'
s rightwing opposition as harmful to France's traditional
relations with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's parliament debate, Jospin said that although
France should keep an impartial policy between the conflicting
sides in the Middle East, it should not be too soft towards those
who are resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
"We should prove a policy of balance, but we should not be
indulgent with those who use violence. That does not reinforce the
position of France, which can only be weakened in the balance of
force with violence and fanaticism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Being impartial should not mean being blind to the dangerous
acts for the fragile peace process," said the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews U.N. Mission in Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution to extend the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for a Referendum in the
Western Sahara (MINURSO) until May 31.
</P>
<P>
The extension was seen as the continued U.N. efforts to
implement the Settlement Plan and agreements adopted by the
parties to hold a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self-
determination of the people of the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
The resolution supports the intention of U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan to ask his special envoy to consult the parties
and, taking into account "existing and potential obstacles," to
explore ways and means to achieve an early, durable and agreed
resolution of their dispute, which is characterized by who can
vote in the proposed referendum and concerns that the results
might never be implemented.
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable blunt report on February 19, Annan said that
the "fundamental differences" between Morocco and rebels over a
voter registration list had again destroyed the timetable for the
referendum and made it impossible to set a new date.
</P>
<P>
Disagreements over such a core issue "could eventually prevent
the holding of the referendum as provided by the plan," Annan said.

War broke out in the Western Sahara in 1976 after Spain
withdrew from the Atlantic coast territory and Morocco annexed it
and moved in settlers. The fighting, which pitted 15,000 ragtag
guerrilla fighters from the rebel Polisario Front against Morocco'
s U.S.-equipped army, ended with a 1991 U.N.-negotiated cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations then launched a plan to hold a referendum
to decide whether residents of the mineral-rich northern African
territory would become independent or part of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been working since 1991 to identify
voters because of disagreements over who is eligible to cast
ballots.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Prolonged War Boasts Illicit Opium Production in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The provinces of Helmand and Nangarhar remained the two
dominant areas for opium poppy cultivation, representing
respectively 49 percent and 26 percent of total areas under
cultivation, and in 1998/1999, opium cultivation has also spread
to new areas, especially in northern and north-eastern Afghanistan,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the production of illicit raw opium was even
more dramatic than the increase in the areas under cultivation:
total output of raw opium is estimated to have jumped from 2,700
metric tons in 1998 to 4,600 metric tons in 1999, a staggering
annual increase of 70 percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Ideal weather conditions during 1999 were the main reason that
the increase of opium production exceeded that of cultivation, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Departing U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator to Brief Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The departing U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Von Sponeck, would brief the
United Nations Security Council on the U.N. oil-for-food program
in Iraq Tuesday afternoon, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said it would be an informal briefing.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, who was appointed to the post in September 1998, the
fifth humanitarian coordinator to run the program, will leave the
job on March 31 to protest the nine-year-long sanctions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck met U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday and he
also briefed the U.N. chief on the implementation of the
humanitarian program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan issued a statement after the meeting which said, "The
secretary-general made clear, and Mr. Von Sponeck fully understood,
that United Nations policy on the oil-for-food program is set by
the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Annan also said in the statement that he shared the views of Von
Sponeck on how to make the program more effective and beneficial
for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general will review those ideas critically with
all concerned," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck has on occasions criticized the U.N. sanctions against
Iraq, saying it has resulted in "a true human tragedy" and the oil-
for-food program was not even meeting the minimum requirements of
the Iraqi people. He urged the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Security Council members have expressed their deep
concern on the failure of the program which began to be
implemented in late 1996.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.N. Steps Up Relief Efforts in Flood-Hit Mozambique (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations,
concerned over the worsening flooding situation in Mozambique,
has responded with strengthened efforts to seek more funds and
helicopters for the Southern African country in a bid to assist
Maputo in fighting against the nation's worst flooding in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies Tuesday appealed for more helicopters and other
emergency aid for Mozambique, where up to 100,000 people have yet
to be evacuated from rising waters bearing diseases including
cholera.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based United Nations World Food Program (WFP) warned
Tuesday that the situation for hundreds of thousands of
Mozambicans stranded by recent floods and cyclones is worsening
and that people will increasingly run the risk of illness and
starvation if humanitarian assistance is not immediately expanded,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries pledged 13.5 million U.S. dollars at emergency
talks in Geneva. Italy and the Netherlands led the pledges with 5
million U.S. dollars and 3.15 million U.S. dollars respectively,
followed by Portugal with 2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft supplied by South Africa have rescued some 4,000
people since Sunday. But air power is severely lacking, especially
helicopters which can swoop down and carry 50 to 60 people at a
time, according to U.N. relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The message is there are not enough helicopters and more are
needed. The number of helicopters being used there now is not
enough to evacuate all he people hanging onto trees," said
Christiane Berthaiaume of the WFP. "It is a race against time, a
question of days and hours. The situation has become particularly
difficult since the weekend when the Limpopo River banks
overflowed again."
</P>
<P>
Over the past five days, an additional four to eight meters of
flood waters have engulfed the African country's hardest hit areas
caused by an overflowing of dams in Southern Africa and Zimbabwe.
And the opening of the spillway gates of the Kariba dam on the
Zambezi River Monday will cause further flooding, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the growing crisis, the WFP is launching a
massive emergency aid operation for the country -- and potentially
the region. The food aid agency already estimates that immediate
support is required to search, rescue and care for up to 300,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations appealed last week for 13.6 million U.S.
dollars to help 300,000 people for six months with food assistance,
shelter, health care, water, sanitation and education.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
announced that a second five-member U.N. Disaster Assessment
Coordination Team was deployed Tuesday morning and is scheduled to
arrive in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, Tuesday in what came as
the strengthened U.N. efforts to assist the African country to
fight against floods, the worst in 30 years, Eckhard said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked Ross
Mountain, the assistant emergency relief coordinator, to travel
immediately to Mozambique to serve as his special humanitarian
envoy to the country. He also authorized the release of resources
from the Central Emergency Revolving Fund to reinforce the
continuing relief efforts being undertaken by U.N. agencies on the
ground, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At least 350 people have died, more than 650,000 have been
made homeless and crops vital for surviving the coming winter
have been swept away in Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Botswana in three weeks of flooding.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican disaster officials said the situation was much
worse than the WFP's estimates. Up to 900,000 people needed urgent
aid, they said. The government has said it will need 65 million U.
S. dollars to rebuild flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Greg Harti, spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO)
in Geneva, said that flooding and contamination of drinking water
supplies increased the risk of outbreaks of disease.
</P>
<P>
"Cholera is a big concern. Malaria will become an increasing
concern as flood waters recede and stagnate. Dysentery, obviously,
is already a concern," Harti said.

PARIS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel

He was apparently referring to the military intervention in
Lebanon by both Israel and Syria since the late 1970s.

Israel has occupied a part of southern Lebanon since the early

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Tuesday it was
considering to provide further assistance to the "dramatic and
very serious emergency" caused by weeks of flooding in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at all possible ways in which we can provide
emergency assistance both for those who are trapped, and for the
medium-term reconstruction of Mozambique," Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are all shocked and deeply concerned at the human suffering
and the risk to life in Mozambique. We are actively continuing
even today to consider how we can make further assistance to this
dramatic and very serious emergency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the death toll in four weeks of floods across
southern Africa is still pegged at 350, including 150 in
Mozambique, but aid workers say that many hundreds of people must
have died.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, British Development Secretary Clare Short said that
Britain was urgently trying to locate helicopters in southern
Africa for flood rescue in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
She said Britain, which has given 600,000 pounds to pay for
helicopters and boats ferrying people to safety, had pledged a
total of 2.2 million pounds so far to help overall emergency
relief efforts.

<HEADLINE> NATO Troops to Pass Through Greece for Kosovo Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 NATO troops will in
the next few days pass through the northern Greek port city of
Thessaloniki on their way to participate in an alliance exercise
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press briefing, Reppas also stated that
Greece will not send new forces to Kosovo, and Greek soldiers will
not participate in the exercise, codenamed Dynamic Response 2000,
which is to take place on March 19 to April 9.
</P>
<P>
"There should not be given the impression that we are before
shocking developments," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit
will make up the bulk of the troops headed for the Yugoslav
province while others will come from the countries such as Italy,
the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Greece currently has a strong battalion of 1,200 men
participating in the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos has characterized
the Greek force in Kosovo as adequate and very effective. He also
noted that no additional Greek soldiers will be sent to Kosovo,
which has seen in recent days rising violence between French
peacekeepers and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for the increase of the Kosovo-
based International Police Force, which is now made up of 1,800
men.
</P>
<P>
While calling for the implementation of the relevant agreements
in Kosovo, Tsohatzopoulos warned that there is a risk of new
explosions in the region if those deficiencies are not met.
</P>
<P>
Greece is now closely watching the situation in Kosovo and
urges the international community to coordinate their efforts to
resolve the Kosovo problem quickly.

UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. employee was
shot and wounded in southern Serbia close to Kosovo, a Yugoslav
province, Tuesday, a U.N. spokesman said here.
</P>

Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that the wounded U.N. worker is Marcel Grogan of Ireland, who, a

</P>
<P>
The incident took place at 12:15 p.m. (local time), said the

<HEADLINE> "Six Plus Two" Ends Meeting on Illicit Drug Issues in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The "Six Plus Two"
informal group on Afghanistan had concluded its meeting on issues
of illicit drugs emanating from Afghanistan, the U.N. said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held Monday at the U.N. Headquarters at the
level of permanent representatives to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. said the members agreed that the "Six Plus Two" could
make a useful contribution to drug-related problems and that the
United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (
UNDCCP) should play a key role in facilitating its activities in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on how best to address the drug-related
issues in a coordinated manner with a view to eliminating drug
production and trafficking out of Afghanistan through a
comprehensive and balanced regional plan.
</P>
<P>
Ideas exchanged at the meeting also included ways to promote
regional cooperation, such as exchange of information and training
of law enforcement personnel, as well as measures to tighten
controls on chemical precursors and essential chemicals used for
the manufacture of heroin and morphine base.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, members of the group agreed to
continue working-level consultations with a view to convening a
technical meeting supported by the UNDCCP in early April in Vienna,
the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises all the neighbors of Afghanistan: China,
Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as well as
Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Digital Technology Paints Pictures of World's Forest Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The maps and reports reveal widespread logging in the forests
of the Congo Basin, and extensive mining, energy and road
construction projects in the forests of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, we documented that only a fifth of the world's
historic forest cover remains as frontier forests or large tracts
of intact forests. At the current rate of expansion, we estimated
that another 40 percent would be lost in the next 10 to 20 years,"
said Dirk Bryant, director of Global Forest Watch, an initiative
of the Washington, DC-based World Resources Institute.
</P>
<P>
"It now looks like we have underestimated those threats in some
places," Bryant added.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, researchers at the World Resources
Institute and World Forest Watch are able to map out logging
across the Congo Basin, a region that contains the world's second
largest continuous tropical forest after the Amazon, thanks to a
unique technology combination of satellite imagery, geographic
information system (GIS) and mapping software.
</P>
<P>
The digital and remote sensing technology, along with the
Internet and on-the-ground observation, will help provide accurate
forest information to anyone with access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It also enables governments to better manage their forests, and
provides local groups with the information they will need to
participate in the management of their forests.
</P>
<P>
Global Forest Watch currently has 75 partners in seven
countries. During the next five years, the international network
will span 21 countries and cover 80 percent of the world's
remaining frontier forests.
</P>
<P>
It has received support from both environmental groups and
industry. Software companies such as Environmental Systems
Research Institute, and home furnishings company, IKEA, have given
major donations to support Global Forest Watch.

ATHENS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday welcomed the
resignation of Joerg Haider as the chief of Austria's far-right
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the development in Austria as "positive,

</P>
<P>
Fourteen other European Union (EU) members joined hands in

</P>
<P>
Haider, known for his non-tolerant and pro-nazism comments,
announced late Monday the handover of the party's leadership to
Susanne Riess-Passer, who is now serving as the vice-chancellor of
the Austrian coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been concerned over the political development in
Austria following the rise of the country's far-right party and
its participation in the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Athens has stated that governments of EU countries should
respect in practice the principles and values which led to the

<HEADLINE> Alitalia-KLM-Northwest Takes Off on April 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The new air transport alliance
between the Italian national carrier Alitalia, KLM of the
Netherlands and Northwest Airlines of the United States will
officially take off on April 2 with code-sharing and common
frequent flier programs.
</P>
<P>
The alliance between the three airlines will initially service
42 cities in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States
and work out of the air hubs of Fiumicino in Rome, Milan's
Malpensa, Detroit and Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The first new initiative of the alliance, in the future to be
known as Wings, will be the start-up of non-stop service by
Northwest between Detroit and Rome, Detroit and Milan.
</P>
<P>
The code-sharing agreement will be extended from the flights
themselves to on-ground services for check-in, reservations and
sales and all frequent flier programs will be merged as of April 2.
</P>
<P>
The Alitalia-KLM-Northwest alliance received an green light
from European Commission anti-trust authorities in December 1999,
while Northwest and KLM have been working together since 1993 with
common flights, frequent flier programs, business class services
and waiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
Together, the Wings alliance between the three carriers will
carry some 90 million passengers a year at the last count, with 50
million from Northwest, 24 million from Alitalia and 15 million
from KLM.
</P>
<P>
The alliance creates Europe's largest airline in terms of
passengers transported in 1998, serving 377 destinations in 87
countries. It will use over 672 planes (148 from Alitalia, 405
from Northwest and 119 from KLM), employ about 94,000 people and
should see a turnover of 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Northwest is the world's fourth largest airline with 1,700
flights daily serving Detroit, Minneapolis-St.Paul, Memphis, Tokyo
and Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia serves 130 cities in 63 nations out of Rome's
Fiumicino airport and Milan's Malpensa airport while KLM, with its
partners, serves over 500 cities in 100 countries on six
continents.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia-KLM-Northwest are currently negotiating to bring Thai
Airlines into their alliance in order to expand in Asia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: McCain Poses Dilemma to U.S. Republican Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McCain's attack on Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition, and Jerry Falwell, the founder of Moral Majority, long
considered an important part of the Republican constituency, shows
a striking split within the Republican Party, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the party's primaries for presidential nomination, McCain
has won support of some Republican moderates, independents and
even Democrats while his rival Texas Governor George W. Bush got
the staunch support of Republican conservatives.
</P>
<P>
McCain won victories in New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona
primaries, but Bush defeated McCain in Iowa, Delaware and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The tight race between McCain and Bush has come as a shock to
the party establishment, which had once expected Republicans to
quickly rally around Bush, son of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush has been endorsed by 213 Republican members of Congress
and 26 governors, while McCain by only 12 Republican members of
Congress and no governors.
</P>
<P>
Bush's struggle to nail down the Republican presidential
nomination has shaken up the Republican Party's campaign plan to
control the House of Representatives, threatening its strategy
based partly on the notion that candidates would get a boost from
Bush leading the ticket, the Washington Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
McCain, with his appeal to Democrats and independents, is
trying to assemble a coalition that taps into the movement started
by Ross Perot and his Reform Party in the 1992 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who began his campaign hoping to bring new immigrants and
other new votes into the Republican fold, has been pushed by
McCain into running a primary campaign focused on the traditional
conservative Republican base.
</P>
<P>
He has sought to energize the party's core constituency by
accusing McCain of "hijacking" the Republican primaries by drawing
Democrats and independents into them.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans are worrying that the pitched primary battle
will leave the party in tatters.
</P>
<P>
Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican and a Bush
supporter, said the disputes between McCain and Bush had reached "
crisis proportions" and called for the party to "get back on the
issues."
</P>
<P>
McCain has emerged as the Republican with the best chance of
winning the White House in November, but he also is an
increasingly divisive force in the Republican Party, according to
a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is no sign that the Republican
establishment will change the horse from Bush to McCain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Slips In February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence
slipped in February from an all-time high in January due to higher
interest rates and oil prices, the Conference Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a
report that the Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.8,
down from 144.7 in January.
</P>
<P>
"Declining consumers' expectations for the next six months was
the major reason for the overall dip in confidence," said Lynn
Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research
Center. "Consumer attitudes will bear watching over the next few
months to gauge the impact of rising interest rates and relatively
high gas prices. As for now, the index is signaling further
economic growth ahead."
</P>
<P>
The report said the percentage of respondents who rated
business conditions as "good" fell to 46.2 percent, down from 47.3
percent in January. Consumers holding the opposite view increased
to 8.8 percent, up from 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of consumers who say jobs are "plentiful" slipped to
51.2 percent from 55.2 percent in the previous survey, it added.
</P>
<P>
The consumers are less optimistic about the short-term business
outlook, the report said, adding that the percentage expecting
business conditions to improve over the next six months dropped to
17.6 percent from 20 percent and the proportion expecting
conditions to worsen rose to 4.7 percent from 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index is closely watched because
consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economic
activity.

<HEADLINE> OAU Donates Half Million U.S. Dollars to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Monday donated 500,000 U.S. dollars to
Mozambique to help the country cope with devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim handed over a cheque of
500,000 dollars to permanent representative of Mozambique to the
OAU, Alexandre Zandamela.
</P>
<P>
"The contribution is a clear and firm expression of our sense
of concern and solidarity with the people of Mozambique," Salim
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone Eline swept southern Africa last week. A combination
of destructive cyclone, heavy rain storm, over-flowing rivers and
floods have reportedly claimed hundreds of Mozambicans' lives, and
make hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
At least 65.5 million dollars are needed for the rescue
operation, according to Zandamela, who is also Mozambican
Ambassador to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Stressing African solidarity in action, Salim appealed to
African and non-African heads of state and government to provide
and increase whatever support they can give to the people of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Africa, Botswana and Malawi have
offered the Mozambican government logistic support, including
helicopters.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Ask Donors to Help African Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press released available here Tuesday, the two U.N.
agencies expressed their concern over dramatic funding shortfalls
for humanitarian operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Monday joint appeal was prompted by a jump in the number of
refugees, which has led to a shortfall of 36 percent, or 81
million U.S. dollars, for food assistance to refugees in 16
African countries where the two U.N. agencies collaborate on
humanitarian activities.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees WFP expects to assist with food aid in
the 16 African countries this year is expected to rise to
2,065,000 from 1.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
The combined projected needs are 363,000 tons of food with an
estimated value of 221 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the largest funding problem is
in Tanzania, where by July WFP will be unable to feed some 525,000
people unless contributions are received immediately.
</P>
<P>
The refugee population in Tanzania recently swelled by 120,000
to 500, 000, most of whom came from Burundi. At the same time,
some 25,000 poor Tanzanians who live near the camps are also
receiving food from WFP.
</P>
<P>
The refugees receive a basic ration of maize, pulses and
cooking oil from the agency.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 countries where WFP and UNHCR have joint
operations, Kenya has the second largest funding crisis, with a
shortfall of 7.4 million dollars, or 30 percent of WFP's food aid
for refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, over 20,000 additional refugees have
flooded into Kenya to escape harsh conditions in Somalia and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Zambia have respective shortfalls of 7 million
dollars and 5 million dollars, U.N. officials said, noting that
the numbers of refugees in the region could easily rise over the
coming year and put even more strain on an already fragile
humanitarian operation.
</P>
<P>
WFP is the United Nations' front-line agency in the fight
against global hunger. In 1999, the U.N. agency fed more than 88
million people in 82 countries including most of the world's
refugees and internally displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Agrees to Ratify SADC Tourism Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Parliament Tuesday
agreed to ratify the protocol on tourism in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) allowing for the adoption of a
regional approach to promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was crafted in line with international travel
trends that show tourists normally visit more than one country,
said Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon
Moyo.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, a regional approach to promote and integrate the
regional tourism policies can only accelerate the development and
growth of the tourism sector in member countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Tourism Organization of Southern Africa had
earlier launched a regional directory featuring various tourism
attractions of the region.
</P>
<P>
"Member states have recognized that a thriving tourism sector
can contribute to economic development as evidenced by the fact
that tourism has remained the fastest growing sector in the
region, despite the harsh economic environment we are facing,"
Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the protocol, the minister said, member
countries would have to harmonize their national policies,
strategies and programs.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among member states would extend to research and
making available national facilities for promotion of tourism
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would gain tremendously from the cooperation
because other countries in the region are much more advanced in
the areas of marketing, human resources, research and product
development.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe will take advantage in training its work force and at
the same time tap research data, which will improve local tourism
operations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses U.S. of Aggravating Pollution in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Navy Commander Rear
Admiral Abbas Mohtaj on Tuesday accused the U.S. of aggravating the
environmental pollution in the Gulf by deploying military forces in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The dozens of U.S. warships and nuclear-powered submarines are
responsible for the various kinds of radioactive, chemical, thermal
and sound pollution in the Gulf, Mohtaj said on the sidelines of
the 10-day "Vahdat (Unity) 78" war games in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. navy carried out unconventional exercises
in the Gulf, leaving behind irreparable damage to the environment,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohtaj said the ammunition fired by the U.S. navy in its
maneuvers including depleted uranium has severely threatened the
health of the people living in the region.
</P>
<P>
The cases of cancer in Iraq has risen tenfold since the Gulf War
in 1991, he said, and 200,000 out of 700,000 U.S. forces who took
part in the Gulf War are suffering from the uranium-related
infection known as the "Gulf Syndrome."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander urged the regional countries to protect
the environment of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ongoing maneuvers conducted jointly by the army
and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Mohtaj said the
Iranian navy gives due consideration to safeguarding the
environment in its exercises and it even refrains from using live
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the Iranian navy's exercises, the regional
states can make use of Iran's experience in protection of the
environment of the Persian Gulf," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the naval forces of the Iranian army and the IRGC have
conducted three phases of the "Vahdat 78" exercises in the Gulf,
which was kicked off on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver was scheduled in five stages in an area of 64,000
square kilometers with participation of 60 vessels, 120 gunboats,
30 helicopters, 15 warplanes and several submarines.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israel Responsible for Deadlocked Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said on Tuesday the Israeli government
is fully responsible for the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held here with visiting President of
the European Commission (EC) Romano Prodi, Arafat said the Israeli
side alone is to be blamed for the current crisis in the talks
because it is not committed to the implementation of the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised Europe's role in the peace-making efforts in the
region and expressed appreciation for the support which the
European Union (EU) extended to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the importance of activating Europe's role
in moving forward the peace process which ground to a halt earlier
this month over a long-delayed Israeli troops withdrawal from 6.1
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, promised
that Europe would continue to play its role in the peace process
and support the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
During their talks held Tuesday morning, Arafat and Prodi
discussed the Mideast peace process and bilateral relations. Prodi
is expected to end his tour in the Gaza Strip later Tuesday after
visiting Palestinian refugee camps and the European hospital funded
by the EU.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath also criticized Israel for
trying to block Prodi's visit to East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Voice of Palestine radio, Sha'ath stressed
that the Palestinians viewed those visits made by international
officials to East Jerusalem as an expression of support for and
solidarity with the Palestinians' legitimate rights over the city.
</P>
<P>
And their talks with PLO Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal
Husseini would also help the Palestinians reclaim their sovereignty
over the holy city under the relevant U.N. resolutions, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said any official who is unwilling to visit East Jerusalem
will not be received elsewhere since this is regarded as a denial
of the Palestinians' political, historical and religious rights.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities had reportedly tried to prevent Prodi from
visiting East Jerusalem. But the attempt was foiled after Prodi
held talks with Husseini at the Ecole Publiqe school on the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Prodi arrived in Israel on Sunday on a two-day visit, his first
visit to the region as president of the European Commission which
is the executive arm of the EU.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reaffirms Support for Lebanese Resistance Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday reiterates its
support for Lebanon's independence, territorial integrity and
national unity as well as the Lebanese resistance movement fighting
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani all made clear Tehran's stance
during their separate meetings with visiting President of the
Lebanese National Assembly Nabin Berri.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that solidarity and cohesion among the Lebanese
nation and the brave stances taken by Lebanese officials in support
of Lebanese resistance movement against the Israeli expansionist
policies are the sole way of repelling Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Tehran's readiness to contribute to Lebanon's
reconstruction and help repair civilian installations damaged in
the Israeli air raids, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a religious and nationalistic attitudes towards
Lebanese and Palestinian issues and all Iranian officials are of
the belief that the present policy on the issues should be followed
vigorously, Nouri assured his Lebanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafsanjani, who is the current chairman of the
arbitral and advisory State Expediency Council, lauded the position
of the Lebanese people and government in supporting the Lebanese
resistance movement against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran continues its support for the movement, he said, expressing
hoped for peace, tranquility and stability in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to recognize the Jewish regime, Iran has allegedly
supplied arms to the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas in their
fighting to end Israeli occupation. But Tehran always denied the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Both Nouri and Rafsanjani also called for expanding cooperation
in political, cultural, economic and parliamentary fields between
Iran and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri, who arrived here Sunday night, thanked Iran for its
principled stances towards Lebanese and Palestinian issues, calling
for expansion of mutual cooperation, especially between the two
countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Iranian officials on the latest political, military and
social developments in Lebanon, he said that his country is
determined to continue resistance and consolidate its relations
with its friends in a bid to effectively confront the expansionist
policies of the Israeli regime.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Ministers Discuss Ties, Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of China
and Russia met here Tuesday and discussed bilateral ties,
international issues, and a summit between the heads of state of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Russian
counterpart, Igor Ivanov, expressed satisfaction with the
development of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here Monday on a three-day official visit,
said the partnership has kept a sound momentum as the world moves
into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
As two powers wielding major influence, the strengthened
cooperation between China and Russia not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two countries, it is also of great
significance to the progress of a multi-polar world and the
establishment of a just and reasonable new world order, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
China would work together with Russia to promote bilateral
cooperation in various fields to a new high, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, for his part, said Tang's visit would further promote
Russian-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral relations have reached a level of mutual
trust and that both sides should make more efforts to implement
the agreements reached by the top leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov would
visit China shortly and discuss with his hosts bilateral
cooperation in the fields of politics, economy and trade. He
expressed the hope that Klebanov's trip will achieve positive
results.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China attaches great importance to Klebanov's visit
and that he believes the visit would enhance the overall
development of bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two sides base their cooperation on the spirit
of mutual trust and mutual benefit, such cooperation in specific
areas will have very bright vistas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Ivanov agreed that high-level exchanges have an
irreplaceable role in pushing forward the bilateral strategic
partnership. They exchanged views on the exchange of summit
meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Tang reiterated China's support for the
Russian government's stance on the Chechen issue and the actions
taken in fighting separatism and religious extremism in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov expressed his appreciation for China's just stance on
the Chechen issue. He repeated that Russia will unswervingly stick
to the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia supports the early reunification of China and
will cooperate with China on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Both sides voiced their resolute rejection of such arguments as
"limited sovereignty" and "humanitarian intervention," and
believed that each country should be able to choose its social
system and path of development in line with its own situation.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed other regional and
international issues and reached broad consensus. They pledged to
strengthen cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting, Tang and Ivanov signed an
agreement on the exchange of visits by citizens of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wu Tao and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Ivan Sergeyev also signed an accord on the exemption of visas for
citizens visiting as members of tourist groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A new rule aimed at
standardizing the approval procedures for residents in the Chinese
mainland visiting their relatives in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR) will go into effect in March.
</P>
<P>
A notice released today by the Ministry of Public Security says
the rule pledges to increase transparency during the approval
process, so as to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of
Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Mainland residents with immediate family studying, permanently
residing or working in the HKSAR and the MSAR are all entitled to
apply for visits to their relatives in the two regions, and the
applicants may get a permit with a one-month validity period,
according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
Applicants who plan to visit their spouses, seriously sick or
terminal patients may get three-month permits, and the same
preferential policy will apply to people under 16 or older than 60.

or more times can be exempted from providing documentation to
verify the family relationship, and those applicants under 16 or
older than 60 can receive assistance from their guardians or their
agents.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Air Quality Greatly Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The urban air quality of
Beijing has been greatly improved after three months of pollution
control efforts, according to a working conference of the Beijing
Municipal government.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months of this year, Beijing enjoyed 30
days more good air quality than in the same period last year,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide, one of the major pollutants, has continued to
drop for 12 months by 33 percent. And other pollutants including
nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and suspended particles decreased
by 8 percent, 12 percent and 4 percent respectively last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing suffered from moderate and serious pollution in 30
percent of the time of last year, 10 percentage point lower than
the previous year. And the air pollutants kept dropping in the
first month of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, environmental experts pointed out that the average
content of major pollutants in Beijing is still higher than the
national standard. And they attributed much of the air improvement

<HEADLINE> HK Internet Up-star Wins Battle for HKT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's internet up-star
Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd. (PCCW) announced Tuesday it had
reached an agreement with Cable and Wireless PLC to buy the
territory's dominant telecoms operator Cable and Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
Cyberworks, run by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's son
Richard Li, said in a statement that the terms of its offer for
HKT had been agreed by HKT's British parent, Cable and Wireless
PLC, which owns 54 percent of the HKT shares.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the offer, PCCW would pay 38.1 billion U.S.
dollars in stock, or it also offers a cash-and-stock alternative
that values Cable and Wireless HKT at 35.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merged company, to be named Pacific Century CyberWorks HKT,
will be worth about 70 billion U.S. dollars on the stock market.
Cable and Wireless PLC will retain about 20 percent of the merged
group. Other stakeholders with smaller shares will include China
Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd., CMGI Inc. and Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
The merger with HKT will strengthen PCCW's position as the
leading broadband internet company in Asia and complements the
company's overall strategy, Richard Li, chairman of PCCW, said.
</P>
<P>
"HKT provides immediate customers for our talent, services,
additional distribution platforms and accelerate PCCW's roll-out
throughout Asia," the 33-year-old chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The deal announced Tuesday still needed approval by the board
of Cable and Wireless HKT. If completed, the acquisition would be
the biggest telecommunications merger in Asia and give a huge
boost to PCCW.
</P>
<P>
It would also be a heavy blow to Singapore Telecom (Singtel),
which first offered to purchase Cable and Wireless HKT in January
this year and was hopeful to win a deal until Cyberworks joined
the race on February 11. analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Singtel pull out of the running Tuesday morning, just one night
after it announced it had joined hands with media giant Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp to enhance its chances of buying Cable and
Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
PCCW, founded nine months ago by Richard Li, is comprised of
Pacific Convergence Corporation, CyberworksVentures and the Cyber-
Port project and is mainly engaged in Internet-related investment.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's biggest communications provider with a 97
percent market share, HKT markets a full array of quality voice
and data telecommunications services backed by a state-of-the-art,
fully digital, fiber-optic network and an extensive regional
Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed the marriage between PCCW and HKT would be
beneficial to the telecoms development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed merger, Chief Secretary for Administration of
HKSAR Anson Chan said on Tuesday: "The government has no view on
which party should or should not merger with Hong Kong Telecom."
</P>
<P>
The government's concern over telecommunication services is
that "there should be a level playing field and fair competition"
and "whoever holds the license should comply with the licensing
conditions and all regulatory requirements," she said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Opposes Likud's Bill on Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Tuesday expressed his opposition to a Likud bill requiring
a special majority of registered voters in any national referendum
to approve an Israeli-Syrian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said the referendum should be free and the bill,
presented by Likud Knesset (Parliament) member Silvan Shalom,
places prior restrictions on the vote in an attempt to defeat a
possible peace deal with Syria, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
It was Weizman's first public announcement supporting the peace
process with Syria since he was under a criminal investigation over
his financial irregularities of accepting a large sum of cash gifts
from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's law, any decision by the government to
relinquish the Golan Heights, which it occupied in the 1967 Middle
East war, in exchange for a peace deal with Syria must be approved
by a vote in the Knesset and a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Shalom bill requires 50 percent plus one of all eligible
voters in a national referendum, and then at least 61 MKs in the
120-member Knesset to vote in favor for ratifying such a treaty.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the proposal presented by the government requires a
simply majority of only participants in the referendum to approve a
peace agreement instead.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has reiterated his commitment several
times to hold such a referendum once he reaches an agreement on the
negotiation table, believing that he will win a sweep victory in
the vote.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Likud faction predicted that Barak would not
got majority in the referendum, while the point was also proved by
several opinion polls recently.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said last December that if the referendum failed to
ratify an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement, he would resign. His
stand immediately elicit calls for his ousting from a number of
MKs, accusing him of incorrectly favoring one side in a critical
question which had split the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The government had accused Likud's bill of racism as it attempts
to neutralize the vote of nearly one million Israeli Arab citizens,
who are supposed to endorse any peace deal with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition held talks with Likud to bridge their gap
over the bills, but the negotiation collapsed last month. As a
result, both the government and the opposition bills are to be
brought before the Knesset in Wednesday's debate.
</P>
<P>
The government's worries about the fate of its referendum bill
aggravated Monday night because even three partners in its
coalition had expressed their support for the Likud's bill. During
a caucus held on Monday night, Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National
Religious Party, and Natan Sharansky, leader of Yisrael Ba'aliya,
had announced that their MKs will vote for the Likud's bill.
</P>
<P>
Although Eli Yishai, leader of orthodox religious party Shas,
had yet pronounced his opinion, but some Shas MKs had shown their
inclination to the Likud's bill. Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef will decide Shas's stand Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Barak is reportedly planning to convene all the coalition
leaders Wednesday morning to try to convince their support for the
government proposal.
</P>
<P>
Some analyst warned that even if the Likud's bill passed only
its preliminary reading, it would send a dangerous message to Syria
and the international community that Israel had no real intention
of peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria will hesitate much more to go back to the negotiation
table in such a situation, according to these analysts, because it
will worry that even a deal with Israel could be reached, Israel's
referendum would reject it and Syria would be seen as a peace
seeker whose outstretched hand is refused.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again earlier this year only after two
rounds of talks due to differences over Israeli troops withdrawal
form the Golan Heights.

PARIS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- France will not change its
policy of isolation toward Austria despite the resignation of the
leader of far-right Freedom Party, Joerg Haider, from his post in
the party.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said on
Tuesday that the resignation will not change France's evaluation
of or position on the coalition government in Vienna, which is
made of the Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
She also said that all the other 14 European Union countries
will maintain their decided measures against Austria, which
includes a suspension of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are targeted toward the government ... and not
the person of Mr. Haider," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Haider resigned from the presidency of Freedom Party on Monday
after the new Austrian government triggered a wave of condemnation
and protest abroad.
</P>
<P>
But the move by the Freedom Party leader is widely considered
as a tactic to alleviate the pressure on Austria.

<HEADLINE> Full-Scale Military Operation in Chechnya Ends: Russian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops Tuesday took the
town of Shatoi of the breakaway republic of Chechnya, the last
stronghold held by the rebels in the southern mountains, said the
Russian military.
</P>
<P>
Fighting for the administrative center of the Shatoi District,
situated in the center of the Argun gorge at the foothills of the
southern mountains, began in mid-February. Some 3,000 militants
were defending Shatoi in order to hold it for a long time as the
last fortress for reviving separatism.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of Shatoi made it possible for Russian troops to
remove the blockade of the Argun valley and to start clean-up
operations in the mountains, and Moscow regarded it as the end of
the large-scale military operation in Chechnya, said head of the
Russian Joint Forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
In a Tuesday interview with the Russian NTV television company,
Acting Commander of the joint forces Colonel General Gennadi
Troshev said Shatoi and other nine populated localities in the
Argun valley have been under full control of the federal troops.
</P>
<P>
He said in the coming weeks the federal units will chase and
destroy small rebel groups who are trying to break through the
encirclement.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the federal troops won't withdraw from the
highland areas of Chechnya. "They will stage clean-up operations
in populated settlements, combing villages, forests, mountains and
gorges as many times as it is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the headquarters of the Russian federal forces in
the Northern Caucasus said that Chechen rebel leaders, including "
Chechen President" Aslan Maskhadov and rebel field commanders
Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduyev, have escaped from Shatoi into
the mountains.

<HEADLINE> China to Build First Dinosaur Park in Yunnan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- China will build the country's
first dinosaur park displaying fossils of a variety of dinosaurs
which lived between 150 to 180 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 60-million-yuan park, covering 13 hectares, will be built
on the site where the bones were excavated in Lufeng County,
dubbed the "hometown of dinosaurs" in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Lufeng County acquired its nickname after fossils of 80
dinosaurs were unearthed on a 60,000-square-meter pit at Dawa
Township in 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The local government is working with the Shanghai Nature Museum
on design plans and investment potential from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Recent excavation in the county led to discovery of a 10,000-
square-meter area containing fossils of numerous dinosaurs, some
of which have been exposed to the open air.
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhiming, a leading paleontologist on dinosaur research,
inferred that the area is a huge "graveyard of dinosaurs."
</P>
<P>
Keith Rigy, an American dinosaur expert who has visited
Chuanjie on five occasions, estimates that there may be 400 to 500
dinosaurs fossils in the Chuanjie area.

"Chuanjie has now passed Utah in the United States and Zigong
in southwest China's Sichuan Province to become the largest burial
ground of dinosaurs in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the recent excavation, Chinese archeologists unearthed
fossils of eight dinosaurs, which lay crisscross over a 220-square-
meter area of mountain slope in Chuanjie. A 20-meter long
carnivore was found on top of a seven-meter-long herbivore -- the
natural enemy of the carnivore.
</P>
<P>
"It is rare that the two kinds of dinosaurs died together,"
said Pan Shigang, an official with the Lufeng Dinosaur Museum.
</P>
<P>
The burial ground shows obvious signs of being a lake in
ancient times, Pan said, and so the dinosaurs were likely washed
together by the water after they died or were killed during
dinosaur attacks.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 120 dinosaurs dating back to the early or middle
Jurassic Period have been excavated in Lufeng County.
</P>
<P>
"It is unprecedented in both China and elsewhere in the world
that dinosaurs of the early and middle Jurassic Period were found
in the same region," said Fang Xiaosi, a researcher with the China
Geology Museum.
</P>
<P>
"The new discovery is of vital importance to the study of the
evolution and migration of dinosaur in both the early Jurassic
period and middle Jurassic Period," Professor Dong Zhiming said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Security Sets Off Hot Discussion in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On or near February 8, when major web sites such as Yahoo and
Amazon in the U.S. were temporarily shut down by hackers, China's
Sino.com also faced a similar assault.
</P>
<P>
But the vulnerability of the Internet has also created a large
market for security products. A new network software security
system was developed recently at Xi'an Communication University.
The system, entirely the brainchild of Chinese computer experts,
has been approved by the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Internet security companies are also coming to the
country. RSA Security Inc, a major international security software
and consulting company, set up its first Chinese office in Beijing
on Monday. Its security product, RSA SecurityID/ACE, has also been
approved for sale in China.
</P>
<P>
Tom Schuster, RSA's vice-chairman in charge of global marketing,
said that China is a very interesting and very important market
for Internet security, as the country is developing so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that by the end of this year, the demand for
network security products in the country will increase by 100
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Hack attacks on major web
sites in the United States and China this month have set off
spirited discussions among China's information-watchers.
</P>
<P>
"The attacks tell us that our network is still vulnerable and
it tells us that we have a lot of work to do," said an official
from the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is now busy making new rules to govern computer
network and information security management. The development of
security software has also been put high on the list of an
information industry development plan.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, China has witnessed rapid development in its
information industry. By the end of 1999, China had 8.9 million
computers linked to Internet and the figure is expected to double
this year.
</P>
<P>
But the country's network security technology drags far behind.
A recent survey conducted by a security corporation shows that
more than 90 percent of China's e-commerce web sites have security
problems.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Public Security also noted
that the number of hacking cases is increasing in China at a
annual rate of 30 percent. In 1999, the country dealt with several
hundred hack attacks.

BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua)-- The following are highlights of
China's diplomatic news items today:
</P>
<P>
Military Leaders Meet U.S. Pacific Commander
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian stressed today during a
meeting with Dennis Blair, commander-in-chief of the pacific
command of the United States armed forces, that China's basic
policy toward the Taiwan issue remains "peaceful reunification and
'one country, two systems'", but that China will never commit
itself to giving up the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the white paper "The One-China Principle and the
Taiwan Issue" had made clear the consistent stand of the Chinese
government toward the issue of Taiwan and reflected the common
aspiration of the entire Chinese people. The reunification cause
of China is irreversible, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Blair's delegation marks the first senior U.S. military
delegation to officially visit China since the U.S.-led NATO
bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last May.
</P>
<P>
Blair reiterated that the two countries share common interest
in maintaining peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region
and even the whole world. He also stated that U.S. will stick to
the One-China policy.
</P>
<P>
-- Fu Quanyou, Chief of the General Staff of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) of China, warned today while meeting with
Blair that the U.S. government should not let the Sino-U.S.
relations and bilateral military ties which have shown a trend of
resumption and improvement suffer from setbacks once again.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that Sino-U.S. relations is now at an important period
which faces both opportunities for improvement and development,
and problems calling for urgent and proper handling, and the
Taiwan issue is a key one.
</P>
<P>
 FM Spokesman on U.S. Human Rights Report
</P>
<P>
-- It is entirely unjustified for the U.S. State Department to
make allegations, regardless of the fact, about the human rights
situation in Hong Kong in its annual human rights report, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the U.S. report, Zhu said that it has
met with criticism from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) government and people from all walks of life in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fact generally recognized by the international
community and it is most inappropriate for the U.S. to make
uninvited remarks on and unwarranted interference in Hong Kong's
internal affairs," Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
"We express our firm opposition to that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Women Encouraged to Help Develop Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF) today called on women from all walks of life in
the country to help with the enormous undertaking of developing
western China.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF will launch several projects to improve the life of
women in western areas which include building 1,000 schools for
rural women, helping 1,000 female farmers become better-off by
using advanced agricultural technology, and training 1,000 women
officials at county or township levels.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of developing areas in western China put forward
by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party provides
not only an opportunity for the economic growth and social
progress in western China but also a good chance for the
development of women's life in the area, said Gu Xiulian, vice-
president of the ACWF.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that women in western China should be active in the
construction and development of the region, while women in eastern
China should also lend a helping hand to the economic and
scientific development in western China.
</P>
<P>
The women's federations in both Beijing and Shanghai will
organize female scientific workers, entrepreneurs, college
students and women from other social circles to give suggestions
and advice for the construction in western China and send some
volunteers to work there.

<HEADLINE> China Initiates Bird Protection Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- An annual campaign to raise
public awareness for the need to protect birds was initiated today
near east China's Poyang Lake nature reserve, a major habitat of
migratory birds of the country.
</P>
<P>
The week-long bird-lovers activity has been held for 19 years,
however, China has not thoroughly wiped out illegal poaching and
trading of birds, acknowledged a Chinese official in charge of
wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
"Some offenders still shoot wild birds to sell to restaurants,"
said Wang Fuxing, secretary-general of the Chinese Association for
Wildlife Protection. But he also stressed that the illegal
practice has been curbed since the State Forestry Administration
issued an urgent order asking for more vigilant protection.
</P>
<P>
In the Poyang Lake area, crackdowns upon bird poaching are
underway since shootings of swans were revealed and triggered the
concern of the government of Jiangxi Province late last year.

<HEADLINE> HKTA Outlines Tourism Vision For 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Continued growth in visitor
arrivals is expected in 2000, with a forecast increase of 6.8
percent over 1999 to around 11.4 million, Amy Chan, executive
director of the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing, Chan said priority would be strong
marketing of the diversity of Hong Kong's attractions in incentive,
convention, exhibition, business and inland markets in the future.
</P>
<P>
HKTA's plans for 2000 and beyond are a vision shared with the
Commission on Strategic Development, as outlined in the document
Bring the Vision to Life, said Chan.
</P>
<P>
She said HKTA has established three key platforms for 2000 --
to promote Hong Kong as the pre-eminent international and
cosmopolitan city in Asia, as the preferred gateway to the Chinese
inland areas and other parts of Asia, and as the entertainment,
media and events capital of the region.
</P>
<P>
While 75 percent of visitors are currently from Asia, a more
balanced ratio would be needed in order for Hong Kong to maintain
its reputation as a truly international city, she noted, adding
that HKTA would shift its marketing resources accordingly, with
particular emphasis directed at the North American and European
markets.
</P>
<P>
To cater to these markets, HKTA has embarked on a series of
global media alliances, such as the National Geographic, to attain
a broader reach and to deliver fresh aspects of the City of Life
program launched to promote Hong Kong through television, print
and Internet.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese mainland that is one of the most important
markets of Hong Kong, HKTA will also establish closer partnerships
with provinces such as Yunnan and Sichuan and cities such as
Beijing and Guilin.
</P>
<P>
Chan said Hong Kong must also have in view the need to raise
service standards and develop new skills to meet the challenges
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Since the Quality Tourism Services scheme was launched last
year, over 166 retail and food beverage outlets representing 400
stores have applied to participate in the scheme, she added.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't Gains 86.8 Mln Dollars At Land Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Three government lots were
sold for a total of 677.2 million HK dollars (about 86.8 million U.
S. dollars) at a public auction held by the Lands Department of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The land auction, which is the last one in the 1999/2000 fiscal
year, consisted of two lots designated for private residential
purposes on the Hong Kong Island and one for non-industrial uses
on Lantau Island of the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Peak of the Hong Kong Island, the 13,570-square-
meter luxury site was the focus of the bidding and was sold for
490 million HK dollars (about 62.8 million U.S. dollars), 40
percent higher than the opening bid of 350 million HK dollars (
about 44.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second lot, which is about 880.8 square meters at Shau Kei
Wan on the Hong Kong Island, was sold for 170 million HK dollars (
about 21.8 million U.S. dollars). The opening bid was 110 million
HK dollars (about 14.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The third site on Lantau Island of the New Territories was sold
for 17.2 million HK dollars (about 2.2 million U.S. dollars), 2.8
times as much as the opening bid of 6 million HK dollars (about
769,230 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the results were within the market expectation
and investors are optimistic about a stable property market.
</P>
<P>
The site on Lantau Island, which was considered the most
successful deal at the auction, reflects investors' confidence
about the prospects of tourist development, they added.
</P>
<P>
The auction drew participation of mainly small and medium-sized
developers, while large developers are preparing for the future
land auctions as the government is expected to put more land on
sale in following fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
Acting Secretary for Planning and Lands Patrick Lau Lai-chiu on
Tuesday announced the Land Sale Program from April 2000 to March
2001, and the Land Development Program from April 2001 to March
2005.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months from April 2000 to March 2001, public
auctions and tenders will be conducted according to a land sale
timetable to make available a total of 16 hectares of land for
private housing, 6 hectares for the Private Sector Participation
Scheme (PSPS) and 0.5 hectare for non-housing uses.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 16 hectares of land for private housing and 9
hectares for non-housing uses will be available for application in
the same period. Another 69 hectares of land will be available for
disposal by way of private treaty, comprising 58 hectares for
private housing and 11 hectares for non-housing uses.
</P>
<P>
"Altogether, 90 hectares of land for private housing will be
available for disposal in 2000/2001, compared with 52 hectares in
1999/2000," Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Land Development Program for the four years from
April 2001 to March 2005, 333 hectares for private housing will be
available.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Declares 2000 As Year of OFWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- In recognition of the pivotal
role played by the country's migrant workers in strengthening the
economy, Philippine President Joseph Estrada has declared 2000 as
the Year of the Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs).
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said Tuesday that Estrada issued a
proclamation before he left for Mindanao, the southern Philippines,
hailing the OFWs as the country's modern-day heroes "because of
their exemplary qualities of hard work, determination and self-
sacrifice."
</P>
<P>
He said that OFWs deserve to be recognized and honored for all
these qualities, as well as for their effective role and
contribution to the Philippines' efforts towards globalization.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon all government agencies, concerned non-
governmental organizations and the citizenry to lend their full
support and cooperation in the observance of the year of overseas
Filipino workers," Estrada said in his proclamation.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said OFWs play a "very important role" in reinforcing
the country's foreign currency reserves by way of remitting
portions of their dollar earnings into the country's banking
system.
</P>
<P>
This "alleviates the economic turbulence being experienced" by
the Philippines as a result of the world's ever changing economic
pattern, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's OFWs, he added, also significantly contributed to
helping the Philippines hurdle the Asian financial crisis through
their annual dollar remittances.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Hopes to Learn From China in Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government said
that it hopes to learn from China in fighting corruption among
government officials and sensitizing the general public in the
same field.
</P>
<P>
Miria Matembe, Ugandan Minister of Ethics and Integrity, made
the remarks here on Tuesday afternoon when meeting with a
five-member delegation from the Chinese Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation headed by Secretary-General of Ministry
of Supervision Yuan Chunqing arrived here Monday for a five-day
visit to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Matembe said that the two countries have different systems in
fighting corruption, but they can exchange their experience in the
field by enhancing exchange visits. She stressed that Uganda is
determined to uproot rampant corruption through concerted efforts
by relevant ministries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Yuan introduced China's experience and
achievement in fighting corruption and in enhancing public
awareness about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is ranked one of the most corrupt countries in the world
by Transparency International and more than 100 million U.S.
dollars, some 15 percent of the government's annual revenue, is
embezzled by corrupt officials each year.

<HEADLINE> EU Not to Change its Position on Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Tuesday that its position on Austria had not changed in the
wake of the resignation of Joerg Haider as the chief of Austria's
far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman said that the commission still shares
the concerns as demonstrated by Austria's 14 European Union (EU)
partners and the commission will continue to watch how the new
Austrian coalition government behaves.
</P>
<P>
"The commission's position has been consistent throughout,"
said the spokesman, who added that the commission will live up to
its expectation of serving as the guardian of the European Union
treaties.
</P>
<P>
The commission has earlier told Austria that no basic
principles of the treaties should be breached.
</P>
<P>
The same spokesman said that it was not up to the commission,
though the executive body of the 15-nation European Union, to
advise Austria what to do as an exit from the current political
plight.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen other EU members joined hands in isolating Austria
when Austria's new coalition government dominated by Haider's far-
right Freedom Party took power on February 4.
</P>
<P>
Haider, known for his non-tolerant and pro-nazism comments,
announced late on Monday the handover of the leadership of the
Freedom Party to Susanne Riess-Passer.
</P>
<P>
Riess-Passer is now serving as the vice-chancellor of the
Austrian coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Though not a member of the cabinet, Haider was the one who had
signed the preamble of the coalition government on behalf of the
Freedom Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
expressed surprise on Tuesday at U.S. opposition to its German
candidate for the post of International Monetary Fund (IMF)
managing director.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Solbes, EU monetary affairs commissioner, said that it
came as a surprise what the Americans said about Caio Koch-Weser
not having the right qualifications.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense," said the commissioner, "He is very
experienced."
</P>
<P>
Solbes said the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation EU, would continue supporting the choice of Koch-Weser
as the EU candidate for the top IMF job.
</P>
<P>
At a European council meeting on Monday, EU finance ministers
unanimously agreed to back Koch-Weser for the post as IMF managing
director.
</P>
<P>
Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister, declared his bid
to replace the outgoing Michel Camdessus at the IMF helm three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Competing with Koch-Weser for the top IMF job are two other
candidates -- the IMF's acting managing director Stanley Fischer
and Japanese finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara.
</P>
<P>
The executive board of the IMF met on Tuesday in Washington for
an informal discussion on the candidates before appointing the
managing director.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Rescue Plan Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- One of the smaller pro-peace
agreement parties in Northern Ireland's suspended assembly has
launched a plan aimed at rescuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The cross-community Alliance Party is urging all pro-agreement
parties to join together to call on all paramilitary groups to
make concessions on the arms issue, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The party's six-point plan involves all of the pro-agreement
parties re-committing themselves to the Good Friday Agreement
signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
It called the paramilitary groups to renounce violence and
renew the talks with the disarmament commission, and also urged
normalization measures by the security forces, end of the
assembly's suspension and a day of reconciliation for republicans
and loyalists to start decommissioning their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been presented to the British, Irish and U.S.
governments.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing executive set up last December was suspended
on February 11 due to the impasse over paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
Alliance deputy leader Seamus Close said he believed that the
plan would relieve the pressure on Sinn Fein and strengthen its
hand in convincing the Irish Republican Army to return to talks
with the disarmament commission headed by General John de
Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
"This would show that no party had a special responsibility,
and would also be a tremendous confidence-building measure," the
Lagan Valley assembly member said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Fiscal 2000 Budget Approved By Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives,
or lower house, on Tuesday approved a record-high 84.99 trillion
yen (770.9 billion U.S. dollars) national budget for the fiscal
year of 2000, featuring measures designed to get Japan's economy
back to sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
The budget is certain to be enacted before the current fiscal
year ends on March 31 as the Japanese constitution rules that the
budget will automatically become law 30 days after the passage by
the lower house passage, even if the House of Councillors fails to
approve it.
</P>
<P>
The general-account budget for the year starting April 1, which
was submitted to the Diet (parliament) on January 28, was approved
by a majority vote with the support of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and its two coalition partners, the Liberal
Party (LP) and New Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
The budget features a 2.6-percent expansion in general
expenditures to a record 48,091.4 billion yen (436.2 billion
dollars) in funding public works and other policy-oriented
projects.
</P>
<P>
The expansionary fiscal policy is designed to meet the Japanese
government's economic growth target of 1.0 percent in real terms
in fiscal 2000, which will be the second straight year of growth.
The government has voiced confidence that it will be able to
attain its goal of 0.6-percent growth for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
To help fund the budget, the Japanese government will have to
float a record 85.87 trillion yen (778.9 billion dollars) in bonds
during fiscal 2000.

<HEADLINE> Japan's January Unemployment Rate Stands at 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate for January
stood at a seasonally adjusted 4.7 percent, unchanged from the
revised figure for last December, the Management and Coordination
Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for men was 4.8 percent, 0.1 percent down over
last December, while that for women rose 0.1 percent to 4.5
percent in the month, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed Japanese increased by 110,000 from
last December to 3.09 million, rising above three million for the
first time in three months.
</P>
<P>
The agency, taking into account such elements as seasonal
factors, adjusted the jobless rates for June and July 1999 to 4.8
percent, rather than 4.9 percent, which was the worst rate ever
recorded in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Ministry said in a separate report that
the ratio of job providers to job seekers in January stood at 0.52,
or 52 job providers for every 100 job seekers.
</P>
<P>
It was a rise from the 0.50 registered in December, marking the
third consecutive month of improvement.
</P>
<P>
The report said the number of people forced out of their jobs
due to bankruptcy or restructuring reached 1.01 million, an
increase of 10,000 compared with the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the employment statistics, Japanese Labor Minister
Takamori Makino said while the labor situation continued to be
severe, there were also a few bright signs including the increase
in overtime hours.

<HEADLINE> WWF Expert Confirms Traces of South China Tigers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) today confirmed the credibility of traces of
South China tigers found in the eastern and southern region of
China and explained why sightings of the most endangered tiger
species have become more frequent.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yu Changqing, director in charge of species and nature
reserve projects in WWF's China Program Office in Beijing, told
Xinhua today that the tiger trace reports in Hunan, Zhejiang and
Jiangxi provinces this year are credible, because they were proved
by Chinese wildlife experts with such scientific methods as
molecular genetic testing and DNA analysis of tiger droppings and
tiger hair.
</P>
<P>
He said that tigers become more daring when searching for food
in the spring, when food is hard to find and young tigers are
searching for mates.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, no living South China tigers
have been found in China since 1955, although there are 52 in
captivity. However, traces of the tigers in their natural habitats
in south China suggest that some 20-30 are living in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The more advanced methods used to identify their traces have
certainly aided the search for South China tigers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lei Guangchun, another WWF expert, said it is easier to
spot tigers in the spring, because foliage where tigers are likely
to live is dry and sparse. The tigers' roars, which in the spring
are often mating calls, could also reveal their existence in
mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
The foundation plans to join with the Chinese Forestry
Administration to conduct a national investigation to locate the
remaining South China tigers.
</P>
<P>
The program, slated for March, will be based on experience from
WWF's cooperation with China in a Giant Panda Rescue Program,
which successfully rescued rare wildlife. WWF will help introduce
funding and advanced expertise for the program.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest environmental organization, WWF started
its China programs in 1980, initially committed to the protection
of the giant panda. Its efforts have been gradually extended to
other programs such as the protection of wetlands and tropical
forests in China.
</P>
<P>
WWF recently gave priority to improving public awareness on
environmental protection in China. It noted that sightings of
tiger traces in recent years were all reported by local residents
in nature reserves.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Expand Flower Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will enlarge its planting area of flower industry to 66,
667 hectares in the next five years to achieve greater economic
efficiency from the sector.
</P>
<P>
A local official explained that as people's living standard
improves, the demand for fresh flowers has kept climbing rapidly
in China. Farmers in the province grew some 20,000 hectares of
flowers last year, and the output value was estimated at three
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has a mild climate all the year round and is frost-
free for the whole year, which has constituted Guangdong's
advantageous condition in growing flowers.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in this southern Chinese province all have a
tradition in growing and loving flowers. The recorded history of
flower growing in the province can be dated back to 111 years B.C
when people from Chencun of Shunde started to grow potted oranges
and flowers to greet the lunar Spring Festival -- an occasion for
family reunions.
</P>
<P>
After many years of development, flower growing has become a
professional industry which attracts overseas investors and
tourists alike, and spurs development of other businesses centered
on flowers.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the province is now home to 305
overseas-financed flower companies which have attracted about 300
million U.S. dollars of investment from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Many rural areas, which used to be very poor, have grown into a
galaxy of specialized centers in cultivating flowers and become
prosperous. Chinese and overseas tourists to Guangdong scramble
for having a look at the splendor of large number of flowers grown
at the centers.
</P>
<P>
Different kinds of scientific flower research organizations
have also mushroomed across the province.
</P>
<P>
Fresh and potted flowers grown by the province are sold to
different corners of China by air and are exported to more than
100 countries and regions. The Netherlands, the world's leading
fresh flower producer, imports more than 10 million U.S. dollars
worth of potted flowers from Guangdong each year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province earned well over 100 million U.S.
dollars from exporting flowers, accounting for a half of the
country's total flower exports, said the local sources.

<HEADLINE> No Mandate for Sterilization in Tibet: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China has never infringed upon or
restrained women's rights to give birth, said the director of the
Regional Family Planning Commission today.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet has no policy that sets a quota for the number of
children Tibetan women may have, nor does it force women to have
abortions or undergo sterilization procedures," Purbu Zhoima said
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a recent distorted report in the overseas media
about Tibet's family planning policy, Purbu Zhoima said, "It is
ridiculous for the media to say that Tibet has a policy to force
women to abort or to be sterilized."
</P>
<P>
Of course, the government advocates a birth control policy in
Tibet, but there are different rules for different groups of
people, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing family planning policy in Tibet, married
couples of the Han nationality who are officials or employed in
Tibet should follow the one-child policy. Tibetan officials and
employees are encouraged to bear and rear fewer children; two-
child families are regarded as standard in cities.
</P>
<P>
There is no family planning policy for Tibetan herdsmen, she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, more and more Tibetan women in the
countryside now choose to have two or three children, while the
educated women prefer having one child.
</P>
<P>
There are some changes in the concept of having children among
Tibetan women, she said, adding that Tibetan people now appreciate
the regulations for birth and fertility.
</P>
<P>
Dixing, a 45-year-old women in the rural area of Nedong County
of Shannan Prefecture, has 11 children. She said that the burden
caused by such a large family is nearly unbearable.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhin, a 25-year-old official with the Lhasa City Taxation
Bureau, said, "As a Tibetan, I enjoy the right to have more
children than the Han people, but I am reluctant to have more than
one or two children in the future as I want to improve the quality
of my life."
</P>
<P>
An official of the State Family Planning Commission in Beijing
said the family planning policy is also expected to be carried out
among the ethnic people, but the birth policy for them is more
lenient than that for the Han people.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic people living in frontier regions and the areas with
harsh natural conditions can have three or more children, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to 1998 statistics, there are 514,200 married women
of childbearing age in Tibet, 36.29 percent of whom have three or
more children.

here today with an Israeli delegation headed by Ran Cohen, Israeli
Minister of Industry and Trade, and the two co-chaired the 3rd
Conference of China-Israel Mixed Committee on Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic ties between China and Israel have seen
sound and speedy development since the two countries established

</P>
<P>
Cooperation in areas of trade, technology, investment and labor
service has maintained stable growth, Shi said. He hoped that
businesses of the two countries would explore more ways to expand
the range of bilateral trade and investment, scientific
cooperation and labor service cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that Israel has been interested in expanding trade
relations with China, adding that a major task of his Chinese tour
is to strengthen existing trade links.
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that Israel firmly supports China's bid to enter
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
During the 3rd Conference of the China-Israel Mixed Committee
on Trade and Economic Cooperation, discussions will be held on
three separate areas, agriculture, medicine and medical science,

<HEADLINE> China's Policy on Taiwan Issue Consistent: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
reiterated that the solution of the Taiwan issue can not be
delayed indefinitely, and that the position of the Chinese
Government hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen made the remarks while speaking at an
annual meeting of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas
Chinese held here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian denied any change in the government's policy on the Taiwan
issue, referring to some foreign reports that China's policy on
solving the Taiwan issue has been changed following the issuing of
the white paper titled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan
Issue".
</P>
<P>
"This is wrong," Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There is no change in the policy of "peaceful reunification and
one country, two systems" nor is there any change in the eight-
point proposition put forward by President Jiang Zemin, Qian
stressed, adding that these have been expressed clearly in the
white paper.
</P>
<P>
The solving of the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed indefinitely,
and this is China's consistent position and not anything new, Qian
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As early as in October 1984, Qian said, the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We adhere to seeking the solution of
the Taiwan issue by peaceful means, we have never given up the
possibility of using non-peaceful means, and we cannot make such a
commitment. What can we do if the Taiwan Authorities will never
talk with us? Can we give up national reunification?"
</P>
<P>
The recently-issued white paper titled "The One-China Principle
and the Taiwan Issue" was aimed at "pushing forward the
development of the cross-straits relations and urging the Taiwan
Authorities to sit down to hold talks and negotiations with us,"
Qian said.

<HEADLINE> New Rules for Procuratorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Han Zhubin, procurator-general
of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, announced here today 10 new
rules meant to keep the procuratorates clean and cost-conscious.
</P>
<P>
Though the overall quality of the country's procurators has
been improved in recent years, a lot still needs to be done to
meet the demands of the Party and the people, Han said.
</P>
<P>
The new rules forbid procurators from leaking information to or
seeking it from interested parties, or interfering in cases
involving them.
</P>
<P>
Procurators are not allowed to attend banquets or entertainment
activities, accept gifts, or use vehicles or telecommunication
devices from interested parties, according to the principles.
</P>
<P>
In addition, procurators are also forbidden from drinking in
uniform in public places, engaging in business or seeking business
interests for family members and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Procurators and procuratorates at all levels should strictly
abide by the principles, Han said at a national procuratorial
meeting here. Violators will be sacked, Han added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 694 procurators of the country were
investigated for rule-breaking. Some 544 procurators faced
disciplinary measures, and 55 were sent to judicial departments to
handle.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
sailed smoothly through the leap year computer bug, the municipal
government announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Public utilities, hospitals, transportation and
telecommunication sectors and other enterprises started reporting
to the city's millennium computer emergency center at 00:20 (local
time) today no glitches in computer operations.
</P>
<P>
The reports indicated that computers at all the sites shifted
smoothly from February 28 to 29, officials at the center said.
</P>
<P>
By 18:30, the center had received only two reports from
individuals that their personal computers encountered problems due
to wrong timing.
</P>
<P>
Early February 29 and March 1 are two sensitive times when
computers might fail to recognize February 29, 2000, and cause
problems, said Gao Zhichao, an engineer of the center.
</P>
<P>
However, early March 1 poses much less danger for computer foul-
ups than February 29, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the center announced that so-called millennium bug
of computers has largely been tackled in the city.
</P>
<P>
From now on, it will focus on minor computer mishaps, such as
bugs in application programs that computer users may encounter.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Newspapers Demand Israeli Commitment to Golan Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspapers on Tuesday
played down Israel's admission of a pledge made by former prime
minister Yitzhak Rabin to withdraw from occupied Syrian territory,
demanding an explicit commitment from Israel toward peace.
</P>
<P>
The official Tishrin (October) daily said in a commentary that
despite its significance, Rabin's pledge may not help revive the
Mideast peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks unless it
is committed by the current Israeli government and accompanied by
tangible actions.
</P>
<P>
The paper said political observers suspect that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's confession of the existence of Rabin's pledge
might be a manoeuvre aimed to mitigate Arab anger over the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials, including Barak, admitted Monday former
Israeli governments since that of Rabin have acknowledged the
principle of complete pullout from the Golan Heights which it
seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the disclosure, the paper said "the ambiguous and
mysterious statements do not convince anyone in Damascus or Beirut
or other Arab capitals" unless Barak's government is serious to
turn the pledge into reality.
</P>
<P>
Another official daily, Al Thawrah (Revolution), said the
revelation is still defect and incomplete unless it is accompanied
by a clear-cut Israeli commitment to halt to aggression.
</P>
<P>
Al Baath (Rejuvenation), daily of the ruling Socialist Arab
Party, said Rabin's pledge is an essential condition that Israel
should carry out to create the suitable circumstances for resuming
the stalled Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have been postponed indefinitely after
two rounds of talks held in December and January, due to Damascus
insistence that Israel make a promise to return the Golan and
withdraw to the June 4, 1967 border line.

<HEADLINE> Policemen Charged of Attacking Student Dorms Stand Trial in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's military court on Tuesday
started open trial of the policemen who were charged of attacking
students in the Tehran University dormitory last July.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Tehran Military Prosecutor Houshang Eqbal accused 20
police commanders and personnel of attacking student dorms and
beating students, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accused included former Tehran police commander Brigadier
General Farhad Nazari and commander of the special unit of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Colonel Jamshid
Khodabakhshi.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 20 accused, eight were from the IRGC special unit and
nine from the security forces or armed police, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Eqbal underlined the entry of policemen into a university
dormitory requires prior permission from the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot policemen stormed Tehran University dormitory on July
8 following a student protest against the approval of a bill by the
Majlis (parliament) to amend the country's press law with an aim to
tightening restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian Supreme National Security Council,
three people, including a civilian opponent, a police officer and a
conscript of the IRGC were shot by bullets in the incident. The
conscript died in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The police attack, without prior permission from the Interior
Ministry, triggered a week-long nationwide protest and political
disturbance in the country, the worst since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reformists have stated the attack was pre-arranged and
politically motivated with an aim to cracking down the freedom-
seeking movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rahami, an attorney for the Tehran University and
students, said at the hearing session that commander Nazari said
before the attack that he had predicted the incident.
</P>
<P>
"It may safely be concluded that the attack on the dormitory was
pre-arranged and was waiting only for an excuse to justify it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rahami also called for an investigation into the assaults by
some civilians on students during the incident, saying that there
were some people who coordinated the civilian elements to work with
the military forces and had dispatched them to the dormitory to
beat up students.
</P>
<P>
He believed that there was a coordinating center behind the
dormitory beating. "In less than 24 hours after the incident, 204
students were arrested, some of whom were beaten," he added.
</P>
<P>
The attorney noted that in addition to the illegal entry of the
police into the dormitory, the accused also set fire on several
rooms, destroyed students' belongings and threw out a student from
the third floor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some foreign students were also beaten and
injured, and were later forced to take refuge in their respective
embassies.
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate incident destroyed the image of the Islamic
republic both inside and outside the country," Rahami said.
</P>
<P>
The next hearing on the case will be held on March 4.

<HEADLINE> Australia Plans to Export Bamboo Shoots to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 29 (Xinhua) "Supplying bamboo shoots to Asia?
At first glance it may seem like supplying coal to Newcastle." It
is a lead of a report of AAP Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle is a city in New South Wales state of Australia and
famous as a coal mine.
</P>
<P>
According to the report ,a man named as Victor Cusack formed
his Bamboo Plantations of Australia Ltd (BPA) and planned to raise
35.58 million U.S. dollars to establish the first large commercial
bamboo plantation in the Southern Hemisphere and supply fresh
bamboo shoots out of season to Asian, American, Canadian and
European, as well as Australian markets.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 percent of the world's population consume edible
bamboo shoots, Cusack said, adding that currently in Asia,
consumers paid high prices for fresh shoots out of season and
resorted to tinned shoots or dried shoots as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
"Prices for fresh shoots are going up to around 62 U.S. cents a
kilo and we can supply at prices the same as or less than that,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, people consumed around 35,000 tonnes and
in Australia around 8,000 tonnes, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Fortune-seeking through
armed banditry is surfacing in the Somali capital Mogadishu and
Middle Shabelleh region, causing havoc for both the business and
humanitarian activities.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen attacked the headquarters of Al-Barakat
Telecommunications Company in Jowhar town of Middle Shabelleh
region on Monday night, killing one of the security guards.
</P>
<P>
A source in Jowhar, 90 kilometers north of Mogadishu, told
Xinhua on Tuesday morning that the gunmen have taken away 9,000
U.S. dollars and two million Somali shillings (some 200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main child and maternity hospital of Mogadishu,
SOS, has been attacked by quite a large number of gunmen from the
Sarur subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
According to security guards of the hospital, dozens of gunmen
equipped with automatic assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades
and hand bombs have attacked the hospital with the aim of taking
control of the compound.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people from the two sides were wounded, five
from the SOS security guards and three from the perpetrators of
the attack belonging to the Sarur subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the area said the attacking gunmen were
repulsed back after the security guards of the hospital resisted
the attack and later on made a tactful counter-attack which foiled
the attempts of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The area of the hospital was tense on Tuesday morning despite
the deployment of Islamic court militiamen in the area following
Monday night's fighting.
</P>
<P>
There has been no central government in the Horn of Africa
country since 1991. And the Somali people are crying for peace
and reconciliation in the country haunted by civil strife.

<HEADLINE> Lloyd Threatens to Take Legal Action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former Davis Cup
captain David Lloyd threatened on Tuesday to take legal action
against the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) for slander after he was
sacked for allegedly affecting team morale.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report, Lloyd, who was replaced on Monday
by former Wimbledon semifinalist Roger Taylor after publicly
criticizing two of his players, said: "That is a direct slander on
my character and future. They said my team had no spirit and no
morale."
</P>
<P>
"I will not stand by and let people make incorrect accusations.
</P>
<P>
"As far I am concerned we had fantastic team spirit and
fantastic team morale and that what's my future in life is all
about.
</P>
<P>
"If that's been put into jeopardy then I will take action.
There are no two ways about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
After Britain had been beaten 4-1 by the Czech Republic in
their world group tie this month, Lloyd said second string players
Arvind Parmar and Jamie Delgado were not fit enough to compete at
international level.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was the LTA's job to deliver players to him in
a fit condition.
</P>
<P>
LTA chief executive John Crowther said on Monday Lloyd had been
dismissed for his public criticism of the team and "the
unnecessary adverse affect these had on players and coaches
connected to the Davis Cup squad".
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Crowther said former British number one Jeremy Bates
would coach the Davis Cup squad under Taylor's guidance.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> NBA Fines Ostertag and Smith for Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Utah Jazz center Greg
Ostertag and Portland Trail Blazers guard Steve Smith were fined
by the NBA on Monday for getting into a scuffle during Sunday's
game at the Rose Garden in Portland.
</P>
<P>
Ostertag was hit with a 7,500 U.S. dollars fine and Smith 3,000
U.S. dollar for the altercation. The heavier penalty levied
against the Utah centre was for kicking the ball into the stands
following his ejection from the game.
</P>
<P>
With 5:12 to play in Portland's 101-92 win, Ostertag and Smith
became tangled up in a battle for a loose ball and the much larger
Jazz centre would not let go, prompting some shoving and flailing.
</P>
<P>
"This is a heated rivalry," Ostertag said. "Both teams play
hard trying to get a win. This stuff happens."

<HEADLINE> Sick Siberian Tiger Regains Appetite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Meimei, the sick female
Siberian tiger who fell ill after eating poisonous meat, has
regained her appetite, zoo-keepers say.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday morning when she first regained appetite, she ate
one kilo of fresh beef and drank two kilos of water after being
hospitalized for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianhua, the zoo-keeper at the Shenyang Zoo, said that "
Meimei's recovery is just a miracle." However, this doesn't mean
that Meimei is out of danger. Vets are keeping a close eye on the
tiger.
</P>
<P>
Meimei's medical record shows that she has been suffering from
stomach problems over the past two years. The poisonous meat was
the last straw.
</P>
<P>
Poisonous frozen meat caused two female tigers, Duoduo and
Meimei, to contract food poisoning on February 10. Duoduo died
and Meimei went into a coma.
</P>
<P>
Meimei was an present from the U.S. government. Since the late
1980s, she has given birth to ten tiger cubs.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are among the top ten most endangered species
in the world. There are only around 300 remaining in the wild. The
Shenyang Zoo has bred and raised 13 Siberian tigers. One of the
tigers had a cesarean which attracted nationwide publicity.

<P>
CHENGDU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Public Security Bureau of
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, recently
simplified its exit and entry procedures as part of the measures
to speed up economic growth in western China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens who are going abroad from Chengdu need only
show their valid exit-entry certificates or visa. In-coming
foreign investors and Taiwan compatriots who are on business trips
will be allowed to enter and go through required procedures
afterward.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the local government has put an end to the old
practice of asking for flight schedules from aviation companies in
countries granting visa-free access to China. They may go through
entry-exit procedures after the border inspection department
affixes the seal to the contract.
</P>
<P>
Shuangliu Airport in Chengdu, the largest international airport
in western China, has handled 20,000 aircraft with 1.6 million
Chinese and overseas passengers since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Reform of existing customs inspection management and
simplification of customs procedures will help improve efficiency
and attract more investors to western part of China, said a local
customs official.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin Port
will carry out construction of a number of infrastructural
projects this year.
</P>
<P>
The new projects have already attracted the interest of
multinationals and become the focus of investment by them, said
local sources.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, seven 10,000 dwt docks will be

</P>
<P>
In the meantime, eight other existing container wharves will
also be rebuilt, coupled with the construction of a number of ship
locks.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals based in the United States, Britain and the
Netherlands recently sent their representatives to Tianjin to
negotiate matters relating to investing in construction of coal
docks at Nanjiang Port Area of Tianjin Port and reconstruction of
three container berths at Beijiang Port Area.

<HEADLINE> State Council Meeting Discusses Huge Gas Pipe Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has recently
called a meeting to discuss a huge gas pipe project which is
designed to send natural gas from China's western Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region to Shanghai Municipality in the east.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) have submitted a feasibility report
on the project concerning resources, the market and technology.
</P>
<P>
The State Council regards the project as extremely important in
promoting economic growth in Xinjiang, in restructuring the
industrial structure and energy consumption patterns and in
raising economic efficiency in the eight provinces, autonomous
regions and municipality along the pipe.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the project will also greatly benefit residents
in Xinjiang by tapping the country's largest natural gas reserves
in the Tarim Basin and greatly boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The project will also accelerate economic development in the
areas along the pipe and increase their financial revenues and job
opportunities accordingly.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of the project, the 4,200 km long
pipeline will provide 12 billion cubic meters of gas annually for
industrial and domestic use to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan,
Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Cleaner fuel will greatly contribute to environmental
protection in cities and new sources of fuel will also promote
other industries such as steel, building materials, petrochemicals
and electricity.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 120 billion yuan (14.5 billion U.S. dollars) will
be injected into the first stage of the project. The government
expects foreign companies to invest in the project.
</P>
<P>
There are 419 billion cubic meters of proven natural gas
reserves in the Tarim Basin. Further exploration in the next five
to ten years might increase this figure to one trillion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin, which is about the size of France, is known as
the "Sea of Hope". China's oil and gas industry has an estimated
10.8 billion tons of crude oil reserves and 8,400 billion cubic
meters of natural gas reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Figures from the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released today show that the purchasing
price of raw materials, fuel and power rose 2.1 percent in January
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of industrial goods improved as selling prices remained
stable comparing with last year.
</P>
<P>
Areas in north and west China, including major industrial bases
such as Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Chongqing and
raw material producers such as Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and
Xinjiang saw the biggest price increases in January.
</P>
<P>
The NBS said the increase in the prices of mining products,
especially oil, is the main factor in the price hike of industrial
goods. The price of mining products rose 18.7 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rising prices of crude oil on the international
market, the price of petroleum products in China jumped by 30.3
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Prices of electricity, textile, non-ferrous metallurgy and
building materials also rose considerably this month.

<HEADLINE> Major Reforms For SOEs in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Liu Hong, director of the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), told a press conference
Monday that China will meet the target of turning money-losing
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) into profit enterprises by the end
of this year as part of a three-year reform plan.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by NBS Monday, profits of large
and medium-sized SOEs increased by 77.7 percent in 1999. Losses
dropped 15.9 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that apart from two loss-making industries - military
and coal - the 14 industrial sectors in China began to turn around
and make profits last year.
</P>
<P>
At local levels, SOEs in 20 of the 30 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions are now turned out of their loss-making
cycle.
</P>
<P>
Since January, such major economic indicators as industrial
output, foreign trade volume, consumer prices and direct foreign
investment have begun rising.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to pursue a pro-active
fiscal policy and implement the strategy of developing China's
western region this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu predicts that this year's economic growth will exceed the
rate of 7.1 percent in 1999 and create favorable conditions for
the SOEs in overcoming existing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The success of the three-year plan to revive SOEs should not
only depend on reducing the proportion of money-losing enterprises,
Liu said, adding that the success of the plan is also due to the
healthy turn around of SOEs that suffered the biggest losses.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, an economist from the Development Research Center
of the State Council, said that the main focus of the three-year
plan is to reform SOEs, gain valuable experience from
restructuring the industry, capital circulation and relocation of
workers.
</P>
<P>
Major reforms can be seen in the government's decision to
concentrate on some key sectors and enterprises. The government
will also allow private capital to be injected into many
previously government-dominated areas.

<HEADLINE> Major Reforms For SOEs in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has begun to reduce government shares in State-owned
companies on a trial basis. For example, from 2000, Beijing will
not allow the establishment of any solely-owned SOEs in industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of such large enterprise groups such as China
Petroleum Co. Ltd. witnessed a new stage in restructuring SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a modern corporate system has also made
new progress. Local governments in northeast China's Jilin and
Liaoning provinces, for example, have set up independent share-
holding companies which no longer allow administrative authorities
to directly running SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Zhejiang have experimented with setting up an
external supervision council and financial auditors for SOEs.
China has also began to establish an incentive and supervision
system of corporate leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, the Chinese government has focused on
resolving a number of prominent problems in SOEs, including
excessive debts, outdated technology, waste of resources and
environment pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 73 large and medium-sized
SOEs performed debt-to-equity swaps in 1999, reducing debt by 111.
3 billion yuan. The government also wrote off more than seven
million yuan in bad loans of some 800 SOEs that went bankrupt last
year.
</P>
<P>
By scrapping cotton weaving production capacity by more than
nine million spindles over the last two years, the textile
industry became the first industrial sector to turn around their
loss-making cycle in 1999. Coal, metallurgical, building materials,
non-ferrous metal and petrol-chemical industries have also closed
down a great number of small factories that waste energy and
pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
The government is developing social insurance systems,
increasing the income of medium- and low-income workers and
encouraging the expansion of private enterprises to accelerate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
China's unemployment insurance system helps three million laid
off workers to find new jobs every year. The government is
planning to develop a complete social insurance and employment
benefit system in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Flourishing private companies have taken in many laid-off
workers from SOEs, re-employing 1.4 million of them in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that the success of the three-year plan of
reviving SOEs is crucial for China's economic reform and future
development.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reacts Cautiously to Haider's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel will assess the
resignation of Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider before making
any decision on whether to send its ambassador back to Vienna,
Israeli Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Haider, an outspoken xenophobe and sympathizer of the Nazis,
announced his stepping down as leader of the Freedom Party late
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old populist handed over his mace to his party
colleague Susanne Riess-Passer, currently vice-chancellor in the
government headed by Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, leader of the
conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Haider's dramatic resignation was considered as an effort to
reduce the storm of international pressure on Austria and help the
coalition function more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts in Jerusalem pointed out Haider's
comments that he will remain active in national politics, saying
the move is just another trick of Haider to boost his popularity.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the Freedom Party in Austria's new coalition
government earlier in the month - although Haider himself did not
occupy a cabinet post - has made all other 14 European Union
members freeze their bilateral contacts with Vienna.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Haider's praise of Hitler's policies and his
description of Nazi veterans as "men of good character," Israeli
Foreign Ministry announced the recall of its ambassador from
Vienna, one of the harshest gestures in the diplomatic arena,
shortly after the new Austrian government was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
"Israel cannot remain silent in the face of the rise of
extremist right-wing parties, in particular in those countries
which played a role in the events that brought about the
eradication of a third of the Jewish people in the Holocaust," the
ministry said then in a statement.
</P>
<P>
During the World War II, the Nazi regime deliberately carried
out a systematic liquidation of the Jewish community in Europe, in
which some 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children, were
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
Haider has repeatedly apologized for his controversial comments
since his Freedom Party drew international attention after ranking
second in Austria's parliamentary election last October.
</P>
<P>
He even signed a declaration renouncing Austria's Nazi past and
affirming his commitment to the values of democracy and human
rights in a bid to win approval of President Thomas Klestil for a
coalition including his party.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs Close Ties With East Timor: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needs a close
relationship with East Timor, a former province of Indonesia, and
should build mutual cooperation in the future, a legislator said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Economically, we can not expect anything from East Timor, but
we can be a good friend of East Timorese, and we can establish a
good relationship with them, and I think we should establish a
good relationship, because East Timor is our neighbor," Chairman
of the House of Representatives (DPR) Commission on Security and
Foreign Affairs Yasril Ananta Baharuddin told Xinhua in an
interview here on Tuesday when commenting on President Abdurrahman
Wahid's ongoing visit to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Politically, East Timor will be a strategic country for
Indonesia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that East Timor needs to be proposed to join the
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).
</P>
<P>
"And the relationship between Indonesia and East Timor should
balance and bring benefit to the two countries," Baharuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Wahid, who was visiting in Dili, capital of
East Timor, said that the Indonesian government would give its
hand to help its former province.
</P>
<P>
"We will give whatever we can," said Wahid who is the first
Indonesian leader to visit East Timor since the territory
separated from Indonesia after a ballot last year.
</P>
<P>
East Timor voted in favor of independence in a U.N.-sponsored
direct ballot in August last year and separated from the unitary
state of Indonesia after 23 years of integration.
</P>
<P>
The territory is now under U.N. administration, before getting
a full independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Grant Wilson, a liaison officer of the UNTAET (
United Nations Transition Administration in East Timor) in Jakarta,
told Xinhua that "it is important for Indonesia to establish close
relations with East Timor to show the world that Indonesia is a
democratic country."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Indonesian government to support the
reconciliation process in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to Indonesian people to realize that East
Timor is a free (state) now. And I am very optimistic about the
bilateral relations between the two countries," Wilson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- India has set its economic
growth rate at seven to eight percent for the next financial year
beginning from April 1 with an aim to put the country on a "
sustained, equitable and job creating" basis and to eradicate
poverty within a decade.
</P>
<P>
Tabling the Union Budget for 2000-01 before the parliament here
on Tuesday, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha listed a number of
initiatives to achieve the objectives such as doubling the
allocation of food grain to those below poverty line and
rationalizing fertilizer subsidy.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to establish a credible framework for fiscal
discipline, saying rural development would be strengthened besides
modernization of traditional industries like textiles, leather,
agro-processing and creation of more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The minister laid emphasis on strengthening the potential of
knowledge-based industries such as infotech, biotech and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to remove infrastructure bottlenecks in power, road,
telecommunications, railways, ports and airways and give high
priority to human resources development to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sinha added, the highest priority would be
given to programs and policies in education, health and other
social services with special emphasis to the poorest and weaker
sections of the society.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, defense expenditure would be
remarkably increased by 28.2 percent to 585.87 billion rupees (
approximately 13.62 billion U.S. dollars) from 455.87 billion
rupees (about 10.6 billion dollars) in the financial year 1999-
2000.
</P>
<P>
More money would be provided for defense whenever required, the
financial minister told the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Indian
Parliament, which began its budget session last Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest-ever increase in defense expenditure in any
single year in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said in the budget that fiscal deficit in the last fiscal
year which will end on March 31 was likely to go up to 5.6 percent
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the original target of 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The financial boss proposed that government equity in the
public sector banks be reduced to 33 percent by issuing shares to
the general public and introducing a single rate central value
added tax of 16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feb.29 Y2K Crossover Uneventful In Singapore with  OneMinor Glitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 29 (Xinhua)-- The February 29 Y2K crossover
was generally uneventful in Singapore with one minor glitch, says
a statement released by Singapore's Inforcom Development Authority
(IDA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology Alan Chan, the National Y2K spokesperson,
said in the statement that there were no reports of major
incidents in Singapore arising from the February 29 Y2K critical
date and the crossover in Singapore's five key sectors: finance,
telecommunications, transportation utility and healthcare, has
generally been smooth.
</P>
<P>
IDA said there was one minor incident reported by the Singapore
Mass Rail Transport (SMRT) Limited.
</P>
<P>
The SMRT said the date stamped on 10 single-trip tickets issued
from the SMRT ticket vending machines at the Ochard and City Hall
stations after 1200 midnight was March 1 instead of February 29,
2000.
</P>
<P>
The problem has since been rectified and SMRT will continue to
monitor the situation closely, IDA added.
</P>
<P>
Alan Chan said that "this minor glitch has been quickly
corrected and we are confident that the public will not be further
inconvenienced."
</P>
<P>
He expects no major disruptions would arise on the day and
reassured that Singaporeans can expect to pass the day smoothly
and trouble-free.

<HEADLINE> About 2300 Deserters Return to Sri Lankan Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The amnesty from February 21 to 27 was a response to appeals
made to the army commander by many deserters and their parents.
</P>
<P>
All of them will be re-equipped and given a eight-week
refresher course before they join their former battalion. They
will be paid their former salaries from the day they reported back
and they will serve in the same rank in at the time of their
desertion but will lose their seniority, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
These deserters returned to their army will receive no
punishment except in exceptional cases if they are wanted by the
police for any criminal offense during their desertion period, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government have launched many times of the
amnesty since 1995. Many of deserters reportedly returned to the
army. However, there are still thousands army deserters who failed
to respond to the amnesty.

<HEADLINE> No Leap Year Computer Problem Reported in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Leap Year's extra day caused
no problem in Thailand's computer systems so far, a senior
official from the country's technology agency told Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kwanchai Lamubol, assistance director of the National
Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), said that so
far since Monday, NECTEC received no report about any computer
glitches caused by the leap year.
</P>
<P>
February 29, 2000, is considered the last critical date for the
year in which glitches may show up. Some experts voiced concern
that if computers do not recognize the year 2000 as a leap year,
its calendar may get confused, with results similar to those
expected after the transition from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Kwanchai said that NECTEC reactivated its Y2K command center on
Monday but with only 10 officials on duty compared to 300 on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
The command center opened the whole night on Monday but will
close Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Kwanchai said the center will reopen on Wednesday to collect
reports from 36 organizations to have a whole picture of Thailand'
s Y2K situation.
</P>
<P>
The 36 organizations, including 21 agencies in critical sectors
and 15 ministries, compile information about their computer
systems from subordinate units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank of Thailand (BOT) said that it has found no
problem in its credit and payment systems as well as the 88
financial institutions under its control.
</P>
<P>
Napajorn Hemachandra, director of BOT's information technology
group, told Xinhua that the bank's daily operation is "okay."
</P>
<P>
She said that despite the calm day Tuesday, the bank will still
monitor the normal problem which might occur at the transition of
each month.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has met no Y2K problems when the new millennium
arrived.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Launches Financial Institutions Development Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government
Tuesday formally launched Financial Institutions Development
Project (FIDP) of 52 million U.S. dollars, with 47 million dollars
credit coming from the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the FIDP is to stimulate the financial
market and support the policies of non-banking financial
institutions in a healthy and efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
"The project would undoubtedly be helpful in stimulating the
country's financial market, which is one of the major segments for
investment," said Governor of Bangladesh Bank Dr. Mohammed
Farashuddin.
</P>
<P>
WB Resident Mission Chief Frederick Temple said Bangladesh's
financial system can be characterized as bank-based rather than
market-based.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, the major portion of financing for business and
a majority of the core financial services are provided by banks,
said Mr. Temple, adding that in market-based financial systems,
the major portion of financing and services come from the capital
market.
</P>
<P>
On the launching of FIDP, Temple said the project would
increase the diversity in financial instruments, helping financial
institutions to scrutinize financial assets in order to raise
funds from the market.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions will also be encouraged and assisted to
issue bonds and other commercial paper as another way of raising
funds from the market, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has expressed shock over the level of human carnage and
destruction of property in last week's religious clash in the
country's northern Kaduna State.
</P>
<P>
The president was on an assessment tour in Kaduna Metropolis
Monday, accompanied by Acting Governor of the Kaduna State Stephen
Shekari, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day trip, Obasanjo visited many riot sites like
Rigasa, Kabala west, Angwuan Muazu and television village, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of political,
community and religious leaders to the crisis in Kaduna. He,
however, assured that the country will remain indivisible in spite
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sad for what I have seen because I could not
imagine the magnitude of destruction that took place last Monday
and Tuesday," said the president when addressing religious,
traditional and community leaders during the trip.
</P>
<P>
The president urged all leaders -- religious, traditional and
political - - to embark on reconciliation moves at the local and
state levels to heal the wounds the entire community may be
nursing as a result of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened has destroyed the community because people
who were your neighbors yesterday suddenly turned against you.
Confidence has been shattered. The earlier we work to bring
confidence back the better," said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The riot broke out in the city of Kaduna between the Christians
and Moslems who demand for the introduction of Sharia law, killing
at least 400 people.

KAMPALA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Lose 80 Percent Conventional Forces: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi has lost 80 percent of his conventional forces since last
October, a repentant rebel general was quoted here on Tuesday by
the official newspaper Jornal de Angola as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to General Diogenes Malaquias, the ex-chief of the
operation division of the rebel Headquarters of the General Staff,
Savimbi suffered a desertion of 80 percent of his effectives in
last October during the battles around the central city Andulo, a
traditional rebel military headquarter which was taken over by the
government troops on October 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
 At this moment, the rebel troops are seriously shortstaffed,
with the conventional effectives accounting for less than 20
percent of its number in 1999, said General Malaquias, who did not
mention the loss of Savimbi's guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the repentant general, most of the rebel soldiers
still loyal to Savimbi are guerrillas, who have been launching
road ambushes, guerrilla warfares and other destructive actions
against the government's targets. It was estimated last year by
the Angolan government that Jonas Savimbi had some 60,000
effectives, including 40,000-strong conventional troops and 20,000
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> OECD Optimistic About Euro Zone Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Tuesday that the
economic growth rate in the 11 euro zone countries could attain 2.
8 percent in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The OECD also called on these countries to speed up their
structural reforms especially in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
In a report on analyzing the results of economic performance by
euro zone countries over the past year, the OECD said it maintains
its prediction that these countries will attain a 2.8 percent
growth in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The countries in the euro zone experienced a 2.1-percent growth
of their gross domestic product in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But OECD said that euro zone countries are faced with "major
challenges" in the field of public finance to pay for the social
security of a growing population of retirees and aged people.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the labor market of the euro countries is
still too rigid and should be reformed.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said the euro countries should adopt a policy of "
salary moderation" to limit the labor costs, which it said can
help limit the rising of the interest rate of the European Central
Bank, help create jobs and push forward growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it played down the effect of the devaluation of the
euro against the U.S. dollar, saying that compared with the
devaluation of the currencies in Asian countries, the drop of the
euro appears more limited.

<HEADLINE> "National Ear Care Day" Set in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Starting from this year, March
3 has become "National Ear Care Day" in China.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's National Ear Care Day, organized by
the China Disabled Persons Federation and the Ministry of Health,
is "Preventing Deafness Caused by Taking Medicine."
</P>
<P>
China's deaf population has reached 20.57 million, accounting
for one third of the country's total disabled. About 800,000
Chinese children under seven are deaf and 9.49 million elderly
people suffer from deafness.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 Chinese children lose their hearing each year due
to medicine taking, hereditary-related problems, diseases and
noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yonggong, a pharmacy expert said that antibacterial is the
"main culprit" responsible for ear nerve problems that can lead to
deafness. Even doctors do not take the necessary precautions to
prevent such "disasters".
</P>
<P>
The number of children under seven suffering from deafness will
be reduced by 10,000 to 20,000 every year, if China can tighten
and control the kinds of medicine that can cause deafness and
educate the populace on how to take the right medicine, according
to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health issued regulations last year on medicine
that can cause deafness.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the Chinese Disabled Persons
Federation, said that China has over 1,500 organizations that
cater for the deaf. Since 1988, nearly 130,000 deaf mute children
have learned to speak. Seventeen percent of them have entered
kindergartens and primary schools.

<HEADLINE> HK Has Smooth Rollover to February 29 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Essential services in Hong
Kong have continued to function smoothly following the region's
smooth rollover to February 29, 2000 without any Y2K-induced
computer glitches, a Hong Kong official announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jessie Ting, deputy secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting and the controller of the government's Y2K Central
Coordinating Center (CCC), said Hong Kong had entered February 29,
2000 without any disruptions in the provision of critical public
services.
</P>
<P>
"The CCC will continue to closely monitor the territory-wide
rollover situation through regular reports from the 13 sector-wide
coordinating centers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 13 essential service sectors are aviation, broadcasting,
energy supply, environment, fire and emergency services, financial
services, food supply, border control, port management, public
health, public order, telecommunications and transport.
</P>
<P>
Ting said that both the government and essential services
providers had put in place comprehensive contingency arrangements
to ensure a prompt response to any unforeseen Y2K-induced system
failures.
</P>
<P>
"With these well-tested contingency arrangements, the risk that
Hong Kong will be adversely affected by the Y2K problem during the
rollover to February 29 is minimal," she said.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized businesses experiencing Y2K-related
problems with their computers, which fail to recognize 2000 as a
leap year, can contact the Hong Kong Productivity Council for
assistance. The Council is operating a 24-hour hotline to answer
inquiries on Y2K-related matters.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Visits Georgia to Discuss Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Hikmet Cetin, Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel's advisor and former foreign minister and deputy
prime minister, has paid a visit to Georgia for the implementation
of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
Cetin said he delivered a message from Demirel to Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze, urging him to accelerate the
negotiation process with Azerbaijan, Turkish Daily News reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is anxious to implement the oil pipeline project
agreement, reached among the three countries on the sidelines of
last November's summit of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation jin Europe, which was held in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will transport crude oil across Georgia from Baku
of Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
Georgia is reportedly attempting to gain a higher tariff - 0.20
U.S. dollars per barrel - for the transport of oil through its
territory and has also insisted that it will not assume any
responsibility for the security of its section of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, in a move intended to urge Georgia into
complying, has offered assistance to Georgia in the form of
military training, equipment, electronic surveillance systems and
ammunition to help maintain security of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Cetin said he believed Shevardenadze is determined to carry out
the project, but it is understood that Georgia will wait for the
outcome of the April 9 presidential elections before making a final
decision on the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Asset Management Company to Restructure  Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's national asset
management company Danaharta is expected to restructure a total of
30 billion ringgit (7.894 billion U.S. dollars) in gross loans by
June this year, its managing director Azman Yahya said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta set up in June 1998 to acquire non-performing loans (
NPLs) completed its primary carve-out of NPLs on June 30, 1999,
and by December 31, 1999, it had taken over a total of 45.521
billion ringgit (11.979 billion U.S. dollars) in gross NPLs from
68 financial institutions, the director said while briefing
reporters on the company's operations for the six months ending
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to Azman, as at the end of 1999, Danaharta had
restructured or disposed of loans and assets valued at 17.607
billion ringgit (4.633 billion U.S. dollars), representing 38
percent of loans in its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
He said Danaharta will conduct before end-March this year a
second property tender comprising 123 industrial, residential,
development, commercial, retail, agriculture and office properties
worth 276 million ringgit (72.631 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Danaharta managed to sell 24 properties worth 16.49 million
ringgit (4.339 million U.S. dollars) in its first tender of 44
properties worth 122.6 million ringgit (32.263 million U.S.
dollars) held last November, Azman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Danaharta had completed the first sale by
restricted tender of foreign loans in August last year, involving
15 accounts worth 541.31 million ringgit (142.45 million U.S.
dollars) with a recovery rate of 55.3 percent on 13 accounts.
</P>
<P>
The second sale in December, involving 28 accounts worth 957
million ringgit (251.842 million U.S. dollars) has a recovery rate
of 71 percent on 25 accounts, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 340 million U.S. dollars in foreign
currency loans were expected to be disposed of in the second
quarter of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government's debt
owed to the banks has increased to 878.9 billion kwacha (321
million U.S. dollars) from 695.6 billion kwacha (253 million U.S.
dollars) in December, according to Financial Mail on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increasing government debt raises concern in the private
sector and monetary authorities because it leaves less credit for
the private sector for investment or expansion which in turn
creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
The increased borrowing by the government also pushes up the
interest rates because the government has to offer higher
interests to attract the banks to buy its treasury bonds.

<HEADLINE> Russia Captures Last Populated Settlement in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops have seized the
last populated settlement in Chenchnya, the Shatoi District Center,
60 kilometers south of the rebel republic's capital of Grozny in
the Argun gorge, said the Russian military Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian Combined Forces'
headquarters in the North Caucasus as saying that Russian troops
Tuesday took full control of Shatoi, the last major rebel
stronghold in southern Chechnya, where some 2,000 Chechen rebels
had been resisting for the last days.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said the seizure of strongly fortified
Shatoi was the key to controlling the last rebel-held areas in the
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry has confirmed that Russian
federal troops now fully control the town of Shatoi.
</P>
<P>
"Federal forces assumed full control of Shatoi on Tuesday
morning," the ministry's press service told press.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky also said that
Russian soldiers are in full control of Shatoi.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops marched into Shatoi at 5:00 p.m. Moscow
time (1400 GMT) on Monday, he said. The Russian flag will be
raised in Shatoi today.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of ammunition and equipment including the
militants' armored vehicles were seized in Shatoi, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A group of 200 militants had tried to leave Shatoi. Of these,
around 150 were killed," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, trench warfare is now still underway between Russian
federal forces and Chechen guerrillas in the Argun gorge area, the
news agency Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal units surrounded the strategically important
villages of Duba-Yurt, Dachu-Borzoi and Chishki in the valley over
the past 24 hours, the Russian command in the North Caucasus was
quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wolf Gates mountain crossing to the Argun gorge has been
blocked off, while artillery and air strikes are continuing in the
gorge, it added.
</P>
<P>
Chechen extremists will probably try to break through the
Chechen section of the Russian-Georgian border. Around 500 federal
soldiers have been deployed in the area to reinforce the border
guard force, said the command.
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, the Russian Defense Ministry predicted that
99 percent of Chechen territories had been liberated by federal
troops after five months of the Russian anti-terrorist military
campaign in the rebellious province.
</P>
<P>
But Russian top military officials held that the seizure of
the Argun gorge will not end rebel resistance. They foresee hit-
and-run attacks by small rebel groups throughout Chechnya and warn
terrorist attacks in Russia are also possible.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM: No Reason for International Intervention in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Monday that he believes there was no genocide in
Chechnya and no reason for international intervention in the
Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have the conditions you had in Kosovo, which
justified an intervention," he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
"We are unfortunately facing a conflict by rebel forces who
are asking for autonomy, or even secession in Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that the Russian Federation is not ready to
concede," explained Dini, recalling the EU's various moves to urge
Russia to show moderation as well as its attempts to persuade
Russia to allow an international humanitarian presence.
</P>
<P>
"It is a conflict people tried to avoid, but unfortunately it
was impossible," said Dini, pointing out that Chechnya is Russian
territory and the Chechen rebel forces was considered as "
terrorists" by Moscow.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 6,500 Italian women begin
competing Monday for posts in the national air force marking a new
page in the history of the Italian Armed Forces, whose ranks have
always been closed to female recruits.
</P>
<P>
A total of 136 jobs are up for grabs in the Italian air force
of which 28 are, for the first time ever, earmarked for women,
including 16 posts as pilots.
</P>
<P>
In all, 13,000 people have applied for the jobs, half of them
women. The preliminary selection procedures started Monday and
will last until March 3.
</P>
<P>
Female candidates are required to have Italian citizenship, if
they are aged between 17 and 25 and have a high school diploma.
They must also be unmarried, without children and at least 1.61
meters tall, or 1.65 meters if they wish to become pilots or
navigators.

Meanwhile, a group of male recruits protested today against
military academy regulations that permit female recruits who marry
and have children to complete their training while throwing out
males automatically for such actions.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Italian government decided to let women
join the forces. It also abolished compulsory military service and
put Italy's armed forces on a totally voluntary and professional
footing.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Referring to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's assertion
that his four predecessors agreed to give back all of the Golan
Heights, Barak's top aide Danny Yatom confirmed Monday that Yitzhak
Rabin did say he would be willing to cede the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Yatom served as the slain former premier's military adviser and
participated in the famous meeting between Rabin and then United
States Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the meeting, Yatom said, Christopher asked
Rabin what he would be willing to offer if the Syrians gave him all
that he demanded regarding security and normalization. Rabin
confirmed he would not rule out the June 4, 1967 lines as one of
the borderlines the two countries would decide upon.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Ministers and Knesset (parliament) members from three ruling
coalition partners met Monday night in advance of Wednesday's
Knesset vote on Likud's bill that would require an absolute
majority in a national referendum plus 61 legislators' favorable
votes to endorse any treaty the government signs with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the National Religious Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya had
threatened to vote for the opposition Likud party and against the
government on the bill, which was perceived as an effort to
neutralize the Israeli Arabs' vote.
</P>
<P>
The government worries that if the bill passes, it would mean a
coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- United States Middle East envoy Dennis Ross decided Monday to
return home, after failing to restart peace talks between Israel
and the Palestinians regarding a framework agreement for a final-
status peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Ross Monday morning, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat rejected Barak's compromise solution for renewing the talks.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials said that Israel's compromise
proposal was for the Palestinians to choose an area making up 6.1
percent of the West Bank, but not including neighborhoods east of
Jerusalem, currently under Palestinian civilian authority and
Israeli security control.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economists Optimistic Over Economic  Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian economists voiced
their optimistic about the country's economy, saying the
government's economic growth target of 4 percent or more this year
could be reached.
</P>
<P>
Anggito Abimanyu, a noted economist of the Gadjah Mada
University, told Xinhua on Tuesday that the government could reach
the target of its economic growth (4 percent) easily if security
and political situation in Indonesia is conducive enough for
investment.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the country's economic growth will be
influenced by the growth in some neighboring countries such as
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Asia Pacific Director of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Yazuke Horiguchi also said that Indonesia's economy
this year would reach 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's economic growth has shown progress," Horiguchi,
who just replaced Hurbert Neiss, said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a memorandum of economic and financial policies
signed by the IMF and the government of Indonesia issued on
January 20, Indonesia's economy is predicted to grow by 1- 2
percent in 1999/2000 fiscal year ending on March 31, 2000, and
then to strengthen to the 3-4 percent during the fiscal year of
2000 (April-December).
</P>
<P>
Abimanyu noted that the target of 4 percent is a conservative
figure, saying that actually the government could reach more than
4 percent in the fiscal year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, in an attempt to make the 2000 state budget strong to
boost the on-going economic recovery program, the Advisory Group
in Economic, Industry, and Trade (Econit), one of the noted
country's economic think-tank, urged on Tuesday the government to
revise its draft of the country's 2000 state budget.
</P>
<P>
In its public policy review journal issued on Tuesday, the
Group said that the government needs to make its fiscal policy
more expansive.
</P>
<P>
The government was also urged to carry on foreign debt
rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia, so far has behaved as a good boy in the payment of
its foreign debt, so we think we are deserve to ask for debt
reduction. It is important for Indonesia to reduce its foreign
debt stock," Econit Director Arif Arryman said.

"No, it is not necessary that the accused shall accept that

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Build 10 More Industrial Institutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia plans to build
10 more industrial training institutes (ITI) under its 8th Five
Year Plan (2001-2005), Human Resources Minister Fong Chan Onn said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move, which would cost around 1.3 billion ringgit (342.105
million U.S. dollars), is to ensure sufficient supply of skilled
manpower in the industrial sector in the country, he told
reporters here after addressing the one-day conference on "
Education as an Engine for Growth and Innovation in a Knowledge
Economy".
</P>
<P>
Under the 7th Malaysia Plan, Malaysia has 10 ITIs which are
being upgraded, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once we complete the upgrading works by the end of this year,
we expect the next intake for ITIs to increase to 17,000 students,
compared with 4,300 trainees now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with the new ITIs, his ministry intended
to work on specialization in certain skills to ensure optimal and
efficient utilization of available resources.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 23,900 trainees were produced by the all
public training institutions annually.
</P>
<P>
Fong said that the government has allocated 500 million ringgit
(131.578 million U.S. dollars) under the Skills Training Loan Fund
to help students from the lower income group.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Resumes Blasts, Ash Fall Triggers Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A series of blasts rocked Mayon
at noon Tuesday, sending volume of ash under the heavy rains that
fell in big muddy drops in Albay province, grounding power cables
and insulators and plunging the province in total blackout.
</P>
<P>
The noon day blasts occurring at 12:11 p.m. and 12:20 p.m. were
stronger than Monday's explosions, according to Ted Sandoval, an
expert of Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (
Phivolcs) Lignon Hills Observatory in Legazpi City.
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said in a report that Monday's and Tuesday's
explosions were stronger than Mayon's 1968, 1984 and 1993 blasts.
</P>
<P>
He said rain clouds covering the volcano's peak rendered visual
observation hard, hiding the rather huge eruptions column.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains pelted Albay at noon while the eruption was taking
place and disaster experts issued warnings of possible lahar
avalanches.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Albay Electric Cooperative said muds-mixture
of ash rains covered and grounded power insulators forcing them to
shut down electricity in the entire province.
</P>
<P>
The Philvolcs maintains Alert Level 5 of the country's most
active volcano "since there is still high potential for
occurrences of pyroclastic flows."
</P>
<P>
The institute said strict compliance of the 6-kilometer radius
permanent danger zone and the extension to 8-kilometer in the
southeast sector should be observed.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Volcano erupted last Thursday, sending lava fountains and
huge columns of smoke to the sky as thousands of local residents
fled their homes to evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
Located about 300 kilometers southeast of Manila, the 2,462-
meter Mayon Volcano has erupted at least 40 times since 1616 and
its last major eruption was in 1993, which killed at least 77
people.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Attract $10 Billion Investment Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said Monday that his government is determined to attract
at least 10 billion U.S. dollar investment annually.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day Commonwealth-Nigeria
Investment Conference in the capital Abuja, Obasanjo said that all
legal and administrative constraints to foreign investment had
been removed while the process of entry into and exit from the
country's economy by foreigners had been simplified.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that his government would make all possible
efforts to drastically reduce the cost of doing business in the
country through the rehabilitation of infrastructure and
privatization exercise, stressing that "Nigerian conditions must
become internationally competitive."
</P>
<P>
The government was committed to reducing Nigeria's debt burden
through negotiations with the various creditors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been undertaking painstaking efforts to attract
foreign investors and demand western creditors to write off its
debt in order to revitalize its ailing economy after Obasanjo's
coming into power last May, ending 15-year military rule.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Urges Nigeria to Step up Anti-corruption Crusade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary General
Emeka Anyaoku said Monday that the Nigerian government needed
"progress" in its battle against corruption before it could expect
to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Potential investors would like to see progress being made in
tackling corruption before agreeing to finance investment in
Nigeria," he said at the opening of a three-day
Commonwealth-Nigeria Investment Conference in Abuja, the capital
of Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-born secretary general also identified the
recurring religious and ethnic clash, and inefficiency of the
public service as " inimical" to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The problem relating to Sharia must be given great attention,
Anyaoku told entrepreneurs, bankers, and economists attending the
conference jointly organized by the Nigerian government and the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Lack of progress in rescheduling Nigeria's 29 billion U.S.
dollar debt would undermine the ongoing process of "political and
economic reform", warned Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that the 54-member organization would help bring
the debt issue to the world's attention.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Pour Into White-owned Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's former freedom
fighters launched a countrywide invasion of white-owned commercial
farms to push for equitable redistribution of land, the daily
Herald reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday night the veterans had invaded at least 12 farms
countrywide in the past two weeks, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants Monday continued to pour into commercial
farms in different parts of the country, saying the time had come
to take "part of our heritage, which was illegally taken away
from our forefathers".
</P>
<P>
The invasions started in the southern Masvingo Province and
have now spread to virtually all the country's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
About 700 former freedom fighters Monday descended on Muzuri
Farms in Ruwa, just outside Harare.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the police were doing about the invasions, Police
Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said the issue was "above the
police" because it was political and referred the reporters to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Vice-President Joseph Msika, who is also chairman of
the National Land Acquisition Committee, said on Monday night the
government would only take a position after the local leadership
in the provinces had briefed it on the invasion.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebel Leader Welcomes U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the
main rebel group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
has welcomed the recent U.N. resolution to send 5,500-strong
peace- keepers to the country.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily quoted Wamba, leader of the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD) based in Kisangani, as saying on Tuesday
that once the U.N. military observers were on the ground, it would
be easier to identify the violations of the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The international peace-keepers could help facilitate the
Lusaka agreement signed by all belligerents last July and August,
Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, peace in the vast central African country was
still far off because internal rifts and lack of clear leadership
in rebel ranks would greatly undermine the U.N. peace mission in
the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Disease Threatens Flamingos in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious disease is
killing tens of thousands of flamingos on Lake Bogoria in Rift
Valley Province, central Kenya, the East African Standard reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted conservationists as saying human pollution is
the cause of the disease which has since last July killed up to
50,000 birds on the lake.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the world's flamingo population live on the
eastern Rift Valley lakes, with vast majority living on the
30-square-kilometers Lake Bogoria, the real haven left for the
bird in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In every single bird which we collected and analyzed tissues,
we found up to nine or 10 heavy metals," said Gideon Motelin who
specializes in flamingo studies at Kenya's Egerton University.
</P>
<P>
"It is not normal to find arsenic, lead, mercury, chromium and
copper in the livers and kidneys of these birds," he said, adding
that traces of pesticide have also been found in the body tissue
of the dead birds.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists believe that the source of pollution is the
farms near Lake Nakuru, about 100 kilometers south of Bogoria.
Flamingos abandoned Lake Nakuru two years ago due to pollution as
the lake became virtually uninhabitable.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Sudan to Resume Talks in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and the Sudan will
resume ministerial talks on the implementation of the peace
agreement signed by the two countries' presidents last December.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister for Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda told Xinhua on
Tuesday that the talks would start on Wednesday in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi and last through to the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We would discuss what major progress we have achieved so far
in the implementation of the agreement and what should be done
next," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement, brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, committed the two countries to ending hostility and
returning prisoners of war or people abducted by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to restore full diplomatic relations by the end of
February if the commitment was fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
expressed his dissatisfaction with the lag of its implementation,
saying that the Sudanese government did not honor its promise of
returning all the children abducted by the rebel Lord's Resistance
Army in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and the Sudan have been accusing each other of backing
rebel activities on their respective land and cut diplomatic
relations in April 1995.

NAIROBI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
lifted the ban on logging, according to Tuesday's Daily Nation

</P>
<P>
The ban became effective last year to give the government time

the collection of revenue in the sector.
</P>

Official statistics show that revenue from forests in Central

<HEADLINE> China Reports Success in Breeding Panda Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Artificial panda-breeding
techniques have been hailed as a success in China with the
survival of all five giant panda cubs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, prior to 1998, only 30 percent of baby
pandas could be bred through artificial breeding at the Chengdu
Giant Panda Breeding Research Center in southwest China's Sichuan
Wolong Natural Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Of the five baby pandas, one was born in 1998 and the other
four in 1999. They are all reported to be in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center, China's most
professional panda research institution, is fully confident that
in the future they will have a hundred per cent survival rate of
artificially-bred baby pandas.
</P>
<P>
Giant panda only conceive one or two babies each year. Many
newborn cubs are often abandoned by their mothers because they
cannot feed or take care of two cubs at once.
</P>
<P>
The research center initiated a program from 1991-1997 to save
baby pandas by artificial breeding. However, in the early stages
of the program, six panda cubs died.
</P>
<P>
The death of some of the baby pandas was due to mixing
different milk ingredients, said Zhang Guiquan, assistant director
with the center.
</P>
<P>
After tests and experiments, experts changed the milk for
feeding panda cubs in 1998 which proved successful in the survival
of all five cubs.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the Panda Research Center look after newly-born pandas
during the first 11 days of birth, considered to be the most
critical period. Young pandas will then be removed from a special
caring room to a simulated wild environment to become familiar
with their new surroundings, said Zhang Hemin, director of the
research center.
</P>
<P>
China is making a blueprint to release pandas from captivity by
2005 after they receive training exercises in their simulated
environment.
</P>
<P>
Some mature female pandas are watching videos of other mother
pandas raising their offspring at the research center. Recorded
sounds of little pandas are also broadcasted regularly to arouse "
motherhood" in these female pandas.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is on the verge of extinction. There are about
1,000 pandas in the world, most of which live in China. About 100
pandas are bred by artificial insemination or through artificial
breeding programs.
</P>
<P>
China has set up 27 natural reserves to protect pandas and is
building another 17 areas to breed and raise pandas.
</P>
<P>
Among all panda protecting reserves in China, the Wolong
natural reserve is the largest with over 100 wild giant pandas.
About 50 of these pandas are in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Center was founded in
1980, 100 kilometers away from the capital of Chengdu. The Center
was sponsored by the Chinese government and World Wild Fund For
Nature. The Reserve covers a total area of over 30 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Entry Into WTO Accelerated (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) has been much accelerated over the past
several months as the country signed WTO deals with a dozen member
of the multi-lateral trade body.
</P>
<P>
Following the China-US agreement concerning China's entry into
the WTO last November, China has since signed bilateral WTO
agreements with Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, Sri Lanka,
Uruguay, Peru, Norway, Iceland, the Philippines and India.
</P>
<P>
China has yet to reach agreement with another 13 WTO members --
the EU, Argentina, Columbia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Girghizstan,
Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and Thailand --
before it finally becomes WTO member.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that negotiations with the above 13
members are all under way.
</P>
<P>
China's bid to enter the WTO has lasted 14 years. Before the
China-US WTO deal was clinched, there was little progress.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1999, China held numerous negotiations with
the United States and other major WTO members on its accession to
the WTO, previously known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
During this period, China almost reached a deal with the United
States, but failed because of the U.S's unrealistic high demands
and domestic political factors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Observers in China said that the acceleration of China's entry
into the WTO came about due to strategic decision by the Chinese
Government.

<P>
"As the People's Daily said recently in a signed article, that
to join the WTO as early as possible by quickening negotiations is
imperative in developing China's socialist market economy as well
as for China to open its doors even wider to the outside world,"
said an analyst, who prefers not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The "win-win" deal between China and the United States is of
significant and far-reaching importance, said the analyst.
</P>
<P>
As the largest developed country in the world, the United
States is a major player in global trade and economy. The United
States greatly influences world trade and the rules which govern
global trade.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US agreement has cleared the biggest obstacle for
China's entry into the WTO, paving the way for a quicker process
of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Following the Sino-US agreement, many WTO members, including
the EU, have said they would accelerate negotiations with China to
enable the country to join the WTO at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed upon that China's WTO membership will be
good for China and global trade.
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore, WTO director-general, said during his recent visit
to Beijing that WTO will only truly be a world trade organization
until China becomes a member, adding that the day China enters the
WTO will be a great day for China and the world.
</P>
<P>
China is now making preparations for that historical day.
Major newspapers, including the "People's Daily", "Economic Daily"
and the "Guangming Daily", have run a series of articles about the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
According to MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng, China is making
amendments that accord with WTO regulations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Allegations on HK Human Rights Situation Unjustified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- It is entirely unjustified for
the U.S. State Department to make allegations, regardless of the
fact, about human rights situation in Hong Kong in its human
rights report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
here today.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the U.S. report, Zhu said that it has
met with criticism from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) government and people from all walks of life in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The central government of China and HKSAR government have been
following the principles of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people administering the affairs of Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy since the return of Hong Kong, he said, adding that
people there continue to enjoy a wide range of human rights,
democracy and freedom as safeguarded by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fact generally recognized by the international
community and it is most inappropriate for the U.S. to make
uninvited remarks on and unwarranted interference in Hong Kong's
internal affairs," Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
"We express our firm opposition to that," he said.

an allegation by NATO Secretary General George Robertson that
Yugoslav troops are being amassed for a move against Kosovo.

Robertson's allegation is a sheer fabrication, the command said

YINCHUAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in the northwest is speeding its work on a number of key
infrastructure projects as part of its concrete deeds to greet the
nationwide drive for accelerated economic growth in western China.
</P>
<P>
Mao Rubai, secretary of the Autonomous Regional Committee of
the Communist Party of China, made the remarks on the eve of the
third session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which
is due to open on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Mao, who is also a deputy to the Third Session of the Ninth NPC,
said today that the autonomous region's investment in fixed assets
will be risen to 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars) this
year, equivalent to the combined sum of the past two years. The
figure is to spiral in upcoming years.
</P>
<P>
Major construction projects, now under way in his region,
include a railway section from Yinchuan, the regional capital, to
Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi Province, a new air route,
a number of water control and irrigation extension projects, and a
highway network, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, located on the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow
River, China's second longest, is frequented by wind and sand
storms. Therefore, the autonomous region plans to plant more trees
and grass on more than one million ha of land over the next decade.
When the afforestation target is met, additional 12,000 sq km of
fields with serious erosion will be improved. And its forest
coverage rate will increase to 13 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Drills Deep Hole into Earth's Crust (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are trying
to drill a 5,000-meter-deep hole in an area along the Yellow Sea
in east China, to unravel the secrets of the earth.
</P>
<P>
This is China's first scientific drilling on the continent and
is expected to take five years to complete, said Xu Zhiqin, the
project's chief scientist and a member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Human beings have lived on the earth for ages, but we still
know virtually nothing about what lies under the earth's crust,"
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"We can directly observe the lithosphere and get a better
understanding of the movements of oceans and continents by
drilling. We can also have a more clear idea of the relations
between the crustal stress and earthquakes, examine volcanic
movements and resources lying deep beneath the earth's crust, as
well as the origins of life and differences in climate around the
globe," Xu told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Drilling exploration of the earth is no less significant than
launching manned spacecraft into the space, according to the
scientist.
</P>
<P>
The project, known as "Telescope Inside the Earth," is
conducted in Donghai County in the city of Lianyungang, Jiangsu
Province, near the Tancheng-Lushan Mountain fracture belt, China's
largest fracture belt. Tancheng was hit by an earthquake measuring
8.5 degrees on Richter scale in 1688.
</P>
<P>
At the drilling site, Chinese and foreign geologists have found
tiny diamonds and coesite -- a high-pressure form of silica. These
finds indicate that the area lies on the world's largest high-
pressure metamorphism belt.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from France, the United States, Britain, Japan and
Turkey consider the area as extremely important for studying the
movements of continents. The project is of global significance, Xu
said.

</P>
<P>

December 1999 indicate that 401 billion yuan (48.3 billion US
dollars) was spent in real estate development nationwide, a rise
of 11 percent over the figure for the previous year.

meters in floor space were built last year, an increase of 19.6
percent. The completed floor space of commercial houses was 162
million square meters, up 29.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister: China's Reunification Cause Irreversible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian stressed today that China's basic policy toward the Taiwan
issue remains "peaceful reunification and 'one country, two
systems'", but that China will never commit not to use force.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the statement at his meeting with Dennis Blair,
commander-in-chief of pacific command of the United States armed
forces, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor, said that the white paper "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue" had made clear the consistent
stand of Chinese government toward the issue of Taiwan and
reflected the common aspiration of the entire Chinese people. The
reunification cause of China is irreversible, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Blair's delegation marks the first senior U.S. military
delegation to officially visit China since the U.S.-led NATO
bombed the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last May.
</P>
<P>
Chi urged the U.S. to handle properly the Taiwan issue in line
with the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques and relevant
commitments, to stop arms sale to Taiwan and "do things that
genuinely help promote the peaceful reunification of China."
</P>
<P>
China has always followed an independent foreign policy of
peace and held that differences between countries should be
resolved peacefully through consultations and dialogues on equal
footing. China hopes the world will maintain peace, stability and
development, and China will definitely not pose a threat to the U.
S., he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair reiterated that the two countries share common interest
in maintaining peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region
and even the whole world. He also stated that U.S. will stick to
the "One-China" policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The worldwide drilling of continents began some 30 years ago.
So far, 13 countries have drilled nearly 100 holes in continents
across the globe, with the deepest reaching 12 kilometers
underground. Of the 100 holes drilled, 20 are between four to five
kilometers deep.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who also works at a continental drilling center affiliated
with the Ministry of Land and Resources, said the goal of the
project is to drill a hole 5,000 meters deep and 155 mm in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
The project was designated as one of China's major scientific
projects in June 1997. In April 1998, an international continental
drilling committee approved the project and provided 1.5 million U.
S. dollars in funds and engineering equipment.
</P>
<P>
To choose the right site for the project, Chinese scientists
did a lot of preliminary research. They drilled two experimental
holes in the target area, one 430 meters deep, and the other one
kilometer deep. These initial efforts laid a solid foundation for
launching the project in September last year, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
She also revealed plans to drill a 10-kilometer hole into the
earth on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western China before 2010.

Manila, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Marine trooper was
killed Monday in a freak accident at the conclusion of the month-
long Philippines-U.S. Balikatan 2000 exercise in the northern
Philippines, a military report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes
said that Corporal Noli Dadivas died on the spot when he was ran
over by an armored vehicle in the amphibious beachhead landing.
</P>
<P>
The military report said Dadivas was ran over by the V300
amphibious armored vehicle at about 10:45 a.m. at the height of
the landing exercise at the Caynipa Beach at the Marine Base
Ternate in Cavite.
</P>
<P>
"It is very regrettable that this incident happened. It is very
unfortunate," Armed Forces spokesman Col. Rafael Romero said in
the report.
</P>
<P>
"During military exercises, we try to duplicate real situations
which could be really dangerous. Exercises are done very
realistically," he said, hinting that Dadivas may have stayed too
close to the vehicle upon landing on the beach.
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Mateo Mayuga, Philippine co-exercise director, also
expressed grief over the accident.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot avoid those kinds of accidents because the exercises
and training are fast phased," Mayuga said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador to China Stresses China's WTO Accession, PNTR Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to China,
Joseph W. Prueher, said here Monday that China's World Trade
Organization (WTO) accession and permanent normal trade status
with the U.S. are on the top of the U.S. government agenda in
handling its relations with China this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a policy briefing sponsored by the National
Committee of United States-China Relationship, Prueher also said
the United States should support the economic reform and rule of
law in China, and put forward human rights dialogue and military-
to-military contact between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO, "the number one issue on the
list," will serve America's political, economic and military
interests in the long run, Prueher told a group of China experts
at the briefing.
</P>
<P>
"So we need not take our eyes off the ball," said the 58-year-
old Admiral-turned-diplomat who just came back home after three
months in China.
</P>
<P>
"We should support (China's) WTO accession" and grant it
Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR), because this will help
the reforms in China, Prueher noted, calling on the Americans to "
do everything" to buttress China's reform in such fields as
economic restructuring, banking, financing, so that America's
business firms may enjoy a good deal of fairness in competition on
China's market.
</P>
<P>
Prueher also stressed the need to support the development of
rule of law in China, saying that the Chinese people are working
hard toward establishing a legal society in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also urged support for continued human rights
dialogue with China, but cautioned that when conducting the
dialogue, the United States should take into account what China
has achieved in improving its human rights in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"We should acknowledge what has been done (in China) over the
last 20 years, which is in a considerable amount," he said.
</P>
<P>
In China, he added, many people who starved in the past are
now having enough to eat, and there are more nongovernmental
organizations and greater individual freedom than before, and
there are also a larger number of churches in China, where worship
is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Prueher expressed his opposition to the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, saying the Act will worsen the situation in the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Act last month
despite China's strong opposition. China says that the Act will
pose a severe threat to China's security and increase the chances
of military confrontation across the straits.

<HEADLINE> 4th Race of America's Cup Finals to Be Sailed on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- With four race days lost
and only three races sailed, the Race Committee of the America's
Cup have just decided to change its schedule and the fourth race
of the America's Cup finals series will now be sailed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There was never a hint of wind on Tuesday on the Hauraki Gulf
off Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
A sunny morning gave way to a hazy, cloudy afternoon and didn't
generate enough heat to build a sea breeze. The wind velocity
never exceeded four knots before Race Director Harold Bennett
abandoned racing at 14:45 (local time).
</P>
<P>
But according to weather forecasts, tropical rain storms will
move into the area from the North over Wednesday afternoon,
resulting in Northeasterly winds of 10-15 tomorrow building to 20-
25 knot Easterlies on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the forecasts, the Race Committee has just changed its
schedule and decided the 4th race will be held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There have now been four postponements in the 11 days since the
America's Cup finals began, meaning the series is set to be the
longest-ever in the event's 149-year history.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Has Most Nature Reserves in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest
China now has 105 nature reserves, ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The reserves established over the past four decades, cover an
area of 1.95 million hectares, or 5 percent of the province's
territory. They had served as shelters to protect 100 kinds of
forests and 90 percent of the province's rare species of
endangered animals and plants, according to Chen Jihai, director
of the provincial forestry department.
</P>
<P>
As the most biodiverse region in China, Yunnan, with only one
25th of the national territory, is home to 17,000 kinds of high-
grade plants, or half of the country's total. And half of the
country's wild animal species could also be located in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Yunnan, known as China's "kingdom of
animals and plants", has issued a series of rules and regulations
to protect its biodiversity and crack down on illegal poaching of
wild animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, forest police handled over 10,000 cases related
to poaching wild animals and destroying forest resources. And 16,
000 people were dealt with according to law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many international organizations, such as the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF), the International Union for the Conservation
of Nature (IUCN), the Food and Agricultural Organization and
UNESCO, have also conducted cooperative projects with Yunnan to
protect the province's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Local residents' initiative to protect biological resources has
also been enhanced. In 1995, an association aimed at protecting
biological resources was sponsored by farmers living in the
Gaoligongshan nature reserve, which was set up in 1981.
</P>
<P>
"It's our duty to protect natural environment," said Li Jiahu,
an official of the association, adding that "we could no longer
live here once ecological environment was being damaged."
</P>
<P>
Due to the effort, local forestry department said, Asian
elephants in the jungles of Xishuangbanna in southern Yunnan have
increased from 150 in the 1970s to about 300 at present, the
number of Yunnan golden monkey in the Weixisamage nature reserve
has tripled from about 200 to over 600, and black gibbon in the
Wuliangshan nature reserve has increased from 150 to more than 400.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-Year-Old Tea Trees Still Productive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Patches of ancient tea
plantation, believed to be more than 1,000 year old, in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, are still producing teas, and bringing
benefit for local people.
</P>
<P>
The tea trees in one patch, each three to four meters high on
average and 1.6 meters in diameter, cover an area of about 600
hectares in the mountainous areas in the Lahu Autonomous County of
Lancang, southern Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Inscriptions on a monument in Dai language reads that the trees
were planted in the year of 696.
</P>
<P>
From March to November every year, local people can collect tea
four to five times from the trees, said Yan Shanyong, head of the
Jingmai Village.
</P>
<P>
The tea from the trees tastes quite different from normal tea
plantations, Yan said, adding that it is environmentally friendly
as neither chemical fertilizer nor pesticides were used for them.
</P>
<P>
The tea was also sold at a much higher price compared with
ordinary tea. However, the average per ha output of the ancient
trees was low , only 300 kg per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the tea plantations have become a tourism attraction
over the past few years, and this has also brought about benefit
for local people.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Striving to Boost Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province announced that it has extended its visa-free tour program
from covering only two cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai to nine
cities in the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The program is applicable to overseas tourists with visas to
visit Hong Kong and Macao. Under the program, they will be allowed
to stay five more days when visiting the nine cities in the Pearl
River Delta without having to obtain extra visas after they
finished tours in Hong Kong or Macao, said Lu Weixiong, head of
Guangdong Provincial Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Previously, overseas tourists with visas to travel to Hong Kong
and Macao were given a 72-hour visa treatment and allowed to visit
Shenzhen and Zhuhai in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the new visa-free extension plan is designed
to attract more tourists to Guangdong from both Hong Kong and
Macao. The plan has won approval by the relevant central
departments.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that he believed Disney Company's decision to select
Hong Kong as the venue of its new theme park was made based on the
confidence in investment environment in the greater triangle
formed by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and in China's continued
open-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Lu added that a closer cooperation among people from tourism
communities of Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao is a necessity to
achieve success of implementing the program.

<P>
FUZHOU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Quanzhou, a coastal city in
east China's Fujian Province and the famous hometown of many
overseas Chinese, has become a major tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show the city hosted more than 9.2 million
domestic and overseas tourists last year, including 420,000 from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou boasts some 400 historical and cultural sites, such as
Kaiyuan Temple and Xuefeng Temple. It is also the birthplace of a
variety of artistic forms like Nanyin, a major Chinese folk music
form performed by string and wind instruments such as pipa, a
plucked string instrument, and Dongxiao, a vertical bamboo flute.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the city has restored about 60 historical
sites and made them open to tourists.
</P>
<P>
A great number of museums, including an overseas transportation
museum, and a museum of the history of overseas Chinese have been
established.
</P>
<P>
The city has also staged a series of international events like
a Nanyin concert and a folk art festival to draw overseas tourists.

<HEADLINE> Steel Companies Forced to Control Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Heads of six large iron and
steel companies were summoned to Beijing recently to discuss with
government officials on measures to curb steel production. These
companies failed to control steel output in January.
</P>
<P>
The six companies, from Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and
Sichuan provinces, over-produced 62,200 tons of steel in January,
9 percent more than the projected quota.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Metallurgical Industry (SAMI) held
a meeting for these enterprises to help them work out effective
measures to reduce output for the following months.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, SAMI director, said the administration will track
closely on their progress in curbing steel output on a monthly
basis, and warned that if they failed again next month, the
government will "pose sanctions" on them to force a reduction.
</P>
<P>
Pu said that the sector failed to control steel output in 1999
due to the reluctance of a number of enterprises. " If one
enterprise fails, all previous efforts exerted by the whole sector
will become abortive and the projected annual goal will just be
empty words", he noted.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Economic and Trade Commission also
pointed out that no enterprise will be exempt from the duty even
though they may have all sorts of difficulties, especially in the
first half of this year. The government will consider the
extremely difficult enterprises in the latter half year, if
progress has been made and domestic market improves.
</P>
<P>
China plans to control steel output within 1.1 billion tons
this year, some 10 percent less than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics show that
China produced 10.03 million tons of steel in January, down 4.01
percent from the same period of last year, but still exceeding the
projected quota by 180,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of a few large enterprises and most of the small
and medium-sized enterprises has made the task increasingly
difficult to achieve. Enterprises apart from the 46 key steel
companies had their output exceeding the quota by 481,600 tons or
48.2 percent in January, sources said.

in the oil development sector. Today's agreement is a significant
step made in response to the state's newly-designed strategy of
developing the western regions.
</P>
<P>
So far the CCB has supplied loans of 970 million yuan to the
Northwestern Oil Bureau, with a total settled amount of 2.5

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urged to Push Forward Reform of State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A symposium was held in
Beijing today to encourage scientists and technologists to push
forward reforms of state-owned enterprises and accelerate economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium was hosted by the China Association for
Science and Technology. Zhang Yutai, vice president of Association
said at the meeting that the technological expertise in state-
owned enterprises lags far behind the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
A survey on 24,000 large and medium-sized Chinese enterprises
shows that only 46.6 percent have their own research departments.
Technological level of industries such as non-ferrous metals,
petrochemicals and electric power lag five to ten years behind the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, there was 48 billion yuan (about 5.78 billion US
dollars) of research and development funds in China's large and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called on science and technology associations to offer
their advice on reforming state-owned enterprises, promote and
develop academic exchanges and raise the scientific and technical
level of workers in state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Monitoring Austria Despite Haider's Resignation -- With Correction of Haider's Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Monday that it will continue to monitor the coalition government
of Austria despite the resignation of Joerg Haider as the
chairman of the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular
briefing that Haider's resignation would be "a step in the right
direction," but noting that Haider is "still part of the party."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Austria said that Haider would remain governor of
Carinthia and play a role similar to that of a corporate "
supervisory board" in the party after his resignation as the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. recalled its ambassador to Austria to protest the
Freedom Party's entrance into the coalition government early this
month. Haider is well known for remarks playing down Nazi crimes
and was strongly criticized in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The other 14 members of the European Union (EU) froze bilateral
political contacts with Austria, also an EU member, to protest
against the joining of the Freedom Party in the new government.
</P>
<P>
In its new policy platform, the Austrian government promised to
reject racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. will continue to watch the behavior of the
Austrian government to ensure it will keep its promise.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is going to be on to what extent the government will
live up to the platform it has set forth. So we will be watching
their behavior," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't change our concerns. The Freedom Party is still
part of the government," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Preparations have started for
construction of an international aero-engineering base in Zhuhai
City of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the project will cost 500 million U.
S. dollars which will be shouldered together by Zhuhai Airport
Conglomerate and a Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
The mainland partner takes 30 percent of the stake by
mortgaging land use right and the Hong Kong investor will bear the
remaining 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project will cover an area of 800,000 sq m and be built
near Zhuhai's existing airport which has been making economic
losses since its operation as a result of inadequate passengers.
</P>
<P>
The new project will be constructed in stages and will be
finished in three to five years. On completion, it will be able to
offer services ranging from repairs of whole planes, repairs of
plane engines, manufacturing of components for planes, assembly
and manufacture of small planes, supply, transportation and
storage of logistic materials for inflights, to flight training.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts believe that completion of the project will
help improve economic benefits of Zhuhai, which is one of China's
four earliest special economic zones and the nearest mainland city
to Macao.

<HEADLINE> Kingdom of Tobacco Cuts Cigarette Export to Stabilize Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan, a leading tobacco
producer of China, cut its cigarette export by 173 million U.S.
dollars last year in a bid to stabilize price.
</P>
<P>
The province's cigarette export was down 60 percentage points
compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the total export of the province was also down 8.5
percentage points in 1999, according to statistics from the
provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation department.
</P>
<P>
The reduced cigarette export was aimed at stabilizing cigarette
price and maintaining domestic market order.
</P>
<P>
Many of China's famous brands of cigarette are produced by
Yunnan, known as the "kingdom of tobacco". However, a large
quantity of exported cigarettes by Yunnan were returned to China
by overseas profiteers through illegal channels, disturbing
domestic market order.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has produced about one third of China's cigarettes since
the 1980s, with 70 percent of Yunnan's revenue coming from the
tobacco industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the House of Representatives (DPR) state budget committee agreed
to raise fuel prices by an average of 12 percent from the
beginning of April, the Jakarta Post daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The price of premium gasoline would be raised 15 percent to 1,
150 rupiah (about 0.16 U.S. dollars) per liter from the current
price of 1,000 rupiah (0.137 dollars) per liter, the daily quoted
Minister of Mines and Energy Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But the price of kerosene for the poor and fuel for the public
transportation and (state electricity firm) PLN will not increase,
" the minister said, adding the price of automotive diesel will
increase to 600 rupiah (0.082 dollars) per liter from 550 rupiah (
0.075 dollars) per liter, industrial diesel will increase to 550
rupiah (0.075 dollars) from 500 rupiah (0.068 dollars), kerosene

bunker oil to 400 rupiah (0.055 dollars) per liter from 350 rupiah

</P>
<P>
Yudhoyono said that the average 12 percent increase in fuel

</P>
<P>
In its earlier state budget draft, the government proposed a 20
percent increase in fuel prices.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Marine Fish Output Increases in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's marine fish output
reached 279,900 metric tons in 1999, a 7.6 percent growth over the
previous year, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry in a statement attributed the output increase to
the various incentive packages offered to fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, an island nation in the northern Indian Ocean,
possesses 1,200 kilometers' coastline with vast aquatic resources.
About 100,000 Sri Lankans are engaged in fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a shift to deep sea fishing had been
encouraged through structural and management reforms. Consequently
over 1,700 boats operate in the country's exclusive economic zone
and in the international waters.
</P>
<P>
Deep sea fishing had also been encouraged by the government by
providing fully equipped harbors and anchorages along the coast.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years three new harbors had been
constructed while existing harbors were provided with essential
facilities for faster turnaround. Financial packages have also
been secured for the construction of an additional five harbors.
</P>
<P>
For more efficient operations and security for deep sea crew
members, the government has provided the fleet with radio
communication sets and satellite navigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile there has been a decrease in the import of fish and
fishery products from 71,200 metric tons in 1998 to 65,500 metric
tons in 1999, the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan tea industry
expects a boost from the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
which will take effect next month, the official Daily News Tuesday
quoted a senior industry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The FTA will certainly be instrumental in boosting the Colombo
tea auction," Chairman of the Colombo Tea Traders' Association
Michael de Zoysa told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, India agrees to import 15 million kgs of
Sri Lankan tea annually with 50 percent tariff concessions. For
this year there will be a total exportable quantity of 11.5
million kgs for Sri Lankan tea exporters.
</P>
<P>
India is the single largest tea market in the world which
consumes 600 million kgs of tea. Sri Lanka tea exporters have long
been expecting to carve a niche in the Indian tea market.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka and India entered into a free trade agreement when
President C. B. Kumaratunga visited New Delhi in late December
1998.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the pact was delayed for one year due to
differences on whether tea and other items should be enlisted for
tariff concessions.

<P>
DHAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
finally vested more regulatory power to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) to exercise its authority to help
revitalize the country's ailing capital market, The Bangladesh
Observer reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet at a regular meeting Monday approved the draft
amendments to the rules and regulations of the SEC, giving more
power to the country's capital market watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The SEC, established in 1993, was endowed with limited power to
exercise its authority to maintain transparency in the capital
market. Under the previous rules and regulation, the SEC was
unable to check the irregularities in the stock market, which
caused colossal loss to the share investors.
</P>
<P>
The amendments would empower the SEC to take tough action
against the respective person or institution involved in any
misdeal in share trading. The commission could also impose high
penalty on the default-listed companies for their failure to hold
annual general meetings.

HANOI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is striving to export 1.
68 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods to Japan this year, equal
to last year's figure and an increase of 25 percent over 1998,
English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a major export market for Vietnamese products.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1997, bilateral trade between Vietnam and Japan
increased steadily. Vietnam's exports to Japan accounted for 25
percent to 28 percent of its total annual exports.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now ranks the 20th on the list of the 120 countries
exporting marine products to Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnamese trade officials said that Vietnam's exports
have not yet reached their full potential and do not yet meet the
requirements of the Japanese market in terms of quality.
</P>
<P>
About half of Vietnam's main exports to Japan are raw materials
or semi-processed goods.
</P>
<P>
But Japan's imports from Vietnam represent just 0.6 percent of
its total annual imports.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Jointly Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar have
agreed to set up a joint task force to fight malaria and HIV cases
along the border of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The joint task force will be formed immediately by the health
ministries of the two governments to tackle the problem at the
operation level, according to the agreement reached on Monday
between Korn Dabbaransi, Thai deputy prime minister and minister
for public health, and Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and
chairman of the Myanmar National Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
Korn Dabbaransi was on a one-day special mission to Myanmar to
present in person medical supplies and equipment worth over 1.8
million baht (over 49,000 U.S. dollars) to the country.
</P>
<P>
During their discussions the two leaders shared the feeling
that malaria and HIV cases had increased substantially in about
two to three years along the two countries' border from Chiangrai,
Tak, Maesot to Ranong.
</P>
<P>
Korn hoped the first meeting of the joint task force would be
held in Thailand's Chiangmai province in June or July this year.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the Thai medical supplies and equipment to
Myanmar was done under the technical and economic cooperation
program of the two countries initiated in 1992 and these medical
supplies and equipment, which include those for combating malaria
and TB, will be used to enhance the quality of health care
services in Myanmar's rural and border areas.

<HEADLINE> IEA Forecasts Increasing Demand for Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Director of the
International Energy Agency (IEA) Robert Priddle said here Monday
that worldwide demand for energy will grow by 65 percent in the
following 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Need for energy will grow dramatically in developing countries,
" Priddle told reporters in a press conference during the IEA
convention.
</P>
<P>
Priddle then forecast a huge increase in demand for natural gas
for its high burning efficiency and low pollution features. "In
the future, power plants burning natural gas will gradually
replace nuclear plants and those that use coal as the primary
energy source," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Priddle called on closer cooperation between governments in a
time when growing demand for energy is raising global concerns
over the heavy use of carbon dioxide-emitting fuels and poor
energy safety.
</P>
<P>
As to energy supply, while forecasting that the world will rely
more and more on petroleum production in the middle east, he said
that currently the European countries do not have reasons to worry
about power supplies, even without their own comprehensive
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Vice State Secretary of Ministry of Economy Honig
Peter said the demand for energy in his country will grow by 1
percent annually during the following five years, and that his
government will invest a total of 2 billion forints (7.69 million
U.S. dollars) in programs aimed at energy saving.
</P>
<P>
Found in 1974, the IEA is a major economic liaison organization
between governments for petroleum consuming countries.

BELGRADE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Third Group Army
Command Monday denied an allegation by NATO Secretary General
George Robertson that Yugoslav troops are being amassed for a move
against Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Robertson's allegation is a sheer fabrication, the command said
in a statement, adding that his aim is obviously to divert public
attention when the world is paying close attention to how the
international peace-keeping force will carry out the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 which affirms Yugoslav
sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Third Group Army of Yugoslavia, which
have been complying with the U.N. resolution, are doing regular
military exercises on the country's own territory, with the aim to
strengthen the country's border security in accordance with the
Yugoslav constitution and other laws.
</P>

Tension has been high since early February in northern Kosovo
after clashes took place between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Monitoring Austria Despite Haider's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it will continue to monitor the coalition government
of Austria despite the resignation of far-right Freedom Party
leader Joerg Haider from the government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular
briefing that Haider's resignation would be "a step in the right
direction," but noting that Haider is "still part of the party."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Austria said that Haider would remain governor of
Carinthia and play a role similar to that of a corporate "
supervisory board" in the party after his resignation from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. recalled its ambassador to Austria to protest Haider's
entrance into the coalition government early this month. Haider
is well known for remarks playing down Nazi crimes and was
strongly criticized in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The other 14 members of the European Union (EU) froze bilateral
political contacts with Austria, also an EU member, to protest
against the joining of Haider in the new government.
</P>
<P>
In its new policy platform, the Austrian government promised to
reject racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. will continue to watch the behavior of the
Austrian government to ensure it will keep its promise.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is going to be on to what extent the government will
live up to the platform it has set forth. So we will be watching
their behavior," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't change our concerns. The Freedom Party is still
part of the government," he added.

<HEADLINE> Weather Forecast System Affected by Leap Year Glitch in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- As a result of a computer glitch
stemming from an irregular leap year, erroneous data were found
early Tuesday at 43 of Japan's 500 regional meteorological
observation sites, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three sites for the Automated Meteorological Data
Acquisition System in Japan's 23 prefectures had sent out
incorrect data, particularly in terms of precipitation and
temperatures, from around 1 a.m. local time Tuesday (1600GMT
Wednesday), the report quoted Meteorological Agency officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Gregorian calendar has a leap year every four years, in
which an extra day is added to account for the fact that the Earth
actually takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun.
</P>
<P>
But over many centuries, the difference between this
approximate value and the more precise measurement of 365.242 days
accumulates significantly.
</P>
<P>
To offset this discrepancy, leap days are skipped in years
ending in "00," unless they are divisible by 400, making 2000 a
leap year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, computer programs that do not take into account
this special leap year could mistake February 29 for March 1.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Slash Tax: Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada will cut taxes by 58
billion Canadian dollars (about 40 billion U.S. dollars) in five
years, according to the country's budget for the year 2000
unveiled Monday by Finance Minister Paul Martin.
</P>
<P>
The budget also approves immediate new spending of up to 4.5
billion Canadian dollars (about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars), of
which 2.5 billion (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars) will go for
health care and education, while 1.9 billion (about 1.3 billion U.
S. dollars) will go for national defense.
</P>
<P>
Under the five year tax-cut plan, personal income taxes will be
reduced by an average of 15 percent annually by the 2004-2005
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Middle-class Canadians will see a tax rate reduced from 26
percent to 23 percent, starting with a 2 percent drop to 24
percent in July, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tax-free earnings will be raised to at least 8,000 Canadian
dollars (about 5,520 U.S. dollars), while middle and top income
tax rates kick in at higher levels of 35,000 Canadian dollars (
about 24,150 U.S. dollars) and 70,000 dollars (about 48,300 U.S.
dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The tax reduction plan also includes the elimination of the 5
percent surtax on middle-class earners on July 1, 2000. The
surtax for high income earners will be phased out by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Child tax benefits will increase to a maximum of 2,400 dollars
(about 1,656 U.S. dollars), while maternity leave will be doubled
to one year as of December 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The corporate tax rates will be reduced to 21 percent from 28
percent for both big and small business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Canadians will focus on their future and this is indeed the
message of this budget, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the minister projected a total of 95 billion
Canadian dollars (about 66 billion U.S. dollars) in budgetary
surplus for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
He has said that personal income tax cuts top the list of
things he wants to do with the surplus, which he expects to
achieve after a series of measures imposed in 1995 to tame the
deficit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Men's Doubles Aim to Retain All England Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian men's doubles
specialist Candra Wijaya is optimistic of retaining his title with
partner Tony Wijaya in the All England championships in Birmingham,
England, next month.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to be the champion again this time. It's good to
be the champion. I always aim to reach the best I can, and
hopefully I can retain what I earned last year," Candra was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
World number one Candra said the All England was part of his
preparation for the Olympic Games in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
"We have been preparing well enough not only for the All
England but also for the Olympics. We have fixed our concentration
and goal for the events. We have set a target for ourselves not to
lose in early rounds. We must reach the best position at all the
championships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Candra and Tony defeated South Koreans Lee Dong-soo and Yoo
Yong-sung in the final last year. In 1998, the Indonesians lost to
the South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
"All the world's best doubles teams are after us now. We have
to be consistent in our form. We must play fast, powerfully and
accurately, otherwise our rivals will beat us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, men's singles player Taufik Hidayat, runner-up in the
1999 All England, set a goal of reaching the final.
</P>
<P>
"I still have no idea if I can win the title because this year
many shuttlers will compete in the All England to qualify for the
Olympics," said Taufik, who is ranked fifth in the world.
</P>
<P>
He lost to Peter Gade Christensen, Denmark, last year.
</P>
<P>
"The All England is a prestigious event in badminton. I don't
want to lose any points there. I want to reach the world's top
four in April," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taufik, who was suffering from a right shoulder injury, said
his preparation for the All England was much better than the
Chinese Taipei Open in January, where he lost in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"I only prepared myself for one week last month. But for the
All England, I have been preparing for about one month. I am in
better condition now," he said.
</P>

<P>
URUMQI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Work on eight garners for state
grain reserves has been completed in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, one of China's leading grain production
bases.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of grain has been put into the warehouses,
solving a long-standing headache of farmers who found it difficult
to sell their grain to the state as a result of shortage of
storage space, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
The eight granaries, with a combined storage capacity of 550
million km, were built in Hami, Korla, Aksu, Kuytun, Shihezi,
Fukang, Jinghe and Qingshuihe counties, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Construction of these projects took seven months and cost a
total of 3.2 billion yuan appropriated by the central government.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA (Sichuan), February 29 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua, known
as the "city of sunshine" in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
is working to build itself into a tourist city in the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>

city, bringing a total tourism income of 440 million yuan, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The city's Ertan Hydropower Station, the largest of its kind in
operation in China, and the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company have
become tourist destinations, said Fei Qi, deputy director of the
city's tourism bureau. He added the two places have received tens
of thousands of domestic and overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>

city, which is also the country's largest energy, iron, steel,
vanadium and titanium production base in southwestern area, has
unique local customs, cultural relics and diversified biological
resources.

<P>
As an important communication hub linking Sichuan and Yunnan
provinces, Panzhihua is a major stopover for tourists to go to
Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan and the tourist cities
of Dali and Lijiang in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the cental government strategy to develop
the western regions of China would help improve the city's

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Sees Growing Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 29 (Xinhua)-- The actual use of overseas
investment in China's largest municipality of Chongqing last year
was reported at 241 million U.S. dollars, 3.61 percent higher than
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Based on a year-on-year 11 percent increase of overseas direct
investment here in 1998 over 1997, some 197 new projects were set
up last year with total contractual overseas investment of 510
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the 197 new projects, 25 involve over ten million U.S.
dollars each, with investment in each project averaging three
million U.S. dollars, up 40 percent than that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Major investors came from the United States and European
nations. Nearly 20 nations established some 36 enterprises,
chalking a total contractual investment of 140 million U.S.
dollars, up 50 percent than 1998.
</P>
<P>
The growth of overseas investments was propelled by the local
preferential policies introduced since Chongqing was named a
municipality directly under the central authorities in 1997.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australian PM under New Pressure for  Aboriginal Reconciliation  By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Australian newspaper reported Monday that Howard had
abandoned the deadline, which he committed to on the election
night 1998, to produce a blueprint for reconciliation between
Australia's blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Australian, Howard said the
process of reconciliation would take years and that the process
would be "incremental."
</P>
<P>
"We won't resolve it by May or December," Howard told the
Australian.
</P>
<P>
"The reconciliation process will take a long time and it will
unfold over a period of years," he said, adding "What really
matters are not so much documents ... these things are all
incremental."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Howard's change of tack marked the
discarding of one of his commitments to making reconciliation a
second-term priority.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal leaders have expressed concern and disappointment at
the decision.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats Senator Aden Ridgeway, the nation's only
Aboriginal federal MP, said Howard's decision could derail the
whole process of bringing black and white Australia together.
</P>
<P>
"I think this really has the potential to side rail the lot,"
Ridgeway told the ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
"Unless you have some sort of agreed outcome and some basic
conditions being met, people have nothing to aspire to and it sits
there as a concept out there in the ether," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No-one really understands and no-one commits themselves to it
and eventually it just dies," Ridgeway said.
</P>
<P>
Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation member Marjorie Thorpe
said she was concerned at the prime minister's stand after nine
years of work.
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling a little bit alarmed I guess that the effort that
we've put into this process ... has been at a cost to all the
people involved," she told the ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
"The commitment that there has been by many people over those
years needs to be recognized certainly by the prime minister and
the government," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe said the council would continue its efforts as required
under the act and expressed confidence those efforts would not be
in vain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party considered the federal
government had set back the reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Kim Beazley said Howard was "absurdly chicken-
hearted" on the Aboriginal reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He said it was tragic that the prime minister had abandoned his
end-of-year deadline for the reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"He's destroying the joy and the moral weight in it. He's
destroying the opportunities," he told journalists after a shadow
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Beazley said two simple and easy things were needed to start
the reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The first was to allow federal parliament to deliver the
apology on the stolen generation that most MPs favored.
</P>
<P>
The second was a statement acknowledging the original
Aboriginal custodianship of the land, he said.
</P>
<P>
Labor aboriginal affairs spokesman Daryl Melham said the
reconciliation was always going to be hard to achieve and Howard
had to accept much of the blame for the pace of change.
</P>
<P>
"The process has been stalled under his prime ministership for
four years, indeed I think it's fair to say it's gone backwards,"
he told ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
But the country's peak indigenous body ATSIC described Howard's
move as an honest admission of failure and a point from which to
move on.
</P>
<P>
ATSIC Chairman Geoff Clark said Howard had admitted the
government's failure to properly recognize the true basis for the
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He said most key players in the reconciliation process had also
acknowledged it would not be achieved by December 31.
</P>
<P>
"Now would be a good time for the prime minister to sit down
with indigenous leaders and discuss how we can address the
shocking socio-economic disadvantages suffered by our people and
also our quest for proper recognition of our rights," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts also believed that Howard's decision was linked
to the growing opposition to saying sorry to the Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation member Jackie Huggins
said she believed Howard's statement was linked to an unreleased
and incomplete council survey which found growing community
opposition to an apology to Aborigines for the past practices.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's fairly evident," she told ABC radio. "I think
the research has had a great bearing on how the prime minister has
spoken about the deadline," she added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, federal Reconciliation Minister Philip
Ruddock said the government continued to act in areas like
indigenous health, education and housing, but believed
reconciliation was an ongoing process.
</P>
<P>
"Arbitrary deadlines are not going to produce changes in hearts
and minds," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Changes in hearts and minds will occur with goodwill and
people's willingness to keep working these issues through in a
very positive way," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Hits Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Northeastern areas of
Australia were hit heavily by Cyclone Steve and some residents are
now still isolated by rising waters.
</P>
<P>
The Cyclone slammed into the coastal areas on Sunday, bringing
160 kph winds and torrential rains leaving a trial of destruction
in its wake, Australian mess media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cairns, a coastal tourist city in Queensland, bore the brunt of
the category two Cyclone Steve. Street signs were twisted by the
wind and shop lay strewn across streets. Schools and many ships
and businesses were closed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian newspaper reported Tuesday that some suburbs of
the city were isolated by the flood and the local State Emergency
Services fielded more than 200 calls from residents seeking
tarpaulins for damaged roofs.
</P>
<P>
Only one casualty was reported so far. A 17-year-old boy riding
a tire tube down a north Queensland creek was found dead Tuesday
morning. He was hit Monday by a wall of water when played with a
group of friends.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Meteorology of Australia warned Monday night
against a new cyclone. The Bureau issued a cyclone watch for
coastal and island communities between Mornington Island in
Queensland and Alyangula on Groote Eylandt in the Northern
Territory.
</P>
<P>
A tropical low, following Steve, was based at Normanton at the
base of the Cape York Peninsula and moving Southwest, "There is
some possibility that (the low) will start to move towards the
Northwest, with the risk of a cyclone developing tomorrow night or
Wednesday in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria," the weather bureau
said.

The management committee of Zixiao Temple is under the
jurisdiction of the Mount Wudang Taoist Association, a non-
governmental, religious organization with 147 members. Wang
Guangde, chairman of the association, is a member of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang is as experienced in operating the temple's tourism as he
is in handling religious affairs. His association now runs
businesses ranging from making of pharmaceuticals, commerce,
catering to martial arts training courses. These activities rake
in about 10 million yuan annually, most of which goes for
repairing temples, protecting cultural relics and charitable
offerings.
</P>
<P>
The grand ancient temple complex at Mount Wudang has been
included on the world cultural heritage list by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
In the past 15 years, Taoists have raised 250 million yuan to
renovate the ancient architecture. More than two million yuan has
been donated to poverty-stricken areas, flood-hit regions and
Project Hope, a program which returns young dropouts back to
school.
</P>
<P>
Taoists on Mount Wudang have a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan (
about 24 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"That's enough, as we mainly use the money to buy books," Xuan
Qing said. The Taoist nuns do not use cosmetics nor wear robes
every day, and they eat free meals in the temple dining hall.
</P>
<P>
Taoists used to refine concoctions that they believed made
people live longer, but the "immortality pills" are no longer made.
The Mount Wudang Taoists Association now reimburses the nuns for
their medical bills.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research
Society under the association have selected four ancient formulas
of "immortality pills" and put them into mass production.
</P>
<P>
"Taoism is thriving because of the current tolerant atmosphere
in society," said the association chairman Wang Guangde.

to the ways of the modern world, and they've kept Xuan close to
her office in the temple, where as an elected member of the temple
's management committee, she organizes religious affairs, cultural
protection activities and tourism promotion programs.

Taoism was founded in the second century by ancient philosopher
Lao Zi and is known as the root of traditional Chinese culture. It
is considered to be the earliest religion in China and was
designated the "state religion" many times by feudal regimes
throughout history.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Top chess player Gary Kasparov
of Russia defeated Alexei Shirov of Spain with the white pieces in
the first game of the annual Linares Grandmaster Tournament on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shirov, ranked fourth in the world, chose the venerable Petroff
Defense, which has a reputation as being solid and safe.
</P>
<P>
The players soon found themselves in a sharp tactical melee.
Kasparov later pushed his rooks to the seventh rank. Shirov
blundered with a move that cost him a knight and the game was over.
</P>
<P>
In other games, fellow Russian Vladimir Kramnik, ranked No. 3
in the world, won with black against Alexander Khalifman, the FIDE
World Champion. The No. 2 Wiswanathan Anand of India and Peter
Leko of Hungary, the world's top junior, played to a draw.
</P>
<P>
The Linares tournament is a double round-robin with the six
competitors playing each other twice, once with White and once
with Black. The players have two hours to make 40 moves and then
an hour and a half to make the next 20. A win garners one point
while a draw receives a half point.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which features six of the world's best chess
players, ends March 10, with March 2 and 6 as rest days.

<HEADLINE> China Made Little Progress in Reducing Steel Output in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 29 (Xinhua) -- China has made little progress
in reducing its steel output in January this year due to the
reluctance of small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Because of a surplus of steel, the steel price has continued to
drop. Last year China decided to cut its output of steel, but with
little results.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will continue this year to make sure that the annual
steel output remains within 110 million tons, a 10 percent
decrease from 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the National Bureau of
Statistics, the steel industry produced some 10.04 million tons of
steel in January, 1.78 percent more than the projected quota.
</P>
<P>
The sector's 46 key giant enterprises, with annual output
exceeding 500,000 tons, cut their steel output significantly.
Total output dropped 4.18 percent from the same period last year.
Of these 46 enterprises, 27 met their reduction quota, including
China's five largest steel producers--Anshan Iron and Steel,
Baoshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel and Capital Iron and
Steel.
</P>
<P>
However, the reluctance of small and medium-sized enterprises
to meet their reduction quotas has posed a serious threat to
restructuring China's steel industry.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these 46 enterprises, enterprises produced 1.49
million tons of steel in January, accounting for 15 percent of the
total and exceeding the quota by an astonishing 48.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Metallurgical Industry have taken
drastic measures to force reluctant enterprises to reduce their
steel output this month.
</P>
<P>
A special committee was formed to carry out the task of closing
down small steel factories nationwide and to manage steel output
on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also introduced policies to further
reduce the production of steel. Many favorable policies such as
lending loans for the restructuring enterprises and debt-to-equity
swaps will not be given to enterprises that can't meet the quota.

<HEADLINE> Lloyd Sacked as Davis Cup Captain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- David Lloyd has been sacked as
British Davis Cup captain after the Lawn Tennis Association "lost
confidence" in his abilities.
</P>
<P>
He has been replaced as non-playing captain by former Wimbledon
semi-finalist and world No.7 Roger Taylor.
</P>
<P>
His sacking follows his team's 4-1 defeat by the Czech Republic
in a World Group tie earlier this month and his subsequent harsh
words of criticism for British players Arvind Parmar and Jamie
Delgado.
</P>
<P>
He infuriated his team and earned the wrath of the LTA when he
said he believed many of the country's leading players were not
fit enough to compete at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd has been at loggerheads with the LTA for many years - and
he took another swipe at the sport's governing body as he left the
job.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see (Manchester United manager Alex) Ferguson being
sacked for criticising David Beckham," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But, I'm not surprised. The worse you do, the higher you go up
the ladder (at the LTA) and the more you get promoted, so I'm not
surprised at all."
</P>
<P>
Lloyd claimed he had intended to quit after Britain's next
Davis Cup tie.
</P>
<P>
"I expected it," he said. "I saw they were going to fire me and
I was going to resign after the next match.
</P>
<P>
"If the LTA had any brains and had waited, we wouldn't have had
to have any shouting matches."
</P>
<P>
The LTA's chief executive John Crowther said he believed Lloyd'
s comments had had an adverse effect on some members of the team.
</P>
<P>
Crowther said: "Having reviewed David Lloyd's recent conduct,
including his public criticism of the team in Ostrava and the
unnecessary adverse effect these had on players and coaches
connected to the Davis Cup squad, the LTA lost confidence in David
Lloyd's continuing captaincy."
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's five-year reign coincided with the emergence of Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski, Britain's best players for a generation.
</P>
<P>
They helped take the team back into the World Group - but the
Czech defeat means they must take part in a relegation play-off in
July.
</P>
<P>
The LTA will be hoping for an easier ride from new captain
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am very proud to accept this opportunity to captain
my country in the Davis Cup and look forward to working with the
leading players and coaches to compete successfully in the world's

<HEADLINE> Shearer Remains Adamant on Retirement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team captain and
striker Alan Shearer remained adamant that he will retire from
international football after the 2000 European Championships,
saying that he cannot keep playing a 12-month season.
</P>
<P>
But he remained silent on the matter of his managerial
ambitions,simply saying: "It interests me ... but it's not in my
mind. I have four years playing time left in me."
</P>
<P>
Casually dressed and looking relaxed, Shearer was his usual
taciturn self, the only new information he revealed being that his
wife is expecting a third child in September.
</P>
<P>
"If I want to continue playing at my best over the next four
years, I need to pace myself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With England I have been playing eleven-and-a-half, 12 months
a year and it can't go on forever."
</P>
<P>
Shearer said he had been thinking about giving up international
football for "the last four or five months".
</P>
<P>
"You don't let an honour like the England captaincy go away
quietly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had told England boss Kevin Keegan of his
intentions two days before England faced Argentina at Wembley last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Kevin wanted me do it (tell the public) on Tuesday, but I knew
it would overtake the game," said Shearer.
</P>
<P>
"He knows me more than most and he wasn't going to change my
mind."
</P>
<P>
He said that his decision to quit after "hopefully the next
nine England games" would help Keegan prepare for the next World
Cup in 2002.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that criticism of his captaincy had hastened his
departure, saying: "I use the criticism of fans and the media as a
spur for myself.
</P>
<P>
"You don't boo bad players ... David Beckham is a good example
of that."
</P>
<P>
Shearer said that there were many reasons for quitting, among
which was a desire to spend more time with his family "while they
are still growing up".
</P>
<P>
"It's a big decision, but I think it's the right one," he said.

<HEADLINE> Leboeuf Plans to Quit in Two Years Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Frank Leboeuf has
revealed he may quit the game at the top with Chelsea in two years
' time.
</P>
<P>
Leboeuf rejected a move to Tuesday night's Champions League
opponents Marseille just four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Although clubs must deal with each other first, Marseille
apparently contacted Leboeuf last month after hearing he was
unhappy at Stamford Bridge following the misconduct charge which
he faced for stamping on Leeds forward Harry Kewell.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old defender's answer was an emphatic 'no' because
he is determined to see out the remaining two years of his
contract at Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Winning the Champions League and the Premiership title remain
unfulfilled objectives in his career, even though he acknowledges
the increasingly frantic pace and physical nature of the English
game is taking its toll on players.
</P>
<P>
While his future remains unclear, he spelled out his desire
never to be "pitied at the age of 36, playing in the Second
Division" -even though he insisted Alan Shearer is quitting the
international scene too early at 29.
</P>
<P>
The French World Cup winner has flown back to his home city of
Marseille as Chelsea prepared to return to Champions League action
after a lengthy break to face the club with which Didier Deschamps
and Marcel Desailly both won the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Leboeuf declared: "Before coming to Chelsea, I almost signed
for Marseille two weeks beforehand - but Strasbourg wouldn't let
me go.
</P>
<P>
"Then, four weeks ago, they called me to ask me to join them.
</P>
<P>
"It was the open transfer market in France. Many players had
left the club; they heard I had some problems at Chelsea and
because I was from Marseille they were interested in me. But I
told them I had a contract at Chelsea and I was happy here," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Security experts on Tuesday
concluded a two-day discussion in Istanbul on dealing with the
black money issue, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The senior-level panel discussion, entitled "The Financial
Sources of Organized Crime," was held largely behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, experts who follow international black money
called for exploring new methods to track down and cut off the
financial sources of mafia and terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Emin Arslan, head of the Organized Crime and Smuggling Bureau of
the Istanbul Police Department, noted in his speech that the
meeting focused on the financial sources of organized crime gangs
because the matter threatens the whole financial system.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved important success in the struggle against
organized crime recently," Arslan claimed.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Istanbul Police Department and
Marmara University's Law Faculty, was attended by Turkish police
officers and dozens of security experts from some European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with a population of 10 million,
lies across Asia and Europe, serving as a bridge geographically,
culturally and economically. Local and international organized
crime gangs have also found way into the unique city, committing
various kinds of political and terrorist crimes.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: Israel Never Wants Real Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said on Tuesday that Israel had never wanted real peace in
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"Regular attacks by Israel on Lebanon and elsewhere are
sufficient proof of the disinclination of the Zionist regime to
peace," Khatami said while meeting with visiting Lebanese
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) as stressing that under the current circumstances, it is
extremely important that Arab and Muslim nations share the same
feelings and policies in confronting the "Zionist atrocity."
</P>
<P>
Muslim nations need to better understand the hard realities both
regionally and internationally for their own prosperity and
progress, Khatami told the Lebanese official, who is in Tehran to
attend an extraordinary meeting of the inter-parliamentary session
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which opened on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Berri extended his thanks for Iran's support for the cause of
Lebanon's resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and its
ally South Lebanon Army from the country.
</P>
<P>
Berri also conveyed an invitation from Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud for Khatami to visit Beirut. Khatami accepted the
invitation, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Welcomes Haider's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has welcomed the
resignation of Joerg Haider as leader of Austria's far-right
Freedom Party, hoping that it will be a positive gesture towards
Austria's European partners.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday during his visit to the Middle East, Swiss
Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss said the resignation would be a
constructive move if it had a positive influence on Austria's
relations with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU partners froze bilateral relations with the new
government in Vienna in protest at the inclusion of the anti-
immigrant Freedom Party in a coalition with the conservative
People's Party.Haider himself is not in the government.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has refused to comment on what it says are Austria'
s internal affairs and last week accepted Vienna's request for
Berne to be the destination of the chancellor's first official
trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
Deiss said that Switzerland would maintain good neighborly ties
with Austria.
</P>
<P>
However, Portugal, which currently holds the rotating
presidency of the EU, said it did not foresee a restoration of
normal relations between Austria and its 14 EU partners.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment our position remains the same," said the
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres. "The key question is
not the personality of Haider. It is the nature of his party."

<HEADLINE> Canada to Design Laser Defence for Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada wants to be the first to
design a laser defence for aircraft against incoming missiles, the
Ottawa Citizen reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Department of National Defence scientists are
attempting to equip a Hercules transport plane or a helicopter
with the laser system, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Laser would track the launch of an enemy ground-to-air
missile and "blind" the incoming rocket, making it lose sight of
its target.
</P>
<P>
The system would use what is called a laser dazzler to deal
with portable, shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles, such as the
American-built Stinger.
</P>
<P>
A pilot project of 500,000 Canadian dollars (about 344,550 U.S.
dollars) has already been worked out for a laboratory prototype.
Scientists will run experiments using a stationary missile,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. defence company has built a laser dazzler, but the
Canadian device would be the first to combine both a dazzler and a
laser to detect missiles, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rebels Reject Talks With Expelled NGOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese rebels said Tuesday
they would not negotiate with the 11 aid agencies which were
deported from southern Sudan for rejecting a new operating
agreement, accord to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The organizations, including Medecines Sans Frontieres, World
Vision, Oxfam and Care International, were ordered out of regions
held by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) by Tuesday
noon.
</P>
<P>
The agencies object to conditions in the document which would
give rebels more control over the agencies' operations, and would
allow them to charge for activities such as aircraft landings and
movement within rebel- held territory.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA broke off negotiations with the agencies in
mid-January and gave them an ultimatum to leave.
</P>
<P>
All expatriate staff had been evacuated, either by road or air,
by early Tuesday, the aid agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The agencies estimate they assist around 1.6 million people in
hunger- stricken southern sudan, a region which has been ravaged
by a 17-year war between the islamic government and the mainly
christian and animist rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Our entire operation has been put on hold," said Nigel Marsh,
 spokesman for World Vision. "We need to ensure aid is given out
without partiality, according to need, not according to politics."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agencies are exempt from the agreement and
will continue their operations as normal.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, US Sign Joint Energy Declaration. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A joint Energy Declaration was
signed Tuesday by Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez and U.S.
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, the Venezuelan Ministry
announced.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting held in London on Tuesday, the ministers
confirmed the importance of the economic and energy relations
between both countries and agreed to continue talks about the
world crude market and press the bilateral energy collaborations.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that oil supply at reasonable prices is
important and volatility of international prices will injure
consumer and producer countries.
</P>
<P>
In the same way, Rodriguez reiterated the Venezuelan
commitment to discuss with the other consumer and producer
countries about the crude market real situation, the economy and
the production levels, to protect growth and investments in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson had previous talked in Britain with his
counterparts from Mexico, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Norway, asking
them to increase crude output to avoid price surge. He has voiced
concerns that high oil prices could cause a slowdown in the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Rodriguez said on Monday that he did not expect the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase
output during the second quarter of this year because a seasonal
dip in demand during the period.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is OPEC's second-largest producer and a leading
player in arranging the output cuts that rescued prices from their
lowest in a generation. Venezuela is also the largest oil supplier
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
A final OPEC decision is not expected until ministers meet in
Vienna on March 27.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He May Still Use Strategic Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that he may use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if
other options fail to reduce oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"I have not taken the petroleum reserve issue off the table,
and I certainly wouldn't do that in the event that we don't seem
to have any other options," Clinton said before leaving the White
House for a political trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
Several Northeast lawmakers have urged the administration to
release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson and other administration officials have
repeatedly said they do not intend to do that. The reserve is
designed to ease supply disruptions and not to influence prices.
</P>
<P>
There is also concern that if the strategic reserve were tapped
it would make it more difficult to convince members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase
production when they meet in March to consider future production
strategies.
</P>
<P>
If production goes up, "then oil prices will go down, the
gasoline prices will go down, and that's really what is needed
here," Clinton said. "We'll see. I'm encouraged that that might
occur."
</P>
<P>
Richardson visited several leading oil-producing countries this
weekend but failed to obtain any firm promises that OPEC would
agree to significantly raise its self-imposed production cuts.
</P>
<P>
The cuts have caused oil prices to soar, from 11.37 U.S.
dollars a barrel a year ago to a nine-year high of around 30
dollars a barrel, and led to the highest average U.S. gasoline
prices ever.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged to Grant China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In the most basic sense, when we consider China's WTO and
permanent Normal Trade Relations, we are facing a clear choice,"
said at a luncheon hosted by the Asian Society.
</P>
<P>
"China is the world's largest country, and over the past
decade the world's fastest-growing major economy. The future
course of our relationship will have great bearing on American
security and strategy in the 21st strategy," she added.
</P>
<P>
She also holds that China's accession to the WTO and PNTR
would go far beyond trade and economic benefit to enhance China's
reforms and improve its human rights records.
</P>
<P>
China believes that it was a win-win deal, hoping that larger
American share of China's market will lead to more Chinese exports
to the American. It appeared that the deal was gathering support
at Capitol Hill despite strong opposition from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
The labor organizations fear that more American workers would
lose job in the face of streams of cheap foreign commodities.
However, Barshefsky argued that the consequence would be the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
"A New and fundamentally improved trade relationship with the
world's largest country, which offers practical, concrete benefits
to communities throughout America: stronger guarantees of fairness
for our working people and businesses; new export opportunities
that mean jobs and growth," she said.
</P>
<P>
Free-trade Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate has
urged Barshefsky to submit the trade legislation so lawmakers
could begin their deliberations. Any delay could bog the agreement
down in heated election politics, they warned.
</P>
<P>
In return, the White House asked the Republican-dominated
Congress to grant China the PNTR status, pressing for a vote in
May or sooner, if possible.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky believed that the vote should not be affected by
the ongoing EU-China WTO negotiations because, as she said, the U.
S.-China deal forms the basis for China's accession."Congress
certainly has the full means to vote on the basis of our agreement,
" she added.

<P>
Bogota, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of 15 armed men have
assassinate eight people in El Tigre farm, district of Casanare,
east of Colombia, police sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All victims were taken out of their homes by force Monday
night and then killed, police sources said, adding that such
massacre was made by the paramilitary group of Colombian United
Auto-defense fighting in that zone.
</P>
<P>
Five of the assassinated people were part of the Feliciano
family, the farm's owners and the other three were workers.
</P>
<P>
One hundred people have been killed by paramilitary groups in
the last two weeks, blaming them of collaborating with the
Colombian guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
Outlawed paramilitary forces, numbering up to 7,000 members
nationwide, have killed leftists and suspected rebel sympathizers
across Colombia for more than a decade. Human rights groups have
long blamed their secret, dirty war, for an overwhelming majority
of the peasant massacres and other atrocities committed INA
conflict that has taken more than 35,000 lives in the last decade.

GENEVA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland and Albania have

Albania and refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal signed in Berne Tuesday by visiting
Albanian Justice Minister Spartak Poci and his Swiss counterpart

About 50,000 people who were given temporary shelter in
Switzerland during last year's conflict are due to be "forcibly"
repatriated if they have not returned to Kosovo by the end of May,
said Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most refugees are repatriated to Kosovo by air to
Pristina, but the accord will make it possible for Kosovars to go
home overland. The deal was drafted in January, during a visit to

<HEADLINE> UK Exports Weaken As Domestic Demand Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) Household spending in Britain is
rising at its fastest annual rate since the late 1980s, fueling
fears that the pace of domestic demand growth has become
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative effects inflicted upon growth by the
recent drop in exports, the UK's economy as a whole grew by 2
percent in 1999, which was more than initial estimates.
</P>
<P>
David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England,told a
business gathering that there could now be "an opportunity to wait
and see how the economy develops", indicating the possibility of
an interest rate standstill.
</P>
<P>
Sharp rises in spending in the shops and on financial services
helped household expenditure to rise 0.8 percent in the last three
months of 1999, according to new official data.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the weakness of exports seemed a little
peculiar, given they had contributed positively to growth in the
previous two quarters.
</P>
<P>
"I an a little wary of these figures," said Danny Gabay, UK
economist at J.P. Morgan. "Net trade seems surprisingly weak, and
stock-building surprisingly strong. I would expect to see some
revisions to the composition of demand. "

<P>
LONDON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday it is
to pay for the charter of two more civilian helicopters to help
people fleeing the floods in Mozambique and deliver food to people
hit by floods.
</P>
<P>
This will add to the charter of four private helicopters from
South Africa used by the World Food program, which is already
being funded by Britain.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman in the Department for International Development
confirmed the moves.
</P>
<P>
Together with additional funds offered on Tuesday, they brought
Britain's contribution to the rescue efforts to three million
pounds($4.74 million), she said.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said further help is expected to be announced
later on Tuesday after a meeting between officials from the
Department for International Development and the Ministry of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
The officials are believed to be discussing how British forces'
helicopters could help with the rescue mission, and how Royal
Marine assault boats could also be used.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain was
continuing to look at ways it could offer assistance to the"
dramatic and very serious emergency" caused by weeks of flooding
in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"I can't confirm what may be announced as a result of the
discussions that are proceeding but we are looking at all possible
ways we can provide emergency assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are actively continuing even today to consider how we can
make further assistance to this dramatic and very serious
emergency," he added.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report said the death toll in four weeks of floods
across southern Africa is still pegged at 350, including 150 in
Mozambique, while aid workers say many hundreds of people must
have died.

<HEADLINE> China Supports Convening International Conference on Illicit Trade of Small Arms, Light Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- China supports the
convocation of an international conference on the illicit trade in
small arms and light weapons in all its aspects in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, the deputy Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, took the floor at
the first session of the Preparatory Committee for the proposed
international conference.
</P>
<P>
China "will actively participate in its preparatory process,"
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"China therefore sincerely hopes that this preparatory meeting
will be a success so as to lay a solid foundation for the smooth
convocation of the subsequent preparatory meetings and the
Conference in 2001," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons has in
recent years stood out as a hot issue, arousing the grave concern
of the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is firmly opposed to the illicit trade in any weapons,
including small arms and light weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the scope and objective of the Conference, "we hold that
the Conference and its Preparatory Committee should conduct their
work in strict accordance with the mandate as set out by the
report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms as
endorsed by (relevant) General Assembly resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee Monday began its first session here
for the U.N. Conference on illicit trade in small arms and light
weapons, which is slated for 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on
the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its
Aspects held the session, which is scheduled to end on March 3, to
decide the dates and venue of the 2001 Conference as well as on
the dates and venues of its subsequent sessions.
</P>
<P>
During the first two days of the session, the Committee will
elect the member of its bureau and hold its general debate, after
which it will exchange views on the agenda items concerned.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons
first appeared on the international political agenda in December
1995 when the General Assembly requested the U.N. Secretary-
General, with the assistance of a panel of experts, to report on
the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer, and on
ways and means to prevent and reduce them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, a number of global and regional initiatives have
emerged to curb the destabilizing accumulation and transfer of
small arms. Those include a moratorium on the importation,
exportation and manufacturing of small arms and light weapons in
West Africa by the Economic Community of West African States (
ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are also under way in Vienna to elaborate an
international convention against transnational crime, including a
revised draft protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and
trafficking in firearms, ammunition and other relevant materials.
Those negotiations are expected to conclude later in the year.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Foreign Trade Surplus Almost Halved in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy's foreign trade surplus for
1999 fell by almost half to 25.352 trillion (about 12.7 billion U.
S. dollars) from 48.417 trillion lire (about 24.3 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, according to figures released Tuesday by the
Italian national statistics bureau Istat.
</P>
<P>
The Istat figures showed that trade with non-European Union
countries for the entire year showed a surplus of 24.266 trillion,
compared to 15.807 trillion in 1998, with imports up 7.3 percent
to 154.326 trillion and exports down 2.9 percent to 178.592
trillion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade with EU countries during 1999 showed a surplus
of 1.122 trillion lire, which was a drop of more than 7 trillion
lire over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Istat said that the biggest surpluses were posted in the
machine, manufacturing, clothing and leather industries, while
minerals, electrical appliances, vehicles and chemical products
were the areas with the largest deficits.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> OAU Donates Half Million U.S. Dollars to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Monday donated 500,000 U.S. dollars to
Mozambique to help the country cope with devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim handed over a cheque of
500,000 dollars to permanent representative of Mozambique to the
OAU, Alexandre Zandamela.
</P>
<P>
"The contribution is a clear and firm expression of our sense
of concern and solidarity with the people of Mozambique," Salim
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone Eline swept southern Africa last week. A combination
of destructive cyclone, heavy rain storm, over-flowing rivers and
floods have reportedly claimed hundreds of Mozambicans' lives, and
make hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
At least 65.5 million dollars are needed for the rescue
operation, according to Zandamela, who is also Mozambican
Ambassador to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Stressing African solidarity in action, Salim appealed to
African and non-African heads of state and government to provide
and increase whatever support they can give to the people of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Africa, Botswana and Malawi have
offered the Mozambican government logistic support, including
helicopters.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Ask Donors to Help African Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press released available here Tuesday, the two U.N.
agencies expressed their concern over dramatic funding shortfalls
for humanitarian operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Monday joint appeal was prompted by a jump in the number of
refugees, which has led to a shortfall of 36 percent, or 81
million U.S. dollars, for food assistance to refugees in 16
African countries where the two U.N. agencies collaborate on
humanitarian activities.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees WFP expects to assist with food aid in
the 16 African countries this year is expected to rise to
2,065,000 from 1.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
The combined projected needs are 363,000 tons of food with an
estimated value of 221 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the largest funding problem is
in Tanzania, where by July WFP will be unable to feed some 525,000
people unless contributions are received immediately.
</P>
<P>
The refugee population in Tanzania recently swelled by 120,000
to 500, 000, most of whom came from Burundi. At the same time,
some 25,000 poor Tanzanians who live near the camps are also
receiving food from WFP.
</P>
<P>
The refugees receive a basic ration of maize, pulses and
cooking oil from the agency.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 countries where WFP and UNHCR have joint
operations, Kenya has the second largest funding crisis, with a
shortfall of 7.4 million dollars, or 30 percent of WFP's food aid
for refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, over 20,000 additional refugees have
flooded into Kenya to escape harsh conditions in Somalia and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Zambia have respective shortfalls of 7 million
dollars and 5 million dollars, U.N. officials said, noting that
the numbers of refugees in the region could easily rise over the
coming year and put even more strain on an already fragile
humanitarian operation.
</P>
<P>
WFP is the United Nations' front-line agency in the fight
against global hunger. In 1999, the U.N. agency fed more than 88
million people in 82 countries including most of the world's
refugees and internally displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Agrees to Ratify SADC Tourism Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Parliament Tuesday
agreed to ratify the protocol on tourism in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) allowing for the adoption of a
regional approach to promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was crafted in line with international travel
trends that show tourists normally visit more than one country,
said Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister Simon
Moyo.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, a regional approach to promote and integrate the
regional tourism policies can only accelerate the development and
growth of the tourism sector in member countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Tourism Organization of Southern Africa had
earlier launched a regional directory featuring various tourism
attractions of the region.
</P>
<P>
"Member states have recognized that a thriving tourism sector
can contribute to economic development as evidenced by the fact
that tourism has remained the fastest growing sector in the
region, despite the harsh economic environment we are facing,"
Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the protocol, the minister said, member
countries would have to harmonize their national policies,
strategies and programs.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among member states would extend to research and
making available national facilities for promotion of tourism
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would gain tremendously from the cooperation
because other countries in the region are much more advanced in
the areas of marketing, human resources, research and product
development.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe will take advantage in training its work force and at
the same time tap research data, which will improve local tourism
operations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rebels Reject Talks With Expelled NGOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese rebels said Tuesday
they would not negotiate with the 11 aid agencies which were
deported from southern Sudan for rejecting a new operating
agreement, accord to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The organizations, including Medecines Sans Frontieres, World
Vision, Oxfam and Care International, were ordered out of regions
held by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) by Tuesday
noon.
</P>
<P>
The agencies object to conditions in the document which would
give rebels more control over the agencies' operations, and would
allow them to charge for activities such as aircraft landings and
movement within rebel- held territory.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA broke off negotiations with the agencies in
mid-January and gave them an ultimatum to leave.
</P>
<P>
All expatriate staff had been evacuated, either by road or air,
by early Tuesday, the aid agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The agencies estimate they assist around 1.6 million people in
hunger- stricken southern sudan, a region which has been ravaged
by a 17-year war between the islamic government and the mainly
christian and animist rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Our entire operation has been put on hold," said Nigel Marsh,
 spokesman for World Vision. "We need to ensure aid is given out
without partiality, according to need, not according to politics."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agencies are exempt from the agreement and
will continue their operations as normal.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges for Improvement of Water Resources Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
called for the people to target the problems and challenges facing
the water resource management sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a statement released at the country's
first Water and Sanitation National Workshop titled "Challenges of
Managing Sustainable Water and Sanitation in the 21st Century in
Zambia" held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the government stressed the need for the
public, private sector, non-governmental organizations and all
other partners in the water and sanitation sector to join hands in
addressing the challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, and the region as a whole, faces enormous demands on
water resources with the population growing rapidly, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that this problem cannot be addressed by the government
alone, noting that it is for this reason that the government has
welcomed the establishment of the Water and Sanitation Association
of Zambia (WASAZA) at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Being a corporate member of the Eastern and Southern African
Region Chapter of the International Water Association, WASAZA aims
to assist in the development of professional competence and the
best practical performance standards for water and sanitation
management at both national and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to provide a forum through which all matters
relating to the management of water and sanitation can be
integrated through interdisciplinary discussions and agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary General
Emeka Anyaoku said Monday that the Nigerian government needed
"progress" in its battle against corruption before it could expect
to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Potential investors would like to see progress being made in
tackling corruption before agreeing to finance investment in
Nigeria," he said at the opening of a three-day
Commonwealth-Nigeria Investment Conference in Abuja, the capital
of Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-born secretary general also identified the
recurring religious and ethnic clash, and inefficiency of the
public service as " inimical" to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The problem relating to Sharia must be given great attention,
Anyaoku told entrepreneurs, bankers, and economists attending the
conference jointly organized by the Nigerian government and the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Lack of progress in rescheduling Nigeria's 29 billion U.S.
dollar debt would undermine the ongoing process of "political and
economic reform", warned Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that the 54-member organization would help bring
the debt issue to the world's attention.

HARARE, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's former freedom
fighters launched a countrywide invasion of white-owned commercial
farms to push for equitable redistribution of land, the daily
Herald reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday night the veterans had invaded at least 12 farms
countrywide in the past two weeks, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants Monday continued to pour into commercial
farms in different parts of the country, saying the time had come
to take "part of our heritage, which was illegally taken away
from our forefathers".
</P>
<P>
The invasions started in the southern Masvingo Province and
have now spread to virtually all the country's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
About 700 former freedom fighters Monday descended on Muzuri
Farms in Ruwa, just outside Harare.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the police were doing about the invasions, Police
Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said the issue was "above the
police" because it was political and referred the reporters to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Vice-President Joseph Msika, who is also chairman of

government would only take a position after the local leadership

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Disease Threatens Flamingos in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 29 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious disease is
killing tens of thousands of flamingos on Lake Bogoria in Rift
Valley Province, central Kenya, the East African Standard reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted conservationists as saying human pollution is
the cause of the disease which has since last July killed up to
50,000 birds on the lake.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the world's flamingo population live on the
eastern Rift Valley lakes, with vast majority living on the
30-square-kilometers Lake Bogoria, the real haven left for the
bird in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In every single bird which we collected and analyzed tissues,
we found up to nine or 10 heavy metals," said Gideon Motelin who
specializes in flamingo studies at Kenya's Egerton University.
</P>
<P>
"It is not normal to find arsenic, lead, mercury, chromium and
copper in the livers and kidneys of these birds," he said, adding
that traces of pesticide have also been found in the body tissue
of the dead birds.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists believe that the source of pollution is the
farms near Lake Nakuru, about 100 kilometers south of Bogoria.
Flamingos abandoned Lake Nakuru two years ago due to pollution as
the lake became virtually uninhabitable.

KAMPALA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and the Sudan will
resume ministerial talks on the implementation of the peace
agreement signed by the two countries' presidents last December.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister for Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda told Xinhua on

"We would discuss what major progress we have achieved so far

The peace agreement, brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy

returning prisoners of war or people abducted by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to restore full diplomatic relations by the end of
February if the commitment was fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
expressed his dissatisfaction with the lag of its implementation,
saying that the Sudanese government did not honor its promise of
returning all the children abducted by the rebel Lord's Resistance
Army in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and the Sudan have been accusing each other of backing
rebel activities on their respective land and cut diplomatic
relations in April 1995.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Debt Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government's debt
owed to the banks has increased to 878.9 billion kwacha (321
million U.S. dollars) from 695.6 billion kwacha (253 million U.S.
dollars) in December, according to Financial Mail on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increasing government debt raises concern in the private
sector and monetary authorities because it leaves less credit for
the private sector for investment or expansion which in turn
creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
The increased borrowing by the government also pushes up the
interest rates because the government has to offer higher
interests to attract the banks to buy its treasury bonds.

LAGOS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
vowed to appropriately manage its oil windfall arising from the
price hike in international market, local newspaper This Day

preparedness to seek international expertise of management to
assure that the oil windfall might not be misappropriated as

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Lose 80 Percent Conventional Forces: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi has lost 80 percent of his conventional forces since last
October, a repentant rebel general was quoted here on Tuesday by
the official newspaper Jornal de Angola as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to General Diogenes Malaquias, the ex-chief of the
operation division of the rebel Headquarters of the General Staff,
Savimbi suffered a desertion of 80 percent of his effectives in
last October during the battles around the central city Andulo, a
traditional rebel military headquarter which was taken over by the
government troops on October 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
 At this moment, the rebel troops are seriously shortstaffed,
with the conventional effectives accounting for less than 20
percent of its number in 1999, said General Malaquias, who did not
mention the loss of Savimbi's guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the repentant general, most of the rebel soldiers
still loyal to Savimbi are guerrillas, who have been launching
road ambushes, guerrilla warfares and other destructive actions
against the government's targets. It was estimated last year by
the Angolan government that Jonas Savimbi had some 60,000
effectives, including 40,000-strong conventional troops and 20,000
guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Bandit Attacks Cause Havoc in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Fortune-seeking through
armed banditry is surfacing in the Somali capital Mogadishu and
Middle Shabelleh region, causing havoc for both the business and
humanitarian activities.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen attacked the headquarters of Al-Barakat
Telecommunications Company in Jowhar town of Middle Shabelleh
region on Monday night, killing one of the security guards.
</P>
<P>
A source in Jowhar, 90 kilometers north of Mogadishu, told
Xinhua on Tuesday morning that the gunmen have taken away 9,000
U.S. dollars and two million Somali shillings (some 200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main child and maternity hospital of Mogadishu,
SOS, has been attacked by quite a large number of gunmen from the
Sarur subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
According to security guards of the hospital, dozens of gunmen
equipped with automatic assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades
and hand bombs have attacked the hospital with the aim of taking
control of the compound.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people from the two sides were wounded, five
from the SOS security guards and three from the perpetrators of
the attack belonging to the Sarur subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the area said the attacking gunmen were
repulsed back after the security guards of the hospital resisted
the attack and later on made a tactful counter-attack which foiled
the attempts of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The area of the hospital was tense on Tuesday morning despite
the deployment of Islamic court militiamen in the area following
Monday night's fighting.
</P>
<P>
There has been no central government in the Horn of Africa
country since 1991. And the Somali people are crying for peace
and reconciliation in the country haunted by civil strife.

LAGOS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency arrested 4,792 Nigerians for drug-related
offense in 1999, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Ogbonna Onovo, chairman of the anti-drug agency, told a press
conference Monday that 2,291 suspects were arrested with marijuana
at the country's sea and air ports alone.

As a result of a reinforced anti-drug trafficking exercise, a
total of 18,120 kilograms of drugs, among which about 98 percent
were "cannabis sativa", a locally grown and processed substance,
were seized last year, Onovo said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug official condemned the increasing use of
teenagers by drug farm merchants inside the country's thick
forests and warned that sterner measures will henceforth be taken
against the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The wicked farmers lured unsuspecting teenagers into the thick
forests to work for them with promises of generous incentives,
because these juveniles are not within the age range of those can
be prosecuted, Onovo added.
