<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's elections headquarters
announced on Saturday that 6,860 people have registered their names
for the 6th Majlis (parliament) elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, 504 of the total
applicants, or 7.3 percent, are women and the remaining 6,356 are
men and 35 non-Muslims have also registered to run for five seats
in Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The total seats of the next Majlis will be raised to 290 from
the current 270.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of applicants will drop after two stages of
screening by the Interior Ministry and the Guardians Council which
have the right to check the qualifications of candidates for
elections.
</P>
<P>
The two rival political camps, the conservatives who dominate
most of the country's state organs and the moderates who support
the reformist President Mohammad Khatami, have started their
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, headed by current Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq Nouri, are expected to maintain their majority in the Majlis
while the moderates hope to grasp more seats, paving the way for
the political reforms advocated by President Khatami.

<P>
Pierre Bemba as the leader of the Congolese Liberation
Movement is absent from the closed door meeting, John Wasswa, news
editor of the government-run New Vision daily told Xinhua
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Political Commissar of Uganda's ruling National Resistance
Movement James Wapakhabulo and Minister for Presidency Ruhakana
Rugunda are attending the rebels' meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
A secretary to Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the Congolese Rally
for Democracy based in Kisangani, said that the meeting is still
on and they may continue the meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to bridge deep rifts among the rival
rebel factions and form a common front. Wamba said Friday that
the meeting was aimed at facilitating the implementation of the
Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the civil war broke out in the DRC in August of
1998, Uganda and Rwanda chose to stand behind the rebels while
troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia were invited to fight
for the DRC government. The main rebel group RCD split in mid-May
due to strategic differences.
</P>
<P>
The belligerents signed a cease fire agreement in Lusaka,
Zambia, on July 10 in an attempt to end the year-old war. But
sporadic fighting has been reported in the country ever after the
peace pact. DRC President Laurent Kabila and Bemba are accusing
each other of violating the cease fire agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga was injured Saturday night in one of the two bomb
explosions which killed more than 25 people at two election
rallies here, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga was rushed to a private hospital in Colombo
undergoing emergency treatment on her eye injury and was out of
danger, the sources said, adding that the bomb blast, which
occurred at Kumaratunga's last election rally before Tuesday's
presidential polls, had killed at least 15 people and wounded some
100 including four cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign journalists were also wounded and hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred just a few meters from Kumaratunga as she
was getting inside her car after addressing the crowd at the
Colombo Town Hall grounds, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, presidential candidate of the ruling People's
Alliance, is seeking re-election in the presidential race slated
for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the blast at the Town Hall grounds, another bomb
exploded in a Colombo suburb at an election rally of the main
opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
The sources said the explosion has killed 10 people including
Major General Lucky Algama.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the two bombings.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared that a curfew was imposed in
Colombo and Gampaha districts from 11:00 p.m. Saturday to 6:00 a.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the UNP's presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake
and 51 others were killed in a similar bomb blast at an election
rally. The attack was blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate state for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the presidential election, LTTE rebels have
intensified their offensive in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Security sources have warned that LTTE suicide bombers have
infiltrated into Colombo to target presidential candidates.

Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China, expressed in a message to Mugabe
the wish that the Republic of Zimbabwe prospers and the Zimbabwean
people enjoy happiness under the leadership of the ZANU-PF.
</P>
<P>
Jiang hopes that the friendly cooperative relations between the
two parties, two countries and the two peoples of China and

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Accuses Parliament of Defaming Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-
Bashir on Saturday blamed the dissolved National Assembly
(parliament) for defaming the government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of civil service officials, al-Bashir
accused that the parliament led by ousted Speaker Hassan al-Turabi
had been determined to discredit the government over the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
That was why he decided to dismiss the parliament and declare a
three-month state of emergency nationwide last Sunday, al-Bashir
added.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was believed to grow out of a rift between al-Bashir
and al-Turabi over what al-Bashir viewed as an attempt by the
parliament to reduce his powers.
</P>
<P>
Al-Turabi suggested a vote in the legislature to install a
premier and directly elect state governors instead of appointing
them by the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir recommended putting off the vote, which was rejected
by al-Turabi.
</P>
<P>
The president accused the parliament of being more involved in
the constitutional amendments rather than other pressing issues as
national security.
</P>
<P>
He said his decisions were meant to unify the leadership and
reconsolidate the central government's authority over the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said contacts with the opposition for an overall solution to
the domestic troubles are under way. He stressed that the
government was making progress towards reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The south rebels have been waging a war since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the predominantly Christians and animists there while
the opposition groups in the north have struggled to share power
with the government.
</P>
<P>
The civil war and the accompanying famine have claimed nearly 2
million lives in the poor African country.

<HEADLINE> "Buying A House Is Very Good Investment": Halifax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) - Buying a home has been a very
good investment in the century, says Britain's largest mortgage
lender, the Halifax.
</P>
<P>
In its end-of-century report released Saturday, the mortgage
lender estimates house prices are 135 times higher now than in the
1930s, while prices in shops are only 37 times higher.
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt that for most people, buying a home has
been a very good investment even after stripping out the effects
of inflation," the report says.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, most towns and cities in Britain have
a wide range of different sorts of properties.
</P>
<P>
About two thirds are privately owned, only one in 10 is
privately rented and the rest are rented out by local councils or
housing associations.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax report shows people who bought their homes in the
1930s got a good deal. A house costing about 510 pounds is now
worth something in the region of 50,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Over long periods, house prices have beaten inflation across
Britain, the Halifax says.

<HEADLINE> UK Moves To Write Off Debts By Poorest Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) - Britain has been praised for
writing off hundreds of millions of pounds owed by the world's
poorest countries by debt relief campaigners.
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor Gordon Brown said that the first four
countries on the list - Uganda, Mozambique, Bolivia and Mauritania
- should have qualified for debt forgiveness by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today program: "It's obviously only a
start to completing this process of debt relief and poverty
reduction, but it is the important start that I think everyone is
looking for."
</P>
<P>
By April about 10 poor countries should be getting relief from
the suffocating burden of debt and the target for the end of the
year is more than 25, according to British officials.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Ann Pettifer said: "It isn't a great deal of money,
but it is politically very important, because Canada has already
committed to writing off its debt, so has the U.S, now Britain."
</P>
<P>
Former pop star Bob Geldof, a leading campaigner against third
world debt, told the BBC he was "thrilled" by the decision, adding
"I think future generations will remember a very simple and
confident gesture like this."

NAIROBI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Saturday welcomed the decision of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to resume negotiation with Kenya on the resumption of
aid.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he had lengthy discussions
with Goodwall Gondwe, IMF deputy director for Africa, in the
capital Nairobi, according to a news release from the Kenyan
Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of aid to Kenya would enable the east African
country to fight poverty and rejuvenate its economic growth, Moi
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board meeting Thursday mandated its technical team to
enter into negotiation with the Kenyan government on resumption of
the 205-million-U.S. dollar aid package which was suspended in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said the IFM team is
expected to visit Kenya in early January next year.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of IMF aid has negatively affected Kenya's
economy as foreign investors massively pulled out from the
country.

<P>
ABU DHABI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Oman is completely ready for
a smooth landing in the new millennium, with all key sectors Y2K
compliant, Omani National Economy Minister Ahmed Bin Abdul Nabi
Macki said in Muscat on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All our key sectors such as electricity and water,
communications services, oil and gas, health services, banking and
finance, commerce and industry, air transportation, sea transport,
publicity and public safety and security are today Y2K compliant,"
Macki was quoted by the official Oman News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the sectors, with the help of British
companies, are not only Y2K compliant but also ready with
contingency plans to face any unforeseen eventuality.
</P>
<P>
All the sectors have set up emergency offices which will
critically monitor the problems, if any, during or after the change
and will report the incidents to the Central Incident Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there will be a Crisis Management Committee to
handle any situation in the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem or the "millennium bug" is a programming error
which will cause chaos in computer systems that will mistake the "
00" date change for the year 1900 instead of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to point out that considerable preparation and
contingency planning work of high quality will minimize the chances
of any major failures on account of the Y2K problem in Oman at the
start of year 2000," the minister concluded.

MAPUTO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo), main opposition party of the country,
Saturday called for new elections in the beginning of the year
2000 under the direct supervision of the international community,
the Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Renamo demanded that the National Election Commission
declare the December 3-5 general elections null and void, unless
it announces Renamo's victory.
</P>
<P>
Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo group in the outgoing
parliament, was quoted as saying that the election process had
been rigged from the outset in favor of the ruling Mozambique
Liberation Front Party (Frelimo).
</P>
<P>
He said that Renamo officials on the election commission were
not allowed to have access to the results by the central and
provincial offices of the Electoral Administration Technical
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
And the national election commission, through its chairman,
Jamise Taimo, had announced "partial and official results to
mislead both the local and international public opinion on a
doctored Frelimo victory" before the final official results, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no sign that the international community
would be willing to fund another such exercise within the space of
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
The international community, notably the European Union, paid
for most of the costs of the second election in the southern
African country since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Company to Build Bulk Terminal in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian entrepreneur
said here Saturday that he will join hands with his counterparts
of the United States and Djibouti to construct a bulk terminal in
Djibouti Port.
</P>
<P>
Gebreyes Begna, general manager of the Amalgamated Ltd,
Ethiopia, said that the design work on the terminal has already
been finalized.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the terminal will enable the Port of
Djibouti to compete with other large international ports.
</P>
<P>
Large consignments will be unloaded and packed, which will soon
be dispatched to its destination, Gebreyes said, noting that
packing, which used to take one month before, will be reduced to
minimum of two or three days following the construction of the
terminal.
</P>
<P>
Gebreyes said that his company has already presented the study
on the terminal to Djibouti and is awaiting concession to launch
the construction work by next year.
</P>
<P>
The terminal will also offer services to other countries, other
than Ethiopia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Amalgamated Ltd. is one of the biggest private-owned
companies in Ethiopia that mainly engages in producing and selling
farm and sideline products, including fertilizers in addition to
grain processing.
</P>
<P>
The Port of Djibouti has become Ethiopia's sole outlet to the
sea and a major import and export channel after it engaged in war
with neighboring Eritrea since May 1998.

<HEADLINE> France to Reshuffle Military Spy Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jacques Dewatre, the chief of DGSE since 1993, will be replaced
by Jean-Claude Cousseran, the French ambassador to Turkey, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
With a 4,050-strong spying force manned by both military and
civilian personnel, the DGSE is in charge of looking for and
analyzing information concerning the national security of France,
detecting and blocking spying activities against France abroad,
and launching clandestine operations against anti-French
individuals or groups.
</P>
<P>
The DGSE, although officially put under the Defense Ministry,
directly reports to the French president and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The group has a budget of 1.66 billion francs (250 million U.S.
dollars) each year, and has an extra 200 million franc (33 million
U.S. dollars) operation fee directly subsidized by the government,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The DGSE is criticized by both President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin for doing virtually nothing during
the Kosovo crisis, losing contacts with its agents in Yugoslavia
during the war, and lacking transparency.
</P>
<P>
It is also blamed for failing to recruit and train personnel
specialized in collecting information in the fields of
international economy, trade, industry, technology, financial
crimes and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing DGSE chief was appointed by former conservative
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
</P>
<P>
His successor is a Socialist, an expert in Middle East affairs
and held several ministerial portfolios in left-wing governments.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Children Protest SLA's Shelling on School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Lebanese children
gathered here Saturday to protest against a shelling by pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) on a school in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Outside the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for
Western Asia in downtown Beirut, the young protestors held banners
calling for Israel's halt to attacks on children and civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Stop the Israeli terror. Don't target children," one placard
read.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the SLA fired three mortar shells on the Arab Salim
village, which faces the Israeli-occupied border zone in south
Lebanon. A bomb slammed into the village's school and wounded at
least 15 students.
</P>
<P>
Despite an apology for the shelling, Israel stressed the
operation was in retaliation for previous attacks launched by
Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas from the village.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a border strip in south Lebanon since
1985 and the SLA has helped the Israeli troops patrol the self-
styled security zone.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which is spearheading the country's resistance
movement to terminate Israel's occupation, denied that its fighters
had launched any attacks against Israelis or SLA militiamen on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place as Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-
Sharaa was in Washington for talks Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, the first in nearly four years aimed at ending a half-
century hostilities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the power broker in Lebanon and al-Sharaa will visit
Beirut Sunday to discuss the outcome of the Washington talks and
coordinate stances.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Flies to Saudi Arabia at Outset of Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
flew to Saudi Arabia Saturday evening, kicking off a Gulf tour
which will also take him to Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Mubarak's trip, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
told reporters that the Egyptian president will hold talks with
Gulf Arab leaders on a wide range of issues in the Middle East and
the Arab world. Moussa did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic analysts in Cairo said the leaders are expected to
discuss the latest developments of the Middle East peace process,
especially the resumption Syria-Israel peace talks, and to form a
supportive Arab stance to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed negotiations on Wednesday in Washington
after a suspension of nearly four years. Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa tried to
work out a framework for negotiations on Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War,
security arrangements and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Barak and al-Sharaa have agreed to continue talks in the U.S.
early next month.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi issue would also top the agenda of the talks in light
of a new U.N. resolution, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday, urging
the restart of weapons inspections in Iraq in return for possible
suspension of the nine-year U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq. Iraq
has rejected the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia sided with Kuwait during the Gulf War in 1991,
sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. It has not forgiven
Baghdad for its failure to apologize for the invasion and shelling
of Saudi cities in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, on its part, urged Iraq on Saturday to take the
resolution seriously and cooperate with the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad severed diplomatic relations with Cairo in the Gulf War.
But the two sides maintain close economic ties under the U.N. oil-
for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil
every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods
for its people.

LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United emerged from

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Announced to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema announced Saturday night that he would resign, opening the
way for a formal government crisis he hopes will end with his
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a parliamentary debate called to clarify
the situation in his fractious center-left majority, D'Alema said
he would shortly hand his resignation to President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi.
</P>
<P>
Opening the parliamentary debate which is expected to clarify
just how much support the premier has, D'Alema said the center-
left coalition needed to rediscover its direction and aims.
</P>
<P>
"I sense the need for a reaffirmation of the alliance's
fundamental ideas and program," he told lower house Parliament
Members, "for a clear strategic direction and for a coalition that
doesn't appear a momentary meeting but a project for government
today and tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks the government has appeared paralyzed by
bickering within the 10-party coalition which supports it in
parliament and the alliance's identity and goals have consequently
become blurred.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is said to be confident that most of his
allies will ask for him to be given a mandate to form a new
government, enabling him to reform his cabinet according to the
changed political picture.
</P>
<P>
Since D'Alema came to power a little more than a year ago, a
new party, the Democrats, has emerged as a strong force on the
center-left while relations with former president Francesco
Cossiga and his centrist followers have soured.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, who has appeared increasingly unpopular in the center-
left lately, lost his patience after the latest criticism against
him and said he was ready to go if he no longer had enough support
to govern.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his allies Saturday evening, he urged them not to
push for snap elections, which are an option open to President
Ciampi if it emerges that neither the present prime minister or
anyone else can muster a majority.
</P>
<P>
"The country does not need lacerations nor a traumatic
dissolving of parliament," he said.

<HEADLINE> Honduras to Take Contro-Measures against Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government
announced Saturday it will adopt in the next days unilateral
measures against the 35 percent tariff applied by Nicaragua to the
Honduran exports to that country.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran cabinet studies trade situation with Nicaragua,
said the Honduran Presidency of the Republic in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Honduras-Nicaragua relations soured after the Honduran
legislative assembly ratified November 30 a treaty of maritime
limits with Colombia that Nicaragua alleges that divest it of 130,
000 square kilometers of maritime platform in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government said in the document that the custom
tax and other coercive measures adopted by Nicaragua "violate the
General Treaty of Central American Integration."
</P>
<P>
Honduran businessmen have demanded the adoption of economic
measures against the Nicaraguan attitude, although up to now
Honduras has recourse only to regional organizations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua suspended the permits for Honduran fishing boats to
fish in its territorial waters, besides applying the 35 percent
customs tariff to Honduran commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran economic cabinet said it will examine with the
country businessmen the adoption of measures against Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Defends Zimbabwean Government's Land Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Saturday defended his government's land police, apparently
in response to predictions by some foreigners that the country's
economy is collapsing.
</P>
<P>
When closing the third National Congress of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), said that his
country's economy will not collapse despite predictions from some
foreigners who had been angered by the Zimbabwean government's
stance on the land question.
</P>
<P>
"British papers and former colonial masters say Zimbabwe will
collapse and the economy will collapse but here we are, moving
ahead," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not move back on the issue of our land and we say
'land to the people.' It is now or never," Mugabe declared.
</P>
<P>
He said without land the economy would not be controlled by
Zimbabweans who would continue to be observers in their country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged the newly elected Central
Committee members to set the pace for unity and desist from
pulling each down as that is to the detriment of the party's
progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work for unity among the people and respect their
status first ahead of ours but we can not do that with dishonest
and conspiracy among the leaders. That must be stopped," said
Mugabe who was reelected President of the ZANU-PF.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ZANU-PF is a people's party which is supposed
to gain respect from the people.

<HEADLINE> Argentine New President Gets More Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-three to 78 percent
of Argentines consider that President Fernando de la Rua will be
able to solve the main problems of the country, a poll raised by
the Gallup firm said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sounding results, show that 15 to 29 percent of those
queried said to have "little" or "none" confidence in the new
administration.
</P>
<P>
The polling reveals that the image of De la Rua grew almost 20
percent after a sounding made before the October 24 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six percent of the population believes in the promises of
the new government to reduce unemployment, while 27 percent said
they have "little" or "not any" confidence in the creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Also 66 percent showed "a lot" or "enough" confidence in De la
Rua promises to fight crime, while the best percentages obtained
by the new president were achieved in reference to themes about
democracy, freedom of speech, and the improvement of education and
public health.
</P>
<P>
The confidence of Argentines in De la Rua dropped when they
spoke of the solution of the huge debt. Only 48 percent of those
polled said they have confidence in the new government in that
matter.
</P>
<P>
For two years running Argentine has borrowed about 12 billion
dollars from foreign and domestic lenders to pay back interest on
existing debt, cover a bulging budget deficit and other financial
needs.

ROME, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Joel Chenal took his
first World Cup crown in Alta Badia, Italy on Sunday and denied
Austrian veteran Hermann Maier's hopes of a giant slalom hat-trick.
</P>
<P>
Maier had won the first two giants of the season but was
lurking in fifth place after a first leg that put Sami Uotila in
pole position for Finland's first-ever win.
</P>
<P>
Chenal, whose best previous finishes were last year when he
came fifth in a giant slalom at Kranjska Gora and in a slalom at
Schladming, was fastest in the second leg to move up from seventh
place to take the win.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Chenal clocked two minutes 39.68 seconds,
edging Maier to second place in 2:39.76.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Rainer Salzgeber, eighth after the first leg just 0.01
seconds slower than Chenal, was third in 2:39.95 after Uotila
failed to match his early pace and finished ninth.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Line to Link UAE, Bahrain, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A shipping line linking the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Iraq will be launched on
december 25 to carry both passengers and goods every week, a senior
UAE official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The shipping line, which links Port Rashid of Dubai, the UAE,
Salman of Bahrain and Umm Qasr of Iraq, will help efforts to
alleviate sufferings of the Iraq people, Sultan Ahmed Bin Suleyem,
director of Dubai Seaports Authority was quoted by the official WAM
news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the line would also create new business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based Naif Marine Services Company, operator of the
line, had expressed its desire to launch more lines between Iraq
and Gulf states, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company began a weekly ferry service between Dubai and Umm
Qasr late last year after securing U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. approved the expansion of the ferry service
to include Qatar and Bahrain. And a company official said the
expansion plan had been authorized by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
However, the WAM report did not give reasons to why the new line
to be launched later this month would not include Qatar.

President Bill Clinton called the two-day talks "a new beginning in
the effort to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the first time since returning from Washington,
Barak said in an interview with Israel's Channel Two television
Saturday night that some form of preliminary peace agreement could
be reached with Syria in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are talking about a group which has come
not only with an understanding of the problems ahead, but also with
a willingness to reach an agreement. This is an historic junction,"
Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to his comments, the head of one of the coalition
partners, the National Religious Party (NRP), threatened to quit
the government over peace-making with Syria.
</P>
<P>
If Barak wrapped up a peace accord, or even an agreement in
principle, with Syria over the next three or four months, then the
NRP would withdraw from the government, Housing and Construction
Minister Yitzhak Levy said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The NRP has six seats in the 120-member parliament. The
coalition government controls 68 seats.
</P>
<P>
"I understood from the prime minister that the intention is
within three or four months to consolidate an agreement, or an
agreement in principle," said Levy, speaking on Israel Radio. "
Then, I think we will get to the stage where we can no longer be in
the government."
</P>
<P>
But Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said that he was convinced
that most Israelis - including those in the religious camp - would
nonetheless approve a peace agreement if it is achieved.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that if the agreement is reached, and it goes
before the people, people will cross political lines to vote for
it," Beilin said. "I think in the end of the issue, the majority
who will understand that with the agreement, there will be no more
wars," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Introduces World Standard IC Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Five major Chinese banks have
introduced a new VISA-marked integrated-circuit (IC) card, the
first of this kind in China with an internationally acknowledged
standard.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new card will help promote electronic
applications in China's banking and payment systems.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai, and Changsha, a city in central-south China'
s Hunan Province, will be the first to employ the new IC card, and
the country will launch the card nationwide early next century,
sources with the People's Bank of China, China's central bank,
said.
</P>
<P>
The new card, with its applicability in all banks and commercial
transactions in China, will gradually substitute older forms of
the IC card, some experts predict.
</P>
<P>
The IC card project, which began in recent years in a number of
large Chinese cities, is part of the government's effort to
promote the construction of local information networks and
standardize IC card usage.
</P>
<P>
To back up the project with the latest technology, the People's
Bank of China also introduced a special regulation (the China
Financial IC Card Standard), which was drawn up in consideration
of compatibility with international standards.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, one of the first cities to carry out the project,
plans to finish reconfigure its automatic teller machines (ATMs)
and money-collecting machine, and improve the IC card issuance
systems and related services by the end of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes New U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday welcomed the
latest U.N. resolution on Iraq, saying it took into consideration
the security in the region, especially Kuwait's interests.
</P>
<P>
During a routine weekly session, the Kuwaiti cabinet voiced
relief on the resolution, hoping Iraq will take "serious and
practical steps in honoring its commitment to regional security and
stability," the official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Minster for Foreign Affairs Suleiman Majid al-
Shahin told Kuna that the resolution has "special importance" as it
emphasizes the key issues such as regional security, Kuwaiti
prisoners and its property in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted on Friday resolution 1284,
which demands Iraq's cooperation in allowing a new U.N. weapons
inspection body to enter Iraq in return for a possible suspension
of the nine-year U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors withdrew from Iraq shortly before the U.
S. and Britain launched massive air strikes against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
The new resolution also required Baghdad to cooperate fully in
meeting humanitarian obligation to account for missing people and
return Kuwaiti property.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait believes there are still more than 600 Kuwaitis and third
country nationals held in Iraqi jails and an unknown amount of
Kuwaiti properties were stolen to Iraq during its invasion and
occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991. But Baghdad denied the Kuwaiti
accusations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President to Reshuffle Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo may announce a major reshuffle in his cabinet anytime
from now, presidency sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day retreat for ministers and permanent secretaries
which kicked off on Saturday in Abuja, the president was said to
be very worried and angry at reports about persistent incidence of
corruption in some ministries, This Day newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo regretted that after six months in office, some of his
 ministries are lack of adequate transparency in their activities,
 especially with regard to contract awards, despite of the
anti-corruption crusade which forms a major policy plank of his
government.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that at least six ministers would be dropped in
the impending cabinet reshuffle because of various allegations of
shady contract deals in the discharge of their duties while a few
special advisers may be promoted full cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said that the second retreat was part of the on-going
learning process to appraise how the government has performed and
that at the end of the retreat, "we shall be in a position to have
a focus on where we want to be by the end of next year."
</P>
<P>
The president used the first retreat, which was held last June
ahead of the inauguration of the ministers, to intimate the
ministers of the vision and policy direction of his administration
which he emphasized was a clean break from the past 15 years of
military rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Fangcheng in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has taken the
lead in returning reclaimed farmland back into jungle.
</P>
<P>
The local government will allocate two million yuan to
compensate those who sacrifice their own agricultural farmland to
replace it with spice trees.
</P>
<P>
This project will help add 20,000 hectare of eucalyptus
coverage, 100,000 hectare of aniseed trees, and cultivate 200,000
hectare of jungle in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The Qingfang Forestry Action Plan was approved by the State
Forestry Administration and aided by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization. It is considered a crucial method for
protecting China's major tropical reserve in the Shiwan Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The jungle, covering 150,000 hectares, is home to many
endangered species of plants and animals. Traces of pollution and
soil erosion, however, have been found in some areas due to human
encroachment over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
The entire ecological recovery project is expected to cost 700
million U.S. dollars, according to local experts, who said it will
be carried out with government funding and donations from
international organizations, enterprises, and individuals.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Hold Talks With King of Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua)-- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will pay a two-day visit to Amman on Monday, to hold talks
there with King of Jordan Abdullah bin Hussein, Israel Radio
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders will discuss issues of Arab
solidarity and coordinate with each other in order to move the
peace process forward, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss the issue concerning the
Israeli-Syrian peace track and the problems facing the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks, foreign diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks were held up last
month after Israel's announcement of issuing more tenders for
building new houses for settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side refused to discuss other issues than the
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
scheduled Sunday in the West Bank city of Jericho was postponed by
the Israeli side, saying the Palestinian's early leaks to the media
of the meeting and its location would cause security difficulties
for Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli final-status negotiating teams are set
to meet on Monday at Shoresh near Jerusalem to continue their
talks, but no progress is expected on any issue that will be
discussed, the diplomats said.

<P>
DHAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Executive Director of
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol Bellamy said
here on Sunday that Bangladesh would be given increased fund for
combating arsenic contamination in the country.
</P>
<P>
The assurance came when the UNICEF chief called on Bangladeshi
Family Welfare Minister Salahuddin Yusuf, the official BSS news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf informed Bellamy that 30 million people of the country's
more than 120 million population are living in the arsenic zone
and already 5,000 arsenic patients have been detected.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also called on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and met
other government officials on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Set up Headquarters to Tackle Y2K Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Ministry has
decided to set up a headquarters from December 25 to January 6 to
prevent the possible problems caused by the millennium bug (Y2K),
Deputy Interior Minister for Planning Hedayatollah Aqaei said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aqaei said the aim for setting up the headquarters is to tackle
Y2K virus which might cause problems in some computerized units,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Although the possibility is weak, necessary steps should be
taken to prevent the subsequent economic and social damage, he
said, adding measures have been taken since two years ago for
making changes in software programs in several industrial units,
banks, economy and finance ministry and a number of other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that prior to the start of the year 2000, the
headquarters will receive reports on energy and transportation
every two hours in order to make proper decision in case of any
possible difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Since hardwares have been mainly designed domestically, the
headquarters will be only in charge of preventing the crisis, he
added.
</P>
<P>
As an official from Iran's Electronics Council, Gholamhussein
Narjabadian said last week that the country has formed an emergency
center to help prevent probable damages created by Y2K threatening
domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
Narjabadian said that the center has now become operational in
two different places in Tehran and is ready to give a free of
charge services to the applicants.
</P>
<P>
The center will also provide applicants with the full technical
information and assist them to identify and remove the existing
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Iran's computer-controlled systems were bought from the
U.S. before the 1979 Islamic revolution, but it has been unable to
get U.S. help to modify the computers for the Y2K because of the
hostile relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But industrial experts believe that Iran might be less
vulnerable to the bug because of the low-tech nature of its
banking, services and most industry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ruling Party Insists on Socialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 19 (Xinhua)-- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) has not abandoned
socialism but redefined the ideology, a party official said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
National Political Commissar of ZANU-PF Moven Mahachi told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the party's socialist ideology was based
on historical and cultural experiences of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the ideology emphasized respect for human rights and
uplifting of living standards for the majority, especially the
under-privileged.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we cannot continue to be isolated from the
rest of the world economically but believe we can be involved
through a socialism based on openness in our society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a historical factor in Zimbabwe that individuals
and organizations were allowed to own companies which showed the
spirit of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party had been under pressure to reform its ideology
when the government declared it was abandoning socialism for a
free market system in the early 1990s.

MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia remains the
Philippines' leading destination of overseas Filipino workers (
OFWs),the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued here, POEA said that Saudi Arabia has
consistently been the favorite OFW destination with 161,105 of
them documented during the first nine months of this year,
representing a 4.28 percent increase over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of Filipino workers to the Mideast country is 24.
24 percent of the total 664,643 OFWs in the first three quarters
of the year, it said.
</P>
<P>
POEA Administrator Raynaldo Regalado said other major
destinations of OFWs were China's Hong Kong and Taiwan, Japan, the

<HEADLINE> Fahd, Mubarak Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-
Aziz and visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday
night reviewed the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process following the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, whose countries are Arab and Gulf heavyweights,
discussed means to extend Arab support to Syria in the new round of
talks with Israel and in its efforts to recover the Golan Heights
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed negotiations on Wednesday in Washington
after a suspension of nearly four years. Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa tried to
work out a framework for talks on Israel's pullback from the Golan
Heights, security arrangements and other issues.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed to continue talks in the U.S. early next
January.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived in Riyadh Saturday night on a Gulf tour
which will also take him to Qatar and Bahrain, also discussed with
King Fahd the Iraqi issue following the adoption of a new
resolution on Iraq in the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for the resumption of weapons inspection
mission in Iraq, in exchange for possible suspension of the U.N.
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion and
occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia sided with Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf war that
ended the Iraqi occupation of the small Gulf emirate. Riyadh has
not pardoned Baghdad for its reluctance to apologize for the
invasion and shelling of Saudi cities in the war.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, on its part, urged Iraq on Saturday to take the
resolution seriously and cooperate with the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ceased diplomatic ties with Egypt during the Gulf war. But
close economic links have been maintained under the U.N. oil-for-
food program, which allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil
every six Months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods for the sanction-stricken Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
As Mubarak will proceed to Qatar later Sunday, and then to
Bahrain, political observers have cautioned that he was facing a
tough job to strike a consensus in this respect with the Gulf
leaders as the Gulf Arab states are differing on ways to deal with
Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Malaysia's BN Obtains New Mandate Amid Economic Recovery (part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Analysts say BN Chairman Mahathir will lead Malaysia into the
new millennium with a strong and fresh commitment: "to make sure
we as a nation remains free, sovereign and independent, prosperous
and the people live in peace and harmony."
</P>
<P>
While accepting the BN's defeat in Kelantan and Terengganu,
Mahathir who won the election for the seventh time said that the
BN victory with more than a two-thirds majority shows that the BN
is still enjoying high popularity.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noticing that the BN returned with a renewed
mandate against the background that the country's economy is
firmly on the path of recovery as a result of the measures
implemented by the BN government.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economic recovery is progressing well and faster
than expected. The policies and strategies Malaysia devised,
including selective capital controls imposed in September 1998,
are best suited to local conditions in dealing with the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The solution," as Mahathir put it, "is entirely our own,
inspired perhaps by others but the actual design has never been
formulated before and we designed it in such a way that it is
suitable for us."
</P>
<P>
"It did not have to go through the misery of massive
unemployment; the tragedy of children thrown out of schools; the
decimation of the middle class which we have spent a generation to
build; blood on the streets and political turmoil throughout the
land," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy recorded an 8.1 percent gross domestic
product (GDP) growth in the third quarter of 1999, the fastest
growth in the region, except for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth in the third quarter doubled its pace from 4.1
percent in the second quarter and a negative 1.3 percent in the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economic recovery is broadly-based. During the third
quarter of 1999, the manufacturing sector posted an impressive
growth of 19.5 percent from 10.8 percent in the previous quarter,
the agriculture sector grew by 3.8 percent, and the construction
sector turned around to register a growth of 0.9 percent, the
first positive growth after six consecutive quarters of a negative
growth.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand, excluding stocks, rose by 7.6 percent, boosted
by the accelerated public spending and the favorable performance
of the export sector.
</P>
<P>
The recovery has also been achieved in an environment of low
inflation rate, improved labor market situation, continued large
trade surplus and rising international reserves.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate moderated to 2.3 percent in the third
quarter from 2.7 percent in the second. For the first 11 months of
the year, the inflation rate increased only by 2.8 percent over
the corresponding period of last year, the latest official
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapid economic growth, the unemployment rate for
1999 has been revised downwards to 3 percent from 4.5 percent
earlier.
</P>
<P>
By October 1999, Malaysia recorded a trade surplus for 24
consecutive months with the total trade surplus for the first 10
months of 1999 amounting to 58 billion ringgit (15.263 billion U.S.
dollars), up 28.1 percent from a surplus of 45.3 billion ringgit (
11.921 billion dollars) in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian State Bank Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said all
these showed that the country had completely recovered from its
worst recession of 1998 when the economy contracted by 7.5 percent.
He is confident that the central bank's estimated GDP growth of 4.
3 percent for the outgoing 1999 could be materialized.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Malaysia's BN Obtains New Mandate Amid Economic Recovery (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 19 (Xinhua) -- As the year 1999 was
drawing to an end, Malaysia's ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (
National Front) obtained a renewed mandate in a snap general
election on November 29, which analysts say will ensure the
country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The 10th general election, the first election after former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was sacked and later jailed
for corrupt practices, drew the world attention because the Anwar
issue had aroused political unrest in the country and how far the
issue would influence the electorate would be tested.
</P>
<P>
In the election, termed as the most fierce fight between the
ruling and opposition parties, the 14-party ruling BN led by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the opposition Barisan Alternatif (
Alternative Front) comprising four parties -- Parti Islam
SeMalaysia (PAS Democratic Action Party (DAP), Parti Keadilan
Nasional (Keadilan (National Justice Party) and the People's Party
of Malaysia, headed for straight fights in nearly 80 percent of
the 193 parliamentary constituencies, the highest number since the
first election in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The election witnessed the split among Malay voters due to the
Anwar issue. However, the whole exercise went through without any
untoward incidents nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The BN won the election by securing 148 out of the 193
parliamentary seats, 19 more than the two-thirds majority, but the
election was costly for the BN, particularly for Malaysia's
largest political party -- the United Malays National Organization
(UMNO), the BN's backbone component representing the interests of
Malays for as many as four ministers and five deputy ministers
from UMNO failed to retain their seats.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with a turnout of 70 percent of the total 9.6 million
voters in the election, the BN obtained 56 percent of popular
votes, lower than the 63 percent it gained in the 1995 general
election, while the rest 44 went to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The narrow winning margins should act as a rude wake-up call
not only for UMNO but for all BN components, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
On the opposition's part, though it came out short of its
target of denying the ruling BN's two-thirds majority, it made
inroads into more states and increased its representation in Dewan
Rakyat (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The election saw the emergence of a stronger PAS, another major
Malay-based party with its intention to set up an Islamic State,
and a weaker non-Muslim-based DAP.
</P>
<P>
PAS was the biggest winner, not only retaining the Kelantan
state government for the third term, but also capturing the
eastern state of Terengganu as well as gaining 27 parliamentary
seats, more than triple their previous tally of eight. It now
becomes the largest opposition party in the country.
</P>
<P>
DAP won 10 parliamentary seats, but its Secretary-General Lim
Kit Siang who had been Parliament opposition leader for 30 years,
its president and deputy president all conceded defeat in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Keadilan led by Wan Azizah Ismail, wife of Jailed Anwar, won 5
parliamentary seats; but the People's Party was nowhere.
</P>
<P>
With PAS's strength expanded, its President Fadzil Noor was
chosen as Opposition Leader in Parliament at a meeting held
recently.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there emerged a new phenomenon in Malaysia's
politics that both the ruling and opposition fronts are dominated
by Malay-based parties -- UMNO and PAS. Malays account for some 59
percent of Malaysia's 22 million population.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Malaysia's BN Obtains New Mandate Amid Economic Recovery (part 3) ...1999 could materialize. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both the central bank governor and the Finance Minister
attributed the strong growth to the government's "correct and
effective" management and financial policies and to the stable
conditions brought about by the imposition of selective capital
controls and the fixed exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was once criticized for imposing capital controls.
Many had forecast "massive outflows" of funds once the selective
capital controls were relaxed on September 1, 1999, but the net
outflow of 1.8 billion dollars in September and October, according
to the central bank, was far below the 5 to 6 billion dollars
predicted earlier.
</P>
<P>
And this turned around as there was a net inflow of 195 million
dollars in the first three weeks of November, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves resumed their uptrend, amounting to some 30
billion dollars, sufficient to finance 6 months' retained imports.
</P>
<P>
Many now acknowledge that Malaysia's policies have worked. The
World Bank said in one of its reports that Malaysia's economic
success was due to it being "agile" where the policies are adapted
and adopted to suit the prevailing economic conditions both at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable turnaround from the Asian financial crisis and
the result of daring yet pragmatic policies implemented by the
Mahathir government helped the ruling BN win voters as analysts
say most Malaysians have confidence in the government's capability
in management of the economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Now that a new BN government has been formed, observers see the
retention of most incumbents in the new Cabinet as an indicator of
continuity in the government's policies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that the BN's two-thirds majority in the
Parliament will ensure continuation of implementing economic
policies to improve the economy's fundamentals to enhance
investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
They say the two-thirds majority secured by the BN also
reflected the people's continued desire for stability. And they
view the concept of sharing power among various races which is
pursued by the ruling coalition as a guarantee to political
stability in the country and peace and harmony among the races.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is expected to see its GDP growth return to the pre-
crisis levels next year, the World Bank said in its Global
Economic Prospects 2000 Report.
</P>
<P>
However, economists say that a major challenge facing the
country as it moves towards strengthening and sustaining the
national economic recovery is that of prompt implementation of the
measures recommended in the National Economic Recovery Plan.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a dynamic situation, so there must be continuing
action. We need the momentum to be kept up. That is a challenge,"
said well-known industry observer and economist Ramon Navaratnam,
who is a director of the Asian Strategy &AMP; Leadership Institute (
ASLI).
</P>
<P>
Another challenge is that Malaysia should improve the level of
productivity, which the economists say is lagging behind those of
its ASEAN neighbors such as Thailand, Singapore and even Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Pak Official Calls for More Dialogue in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Advisor to Pakistan's Chief
Executive on National Affairs Javed Jabbar has called for greater
dialogue between political forces of South Asia to tap the
potential of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We can not escape geography as we are destined to live in this
region but all the countries of South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have to turn inward and away from
Indo-centric vision to open up new growth channels,"Jabbar said
Sunday in a Pakistan TV program.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lot of channels have opened in this age and "we
can build bridges between SAARC countries and sustain them through
media, communications, trade and contacts between civil societies.
"
</P>
<P>
One has to take a combination of initiatives at government and
civil society level to fully exploit and strengthen SAARC, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jabbar pointed out that Pakistan has an abundant range of
talents and skills in entrepreneurship, diplomacy, journalism,
research and environment.
</P>
<P>
"We tend to underestimate ourselves, we seriously under-
evaluate our capacity to play a much more active role in SAARC,"
Jabbar added.
</P>
<P>
"We need to reconstruct ourselves and build internal structures,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
As for India, he said, one has to differentiate between the
Indian government and civil society which comparably has a more
constructive approach towards Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that the Indian government has not been able
to reflect the goodwill and constructive approach which was felt
in the mainstream of India.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Flag Lowered in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The national flag of Portugal on
top of the Praia Grande Palace, Governor's Office of Macao, was
lowered at 5:02:57 this evening, to the tone of the Portuguese
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The final lowering of the Portuguese flag that had been flying
in Macao for hundreds of years marks the end to the Portuguese
rule over the territory and a new historic period Macao will soon
move in.
</P>
<P>
As the Portuguese flag was lowering, the outgoing Governor
Vasco Rocha Vieira, who looked solemnly and was in black suit,
stood still, facing the governor's office. He was joined by major
officials of the Portuguese Macao Government and a 60-member honor
guard of Macao's security police. Dozens of Chinese and foreign
journalists as well as hundreds of civilians witnessed the
historic event.
</P>
<P>
A police folded the flag and handed it to the governor who then
held it to his chest and bowed to those present. Afterwards, the
governor got in a black limousine and departed. The whole ceremony
lasted less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Praia Grande Palace, a red-wall-white-window building in the
coastal area of Nam Van in the Macao Peninsula, has been
governor's office since June 1875, and the office of the
Legislative Council for years. Since Dom Francisco Mascarenhas
became the first governor of Macao in 1623, 127 Portuguese
governors have been assigned to the territory.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been Chinese territory for thousands of years. It had
been gradually falling in the hands of Portuguese since the mid-
1500s. On April 13, 1987, after rounds of friendly talks, China
and Portugal signed the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration,
confirming that the Chinese Government resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999. China will adopt the
policies of "one country, two systems", "Macao people
administering Macao" and a high degree of autonomy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the Chinese and Portuguese governments will
jointly host a ceremony on the transfer of power at the Macao
Cultural Center.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Macao's Return (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper "
People's Daily" is to publish an editorial tomorrow hailing the
return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, headlined "A Glorious Chapter in Chinese History,
" says that the raising of the national flag in Macao at 00:00 on
December 20, proclaims Macao's homecoming to the world.
</P>
<P>
"This represents another great event in the reunification cause
of the Chinese nation since Hong Kong's return to the embrace of
the motherland on July 1, 1997," it notes.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Macao will enter a new era, and the Chinese-
Portuguese friendship and cooperation will continue developing
from a new vantage point.
</P>
<P>
Generations of the Chinese people have dreamed of this moment.
It is a time of festivities for Macao compatriots and the Chinese
nation as a whole. China should "toast our nation's revitalization
and prosperity!"
</P>
<P>
Macao has been a territory of China since ancient times. Since
its occupation by Portugal in the mid 16th century, the Chinese
people have fought a protracted struggle for the reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
However, the savagery of the feudal governments and the
internal fights, corruption and incompetence of the Kuomintang
government made it impossible for the nation to regain the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949
completely changed the lives of many people. Becoming stronger and
more prosperous each day, the Chinese nation won the status and
respect it deserved.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, 1987, China and Portugal issued a joint
declaration on the issue of Macao, which paved the way for Macao's
stable transition and smooth return to the motherland.

COLOMBO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Several foreign leaders have

Kumaratunga who sustained injury Saturday night in suicidal
bombing here, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police said President kumaratunga was injured in the face when
a woman suicide bomber attacked the ruling People's Alliance's
election rally in the Colombo Town Hall ground, leaving 21 dead
and 84 injured including three cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
The foreign leaders expressed their concern and sympathy and
wished Kumaratunga a speedy recovery while condemning the

President Bill Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac and Indian

<TEXT>
<P>
The three generations of leadership of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and generations of the Chinese people have contributed
to the reunification of the motherland. At this jubilant moment in
the nation's history, China cherishes all the more the memory of
Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries, the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that history has proved that without the leadership of
the CPC and the struggle of the Chinese people, there would be no
New China and no national independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
And without reform and opening up and the huge success of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, there would have been no
prosperity and revitalization of the Chinese nation and no smooth
return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that Macao's return has opened a new
chapter in the annals of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
But a lot still needs to be done to fully carry out the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "the people of Macao
govern Macao," it says.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to study and implement Basic Law of the Macao
SAR, which is a fundamental guarantee for Macao's long-term
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"It's our firm belief that the Macao SAR government will
shoulder the historic responsibility in the wise governing,
building and developing of Macao in line with the Basic Law," the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The prosperous motherland will give strong support to Macao no
matter what difficulties or challenges it may face, just as it did
in the case of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also expresses the confidence that the country
ultimately will solve the issue of Taiwan and realize the goal of
complete reunification of the motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani arrived here Sunday morning to discuss with Iranian
officials on the way to end the civil war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Rabbani will
discuss the latest developments in Afghanistan as well as
mechanisms to settle the crisis during his three-day stay in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said upon his arrival that he intends to exchange views
with Iranian officials on ways of settling disputes in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh, who
received Rabbani at the airport, expressed hope that the Afghan
problems will speedily come to an end through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's visit to Iran came after Pakistani Chief Executive
Pervez Musharraf assured Iranian leaders during his first official
visit to Iran earlier this month that Pakistan will make sincere
efforts to cooperate in solving the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Afghan Ambassador to Iran Sayed Mohammad Khair Khah
last week rejected the suggestions that Rabbani's visit is a result
of Musharraf's visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard a lot from the Pakistani officials," Khair Khah
said, "but the fact is that we want action and not word only."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Probes into Poll Rally Bomb Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is conducting
inquiry into the twin bombings in and near Colombo Saturday night
which killed 24 people and wounded 129 others including President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, a senior government official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told a news conference here
that two special committees have been set up to investigate how
the serious security lapses could happen especially amid tight
security and who are responsible for the lapses.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings of the two committees will come out by
Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera quoted President Kumaratunga as saying that the
fourth presidential election will be held on Tuesday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga has also instructed the police to strengthen
security around Tamil-dominated areas to prevent communal
disturbances as the bombings are widely considered the work of the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have
intensified their attacks in their 16-year-old fight for an
independent Tamil state.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera said Kumaratunga was "recovering speedily" in the
hospital where she was rushed to on Saturday night for emergency
treatment to remove shrapnel near her right eye following the
suicidal bombing in her last election rally at Colombo Town Hall
grounds.
</P>
<P>
the minister denied speculations that Kumaratunga lost her
eyesight due to the bombing which killed 21 people and wounded 84
others including three ministers.
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, the bomb explosion by a female
suicide bomber occurred about 9:20 p.m. local time Saturday. Among
the dead were Colombo Deputy Inspector General of Police T. N. de
Silva, three members of the Presidential Security Division and
some Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera said the president will make a recorded address to
the nation this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In another bomb blast about 9:45 p.m. Saturday, three people
were killed and 45 others were injured when the main opposition
United National Party was holding the election rally on the last
day of campaigning in suburban Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the two bombings but
former similar attacks have been blamed on the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sunday that some foreign
leaders have sent condolence messages to President Kumaratunga,
wishing her quick recovery while condemning the assassination
attempt on the president.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders were U.S. President Bill Clinton, French
President Jacques Chirac and Indian and Pakistani leaders.

<P>
BEIRUT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Sharaa postpones a scheduled visit to Lebanon on Sunday to
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Radio Sunday reported that Al-Sharaa told Lebanese
Prime Minster Salim Hoss by telephone of the postponement, without
giving reasons.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa had planned to visit Lebanon on Sunday to brief
Lebanese leaders on the outcome of the just-concluded Syrian-
Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Al-
Sharaa in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday were the first in
nearly four years, which mainly dealt with Israeli withdrawal from
the occupied Golan Heights, security arrangements, the rights to
water resources and normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to return to Washington on January 3
to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, where Syria has been a power broker, has been following
Syrian foreign policy, especially on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, who is recovering from a heart surgery, returned
Friday night after a long flight and has to report the results of
the talks to Syrian President Hafez Assad, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said Lebanese government is waiting for the
results in order to make preparations for possible resumption of
peace negotiations with Israel, which has been occupying a border
strip in south Lebanon since 1985.

In the morning, a delegation of more than 100 people both from
home and abroad held a ceremony in the 880-square-meter courtyard
where Deng was born in 1904 and lived for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yuzhi, a retired county official, gazed at the portrait
and said: "I have two pieces of good news for you. First, Macao
will return to the motherland tomorrow. Second, people in your
hometown have escaped poverty and are leading a well-off life."
</P>
<P>
In Paifang Village, the present farmers yearly income per
capita has risen to 2,200 yuan (about 265 U.S. dollars), ten times
the figure in 1978. Some 80 percent of households have bought
televisions, 70 percent have telephones and several even own
mobile phones, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, who passed away in 1997, is deemed as the chief
architect of China's reforms and opening up and creator of the "
one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jiuling, a compatriot from Macao, said that Deng made
invaluable contributions to the smooth return of Hong Kong and
Macao to the motherland. "The whole Chinese nation owes thanks to
him," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Nanpu, a man from Taiwan residing in the United States,
said he came all the way to Guang'an to show his respect for Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, the number of visitors to Deng's
birthplace was 20,000 more than that of the corresponding period
last year. Some 30 percent of the visitors came from Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
So far, 5.8 million people have visited Deng's former residence,
which is as common as others. The courtyard, built some 130 years
ago, is surrounded by bamboo and trees. In front of the house is
farmland and mountains are in the back.
</P>
<P>
Now festively decorated, the village is adorned with national
flags and the flags of the Macao Special Administrative Region.
Boys can be seen climbing onto rooftops to hang lanterns on the
houses.
</P>
<P>
Many villagers said they would spend the night in the courtyard
to celebrate Macao's return and to remember the late great man.

<HEADLINE> HK Air Cargo Throughput Maintains Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport
Authority (HKAA) Sunday said that the November figures for air
cargo throughput indicate a healthy increase over the same period
last year, while passenger numbers also continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) handled a total of
201,000 tons of cargo in November, an increase of 27.6 percent
compared with 157,484 tons of the same month last year, according
to HKAA Chief Executive Officer Billy Lam Chung-lun.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of passengers was also up 13.2 percent
compared with the same period last year, with the total being over
2.57 million, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures, Lam attributed the upward
trend, especially air cargo, to strong demand as a result of Asia'
s economic recovery, saying that this trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many companies have probably been building up
their inventories in anticipation of Y2K, Lam added.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a slower growth rate early next year with traffic
again picking up towards Chinese Lunar New Year," he said. "The
improving economic situation in Asia reinforces our decision to
develop a Marine Cargo Terminal and Logistics Centers at the
airport."
</P>
<P>
Lam said that these facilities will further strengthen Hong
Kong's position as a major cargo and logistics hub and an
international aviation center.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft movements for November totaled 14,175, a rise of 5.2
percent over the figure of 13,478 recorded in the same month last
year, according to Lam.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defence Minister
Moven Mahachi on Sunday denied reports that the Zimbabwean
government has made an undertaking to support Hutu rebels fighting
the Burundian government.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi described the reports as an attempt to drag the country
into ethnic conflicts in the Great Lakes region, the Zimbabwe
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The reports are trying to wage hatred between us and other
ethnic groups in Africa. It is totally false and to make matters
worse. I have been on leave the whole of December and never
entered into a military agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reports had alleged that a delegation of the Burundian Hutu
militias had visited Zimbabwe and successfully negotiated support
in form of military hardware including bombs and guns.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu militias intensified their guerilla war against the
Tutsi-led Burundian government after the death of the Hutu leader
Malnchoe Ndadaye in a plane crash in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Daily Slams Latest U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily has condemned
the latest U.N. Security Council resolution on Iraq as "unjust and
dubious."
</P>
<P>
The al-Qadissiya daily, owned by the military, said in its
Sunday editorial that the abstention of three permanent members of
the Security Council and one non-permanent member from voting
clearly showed illegality of this ill-fated resolution.
</P>
<P>
"America has failed despite all means of pressure and blackmail
to win the unanimity to pass this resolution," said the article.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Friday adopted a new comprehensive policy
on Iraq with 11 votes for and four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia, France and Malaysia abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
The resolution sets up a new arms control body -- the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) -- in
Iraq to replace UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It also offers Iraq with ambiguous terms the chance to have the
trade sanctions suspended if it cooperates with the arms inspectors
in all aspects and makes progress on key disarmament tasks to be
defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The issuance of this ill-fated resolution uncovers the U.S.
policy hostile to Iraq and its aggressive practices," said the
daily, adding that so many observers described this resolution as a
big setback to America and a victory to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said that the insistence of America and "its subordinate
Britain" to put this wicked resolution to vote demonstrated their
policy to inflict more harm on the Iraqi people, which is contrary
to the willingness of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The daily further noted that passing this resolution represented
the U.S. and Britain's disregard of three permanent members of the
Council out of five, adding this was an expression of the U.S.
arrogance based on the principle of brute force.
</P>
<P>
The article said the Iraqi people would continue their jihad and
struggle for breaking and lifting the criminal embargo and defeat
all forms of plots and sinister schemes being hatched by America,
Britain .

DHAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- It is one of China's greatest
successes in history to resume its exercise of sovereignty over
Macao, said a signed article in a leading English newspaper here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the transfer of power over Macao on December 20, 1999,

<P>
The success of China's reunification policy of "one country,
two systems" -- regarding Hong Kong and Macao -- will inspire a

<P>
CHENGDU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists to late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's birthplace in the city of Guang'an
in southwest China increased by 20,000 this month, with over 30
percent of visitors coming from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We have long been looking forward to the return of Macao to
the motherland," said Hong Qiwang, who brought his wife and
daughter from Macao to Deng's place of birth in Sichuan on
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We brought our daughter here so that she will never forget the
monumental contributions Deng Xiaoping made to the cause of
reunification," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Nan-pu, a compatriot from Taiwan Province, said the "one
country, two systems" policy has led to a successful return of
Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland, and this has laid a
foundation for the eventual settlement of Taiwan issue. "We have
come to visit Deng's birthplace because of our respect for him and
longed for the reunification and prosperity of the motherland, he
said. Deng had spent 16 years in Guang'an after his birth in 1904.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Peace Agreement With Syria Possible in Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua)-- Some form of preliminary peace
agreement with Syria could be reached in months, although its full
implementation might take years, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel's television Channel 2, Barak said
it is hard for him to say the exact timetable for the two sides to
reach a peace agreement, but the reality is that starting next May,
the United States will be going into a period of presidential
elections and so Israel and Syria could reach a preliminary peace
agreement before the U.S. presidential elections begins.
</P>
<P>
En route back from Washington on Friday after Barak concluded
his two-day meetings with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa,
Foreign Minister David Levy said it has been decided that leading
up to the resumption of peace talks in the U.S. on january 3, each
side will set up its respective expanded negotiating and working
teams,so as to immediately get down to business during the next
round.
</P>
<P>
The teams are to deal with issues of water, borders, security
and normalization between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Barak repeatedly stressed that he had not
made any promises to the Syrians regarding a withdrawal from all of
the Golan Heights in advance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle
East War, will be the central issue dominating the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the Washington talks showed that the two sides have
reached an understanding of the problems ahead, but also expressed
their willingness to reach an agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Barak, when asked what sort of agreement he is aiming for at
this stage, said the optimal goal would be a document which is more
than a simple statement of principles, but less than a full peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We need a document which outlines the real answers to the real
questions at the level of leaders in order to go forward to
agreement. Other details will be filled in afterward," he said.
</P>
<P>
While moving the Israeli-Syrian track forward, Barak said his
government will open its doors to other Arab and Muslim countries
to conduct talks with Israel to normalize their relations.
</P>
<P>
He also premised that he will pullout the Israeli troops from
Lebanon by next July and redeploy them on the international
borders.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to brief his cabinet on Sunday about the
Washington talks, but postponed his meeting with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat scheduled in the West Bank city of Jericho Sunday
evening due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office said the meeting with Arafat will be rescheduled
soon.

hospital here about her decision on holding the election on
schedule, dismissing speculations about poll postponement.
</P>
<P>
He said Kumaratunga was "recovering speedily" in the hospital
where she was rushed in Saturday night for emergency treatment to
remove shrapnel near her right eye following the suicidal bombing
in her election rally at Colombo Town Hall grounds.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera denied speculations that Kumaratunga lost her
eyesight due to the bombing which killed 21 people and wounded 84
others including three ministers.
</P>
<P>
He said the president will make a recorded address to the
nation Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In another bomb blast on Saturday night, three people were
killed and 45 others were injured when the main opposition United
National Party was holding the election rally at the last day of
campaigning in suburban Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the two bombings but they
are widely considered the work of the separatist Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have intensified their efforts recently
in northern Sri Lanka in a 16-year old fight for an independent
Tamil state.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira bid
farewell to Santa Sancha Palace, the exclusive residence of
governors of Macao since 1937 this afternoon at 4:30 and then
headed for Praia Grande Palace, the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
The governor has administered Macao on behalf of Portugal for
eight years. His farewell to the residence, located at Penha Hill,
marks an end to the Portuguese rule over the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing governor, who looked solemn and was dressed in
dark blue suit, spent about five minutes shaking hands and bidding
farewell to the staff working at the Santa Sancha Palace, before
boarding his limousine. As the car started moving, the governor
waved farewell to the seeing-off staff through the window.
</P>
<P>
Later, the governor will attend the flag-lowering ceremony in
front of the Praia Grande Palace, a ceremony held for every
governor prior to their departure. But this time, it will be the
last such ceremony for a Portuguese governor of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since 1623, Portugal has assigned 127 governors to Macao, which
has been Chinese territory for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
As the last Portuguese representative and supreme ruler in
Macao, Vasco Rocha Vieira has contributed to the smooth
cooperation on the settlement of Macao Question between Portugal
and China.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the Portuguese side will hold a series of
activities before leaving the territory, which include a cocktail
party and outdoor art performance, a dinner banquet, and the
midnight lowering of the Portuguese national flag at the handover
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
On the early morning of December 20, at 1:45, the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) of the People's Republic of China
will be founded and the MSAR Government headed by Edmund Ho Hau
Wah will take over the power to administer the territory.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanians have been
called on to build the culture of visiting various tourist sites
in the country so as to learn more about the rich natural and
cultural heritage they are endowed with, local media reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday News newspaper quoted the Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism Philemon Luhanjo as
saying that most Tanzanians do not go on recreational tours due to
the misconception that tourism is mainly for foreigners and such
tours are very expensive.
</P>

The official urged Tanzanian people to go on recreational tours
so that they can learn a lot they do not know about their own
country and boost the national income through domestic tourism.

Last Friday, Luhanjo handed over 50 video cassettes on
Tanzanian wildlife to Tanzania Bus Owners Association, which will
distributed them to buses operating between Dar es Salaam and
up-country destinations in order to show passengers various

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Armed Somali bandits
have stepped up their attacks on residents of a village in Arusha
Region in northern Tanzania, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bandits, which are suspected to come from neighboring
Kenya, attacked Mairoa village late last month, and took away with
goods worth 900, 000 Tanzania shillings (1,125 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Observer newspaper quoted some of the villagers as
saying recently that they had, since then, been receiving
threatening letters from the bandits that they would strike again.
</P>
<P>
They said the bandits' main targets are the affluent villagers
who are forced to take refuge within poor Maasai families.
</P>
<P>
They said although they had reported the matter to the police,
the police had not done enough to contain the situation and
reassure the villagers of their safety.
</P>
<P>
Local police sources say they have been hunting for the bandits
in collaboration with their Kenyan counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Somali bandits have been terrorizing Monduli District, which
borders Kenya, for years. They attack local residents and took
away their properties at gun-point.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Voting is underway Sunday
across Russia to elect a new State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, for the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
Russia covers 11 time zones. When the balloting starts in
Moscow at 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT), voting has already ended
one hour ago in the Far Eastern regions of Chukot and Kamchatka.
</P>
<P>
About 3,550 candidates from 26 political parties and blocs
will vie for half of the 450 seats assigned according to party
lists, while other 2,300 candidates will compete for the other
half in constituencies.
</P>
<P>
With federal troops continuing their assaults on rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, several seats will be left vacant
in the new Duma, which will serve for a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, the Unity Party, the Fatherland-All
Russia bloc and the Yabloko movement are expected to be major
winners in the race.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the elections will be known in early
Monday morning, but the final tally will not be published until
about 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many of the 107 million eligible voters
would actually go to the polls. Under the Russian Election Law, a
25 percent turnout would ensure the vote's validity.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, 27.5 percent of the
voters in the Kamchatka region cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
But in the northern Irkutsk region, temperatures were as low
as minus 40 degrees Celsius in some remote villages, and
authorities fear the cold weather might further dent voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
To ensure security, all Interior Ministry personnel, plus 10,
000 servicemen and 22,000 cadets under the ministry, would be on
duty Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,000 observers from foreign countries and
international organizations were monitoring the balloting.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Prepared to Help Seeking Solution to Acheh Conflict: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is prepared to
play a role to assist in seeking a solution to the conflict in
Acheh province if requested by Indonesia, Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said.
</P>
<P>
Any tension or incidents in Indonesia would certainly have an
impact and Malaysia would play a role as a close neighbor, as
required by Indonesia, he told reporters Saturday night in the
southern state of Johor, according to Bernama news agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is a nation significant in the ASEAN region and
therefore, the republic's peace and well-being would contribute to
harmony in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have an open mind. The important thing is that we want to
see Indonesia return to normal ... its economy revived and
Indonesia's integrity as a nation defended at all times," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia believes Indonesia can overcome their problems
and have their own formula. "If they feel Malaysia can play a role,
we can do it but this will have to be discussed in detail," he
added.
</P>

Stressing close ties existing between Malaysia and Indonesia,
the minister said: "We regard Indonesia as a close neighbor and we
can provide whatever they feel we can contribute to fulfill their

COLOMBO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The curfew imposed on the
administrative districts of Colombo and the nearby Gampaha
Saturday night by the Sri Lankan government has been lifted, an
official press release here said Sunday noon.
</P>
<P>
The curfew has been imposed to maintain law and order following
twin blasts Saturday night at the final campaign rallies of the
two main parties contesting Tuesday's presidential elections. The
two bomb blasts have killed 25 people and injured over 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have been deployed on the streets of the
capital since Saturday night to check suspected passing vehicles
and persons.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the two bombings. But the
suspicion has fallen on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
rebels who have been fighting for a separate state for the
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's North and East since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Thai Coalition Firmly behind Govt in Parliamentary Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's key coalition
partners assured the Democrat-led government of their support in
Monday's parliamentary vote as the marathon censure debate rumbled
on for the fifth day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Exhausted opposition members won a concession from the
government to move their final wrap-up statement to Sunday's
sitting on the condition that targeted cabinet members be allowed
to defend themselves against Saturday's allegations when the
meeting resumes Sunday's morning. No new speakers from the
opposition are allowed to open up new issues.
</P>
<P>
Opposition politicians focused their fire during the previous
three days debate on economic mismanagement, corruption and claims
of ceding the country's economic sovereignty to foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
Although the allegations appeared to bruise key ministers such
as Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the other two major coalition partners,
the Chart Thai and Chart Pattana parties, assured that the
coalition would get their support in the Monday's vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition suffered a setback when a 12-man
faction of the Social Action Party announced it would abstain in
Monday's vote.
</P>
<P>
It is widely viewed that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's two-
year-old government should easily win, given its solid majority of
237 to 148 in the lower house of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Leaders Congratulate China on Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign leaders have
congratulated China on its resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the message delivered to his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin hailed Macao's return as a
landmark, which marks the end of foreign governing over China's
territory.
</P>
<P>
"The successful practice of the 'one china, two systems' policy,
initiated by Deng Xiaoping, will be sure to promote Macao's
stability and all-round development in the future, and help
strengthen Macao's traditional function as the bridge between
western and eastern cultures." said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Taiwan as an inalienable part of China, Cambodian
King Norodom Sihanouk wished in his letter China could completely
fulfill its peaceful unity.
</P>
<P>
The party and government leaders of Vietnam also portrayed
Macao's handover as a big historic event, which marks the
conclusion of foreign governing over Macao and the doomsday of
colonialism in China and the Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The event proves such a truth: China is an entirety. Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China.", said the
Vietnamese leaders led by General Secretary of the Communist Party
of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Macao will keep stability and development
after its return and make great contribution to China's prosperity.
Macao's successful handover again testifies the correctness of the
"one China, two systems" policy, they added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from other countries, including the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, Ireland, Myanma, Pakistan, South Korea and Sri
Lanka, also extended their congratulation to China upon Macao's
return.

<HEADLINE> China's Expected Entry into WTO to Attract More Overseas Firms to Its Market: ISI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China's expected entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) is expected to create a
substantial rise in the number of overseas firms in the country,
lending a boost to companies that provide special services for
corporate users.
</P>
<P>
"We expected that all major financial institutions will come to
China in the next few years as China joins WTO," said Gary Mueller,
president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Internet Securities,
Inc. (ISI).
</P>
<P>
Mueller's company provides financial, economic and political
information of emerging markets such as China and Brazil for
business users, through Internet distribution, said today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
In China, ISI has more than 100 corporate users, most of whom
are international financial companies.
</P>
<P>
Other subscribers to their bilingual service include companies
in sectors such as information technology, telecommunications, oil,
automotives and real estate
</P>
<P>
Mueller said he believes China's entry into the WTO will
benefit companies like ISI, as more multinational companies will
be keen on accessing China's information.
</P>
<P>
"We look for our revenue to grow 100 percent a year for the
next three years in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
ISI's worldwide revenue last year was 11 million US dollars.
It offers services in 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
As part of its steps to address the growing demand and
confidence in China's Internet market, backed by the WTO deal with
the United States, ISI will open a solely-owned company in
Shanghai in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
ISI has more than 180 information providers in China from
different industries. Some 2,000 business news items are updated
everyday. The powerful search service enables users to get
connected with its database for China's statistics, stocks, laws
and other business information, Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to move to be public business portal for China's
corporate users," he said. The company's current services are
subscription-based, which ensures a more reliable revenue than
other Internet information providers who bet their development
primarily on Web advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Although financial information is ISI's current focus in China,
Mueller expects that his company will enjoy more corporate users
in industries such as telecommunications and other information
technologies that show strong growth momentum.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A fire broke out late
Saturday in one of the dormitories of the Moscow State University,
killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which lasted over two hours, was put out at 02:00
local time (23:00 GMT) Sunday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
One of the victims, who jumped from the 13-story building,
died in an ambulance. The others were found dead inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
11 people sustained burns and injuries. Five of them were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 people were evacuated from the upper floors and
accommodated in street buses for temporary shelter.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the building housed university students and
post-graduates.
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently started in the second floor of the
building, which is located in Kravchenko Street in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what caused the fire, which happened just
about eight hours before Muscovites go to the polls to elect a new
State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
A special commission has been set up to investigate the
tragedy, Tass said.

A curfew has also been imposed in Colombo and nearby Gampaha

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to the crowd, General Zhang said Macao's return to
China opened a brand new chapter in the history of Macao.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the "one country, two systems"
principle would be able to guarantee the long-term stability and
development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said, the principle would lead to the solution of
the Taiwan issue and the eventual reunification of the whole of
China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the PLA's existence in Macao is both a symbol of
the Chinese government's resuming the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao and an important guarantee of state sovereignty and safety,
as well as the long-term stability and development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
He charged the PLA Macao troops to fully understand and carry
out the "one country, two systems" principle advocated by late
leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The troops should strictly implement the policies and decisions
of the Party on the Macao issue and abide by the laws of the Macao
SAR, the general said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the PLA Macao troops should upgrade their
military training, especially their capability in complicated
situations, so that the world will respect the PLA because of its
achievements in Macao.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Down to 2.44 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
continued to decline for the third consecutive week and stood at 2.
44 percent for the week ended on December 4 following the
consistent fall in prices of major food products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, prices of food articles
recorded sharp decline resulting in a 0.3 percent fall in the
Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for all commodities during the week.
</P>
<P>
The fall in food articles following arrivals of fresh crops
resulted in the inflation rate dropping to 2.44 percent from 2.46
percent in the previous week and 7.40 percent during the
corresponding week of last year.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during the most part of the current
year is mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base last
year when overall prices were up following abnormal increases in
vegetable prices.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Businessmen Anticipate Closer Ties with Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Business people in South China
's Guangdong Province anticipate closer co-operative ties with
Macao after its return to the motherland tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
During a recent seminar held on strengthened economic and
cooperative ties between Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province,
and Macao, experts said closer relationship will lead to mutual
benefits and mutual prosperity, China Daily Business Weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's foreign trade is one sector due to benefit from
fortified cooperative ties, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Macao has forged a particularly strong trade relationship with
Latin American countries and the European Union, which will be
significant for Guangzhou's foreign trade, said Xiong Jun, an
expert with Guangzhou Finance and Trade Administration Institute.
</P>
<P>
According to government sources, Guangzhou's annual exports to
Europe account for a mere 6.8 percent its total during the past
few years; and to Latin America, merely 0.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Macao's favorable trade status with the European Union, in par
due to the economy and a 1992 trade agreement, will also mean a
great deal to Guangzhou's foreign trade as both sides work to
strengthen their relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's exports to Macao were worth 25 million US dollars
in 1998, and exports to Macao this year are expected to surpass
26.6 million US dollars, still small compared with exports to Hong
Kong each year, statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
With the nation's numerous key universities, Guangzhou will
offer more educational opportunities for the people of Macao as
well as provide Macao with sufficient human resources.

<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Banco Nacional
Ultramarino (BNU), a currency issuing bank in Macao since early
this century, says its role in Macao will not affected following
Macao's return to China tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Herculano Sousa, general manager of BNU Macao Branch, said he
expects bustling business as Macao becomes more integrated with
China.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to suffer in any way with the departure of
expatriates and Portuguese officials," the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
BNU will continue to jointly issue local currency, the pataca,
with the Bank of China's Macao Branch, according to today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"After a few years of restructuring, we are now servicing
everybody and have products that serve the entire population such
as credit cards, mortgages and housing loans. Our deposits have
grown significantly," he said. The status as an issuer is
guaranteed by a contract with the Monetary and Foreign Exchange
Authority. The contract will be valid until 2010, and is renewable.
</P>
<P>
"We want to continue in the issuing business, because we know
it well and have experience in the field," Sousa said.
</P>
<P>
After Macao's return to China, BNU plans to become involved in
South China's economy. Macao's close economic relations with the
European Union and BNU's network in Portuguese-speaking countries,
especially in South America, are expected to help the bank's
initiative.

<P>
A statement released by the Italian foreign ministry said that
Italy had exceeded the commitments it undertook at the Cologne
summit of the Group of Seven top industrialized nations in June.
</P>
<P>
In Cologne, G7 leaders decided to cancel about one-third of all
the loans owed by the poorest countries, known as the heavily
indebted poor countries, thus cutting Third World debt by 70
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign ministry said that, through such initiative,
the international community hoped to free some 40 countries from
their debt burden, allowing them to channel funds towards
structural reforms, alleviating poverty and improving health
services.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the nations set to benefit from the debt-cutting
measure would need to pledge their commitment to the founding
spirit of the United Nations with respect to human rights and
fundamental liberties and renounce warfare as a solution to
conflicts.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's
industrial production, excluding the income from coffee, dropped
by 17.15 percent during the first 10 months of this year from the
same period of 1998, the National Statistics Administrative
Department (DANE) said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
DANE said that the production declined by 17.18 percent in
October alone, compared to the same month of 1998, deepening the
profound recession of the economy, the worst in this century.
</P>
<P>
It said that the most depressed sectors were transport
equipment and materials, which slumped by 51.2 percent, footwear
manufacturing by 39.3 percent, and furniture production by 33.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Credit demand remained stagnated despite a drop in interest
rates, and the production of enterprises did not pick up at all
because of stationary internal demand, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coffee harvest dropped 11.36 percent between January
and October of 1999 due to a collapse in the production of the
crop, of which Colombia is the second world supplier.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's industrial sales also fell 12.3 percent in the first
10 months of the year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Launches Rescue Operation for Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez launched Saturday a massive rescue operation for those hit
by floods caused by days of heavy rains in the country.
</P>
<P>
National and international rescue workers are taking part in
the "Bolivar 2000 Rescue Task Operation," said Chavez in a
statement read on the "Globovision" television network, but adding
that it will take time for assistance to arrive in some places due
to the difficult terrain.
</P>
<P>
The president toured Saturday the state of Vargas, one of the
most affected by the rains in the past days that have left at
least 250 dead, 7,000 people unaccounted for and 150,000 suffering
from all kinds of damage in several zones of the country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were stranded on the roofs of buildings and
in high zones in several parts of the country by floods caused by
the intense rains that made rivers outflow and caused collapses
and landslides of mud and rocks.
</P>
<P>
The president said that 23 helicopters, 26 military rescuers,
830 parachutists, hundreds of navy troops and various ships will
take part in the operation.
</P>
<P>
"The first operation of helicopters is ready to take off with a
force made up of national and international rescue experts," said
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
He added that an amphibious force will go into action whenever
approach to affected areas is impossible, and parachutists will
take food, water and medicines to the survivors trapped on the
roofs of buildings and in high zones.

<P>
FUZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua)-- More than 50 descendants of Lin
Zexu (1785-1850), commemorated the 160th anniversary of Lin's
official inspection trip to Macao at the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall.
The descendants are from east China's Fujian and Taiwan provinces.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting Macao on September 3, 1839, Lin informed the

government of the Qing court (1644-1911) to ban opium, and
safeguarded China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The descendants expressed their joy over the return of Macao's
return to the motherland and are determined to see China re-united
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zidong, a fifth generation descendant of Lin Zexu, was a
former consultant for the Fujian Provincial Academy of Social
Sciences. "We all the more yearn for Taiwan to be reunited with
the motherland and return to the embrace of the Chinese nation at
an earlier date," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), China's largest commercial bank, has opened
a branch in Luxembourg, the bank's seventh business agency abroad.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jianqing, vice-president of the ICBC, said the bank has
always attached importance to cooperation and trade in European
countries, and provides a wide range of financial services.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg branch, which opened for business last Thursday,
will not only engage in traditional banking services, but will
expand its involvement in investment banking, project financing,
euro bond issuance, and help domestic enterprises become listed on
the Luxembourg stock exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between China and the European countries has
intensified in recent years, particularly following the emergence
of the euro and rapid expansion of globalization, Jiang noted,
adding that these factors also provide new opportunities and
challenges for the banking world.
</P>
<P>
The new branch is expected to contribute still more to the
cooperation between China and the Europe by providing efficient
banking services, Jiang said.

handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese national flag is to be lowered at the handover
ceremony at about midnight. The Chinese five-star national flag
will be raised at zero hour sharp of December 20, symbolizing that

representatives of overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese
origin, people from Hong Kong and Taiwan and various sectors of

The venue for the handover ceremony at the reclaimed land by
the Cultural Center covers about 6,000 square meters and the
structure is 20 meters high. Some parts of the exterior wall of
the upper half of the structure was built with crystal materials
and by the time of the ceremony, all the lights will be on and the
whole structure will look like a huge lantern full of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macao, will
leave his residence at 16:30 today and attend the flag-lowering
ceremony at the Macao Government Palace at 17:00. The Portuguese
side will then host a number of farewell activities, including an
evening party, a cocktail party and an official banquet. After the
handover ceremony, the Portuguese president, Vasco and their party
will leave for home by a plane.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
is about to be established at 01:30 on December 20, and then it
will swear in.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Macao SAR Legislative Council will be
held at midnight to go through legislation procedures.
</P>

to a rousing welcome of some 20,000 Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 press people from across the world are here,

<HEADLINE> OAS Confident of Nicaragua, Honduras Moderation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Organization of American
States (OAS) mediator for the conflict between Honduras and
Nicaragua Luigi Einaudi expressed Saturday his confidence that
both countries will dismiss war as a solution to their controversy.
</P>
<P>
Einaudi, a former U.S. ambassador to the OAS who helped mediate
a peace agreement last year between Peru and Ecuador, said that
OAS will examine sending observers to prevent an armed
confrontation between both states who charge each other with
mobilizing troops to the common border.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Honduras and Nicaragua soured after the
Honduran congress ratified November 30 a treaty of maritime limits
with Colombia which Managua alleges that it takes off 130,000
square kilometers of Atlantic waters rich in fishing and potential
oil and natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The OAS envoy ended Saturday in Honduras a tour that included
Nicaragua after meeting with the highest authorities of both
countries and will return today to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Einaudi said that his mission wants both countries to start as
soon as possible direct talks for a peaceful solution to their
talks and prevent a situation that would be repudiated by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most horrendous things is that (Honduras and
Nicaragua) are two poor countries in the middle of the disaster
left by hurricane Mitch that are in conflict with each other, said
the OAS mediator.
</P>
<P>
"What is essential is to prevent an armed conflict, because it
would be inconceivable to enter the new millennium with a new
obstacle," he said.
</P>
<P>
Einaudi considered "very positive" that both countries had
shown a willingness for the controversy to be resolved in the
International Court of Justice of The Hague.

Estil finished the 30 kilometers classic-style race in a time
of one hour 16 minutes 30.8 seconds, 31.3 seconds ahead of

surprising victory in Sappada, Italy, last weekend with fourth

<P>
Thomas Alsgaard, winner of the 15km freestyle event at the
Nagano Olympics, settled for fifth but it was enough to maintain
the Norwegian's comfortable lead in the overall standings with 261
points, ahead of Bjervig with 213.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 15km classic, Danilova, the Olympic gold

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Phoenix Suns forward Tom
Gugliotta was still in a Portland hospital on Saturday after
suffering a seizure on the team bus following Friday's 110-102
victory over the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
"He's in a better state than when he was admitted to the
hospital," Suns spokesman Scott Leightman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta was under observation in the intensive care unit at
Legacy Emanuel Hospital. The team was awaiting results of a CAT
scan to determine the cause of the seizure.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year veteran NBA forward, who turns 30 on Sunday, had
17 points and 14 rebounds against Portland and appeared to be fine
while answering reporters' questions in the Suns lockerroom
following the game.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to the hospital Friday night after suffering the
frightening attack on the team bus.
</P>
<P>
Leightman said the Suns do not know when Gugliotta would be
released from the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Arrives in Saudi Arabia on Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak arrived in Saudi Riyadh Saturday night aimed at tackling
the latest developments in the Arab arena and rallying support from
the Gulf states for Syria in its negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, is
also expected to visit Qatar, Bahrain, and probably the United Arab
Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
According to Moussa, Mubarak would hold talks with Saudi King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on the Mideast peace process and progress on
the various tracks, the Saudi newspaper Okaz reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's present Gulf tour took place two days after the
resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations in Washington,
which broke off in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria have agreed to continue the peace talks in the
United State early next January.
</P>
<P>
Arab political sources believed the Egyptian-Gulf meetings will
form a supportive Arab stance to Syria in its peace negotiations
with Israel and affirm the necessity that Israel honor its
commitments to the international resolutions and the principle of
land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights Israel seized from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East War will be at the core of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Israel's media campaign, which blamed Egypt of
blocking the peace process with the Palestinians, Moussa said there
was no competition among peace tracks, stressing that the
breakthrough on the Syrian track will not be at the expense of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have entered
the final stage, with the two sides set on concluding a framework
agreement by February and a permanent peace deal by next September.
</P>
<P>
He said Cairo will never sell Palestine or persuade the
Palestinian side to accept unacceptable offers.
</P>
<P>
He also denied any Syrian reservation of the Egyptian role in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arab sources in Cairo said the latest situation in Sudan is also
likely to be touched upon during Mubarak's consultations with the
Gulf leaders, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir dissolved the parliament and
declared a state of emergency last Sunday. Egypt has thrown its
weight behind al-Bashir.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between Barak, Arafat cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
scheduled for Sunday evening in the West Bank city of Jericho, was
cancelled at the request of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tayeb Abdul Rahim, secretary-general of the Palestinian National
Authority said Saturday that the two sides will set a new date for
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the meeting was called off due to security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak were to discuss pending questions between the
two sides, including the delayed Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank and the Jewish settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel's settlement expansion in the West Bank and Gaza has
become a stumbling block in the final-status talks, which are
expected to lead to a permanent peace deal between the Palestinians
and Israel.  Since Barak's taking office in July, the two
leaders have held seven meetings, including two secret ones in Tel
Aviv.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema resigned Saturday, setting in motion a government crisis he
hopes will end quickly with himself at the head of a re-aligned
government and center-left alliance.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's move, which closes his 14 months as head of Italy's
55th government in the story of Republic, is expected to be
followed by a new mandate from President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to
form a fresh government, possibly in place by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema announced his intention to resign at the end of a
parliamentary debate called in order to clarify the situation in
the fragmented coalition which had hitherto supported his
government.
</P>
<P>
Despite the prime minister's appeal for clear and full support
from his allies, the rebellious Clover group of three tiny
centrist parties, called on him to resign in order to usher in a
radical policy rethink in the center-left.
</P>
<P>
"The radical clarification, which you called for, can only come
through a formal government crisis," said Democratic Socialist
leader Enrico Boselli, meaning the resignation of the prime
minister and consultations for a new government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi said during debate that at
this point President Ciampi should dissolve parliament and call
general election, truncating the present legislature 16 months
before its natural end.
</P>
<P>
However, Ciampi is known to be against this option. He is
widely expected to hold consultations with all political parties
and then ask D'Alema to find support for a new center-left
government.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the debate in parliament showed a broad
desire to continue and to re-launch the action of the center-left,
" said D'Alema as he announced his intention to resign to the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
"I have noted the positive contributions, the consensus and
also the more problematic contributions which will naturally have
to be considered very seriously in the discussions that will now
begin," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several of D'Alema's current allies pledged their support
during the parliamentary debate this evening and only the Upeur
party of former president Francesco Cossiga appeared otherwise
inclined.
</P>
<P>
The other two parties in the Clover group - the Republicans and
the Democratic Socialists - said they would either abstain in a
vote on a D'Alema 2 government or would offer "external" support,
meaning they would not join the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Clover group parties hold 17 seats in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Although without them the remaining center-left parties would
still have a majority, if all or most of the 17 drifted to the
ranks of the opposition, it would become wafer-thin.
</P>
<P>
For this reason D'Alema is expected to try to keep the
Republicans and the Democratic Socialists aboard even if Cossiga's
Upeur looks set to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven of the parties comprising D'Alema's present
parliamentary majority released a joint statement saying they
supported his return as prime minister and would attend
consultations with President Ciampi as a single delegation.
</P>
<P>
The seven - Left Democrats, People's Party, Udeur, Party of
Italian Communists, Democrats, Greens and Italian Renewal - muster
some 309 votes in parliament, just short of the 316 needed for a
majority.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the decision to send a joint delegation
to Ciampi means the president is almost certain to give D'Alema a
new mandate for government.
</P>
<P>
The consultations are scheduled to begin tomorrow with meetings
between the head of state and the two parliamentary Speakers.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Ciampi's office said that D'Alema and his
government had been asked to continue in a caretaker capacity
until a new government could be installed.
