<P>
Museveni who was seen off at the Entebbe International Airport

Agricultural Minister Specioza Kazibwe, is accompanied by First
Deputy Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya.

<HEADLINE> Fire Injures 4 in N. Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Four children were injured,
one very critical, after fire gushed their makeshift huts in the
eastern quarter of Bossaso, a northern town in Somalia on
Saturday, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the fire had destroyed 250 huts and
houses, displacing as many as 700 people who lived in the area
mainly inhabited by refugees.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities in the region characterized the incidents
as terrifying accident. The elders attributed the reason for
the fire to the strong winds of the Northwest Monsoon which
hits the coastal regions of Somalia at this time every year.
</P>
<P>
A radio operator in Bossaso said that the fire began from an
uncovered fire outside a hut used for cooking. The strong winds
then blew the fire which caught the same hut and spread further
to the adjacent houses.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Ugandan, Sudanese Leaders Makes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Progress was made today in
talks between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese
Counterpart Omar al-Bashir, South African President Nelson
Mandela, host of the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
The high-level discussions also focussed on the need for peace
in strife-torn Sudan, Mandela said in Pretoria. But he declined
to give more details.
</P>
<P>
Bashir and Museveni declined to make comment.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Presidentn Robert Mugabe, who attended in his
capacity as chairman of the Organization for African Unity, also
agreed to keep the meeting result secret, saying, "we still need
to move forward and must therefore retain confidentiality."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Sudan and Uganda have been soured by
accusations that they are backing each others' rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said earlier in the day that the meeting had been held
at Bashir's request. When he subsequently raised the matter with
Museveni, the Ugandan president suggested Sudanese People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) leader John Garang also be invited.
</P>
<P>
Garang arrived in South Africa on Wednesday and met Mandela in
Cape Town the next day. However, he refused to have meeting with
his rival Bashir due to be held in Pretoria today. He said his
army would continue war against the Sudanese government. Garang
left for home on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Christian SPLA, which controls a greater part of southern
Sudan, has been at war with Khartoum to fight for greater
autonomy or independence from the Islamic north.

<HEADLINE> Parents in Tanzania Urged to Help in Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian government
official today called upon parents to cooperate with the
government to fight against the moral decay among the youths.
</P>
<P>
Government rules and regulations alone are not enough to
reform a youth's behavior, and "we must cooperate in solving the
problem which is on the increase," Tanzanian Deputy Minister for
Labor and Youth Development W. Lukuvi said today when closing a
three-week seminar on "good advice to youth" here.
</P>
<P>
Lukuvi said that most of the Tanzanian youths do not want to
use their energy for the social development activities. They are
lazy and they always dream to have a luxury life, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Though unemployment contributes a lot to a moral decay, Lukuvi
maintained, employment does not mean every body works in office
but employment means any legal business enable a person to get
his daily meal.
</P>
<P>
"If every youth would work hard, I am sure our country would
not be poor as it is now," Lukuvi noted.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the participants to make sufficient research to
investigate the causes of moral decay. He also appealed to
non-governmental institutions to join the government in fighting
against the moral decay among youths.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief to Visit Iran in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
is to make his first trip to Iran in December to attend the summit
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), a senior U.N.
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary general himself will be coming here for the OIC
conference in December," James Speth, administrator of the United
nations Development Program (UNDP), told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Speth, who was on a two-day visit here, said he had met with
Iran's new President Mohammad Khatami and was impressed by his
personality and his program of action for Iran's development.
</P>
<P>
"Khatami is committed to the idea of equitable and sustainable
development espoused by UNDP," Speth said, and he is dedicated to
growth, not just for the rich, but for the average people" as well.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won the May presidential election with a landslide
victory and was sworn in on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Speth said although Iran says 17 percent of its population live
in poverty, U.N. figures show some 22 percent of Iranians are under
the powerty line.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made great strides in fighting poverty, but it is still
lagging behind, Speth said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if UNDP could work better with Khatami's government
which has been dubbed as "moderate", Speth said his agency has never
been swayed by changes in the governments.
</P>
<P>
"Our assistance has never depended on the changes in the
regimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Speth, the total UNDP financial assistance to be
mobilized from 1997 to 1999 amounts to 48 million U.S. dollars,
which will be spent in the areas of social and economic reforms and
enviroment protection.

<HEADLINE> Divorces Rise 9.1 Percent in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran recorded a 9.1 percent rise
in divorce cases in the first quarter of the current Iranian calendar
year starting from March 21 over that of last year, a government
agency said here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,600 divorce cases were registered in the period, the
country's Statistics and Registration Administration said. But it
did not elaborate the causes for the rise.
</P>
<P>
Specialists attribute the high divorce rate to economic
pressures as incomes are very low and inflation reaching 50-70
percent yearly.
</P>
<P>
A woman specialist said about 80 to 90 percent of the women are
not satisfactory with their marriage not only for economic reasons
but for the negligence of their husbands as well.
</P>
<P>
According to the government agency, more than 130,000 couples
got married in the first quarter, up 4 percent from that in
the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Recieves Messages From US, Russian FMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today received messages on the Mideast peace stalemate from
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine albright and Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeniy Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) said that Albright's message
dealt with the current conditions of the Mideast peace process and
here projected tour of the region in September.
</P>
<P>
The message of the Russsian foreign minister focused on the
peace process in the region and Moscow's role, MENA said, without
giving details.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russian ambassadors to Egypt delivered the messages
during their separate meetings with Moussa today.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process that started under the co-sponsorship
of Washington and Moscow in 1991 has run into a deep crisis since March
when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as a major player in commencing the peace process, has
significantly lowered its profile; the U.S. has been widely
criticized for being "too passive" in breaking the peace impasse and
"too biased" in mediating a conciliation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador here Edward Walker told the press after his
meeting with Moussa that Egypt would be the "third or fourth stop" of
Albright's multi-leg tour of the region, which is reportedly to
begin September 9.
</P>
<P>
The maiden trip to the region by Albright would also take her to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories, Syria, Jordan and
possibly Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Walker said further withdrawal of israeli troops from the West
Bank, among other issues, would be discussed during Albright's
visit. Israel declared on Satuday that it will not execute the
second stage of the Oslo accords related to its redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright, in an attempt to revive the stalled peace talks, was
reported to bring with her major U.S. initiatives on the final
status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, further Israeli
redeployment and Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Since talking office in January, Albright has avoided touring
the region, apparently fearing she could achieve little as relations
between Israel and the Palestinians have gone from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
But after the suicide bombings in Jerusalem last month, she was
stongly considering a trip, her aides said.

<HEADLINE> Phosphate-Loaded Barge Sinks in Nile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A barge ferrying 370 tonnes of
phophate sank into the Nile after it collided with another barge,
the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The barge El-Salam, which belongs to the River Transport Co.,
sank Saturday night near the village of Diyadiya, Beni Suef, about
100 kilometers south of Cairo after hitting another barge carrying
stones.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers had pulled up all six crew on board and were trying to
drag the barge out of water to prevent the river from being polluted.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Public Wroks and Water
Resources assured that the situation has been bring under control and
the accident poses no serious threat to Nile water.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian authorities have closed several outlets on the
lower branches of the Nile to forestall any pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Nile river, which is the longest in the world and runs
about 1,500 kilometers inside Egypt, is the lifeline of Egyptians
on whose banks and delta up to 95 percent of the population are living.
</P>
<P>
The official, on condition of anonymity, said that surrounding
waters, fish and the micro-econsystem in the area will not be
seriously affected thanks to the fact that the 370 tonnes of
phosphates were tightly packed in plastic bags impermeable to water.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Sign Agreement on Aqaba Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
AMMAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel signed today an
agreement for joint operation of the Aqaba international airport in
Jordan's Red Sea port city of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Jordanian Minister of Transport and
Telecommunications Bassam Saket and his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak
Levy, is the second major breakthrough in further carrying out the
1994 peace treaty, preceded by direct transport of goods between the
two countries in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Details of the joint operation have not been disclosed, but both
sides reportedly agreed early this month that some
international flights to Israeli Red Sea resort Eilat will be
diverted to Aqaba airport from September to alleviate the pressure
on the Eilat airport which has a limited capacity.
</P>
<P>
Joint operation of the Aqaba airport is expected to build
further confidence between the two countries, Radio Jordan quoted
Jasser Ziyyad, Jordan's Civil Aviation Authority Director as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
It would also help boost the regional economy by increasing air
transport, Ziyyad added.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the joint operation of Aqaba airport started at the
beginning of the year, but came to a deadlock in midway following a
set of Israeli conditions which Jordan considered as infringements
on its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
As to the disputes in this aspect, Ziyyad sadi that both sides
would try to overcome the technical and other problems that might
arise during the first phase of operation.
</P>
<P>
The Aqaba airport is the only one in the southern region of the
kingdom that conforms to the international runway standards,
permitting large number of planes to take off and land.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two countries in the Arab world that has
signed peace treaty and set up diplomatic relationship with the
Jewish stae. The other one is Egypt.

<HEADLINE> World University Games End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The 19th World University
Games ended here today with the United States finishing on top of the
gold medal table.
</P>
<P>
The Americans got 20 gold, 19 silver and 22 bronze medals, followed
by Ukraine in the second place with 17 gold, 6 silver and 4 bronze.
Japan came third with 14 gold medals and 8 silver and 11 bronze
medals.
</P>
<P>
The 13-day games, the largest sports event second only to Olympic
Games, are more a gathering of student athletes from all over the
world than a top-level international sports competition.
</P>
<P>
The games featured in 10 sports of swimming, diving, fencing,
athletics, water polo, gymnastics (including rhythmic gymnastics),
basketball, volleyball, tennis and soccer.
</P>
<P>
Swimming and athletics were the only two sports in the games which
had their records. But in the competitions, only a few Universiade
records were broken or even challenged while all of the results of the
winners were far behind the world records.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which left its best swimmers at home, still managed to win 9
gold medals to top the medal table of swimming tournament. That was
because the other swimming world powerhouses the United States,
Australia, Germany and Russia only fielded their pure amateur swimmers
to the games while China simply didn't send a single one swimmer to
Sicily Universiade.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese diving team, which dominated the diving tournament by
taking 5 out of 8 gold medals on offer, was consisted of young and
unknown divers who could be unfamiliar even to Chinese sports fans.
</P>
<P>
Yet Chi Meilan, who finished 14th in China's national Champions
Cup, still grasped the women's platform gold with a great advantage of
more than 50 points than all her foreign opponents.
</P>
<P>
The athletics competitions were boosted with the entries of a
handful of world championships and Olympic medalists. But even Ivan
Pedroso of Cuba, the reigning world champion of men's long jump, could
not give the spectators an exciting show.
</P>
<P>
Even the World Sprint Festival, which was held on the last two days
of the Universiade, could hardly satisfy the Sicilian fans. Ottey,
Devers, Frank Fredericks and other stars put up a disappointing
performance compared with their fame.
</P>
<P>
The only real good result of the games came from American Vincent
Henderson who clocked 9.94 seconds in the men's 100 meters
semi-finals. But he only clocked 10.22 seconds in the final to win
the title due to leg hamstring.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the competition results, the organising works of the
games were better. But the organising committee had to work hard to
slove the problems of transportation, communication and computer
system even on the closing day of the games.
</P>
<P>
As the games were the first one held in three cities and many more
towns, the organising committee had more difficulties than even
Olympic organisers.
</P>
<P>
So, we should say that the games were a success, which owed a great
deal to two millions spectators following all the different sports
with a strong passion.
</P>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo, president of the FISU, said at a press conference
that all the foreign athletes would remember Sicily's warmness.
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo, also president of the International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF), said: "Nowhere else in the world the athletes have
been welcomed as has happened this time in Sicily."
</P>
<P>
The next Universiade will be held in Palma of Spain in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Australia Foreign Debt Surges to 150 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's net foreign debt
rose to 202.024 billion Australian dollars (about 150 billion U.S.
dollars) in the June quarter from a revised 197.67 billion
Australian dollars (146.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the March
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The figure also compares with 187.53 billion Australian dollars
(138.9 billion U.S. dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 2.2 percent increase in the net debt within
three months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
Gross debt rose to 254.687 billion dollars (about 189.74
billion U.S. dollars) in the June quarter from a revised 247.819
billion dollars (183.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the March quarter
and 236.012 billion dollars (175.3 billion U.S. dollars) a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello defended the federal government's
record, as foreign debt levels surged above the 200 billion mark.
</P>
<P>
Costello told parliament that he still expected the foreign
debt level to fall as the government returned the budget to
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Costello blamed the high level of foreign debt on the previous
Labor Government, which he said had allow debt levels to grow
from 23 billion (17 billion U.S. dollars) to 187 billion
Australian dollars (138.9 billion U.S. dollars) in 13 years
between 1983 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
"If we had inherited 23 billion dollars as you did we would not
be in the exposed position we are now," he said in answer to a
question from Opposition spokesman Gareth Evens.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen held talks with his
Maltese counterpart George Vella here today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, the two
sides made a positive review of Sino-Maltese relations. They
exchanged views on further promotion of bilateral cooperation in
such areas as politics, trade, economic affairs, culture, science,
technology and civil aviation, as well as on international issues
of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that since China and Malta established diplomatic
relations 25 years ago, relations between the two countries have
been growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides have forged a sound, mutually
beneficial relationship of cooperation on the basis of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides have been supporting each other in
international affairs and share identical or similar views on many
international issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the friendly cooperative relations
between the two countries enjoy a solid foundation and bright
prospects.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese people have always cherished
friendly feelings for the Maltese people. The two peoples had
similar sufferings in the past. Now they share common goals in
safeguarding world peace and stability, expanding their economies
and improving their living standards.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the Chinese Government has always attached great
importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with
Malta. He said that China is ready to make concerted efforts with
the Maltese side to push the bilateral relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Vella, deputy prime minister, minister of foreign affairs and
minister of environment of Malta, said that Malta values relations
with China. It has been following with great interest the
tremendous achievements in economic affairs that China has made in
the past ten-plus years and its increasingly greater role in world
politics and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed congratulations China on its success in resolving
the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Maltese government is ready to discuss with
the Chinese side on possibilities in stepping up cooperation in
such fields as trade and economic affairs, the manufacturing
industry and the shipping industry, so as to further bilateral
friendly cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, officials of the two countries signed an
agreement on civil air transport and an executive program on
cultural cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Budget Surplus of 900 Million Pesos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Budget Secretary Salvador
Enriquez said today that the Philippine government would generate
a budget surplus of 900 million pesos (30 million U.S. dollars)
this year from the depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
After having calculating the impact of the peso's depreciation
on revenues and expenditures, budget officials computed that the
income was bigger by 900 million pesos over net expenditures, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said the budget officials are looking for creative
ways of living up to the depreciated peso.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to live with the value of the depreciated peso in
a way that continues the frugal and prudent program of the
government. We will not hike the budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is also looking at ways of keeping
project costs within the existing budget despite the depreciated
peso.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure projects like roads and bridges, hit by lower
peso value because of the use of imported construction materials,
will have to be cheaper but not inferior in quality, Enriquez
said.
</P>
<P>
The budget officials would learn how to construct cheaper
bridges with better or creative ways of reducing the cost, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The peso has depreciated by 14 percent after it was floated
within a wider band by the country's Central Bank on July 12.

<HEADLINE> Japan Conducts Major Earthquake Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan today conducted
large-scale earthquake drills to boost disaster preparedness.
</P>
<P>
The drills, which emphasized coordination of various government
agencies' functions, were held on the premise that strong
earthquakes had struck the Tokai and southern Kanto regions.
</P>
<P>
The Fire Defense Agency estimated that a total of 7.97 million
people took part in the exercises.
</P>
<P>
Included were school children and business people who held
concurrent drills testing their own ability to cope with such a
calamity.
</P>
<P>
The drills assumed that an offshore earthquake, registering
eight on the Richter scale, struck the Tokai region in the
morning, while a 7.2 magnitude temblor occurred directly beneath
Yokohama in the afternoon, rocking the southern part of the Kanto
region.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto flew into Yokohama by
helicopter this afternoon and observed anti-disaster drills there.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, about 30 volunteer interpreters of six foreign
languages, including English and Chinese, joined in the drills.
</P>
<P>
In Fujieda, Shizuoka Prefecture, about 7,300 local residents as
well as Self-Defense Forces personnel took part in disaster relief
drills under the observation of a central government research team.
</P>
<P>
The drills were held as part of a series of anti-disaster
drills during Japan's Disaster Prevention Week, which runs from
Saturday to the following Friday.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Raps Israel, US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today attacked Israel and the United States for not
honoring the resolutions passed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In his harshest statements on foreign policy issues ever
since his inauguration on August 4, Khatami referred to the
Israeli regime as "the greatest manifestation of international
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Addressing family members of the Lebanese fighters killed in
combat against Israel, Khatami also criticized the United States
for not using its veto power at the U.N. to block Israeli
actions.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. continued support for the Israeli regime, the 54-
year-old president noted that the interests of American nation
have been sacrificed for those of "the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
"With full arrogance, the Zionist regime is trampling all of
the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council,"
Khatami was quoted by the state-run Tehran Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In many places, Israel has escaped the veto power of the
United States..." he said, adding that the U.S. government has
compromised the interests of the American nation in its effort
to protect the Israeli interests.
</P>
<P>
"It is really appalling to see that in today's world, because
of the mistaken policies of the U.S. administration, even the
interests and expedience of the American nation have been
sacrificed for the sake of a gang of racists (Israel) in the
world," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that "the U.S government must apologize to their
nation for its action."
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that Iran was not against peace in the Middle
East, a peace which everyone would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we want peace for all, peace for the people of
Palestine, Syria, regional countries and other countries in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Khatami hinted that under his administration Iran would
continue its support for the Lebanese resistance movement
in southern Lebanon which has been fighting Israeli forces for
over a decade.
</P>
<P>
"We see resistance against aggressors as the right of all the
free nations in the world. Within the framework of revolutionary
and Islamic values, Islamic Republic of Iran would defend the
rights of these nations," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Transport and
Communications Minister, Haris Kastanidis, resigned today, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas announced.
</P>
<P>
He will be replaced by Undersecretary for the Interior, Public
Administration and Decentralization Tassos Mantelis, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Reppas gave no reasons of Kastanidis' resignation, but added
that both Kastanidis' letter of resignation and Prime Minister
Costas Simitis' reply would be released later today.
</P>
<P>
Kastanidis reportedly tendered his resignation to Simitis last
weekend following local media reports that he was personally
reprimanded at a cabinet meeting last Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Reppas, Simitis had made no reference to

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mozambique in Economic Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique, after 16
years of civil war which had reduced it to one of the world's
poorest nations, was experiencing a revival by poising for eight
percent economic growth and much lower inflation.
</P>
<P>
Mozambiuqe's economic reforms have been described by the World
Bank as a success story, with an eight percent growth last year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figure, the government has brought
annual inflation down to 14 percent from 70 percent three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique is in the process of a remarkable recovery, we are
enjoying social and political stability," said Jose Luis Cabaco,
a Mozambican economist based in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We have made remarkable progress in lowering inflation and
forecast our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to grow by eight
percent this year if we receive as good rains as last year."
</P>
<P>
President Joaquim Chissano told the press last weekend that
his government is carrying out a comprehensive restructuring
program to rehabilitate the basic structure.
</P>
<P>
Much of the growth would come from power export from the
Cahora Bassa Dam to South Africa and Zimbabwe, which was
scheduled to start in October next year.
</P>
<P>
The electricity exports are expected to bring in about 100
million U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment and the privatisation program, which
started in 1989, were also expected to boost the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign investment projects will also have a
positive impact on the national economy this year.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government had earmarked 700 public enterprises
for privatisation. Last year, 34.7 million U.S. Dollars was
raised from the sale of 22 state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government hopes to sale off 15 large public
enterprises, with the disposal of 350 smaller companies expected
to run into 1998.
</P>
<P>
The privatisation program has led to the creation of 69 new
companies and has had a huge impact on the cement, beverages,
metal working and packaging sectors.
</P>
<P>
Although Mozambique was experiencing an economic upswing, it
remained saddled with high unemployment, with unofficial
estimates putting the figure of the urban unemployment at 65
percent.

<HEADLINE> Actions Urged to Lighten Hong Kong School Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Education
Department officials today called for actions to reduce the weight
of local school bags.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the department are concerned about overweight
school bags, in particular their possible harmful effects on the
formation of spines on primary and junior secondary school
students.
</P>
<P>
It is important to have measures taken to tackle the problem
and obtain support and cooperation from schools, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Under a set of updated guidelines, students are encouraged to
develop the habit of packing school bags every day and discouraged
from taking toys, magazines and unnecessary items to schools.
</P>
<P>
Schools should advise students on the types of school bags and
on the correct posture in carrying them.
</P>
<P>
Parents' cooperation and support should be sought so that the
advice given to students at schools will be reinforced at home,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Timetables should be designed to enable students not to take a
large number of textbooks, workbooks or exercise books to school
on any day of the week or cycle.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, schools should consider the weight and size
of textbooks before determining which textbooks should be
prescribed and avoid too many supplementary workbooks and
additional exercise books.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also suggested schools provide students with
drinking water and facilities such as lockers, as far as possible,
to store books, stationery and personal items.
</P>
<P>
They also urged teachers to avoid punishing students for
occasionally failing to bring books or other items to class.
</P>
<P>
Schools are encouraged to draw up and implement other measures
which they consider practicable and effective to reduce the weight
of school bags, the officials added.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Likely to Quit Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's former president
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere is likely to step down as mediator for
Burundi peace talks following Burundi's boycott of the talks last
week in Arusha, northern Tanzania, "The East African" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper said Nyerere might put forward the offer at
the regional heads of state summit to be held this week in Dar es
Salaam, capital of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The proposed summit is expected to review Burundi's progress
in meeting conditions imposed by the region last July after Major
Buyoya seized power in a coup by the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Nyerere made his quit offer to Burundi
through South African special envoy Ambassador Wolile Nhlapo.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was apparently angered by Buyoya's snubbing of the
Arusha meeting as without Bujumbura's participation, his mandate
to continue with the talks would be seriously undermined.
</P>
<P>
In a note to all its diplomatic missions abroad sent on the
very day of the aborted talks, the Buyoya regime accused Nyerere
of making provocative statements which further strained relations
between Tanzania and Burundi and discouraged participation in
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has also raised misgivings about Tanzania's role as a
host for the talks at a time when the tension in the relations
between the two neighbouring countries is running high.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has refused to recognize the Buyoya
regime since the bloodless coup which returned him to power last
July and accused Burundi of planning an invasion into its
territory.
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour meeting with Buyoya, special envoy Nhlapo said
that if Arusha was not acceptable as a talks venue to all sides,
then another country should be asked to host the talks, the paper
noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper disclosed that Burundi would send a team this week
to Harare, Zimbabwe, to present Burundi's case directly to
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The team would reportedly send a message to Mugabe, saying
that Burundi would like to see Nyerere step down as mediator for
the Burundi peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Tea Likely to Make Good Profit this Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tea industry is
expecting substantial profits this year because of higher prices
in the international market despite a slight fall in production
due to inadequate rains, according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian country produced 30 million kilograms in the
first eight months of this year as against the whole year target
of 54 million kilograms, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
This year's average quoted price is 74 taka (about 1.68 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram, the highest for 10 years. It was 65 taka
(about 1.48 dollars) per kilogram last year.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our companies would make significant profit as the
increased price in the international market is expected to be
sustained in the coming days," said Syed Hasib, director of the
Bangladesh Tea Board.
</P>
<P>
The tea output for the whole year would fall short of the
targeted 54 million kilograms, but could still manage to reach
around 51 million kilograms if the weather is good, Hasib said.
</P>
<P>
The total tea production last year was 53.50 million kilograms,
of which 26.14 million kilograms were exported, earning 1.35
billion taka (about 30.68 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now has 158 tea estates with a total area of 112,464
hectares, of which 47,938 hectares are planted to tea.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Defense Minister Leaves For Geneva on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah
left for Geneva today to attend a two-day meeting on the
controversial issue of Kuwaiti Prisoners of War (POWs) in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that more than 600 Kuwaiti POWs have been held
in Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official from Kuwaiti defense ministry was quoted by
the Kuwait News Agency as saying the minister would press hard at
the Geneva meeting, which is sponsored by the Tripartite
Committee, for the release of the Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
The official said Iraq has failed to comply with a host of
U.N. Security Council resolutions related to its aggression in
Kuwait including a call for the immediate release of the POWs.
</P>
<P>
The Tripartite Committee, sponsored by the International
Committee of the Red Cross following the Gulf War, groups Kuwait,
Iraq as well as the Gulf War allied anti-Iraq countries such as
Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 25 meetings, once a month at the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi border, have been held by a technical sub-committee
of the Tripartite Committee, but failed to achieve any results
due to difference on the POWs issue between Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claimed that the POWs who were brought to Iraq at the
end of the Gulf War are still being detained in Iraqi jails while
Baghdad denied it still jails these people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq acknowledged taking some POWs to Iraq along with
withdrawing troops, but it claimed having no fresh information
about their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
It said a number of the Kuwaiti POWs had gone missing during a
popular uprising that broke out in southern Iraq following the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The POWs issue has been one of the key factors hindering any
improvement of relations between Kuwait and Iraq within the
framework of an Arab reconciliation campaign in which Kuwait
started to restore normal ties this year with countries such as
Jordan, Sudan and Yemen which sided with Iraq during the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Seeks Constructive Working Ties With S.E. Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain is seeking to
strengthen and deepen its relations with countries in Southeast
Asia, particularly in the areas of economic cooperation, visiting
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I've come here early in the life of the Labor Government
precisely because we want to demonstrate our recognition of the
importance of this region and the priority we've attached to
building constructive working relations with countries of this
region," Cook said at a press conference before winding up his
six-day Southeast Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the tour, which had already taken him to
Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Robin noted that this
was the first major visit to Southeast Asia by a British Foreign
Secretary for a decade.
</P>
<P>
"I think it particularly significant that I've carried out this
visit despite the recent financial turbulence, because it
demonstrates our faith that the economic fundamentals of Southeast
Asia are strong, and that in the medium and long term, this region
will be a place of growing economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook recalled that in the course of his visit, he had explored
in every capital how Britain and these countries could strengthen
and deepen their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that in the course of this visit, we have managed to
achieve a balanced dialogue with the countries of the region both
on how we develop economic cooperation to our mutual benefit, and
on how we also talk openly and honestly to each other about our
concerns so that we better understand each other's perspectives,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who arrived here on Sunday, has met with Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong and Foreign Minister S Jayakumar.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Five Tamil rebels were killed
on Sunday in fighting with government forces in Northern Province
of Sri Lanka, according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels fired mortar at the troops manning defenses around
Puliyankulam Town.
</P>
<P>
The troops retaliated with mortar and artillery fire, killing
at least five rebels and injuring two others while three soldiers
were injured due to rebel mortar fire, the sources added.

<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war for a separate state
in the north and east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government troops launched an operation on Puliyankulam
Town on August 19 in an effort to retake the highway linking the

<HEADLINE> Ramos Increases Benefits for Pensioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today approved an 8-percent across-the-board rise in the
monthly pension of Social Security System (SSS) pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Ramos announced the increased benefits in his address during
the 40th anniversary celebration of the SSS.
</P>
<P>
The minimum monthly SSS pension for those who have at least 10
years of service will be raised from 1,000 pesos (33.3 U.S.
dollars) to 1,200 pesos (40 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ramos also approved the increase from 1,200 pesos (40 dollars)
to 1,500 pesos (50 dollars) of the minimum monthly pension of SSS
pensioners who have rendered at least 20 years of service.

Beneficiaries of death and disability pensions, who were
getting the minimum monthly pension of 800 pesos (26.7 dollars),
will now receive 1,000 pesos (33.3 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"These benefits are integral to a vision that we hold of social
security for the Filipino," Ramos said as he vowed to keep working
for increased benefits for SSS members as government resources
would allow.
</P>
<P>
During the last 40 years, the SSS extended 127 billion pesos
(4.23 billion dollars) in benefits to its members and their
beneficiaries, of which 72 percent, or 91 billion pesos (3 billion
dollars), was delivered during the five years of the Ramos
administration.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Banks in Thailand See Deposits Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Thailand are seeing
major reshuffles of deposits among them amid uncertainties about
the country's entire financial sector, with small banks facing a
run on their deposits.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Research Institute of Siam
Commercial Bank, deposits with Thailand's 15 banks totaled 3.845
trillion baht (about 128.1 billion U.S. dollars) in July, up 1.77
percent from June.
</P>
<P>
Large local commercial banks saw deposits grow, though slowly,
during the month. Bangkok Bank obtained the largest deposits in
the country, which were posted at 863.49 billion baht (28.78
billion dollars) in July, up 2.34 percent from June.
</P>
<P>
Krung Thai Bank recorded deposits of 547.71 billion baht (18.26
billion dollars), a rise of 1.89 percent from June, and ranked
second in terms of deposits amount, followed by Thai Farmers Bank
with deposits amounting to 505.72 billion baht (16.86 billion
dollars), 1.29 percent more than June.
</P>
<P>
Siam Commercial Bank reported a 7.69-percent increase in its
deposits, the biggest margin in the month among the 15 banks,
although its total deposits stood at 466.15 billion baht (16.86
billion dollars) and ranked fourth.
</P>
<P>
Thai Military Bank registered the second largest increase
margin of 6.02 percent in deposits in July, which were 238.99
billion baht (7.97 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, five small and medium-sized banks saw at least 27.9
billion baht (930 million dollars) flow out of their accounts.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Metropolitan Bank reported the largest decrease of
13.37 percent in deposits in July, followed by the country's
smallest bank, Laem Thong Bank, which kept deposits of just 30.87
billion baht (1.03 billion dollars) in the month, down 11.43
percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Central Bank's announcement late June to suspend the
operations of 16 finance firms sparked heavy withdrawals from the
firms and other financial institutions. Depositors or creditors
were shifting their money to those financial institutions which
they believe are safer.
</P>
<P>
Large local commercial banks apparently benefited a lot from
the deposits reshuffles and so did the 19 foreign banks which have
branches in the country.
</P>
<P>
The deposits with the foreign banks in July jumped by 35.42
percent from June to 120.4 billion baht (4 billion dollars),
according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Tokyo's branch in Thailand saw deposits soar to 21.51
billion baht (717 million dollars) in July, up 11.33 percent from
June, ranking first among the 19 foreign banks in terms of
deposits amount.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank posted deposits totaling 20.15 billion
baht (716.6 million dollars) in its branch in Thailand in July, a
rise of 99.91 percent over June.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank's branch reported a 181.3-percent increase in
deposits to 10.49 billion baht (349.7 million dollars) in July
from June, although it ranked fifth in terms of deposits amount.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America also witnessed a 115.03-percent increase in
deposits in its branch in Thailand to 4.45 billion baht (148.3
million dollars) in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Some newly-opened branches of foreign banks reported an even
more stunning increase in their deposits in July.
</P>
<P>
Dresdner Bang Ag's branch posted the highest increase of 2,006
percent among the 19 in the month, as deposits with it ballooned
from 13 million baht (430,000 dollars) in June to 274 million baht
(9.1 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank' branch achieved an
increase of 877.09 percent in its deposits to 1.544 billion baht
(51.5 million dollars) in the month.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China also posted a total of 222 million baht (7.4
million dollars) in deposits in July, up 20.03 percent from June.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Central Bank announced to suspend the operations of
additional 42 finance firms in early August, triggering heavier
withdrawals from local financial institutions around the country.
</P>
<P>
Although the August figures are not yet available, analysts
said deposits figures in the month with local and foreign banks
are expected to have bigger changes, with small and medium-sized
banks gaining less deposits and large banks and foreign bank
branches reaping more.

LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prince Charles of Britain flew home from Paris with the body
of his former wife Diana, Princess of Wales, Sunday night to
prepare for official mourning and a possible state funeral.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad launched an angry
attack on the IMF in a move which could further destabilize
Southeast Asia's financial markets.
</P>
<P>

Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace Sunday as the public
mourned Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>

<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A death without objective, a death without words, but with
image: Lady Diana died as she had lived, under the spell of the
dreaming machine. Nothing very normal or very understandable, as
was shown by the reaction of public opinion in front of the end of
a modern and touching young woman.
</P>
<P>
-- The slaughter of 300 civilians on August 29, according to
hospital sources, in Reis, south of Algiers, has brought to an end
of the silence and indifference of the international community
toward the endless conflict in Algeria, and has made Abassi
Madani, the newly released leader of the Islamic Salvation Front,
to agree to appeal for an end of "blood letting" in his country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- If the death of Princess Diana on Sunday was such a shock,
it is that she seems to be the product of a little forgotten
word: destiny. Nothing but fatality can explain this death which
came suddenly in the full night, full speed, and full glory as
much as those in the mythologies of the epoch.
</P>
<P>
-- In a letter addressed to the United Nations Secretary
General, leader of Algeria's outlawed Islamic Salvation Front
Abassi Madani, who was released two months ago by the Algerian
authorities, promised to immediately launch an appeal for an end
of violence. This came after 100 to 200 people were massacred
assumably by Islamic extremists on August 29 in Algiers.

<HEADLINE> Pardon for Ex-Presidents New Political Issue in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Pardon for former South Korean
Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo has become a major
political issue with the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) beginning to
take concrete steps to release them by the Mid-Autumn Festival
this month.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have been indicted on bribery charges and are
currently serving jail terms as long as a whole life and 22 years
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Party Chairman Lee Hoi-chang will propose a pardon of Chun and
Roh to President Kim Young-sam on September 4," NKP spokesman Lee
Sa-churl said today.
</P>
<P>
The NKP said the pardons are necessary to realize the "grand
political unity," starting to take measures to free them by the
festival beginning on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The move is interpreted as a wooing gesture to Kyongsang
Provinces' voters, the hometowns of the former presidents, in
consideration for the coming presidential election in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The main opposite National Congress for New Politics (NCNP),
whose president Kim Dae-jung had already suggested the pardon, is
yet to decide on the party's official decision.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of NCNP leaders have accepted Kim Dae-jung's
revised position on the issue, some others called for a more
cautious approach before setting on a final position.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung's original stance was that before the two former
presidents can be pardoned, they should apologize first.
</P>
<P>
But the second biggest opposite United Liberal Democrats (ULD),
while agreeing on the pardon, insisted that the matter should not
be discussed until the presidential election is held and that the
NKP cannot be the one to propose the pardon.
</P>
<P>
After all, the ULD said, it was the NKP who introduced those
special laws so that Chun and Roh could be indicted.
</P>
<P>
The minor opposite Democratic Party also agreed that the former
presidents should be pardoned, but opposed the proposed time.
</P>
<P>
At today's news conference, President of the Democratic Party
Cho Soon called it "regretful" that the two former presidents were
jailed and agreed that they should be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the NKP for hurrying up to set free the
two ex-presidents by the Mid-Autumn festival, a strategy for the
upcoming presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Leaves for Brazil for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
left here today for a 10-day official visit to Brazil which has
the largest population of Lebanese expatriates in the world,
according to radio reports this morning.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Brazil is the first by a Lebanese president in 43
years.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at enhancing bilateral relations and
strengthening ties between Lebanese expatriates in Brazil and
local residents.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi will hold talks with his Brazilian counterpart Fernando
Henrique Cardoso mainly on promoting political and economic
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also tackle the deadlocked Middle East peace
process and the importance of the implementation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425 demanding Israeli full withdrawal from its
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Hrawi will also discuss with the Lebanese
expatriates on the issue of granting Lebanese nationality to
some of them.
</P>
<P>
Some Lebanese expatriates living in Brazil have lost their
Lebanese nationality due to disorder in Lebanon resulted from the
1975-1990 civil war. These expatriates demanded Lebanon to grant
them Lebanese nationality.
</P>
<P>
The number of Lebanese expatriates in Brazil reaches more than
8 million, according to latest official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Organizations Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-eight Greek and
Turkish Cypriot organizations today issued a joint declaration,
calling for a federal, peaceful and democratic Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, issued on the occasion of the International
Day for Peace, described the status quo as the "basis for
provocative actions, friction, conflict and war" on the island.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that it is their "historic duty to oppose those
forces that inhibit peaceful procedures and to work together in
order to secure lasting peace in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over 37 percent of the island in the wake of a
failed Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the island nation as a bi-communal, bi-zonal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The organizations said in their declaration that their aim is
the creation of a federal, peaceful and democratic Cyprus, which
will be common home for Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"People should be aware of their past but they should not
live in the past," the declaration said, adding that "we
must find the way to overcome feelings of hatred and revenge and
to make good use of our past experiences in order to build a
peaceful future."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Greek and Turkish Cypriot trade unions
will hold a peace rally this afternoon at the Ledra Palace
checkpoint in Nicosia, organized by the All-Cyprus Trade Union
Forum, to mark the International Day for peace.

<HEADLINE> Transit Route to Bangladesh via India for Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's long-held dream of
an alternative transit route to Bangladesh via India's Phulbari
came true today as the route was formally inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
Indian ambassador to Nepal K. V. Rajan and Commerce Secretary
of Nepal Mohan Dev Pant exchanged letters today at Kakarbhitta,
formally guaranteeing Nepal's right to the transit route for the
coming six months, said a press release issued by the Indian
embassy.
</P>
<P>
The new land route runs 71 kilometers from Kakarbhitta, Nepal's
eastern gateway to India, to Banglabandh in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to the modalities reached by the two sides,
pilfer-proof trucks and containers can use the transit route on
Saturdays and Sundays, and these trucks and containers will be
escorted by the Indian security force and can go only during the
broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
And only 25 trucks at most will be released at one time from
each side.
</P>
<P>
There will be a short negative list of categories of goods not
allowed for transit such as firearms and ammunition, hazardous
cargo, gold and silver bullion and narcotics, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has requested for this alternative route to Bangladesh
through Phulbari in the so-called "chicken neck" in northeastern
India since it found uneconomic the first transit route granted by
India in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Floral Industry Blossoms in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Flower power is packing a
stronger punch in east China's Fujian province, which now ranks
among the country's top seven flower-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the total flower planting area
covers 5,107 ha. and the annual output value has topped 383
million yuan, up 28 percent and nearly four-fold the amount in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The province has made its flower industry a priority in its
agricultural development plan, and individual flower-growers have
organized channels for exchanging information on the business.
</P>
<P>
With the government's help, Luoyuan county has begun to export
flowers. Its annual export to Japan alone has reached one million
bouquets.
</P>
<P>
People living in the southwestern mountainous areas of the
province have developed simple pot-planting into large-scale
flower fields including many major cymbidium production bases.
</P>
<P>
Nankeng Town of Nanjing county has earned over 10 million yuan
annually from flower cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province is able to provide a wide variety of
flowers in any season.
</P>
<P>
The city of Zhangzhou, known as the hometown of narcissus, has
invested five million yuan to build a flower planting zone. Over
30 domestic and overseas investors have joined the lucrative
business, owing to the preferential policies issued by the local
government.
</P>
<P>
A 50 km-long flower belt, covering over 667 ha. of land, and a
large flower market are to be built along the Zhangzhou section of
the No. 324 state highway.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial officials, Fujian has drawn up plans to
further expand the floral industry. By 2000, the province will
have a total flower-planting area of 66,667 ha., while its yearly
output value is expected to reach 600 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Creation to Be Delayed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
proposed secondary bond market in the Philippines will be delayed,
an official of the Capital Market Development Council said today.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Canlas, spokeswoman of the council, traced the reasons to
the intervention of some economic and political forces in the
United Nations-sponsored project.
</P>
<P>
She said the council, in coordination with the government, has
to seriously pay attention to the economic and political
priorities at this time when the capital market is experiencing
speculative attacks resulting in the latest currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Canlas, however, stressed that the members of the council,
composed of top officials from government and the business
sectors, are scheduled to meet again in October to finalize the
implementation of the proposed secondary bond market project.
</P>
<P>
She is optimistic that the meeting would result positively in
the finalization of a number of measures that could eventually
lead to the project's implementation before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project will initially be implemented with a
start-up budget of 33,000 US dollars from the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The amount will be used to finance the project's consultations
for experts on the bond market's development like the preparation
of the project feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, proponents of the project, led by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, have recommended to the
Department of Finance for the endorsement of partial funding
support from the Asian Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Investment for Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, Sepember 1 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, an old heavy
industrial base in northeast China, is expecting more overseas
investment to develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
It has more than 1,400 large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, a tenth of the country's total, with more than 400
billion yuan (48 billion US dollars) in fixed assets, according to
Gao Guozhu, Deputy Governor of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning plans to use 1.3 billion US dollars in overseas
investment for 83 projects in the petrochemical, metallurgical,
machine-building and electronics sectors, the province's four
pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds will also be used to develop high-tech industries

<HEADLINE> Iran Executes Spy for US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today
that it had executed a citizen spying for the United States
in a gesture of tough stance toward its 18-year-old enemy.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's Military Tribunal said in a statement that Siavosh
Bayani, son of Abolqassem, was hanged in the capital of Tehran
last week on charges of spying for "Great Satan, America."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, which did not mention his age,
Bayani had relayed secret military information to the
U.S. intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
Bayani left Iran for the United State through a neighboring
country in the Iranian year 1363 (1984-85), where he applied for
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
After living in the United States for 11 years, the Central
Intelligency Agency (CIA) assigned him to return to Iran for
espionage activities, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in 1995 by the Iranian security forces
and later confessed to his activities -- "spying for Great
Satan, America," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Based on his confessions, Bayani received a sum of 1,000 to
1,500 U.S. dollars for each contact.
</P>
<P>
He was tried at a tribunal in Tehran and sentenced to death
according to a verdict issued on January 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was carried out at the Evin prison in Tehran last
week after going through the legal proceedings and being
endorsed by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Iran has passed a law with severe punishment -- death
sentence for those who spy for the United States and Israel
because Tehran regards the United States and Israel as their
sworn enemies.
</P>
<P>
The United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran in
1980 during the hostage-taking crisis but the election of
moderate President Mohammad Khatami prompted the
U.S. administration to consider whether the time was ripe for a
change in its approach to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
But, the Iranian authorities, especially Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei, seem to continue their anti-U.S. policy and
declared earlier that it would have normal relations with all
countries except for the United States and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Coast Violence Hits Kenya's Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A fortnight of violence in
Kenya's coast districts has dealt a serious blow to the tourism
industry with two hotels closed and workers sent on leave, "The
East African" reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, more than 40 people have been
killed in violent actions in the port city of Mombasa and its
environs which began with a raid on a police station at Likoni
area on August 13.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspapers said that two Italian companies closed
their tourist hotels last week in Malindi, a resort town in
Kenya's coastal region which attracts most of some 770,000
visitors to Kenya each year.
</P>
<P>
Ventag Lia Group closed the 200-bed Temple Point on August 27
because there were no new bookings owing to massive cancellations
by Italian holiday makers while Beach Oasis Ltd. closed the
150-bed Jombo Village.
</P>
<P>
A weekly 5,000 tourists visit Mombasa during the normal travel
season, but now the number has fallen drastically by 30 to 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 charter flights land in Mombasa every week and all
of them were fully booked before the Likoni violence, said the
paper, adding that now many had been cancelled, particularly from
Italy.
</P>
<P>
One hotel chain, which has four units in the Likoni area,
reported that bed occupancy had plummeted from 98 percent two
weeks ago to 37 percent by last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gideon Mung'aro, chairman of the Mombasa and Coast Tourist
Association's Malindi branch, said more than 100 workers of
Malindi's Blue Club Hotel were sent on leave Sunday and over 500
workers in other establishments in the area faced the same fate.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is the number one foreign exchange earner for
the east African country, which received 770,000 visitors last
year with an earning of 480 million U.S. Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolitan area, is currently home to 62 schools involving
funding from over 20 countries and regions, according to the
Shanghai municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative schools have emerged as a new area attracting
foreign investment over the past several years, according to an
official in charge of the city's education.
</P>
<P>
Overseas partners come from Britain, Japan, the United States,
France, Holland, Singapore, Canada, Australia and various other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"The influx of foreign investment has enabled us to establish
more cooperative schools," said the official. "It will help narrow
the gap on education between China and developed countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that such schools in Shanghai have trained a large
number of senior management personnel with graduation certificates
widely recognized throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He said, the municipal government recently issued special
regulations on the management of foreign-funded schools in order
to attract more overseas capital needed to promote local education.

He pointed out that Shanghai's rapidly developing economy has
created the need for more skilled personnel, especially in

He added that from a third to half of shanghai's 1.25 million
professionals are expected to resign from their current jobs and

more skilled personnel for the new industries and the service
sector."

<HEADLINE> Telephone Tariffs Cut in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's telephone tariffs,
one of the highest in the world, have been revised downwards and
will take effect from today, reported The Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
Sempala Mbuga, managing director of Uganda Posts and
Telecommunication Corporation (UPTC), was quoted as saying that
charges for calls to the frequently called countries such as

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Delegation to Visit Kenya for Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is to send to Kenya a
high-powered delegation to discuss non-tariff barriers which are
said to be standing in the way of Ugandans selling their goods
across the border.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Trade and Industry Minister Henry Muganwa Kajura was
quoted by today's East African as saying that he will lead a
delegation to Nairobi this month to discuss issues "affecting
trade between the two sister countries."
</P>
<P>
The issues include the cash bond requirement imposed on those
importing transit goods through Kenya's Mombasa port and
allegations that Kenyan traders are placing obstacles in the path
of Ugandans who want to export goods to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The cash bonds requirement was introduced by the Kenya Revenue
Authority (KPA) to replace the much-abused insurance bonds as a
way of curbing the dumping of untaxed goods into the Kenyan
market.
</P>
<P>
But the new bonds have proved almost as ineffective as the
insurance bonds they replaced, as thousands of tons of illicit
sugar imported by well-connected businessmen finds its way into
the local market.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Uganda Revenue Authority last May instituted
measures similar to those in Kenya to prevent dumping of goods
and which the Ugandans are protesting against.
</P>
<P>
Under the requirement imposed by both the KPA and its Ugandan
counterpart, all goods in transit must deposit with the
government money equivalent to the value of goods in transit.
</P>
<P>
Both Ugandan importers and members of the Uganda Clearing and
Forwarding Agents Association (UCFA) say the introduction of the
cash bond requirement by the Kenyan government was affecting
their operations.
</P>
<P>
"It's only clearing agents and big importers who have a lot of
money and who are not facing problems with the new system," said
a clearing agent in Kampala who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Kajura said his delegation will also investigate complaints by
Ugandan traders that Kenyan business people were conniving with
some government officials to frustrate them.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a Kenyan governemnt policy, it is only a few
traders who are doing it," said Kajura.
</P>
<P>
Uganda manufacturers want to export products such as day-old
chicks from Ugachick, fish and mattresses to their eastern
African neighbor.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda Rebel Leader Back with 300 Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Rebel leader of the Lord's
Resistance Army Joseph Kony, has returned to northern Uganda with
his 300 soldiers, a senior army commander said Sunday in Gulu,
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Colonel James Kazini, commander of the fourth division,
advised the residents in the northern district of Kitgum to avoid
Kony and his rebels in case of being abducted.
</P>
<P>
According to local report, LRA rebels abduct civilians to fill
its ranks.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army was engaged in two battles last week with the
rebels, killing nine and capturing three of them. The government
troops will pursue the rebels, Kazini pledged.
</P>
<P>
The captured rebels said Kony's aim was to appear in the
country and show his presence. The Ugandan authorities had
recently celebrated the demise of IRA.
</P>
<P>
But the two battles scared Kony, forcing him to remain in the
border area near Sudan, The New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said the LRA rebel group operating in the
north had some 450 members at present as against some 3,000
members in the past.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader entered Kitgum from southern Sudan where LRA
has its bases.

DALIAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese industrial park
in Dalian, a seaside city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province,
has attracted a total investment of 500 million US dollars in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 33 enterprises already operational in the park, the
majority are ventures wholly-funded by Japanese corporations,
including a number of transnationals, such as Toto, Fuji Electric,
Mitsubishi Electric, YKK and Konica.
</P>
<P>
A senior manager with the park's development company said many
enterprises started production this year. He attributed the rapid
growth to the improving investment environment of the Dalian
Economic and Technological Development Zone, where the park is
located.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 970,000 sq.m. of land has been transferred to
investors, covering more than half of the total transferable area.

BUENOS AIRES, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer star Diego
Maradona said he had not taken cocaine, his agent Guillermo
Coppola told local television Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Coppola said, "Diego swore to me he did not take cocaine, so
now I doubt the results of the doping test."
</P>
<P>
Maradona tested positive for drugs after a league match for
Boca Juniors last Thursday and could be banned for up to five
years if a second test proves positive this week.
</P>
<P>
"Now Diego is at home with his daughters and family," Coppola
said. "He hasn't told me when he will speak (publicly) about the
(drugs) issue, but I'm sure he will do so when he's ready ... I
say we leave him alone and don't pressure him."
</P>
<P>
The Argentine Football Association (AFA) provisionally
suspended him Friday night and summoned him for a hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who has undergone several treatments to kick cocaine,
was attempting his fifth career comeback. He had tested postive
for drugs twice before, in 1991 when he was playing for Napoli and
during the 1994 World Cup in the United States.

<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese army will launch a
one-year program to train university graduates into officers in a
move to give the army a more academic-oriented image.
</P>
<P>
The Shijiazhuang Army Academy, the biggest military school in
Asia, will recruit 140 university graduates this year, sources
close to the academy said, adding that these men will study
command skills at the academy.
</P>
<P>
Then they will be assigned command posts in combat troops,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
This is an important move to integrate higher education into
the training programs of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and
to modernize the army which is being challenged by the global
hi-tech revolution, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
PLA has recruited college students before, but they were not
trained as commanding officers. Most of them were assigned to
non-combat posts or engaged in technical services.
</P>
<P>
The program was approved by the General Political Department
of the PLA, the sources revealed.
</P>
<P>
The 140 men majored in 20 specialities, including Chinese
literature, law, foreign languages, computer science and
sports. They are all under age 24.
</P>
<P>
During the one-year training, they will study various military
tactics and skills. Then they will be graded first lieutenant rank
and become platoon leaders.

NEW DELHI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The sewage water which has
been polluting Delhi residents' only sources of life, the Yamuna
river, for the past several decades, will now be utilized for
afforestation purposes, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
With life becoming more and more suffocating in the Indian
capital of Delhi due to the ever-increasing pollution, a review to
counter the choking city life was recently done in which
scientists expressed the need for effective use of sewage water
for development purpose.
</P>
<P>
Under a new project, the untreated sewage water which used to
join the Yamuna river through various drains would now be used for
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have allotted 40 acres of land for the
project for a period of one year.
</P>
<P>
If the project is successful implemented, it will not only
reduce discharge of sewage water into Yamuna but also help in
having green lung for Delhi.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's expensive film has
turned in a big profit in Shanghai, beating all imported Hollywood
movies hands down.
</P>
<P>
"The Opium War", directed by Xie Jin, has generated box-office
sales of 14 million yuan (1.8 million US dollars) since its June
21 premiere in China's biggest commercial and trade metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that this is the highest amount taken in by a
single film in Shanghai's film history.
</P>
<P>
The film depicts Britain's invasion of China in 1840 after
China seized and burned opium smuggled in by British traders. The
war ended badly for China and signaled the beginning of the fall
of the eastern empire.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the number of enthusiastic moviegoers was so
big that cinema managers had to open additional viewing halls.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Fund Its Own Budget in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda shall be able to fund
its own budget by the year 2002 from taxes, reported the local
daily The Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
Larbi Siaw, commissioner general of Uganda Revenue Authority
(URA), was quoted as saying "I know it is not easy to make
predictions in matters of revenue but I am tempted to say that
given Uganda's trend in tax improvement, it shall be able to
solely fund its financial budget by the year 2002."
</P>
<P>
Siaw, a Ghanaian who has been in Uganda for 6 years said, "I
saw a devastated country emerging from the shadows of 20 years of
war with an inflation rate of over 400 percent, a country whose
people were willing to come out of a dark."
</P>
<P>
Uganda's revenue collection has improved from 140 billion
Shillings (about 140 million U.S. Dollars) in 1991 to 742 billion
Shillings (about 742 million Dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
URA is expected to bag 851 billion Shillings (about 851
million Dollars) in 1997-1998 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Tumusime Mutebile, secretary to the Treasury, disclosed that
Uganda's taxes are at their highest and the government can only
revise them downwards.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran recorded a 9.1 percent rise
in divorce rate in the first quarter of the current Iranian
calendar year starting from March 21 over that of last year, a

A woman specialist said about 80 to 90 percent of the woman are
not satisfactory with their marriage not only for economic reasons
but for the negligence of their husbands as well.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gets Messages From U.S., Russian FMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today receives messages on the Mideast peace stalemate from
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeniy Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) said that Albright's message
dealt with the current conditions of the Mideast peace process and
her projected tour of the region in September.
</P>
<P>
The message of the Russian foreign minister focused on the
peace process in the region and Moscow's role, MENA said, without
giving details.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russian ambassadors to Egypt delivered the
messages during their separate meetings with Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process that started under the co-sponsorship
of Washington and Moscow in 1991 run into a deep crisis since
March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as a major player in commencing the peace process, has
significantly lowered its profile; the U.S. has been widely
criticized for being "too passive" in breaking the peace impasse
and "too biased" in mediating a conciliation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador here Edward Walker told the press after his
meeting with Moussa that Egypt would be "the third or fourth stop"
of Albright's multi-leg tour of the region, which is reportedly to
begin September 9.
</P>
<P>
The maiden trip to the region by Albright would also take her
to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories, Syria, Jordan
and possibly Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Walker said further withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank, among other issues, would be discussed during Albright's
visit. Israel declared on Saturday that it will not execute the
second stage of the Oslo accords related to its redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright, in an attempt to revive the stalled peace talks, was
reported to bring with her major U.S. initiatives on the final
status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, further Israeli
redeployment and Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in January, Albright has avoided touring
the region, apparently fearing she could achieve little as
relations between Israel and the Palestinians have gone from bad
to worse.
</P>
<P>
But after the suicide bombings in Jerusalem last month, she was
strongly considering a trip, her aides said.

<HEADLINE> Further Opening for Northwest Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The governor of China's Shaanxi
province has said no time will be waisted in making use of the
central government's new strategic policy of developing China's
backward western part.
</P>
<P>
The province will use more overseas investment and local
resources for economic development, Cheng Andong told Xinhua
recently.
</P>
<P>
The governor cited infrastructure, natural resource
exploration, agriculture, hi-tech industry and tourism as the
sectors which need investment urgently.
</P>
<P>
Before 2000, Shaanxi plans to build three railways, three
high-grade highways, and a number of coal, power, oil, gas and
mineral projects, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The province, rich in resources, has plans for the
biggest gasfield with proven reserves of 210 billion cu.m. and one
of the largest fine coal mines in the world. The coal mine has
more than 160 billion tons of proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
The province is referred to as a "history museum", with its
35,000 historical sites and tourism potential, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
It also ranks third in China in number of educational and
research institutions, with 56 universities and over 1,000
research bodies.
</P>
<P>
It has also made big progress in opening-up, Cheng noted. Since
the late 1970s, Shaanxi has set up 2,500 foreign-funded projects,
with total foreign capital of three billion US dollars. Last year,
it accelerated the pace of using overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, foreign investors bought 51 percent of the Weihe Power
Plant and 20-year management rights to an expressway from Xi'an,
the provincial capital, to Lintong, a city in eastern Shaanxi.

Beijing, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in China
this year will equal the amount attracted from overseas in
1996, Beijing-based English language newspaper "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) predicted a considerable
increase on State plans to use roughly 30 billion US dollars of
foreign direct investment this year. China absorbed over 40
billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's second largest user of foreign direct
investment for four consecutive years. The United States ranks the
first.
</P>
<P>
An official of SSB's trade department pointed out that most
major investors in China, including Japan, the United States,
Singapore, South Korea, Britain and Germany all increased their
actual input in the first half of this year. But new investment is
growing at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of foreign direct investment from January to June
still go to the eastern coastal areas despite the government's
call for a shift to the west and the north.
</P>
<P>
However, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong and Hainan
provinces saw a drop in new foreign investment in the first six
months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Investors are being allowed to enjoy reductions of exemption on
tariffs on imported equipment worth less than 30 million US
dollars for another year, according to the deputy director of the
SSB's trade department.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
clarified that Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral will not hold any
talks with his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif in New York
during his visit to the United States later this month, the local
press said today.
</P>
<P>
The clarification came on Sunday, one day after the prime
minister reportedly said that he would hold talks with Sharif
during their presence in New York to attend the forthcoming
session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman said on Sunday that the media reports to
this effect were "misleading".

The prime minister during a brief exchange with the media at
Shantiniketan (West Bengal of India) on Saturday had only
mentioned about the proposed foreign secretary level talks between
India and Pakistan, the spokesman said, adding that "there was no
mention of talks at the prime ministers' level."
</P>
<P>
Several Indian newspapers had quoted Gujral as saying on
Saturday that "I am going to hold talks with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in New York. Indo-Pakistan relations are
improving. We are hopeful that all our aspirations for improved
bilateral relations would be fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
Gujral, who is scheduled to go to New York in the third week of
September to address the UN General Assembly, is expected to meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton on September 22.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who will be present on the same day in New York, will
also meet President Clinton.

STOCKHOLM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sweden, which is normally
famous for its pleasant cool summers of the Nordic region,
experienced the hottest summer in more than 100 years this year.
</P>
<P>
Stockholm had an average temperature of 19 degrees Celsius from
June to August, three degrees higher than in normal years and
above the record high of 18.9 degrees Celsius in 1900.
</P>
<P>
In Southern and central Sweden, the average temperature in
August this year was 21-22 degrees Celsius, five to six degrees
higher than in normal years, which is also two degrees higher than
that in Paris.
</P>
<P>
As a result, electric fans or air-conditioners have been widely
used in many offices and residence houses since early July.
</P>
<P>
The sustained heat spell has caused storms. In the northern
Piteaa area, the precipitation on July 28 reached 198 mm, which
was the heaviest rainfall on a single day in Sweden since 1873.
</P>
<P>
There was no exact account for the freak summer this year in
Sweden and the whole Scandinavia. Experts were reluctant to say
whether the abnormal weather conditions were a result of the
impact of "greenhouse effect" or the "El Nino" phenomenon.

BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports to the United
States in the first six months of this year totaled 130.42 billion
baht (5.2 billion U.S. dollars), up 10 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly attributed to the rising demand in the
U.S. market for Thai products, such as transformers, frozen
seafood, televisions, canned food, wire cable, computers and
parts, women's garments, frozen shrimps and jewelry, according to
a report of the Thai Commerce Ministry available today.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai share of the U.S. market was only 1 percent
during the first five months of this year, slightly down from the
same period of last year, as the Thai market share declined for
frozen fish, natural rubber, artificial flowers, ceramics,
tableware and toys, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also noted that Thai exports to the European Union
in the first six months of this year amounted to 111.2 billion

<HEADLINE> Dini Warns Against Extremism in Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today warned against falling into traps set by extremists in
the Middle East who aimed to block the peace process and called
into question Israel's "peace for security" policy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Aspen Institute conference in Genoa, Dini said,
"Europe is able to distinguish the crimes of Hamas from the
mistakes of Israel," but this does not stop us from "recognizing
the reasons of the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
He recalled the words of Italian President Oscar Scalfaro in
July, "Friendship does not mean that the friend is always right,"
spoken in criticism of Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Dini criticized the Israeli policy of "peace in exchange for
security" as an erroneous confrontation of two concepts. "It
cannot be said that there can be no peace without security," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
He praised the late Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, as a
man who possessed "the great merit of understanding...that
security cannot be entrusted to arms alone."

<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 Sydney Olympic Games

the 14 Olympic boat classes for the next Summer Olympics.

from the rules and regulations of the sport to be in line with

<HEADLINE> Booming Civil Aviation in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation
business will grow at an annual rate of 12 percent in the
remaining years of this century, according to Chen Guangyi,
Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, air transport volume will reach 14 billion
ton kilometers. The country's airlines will carry 100 million
passengers and two million tons of goods and mail, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
"We have to open more air routes, add advanced aircraft, and
build a batch of key airports and air control facilities to raise
the capacity of civil aviation," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Before the arrival of the 21st century, China will do its
utmost to build and upgrade 41 airports, whose combined handling
capacity will account for 95 percent of the country's total, to cater
to the demand expected in the years from 2005 to 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
The airports are scattered in 40 municipalities, provincial
capitals, capital cities of autonomous regions, and important
economic showcase and tourism cities.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that emphasis will be put on the expansion of
the Beijing Capital Airport, construction of the Shanghai Pudong
International Airport and Guangzhou's New Baiyun International
Airport, and the renovation of Shanghai Hongqiao International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese civil aviation industry is entering a new
era of development, and its growth continues to exceed the world
average.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Inland Water Transport Improves: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister for Transport
Lieutenant-General Thein Win said today that his country's inland
water transport has greatly improved due to addition of over 100
cargo and passenger vessels in the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
Thein Win made the remarks at a vessel delivery ceremony here
today, attended by First Secretary of the Myanmar State Law and
Order Restoration Council Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt and Second
Secretary Lieutenant-General Tin Oo.
</P>
<P>
The minister said of the added 103 vessels, 72 were purchased
from China, while 31 others built domestically.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar's state-run Five Star Line Co. signed one
more contract in September 1996 with China National Machinery and
Equipment Import and Export Corporation on purchasing two ocean
going multi-purpose cargo vessels to enhance the country's
overseas water transport.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also built a number of freighter vessels for
foreign companies in recent years which include those in Indonesia
and Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since China implemented the policy of reform and opening-up in
the late 1970s, the country's civil aviation business skyrocketed
20.1 percent annually for 15 consecutive years, 3.6 times higher
than the average figure of member countries of the International
Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate aviation transport volume amounted to 8.05
billion ton kilometers in 1996, ranking 10th in the world, as
against 12th in 1992. Passenger volume was 55.55 million, double
the figure of 1992 and jumping from ninth to fifth place.
</P>
<P>
"The increase was larger than in any five-year period in the
past," the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China invested as much as 40
billion yuan in building airports, air routes and support
facilities, as well as technical renovation.
</P>
<P>
The country has set up the world's largest flying institute,
Asia's largest computer booking network, and Asia's largest
hangar. Construction, expansion and upgrading have also been
completed on 39 key airports, including those in Shenzhen, Guilin,
Guiyang, Fuzhou, and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that more than 440 transport airplanes are now
operating, up about 130 in 1992. The world's most advanced
airplanes can be seen in the Chinese aviation fleet, he added.
</P>
<P>
A fairly complete aviation network has been formed in China, he
said, noting that the country now has about 880 air routes, 260
more than five years ago. Its international air routes are linked
with more than 60 cities in 32 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Limits Dollar Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Indonesia
has imposed a five-million-U.S.-dollar limit on the forward
foreign exchange trading to confine speculative dollar buying,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The new move, which was announced on Sunday by the bank in a
statement, came into effect on August 29, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the trading of foreign currencies from
domestic banks to non-resident customers would be limited to five
million U.S. dollars per customer.
</P>
<P>
The only exception would be swap transaction for investment in
Indonesia and import/export needs, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Forward exchange transactions are purchases or sales of foreign
currencies at an exchange rate established at the time of the deal
but with payment and delivery at a specified future date.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attacks following de factor devaluation
of the Thai baht and the Philippine peso in July.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Central Bank, in its first move following the
attacks, widened its now defunct intervention band from 8 percent
to 12 percent to make speculation on rupiah more expensive.
</P>
<P>
But the widening band was not effective to appease speculation.
After intervening in the market with 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, the
Central Bank decided to float the currency on August 14.
</P>
<P>
After the floating, the rupiah suddenly fell to a historic low
of 3,045 against the U.S. dollar, which prompted the Central Bank
to squeeze rupiah liquidity and raise interest rates to discourage
speculative dollar buying using cheap rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah recovered briefly to 2,650 after the Central Bank
squeezed liquidity by raising the Central Bank's Certificate (SBI)
rates to as high as 30 percent for one-month paper, stopping to
discount money market securities and forced state companies to
convert their deposits to the Central Bank's papers.
</P>
<P>
But the currency continued to fluctuate, dropping to the same
level before the Central Bank imposed the credit crunch, and even
touched a new historic low of 3,070 last Friday before easing to
2,900 level.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said the Central Bank's newest move of limiting
forward transactions would not stop the rupiah from weakening
further. It would only slow down the process.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The first Asia-Europe finance
ministers' meeting will be held in Bangkok on September 19, it is
learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be held in line with decisions made at the
first Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM) in Bangkok in March 1996 to
discuss monetary and fiscal policy cooperation between the two
regions.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming meeting, finance ministers from 25 countries
will discuss financial cooperation between the two continents and
customs cooperation under the ASEM framework.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is expected to report on progress toward a
single currency.
</P>

Asian member countries are concerned about how the European
monetary unit, scheduled to be implemented in January 1999, will
affect capital, financial and foreign-exchange markets in Europe
and consequently in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asia will also call for more investment from Europe,
particularly infrastructure financing in Indochina, according to a
Thai official.
</P>
<P>
Linkages of financial information among the 25 member states
will also be discussed, in order to establish an E-mail network
similar to what the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)
finance ministers are doing, the official said.

<P>
ASEM groups seven ASEAN members, three ASEAN dialogue partners
(China, Japan and South Korea) and the 15 European Union members.

<HEADLINE> Thai Industries Seek More Money Than Bank's Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai industries are seeking as
much as 60 billion baht (1.76 billion US dollars) from the
Industry Ministry, 10 times the amount the central bank is
prepared to provide.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of companies in the country are facing severe cash
flow problems. Even those with firm orders in hand cannot obtain
loans to buy raw materials or expand production, the Bangkok Post
today quotes Deputy Industry Minister Somphop Amatayakul as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank was committed to providing 6 billion
baht (176 million dollars) in loans, but the requests from 248
applicants over the past month topped 60 billion baht (1.76
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said companies seeking fund to increase production would
receive priority in the screening process, but those asking for
money to refinance or to invest in the stock market will be
rejected.
</P>
<P>
The inability of some companies to secure raw materials has
resulted in lost export opportunities totaling more than one
billion baht, according to the Federation of Thai Industries.

<HEADLINE> EU Ambassadors Should Return to Tehran: Italian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dini said that after the election of a new Iranian president,
Mohammed Khatami, it was time for the EU to leave the diplomatic
incident behind.
</P>
<P>
The EU pulled its ambassadors out of Tehran after a German
court ruling on the April 10, 1992 murder in a Berlin restaurant
of four Kurdish opponents of the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the Iranian government had commissioned
the killings. The court ruling led the EU to break off its policy
of "critical dialogue" with Iran, especially after Iranian
officials said the German and Danish ambassadors would not be
welcome in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently said that
Germany was itself monitoring the apparent shift in the Iranian
leadership with Khatami's election at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor said that Germany might revise its position on
Iran if the changes turned out to be "substantive."
</P>
<P>
Dini said that Italy would be seeking to accelerate this
re-assessment. "Solidarity with Germany has been shown by all but
now there is a new presidency in Iran. Let's start again and see
if Tehran sends signals of openness and dialogue, as the
international community expects."
</P>
<P>
Dini said the problem should be resolved "as soon as possible."
Khatami's inauguration earlier this month would have been a good
opportunity for solving it, but it had been missed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Develop Hi-tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will give priority to
modern biological science, the information industry and the new
materials industry in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China, told a meeting here recently that
Shangha's goal for the development of hi-tech industry is, by the
year 2000, to make hi-tech industry's output value account for 20
percent of the city's total industrial output value and its
exports account for over 15 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech industry had over 75 billion yuan (nine billion US
dollars) in output value last year, about 14 percent of the city's
total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
The city is offering financial support to some major hi-tech
projects, and is establishing an investment system for hi-tech
industry and encouraging universities and institutes to take part
in hi-tech development in local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is also encouraging technicians to find part-time jobs in
hi-tech enterprises or to use their hi-tech achievements to invest
in companies.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that experts from abroad will be paid well in
Shanghai and the city welcomes experts from other parts of the
country to move to the city to work. The city government will help
their spouses find jobs.

ROME, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
signed a decree today to extend by three months the repatriation
of Albanian refugees in Italy on November 30.
</P>
<P>
The first group of refugees to be returned will be those who

by authorities. Those with regular residence permits will not be
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Cases of unaccompanied children will be handled by the
committee for safeguarding foreign children set up in Prodi's

<P>
Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano said the text of
the decree will be made public on Monday. He called for full
cooperation between Italy and Albania. Albania had strongly
pressed for an extension of the August 31 deadline for the
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interior Ministry, about 16,000 Albanians
entered Italy this year and more than 10,000 of them held

PRAGUE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia today signed an
agreement with a foreign banking consortium on the provision of
120 million U.S. dollars in loans for the construction of a
super-highway in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be provided by a group of foreign banks led by
the Industrial Bank of Japan, press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the loans will be paid back in seven years
and the repayment can be extended to ten years if necessary.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a series of economic difficulties in recent
years, such as the shortage of funds and cuts in spending for
infrastructure construction, the Slovak government has strived to
get international loans to make up for the gap.
</P>

Slovakia's foreign debts had amounted to 2.9 billion dollars by

Speaking at an Aspen Institute conference in Genoa, Dini noted

He urged Europeans to mobilize the "great international

Dini confirmed that Italy means to call a new

continent," he added.

<HEADLINE> Spaniard Olano Wins 1997 Eddy Merckx Cycling Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Abraham Olano Sunday
proved his endurance and speed in relatively hot weather condition
by winning the 1997 version of the Eddy Merckx cycling grand prix.
</P>
<P>
Olano clocked one hour nine minutes and two seconds from two
laps in downtown Brussels for a combined distance of 61.2
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Boardman of Britain, a cyclist best known for
sprinting, finished one minute 20 seconds behind in second place
while Seiguei Gontchar of Ukraine came in third on a time of
1:11:07, 2:05 behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists were started one by one from nearby the Heysel Stadium
and pedalled through the streets amidst the cheers of on-lookers
who turned out to enjoy the sunshine after two days of overcast
weather and chilling drizzles.
</P>
<P>
Intermediate times showed that the Spaniard led the field all
the way down to his triumph.
</P>
<P>
Eddy Merckx, the race is dedicated to him, presented the trophy
to Olano after the competition.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian is the first cyclist to have won the prestigious
Tour de France five times in all, including a back-to-back winning
streak stretching from 1969 to 1972. He won the tour again in
1974.

TIANJIN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin had 61 companies with about 1,000 outlets by the end of
last June, with 16,000 employees and an average of 100 million
yuan (12 million US dollars) in monthly sales.
</P>
<P>
International companies are also getting involved.
China Resources Holdings of Hong Kong, for example, has 13 outlets in
Tianjin. The Daier Corporation, a major Japanese retailer, has
five supermarkets, each covering 2,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Also engaged in the chain-store business are some of the
most-famous local business like Gou Bu Li Restaurant, a steamed bun
operation with 80 franchises inside and outside China.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the chain stores and supermarkets are increasingly
popular with local consumers, and have great potential for future
development.

<HEADLINE> FIG Chief Calls for Further Development of Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- President of the International
Gymnastics Federation Bruno Grandi Sunday called for further
development of gymnastics in order to keep the sport event alive.
</P>
<P>
The FIG president told a press conference held just before the
1997 World Gymnastics Championships began Sunday evening in the
Olympic capital of Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"The codes of point now are not difficult," said Grandi, who
became the FIG president last year. "They are far behind the
development of the event of gymnastics." He urged further reform
but blamed no one on the current situation of gymnastics lagging
behind technically.
</P>
<P>
Grandi pledged that his federation would give support for
strong federations to make gymnastics among top sports events. On
the other hand, he said, the FIG would also support those
federations underdeveloped by providing them with means and funds
of training.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the FIG's refusal of six federations to take
part in the competition in Lausanne, Grandi said that every
federation should be treated equally.
</P>
<P>
Being a former gymnastist, Grandi said that he knew well the
feelings of those who were unable to come to Lausanne, but the
regulations and rules should be respected at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Applications of six federations, including those of Bulgaria,
Egypt, Zimbabwe, Mexico and two other Latin American countries,
were turned down because they came behind the deadline or after
the drawing of lots on June 9.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bad Media Behavior Accused For Diana's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, Aug 31 (Xinhua) - Media which made check news are
accused for the death of British Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
Diana, 36, and her companion Dodi Al Fayed, 41, were killed
early Sunday when their car crashed while being chased through
Paris by photographers on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Diana's brother Earl Charles Spencer said he always believed
the press would kill his sister, but that he had never imagined
"they would take such a direct hand in her death".
</P>
<P>
"It would appear that every proprietor and editor of every
publication that has paid for intrusive and exploitative
photographs of her, encouraging greedy and ruthless individuals to
risk everything in pursuit of Diana's image, has blood on his
hands today," Spencer told the media outside his house in Cape
Town in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was dismayed at the
sudden death of Princess Diana, while blaming a section of the
media for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Princess Diana has also become the victim of an increasingly
brutal and unscrupulous competitive fight of a section of the
media. This terrible accident and her death should finally give
those responsible in the media something to think about," Kohl
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Check news is popular in the west where publishers often buy
news to promote circulation of their products.
</P>
<P>
There are more than a dozen tabloids in Britain with
circulation of the top five overtaking one million respectively,
compared with the total circulation of five qualified newspapers
such as The Times just reaching three million.
</P>
<P>
"We have all they have, we also have all they don't have," a
vice chief editor of a leading tabloid told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't buy some photos, others will do," he said,
referring to a fierce competition among the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
Diana has become public figure since the disclosure of her
romance with Prince Charles. Tabloids have spent millions to buy
her photos and some photographers thus made millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Mirror bought photos by an Italian paparazzi named Mario
Brenna for about 250, 000 pounds (420,000 U.S. dollars) three weeks
before the disclosure of the romance between Diana and Dodi Fayed.
</P>
<P>
French criminal police questioned seven photographers who were
following Diana's car.
</P>
<P>
Legal sources said they could face charges of endangering lives
if they were proved to have caused the car to drive at high speed.
</P>
<P>
They could also be accused of failing to assist persons in
danger if they were found to have snapped pictures of the crash
rather than helping the victims.

WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today went to church together with his family to mourn the death
of Princess Diana but has not decided whether to attend the
funeral.

"We liked her very much. We admired her work for children, for

mines in the world," Clinton told reporters before he and his
vacationing family headed to church in Edgartown, Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Ready to Replace Welfare with Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Wisconsin, a state which has
led welfare reform in the United States, is asking everybody to
work as of Labor Day tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The state's latest welfare program -- "Wisconsin Works,"
requires all able-bodied adults to work or get job training in
exchange for a check, food stamps, medical assistance and
subsidized child care. It also puts a five-year cap on benefits,
the Associated Press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The program follows a decade of welfare experiments, starting
with Learnfare, which reduced benefits for recipients whose
children skipped school.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the state has tried out various measures to reform
welfare.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when the federal government overhauled regulations for
welfare program carried out by the states, Wisconsin was the first
to apply and the first to receive approval for its work-focused
proposal.
</P>
<P>
The state welfare caseload had been reduced by 62 percent, from
100,000 families to 38,000 families. Until Monday, those families
were receiving assistance through the Aid to Families with
Dependent Children.
</P>
<P>
The state can extend the time limits for families that are
cooperative but unable to become self-sufficient, said Jean
Rogers, administrator of the state Division of Economic Support.
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the poor worry there will not be enough
low-skilled jobs or child care available, and that jobs will not
pay enough. They fear that when benefits run out, homeless
shelters, food pantries and other charities will be the only
safety net.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Money Flowing to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The tobacco industry lobbying
for Congressional approval of a proposed 368-billion-U.S. dollar
settlement in a class lawsuit reached in June in 40 states, has
kept up a steady flow of campaign money to the lawmakers it is
courting.
</P>
<P>
Leading tobacco industry political action committees (PAC)
funneled 566,721 dollars to pivotal lawmakers in the first six
months of the year, according to Federal Election Commission
reports compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
The PAC is a group that represents a point of view and parcels
out campaign money to lawmakers or candidates sharing that point
of view.
</P>
<P>
That giving came on top of two million dollars in "soft money".
Nearly 80 percent of the total went to the Republicans who control
both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Top recipients of the contributions included key Republican
legislators of both houses, the reports said.
