Sprint star to appear at Games, team official assures fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The field wide open in the absence
of Donovan Bailey and Frankie Fredericks, Ato Boldon will run at
the Commonwealth Games and break the 100 meters world record,
according to Trinidad team manager Ken Doldron.
	   ``I urge everyone not to worry,'' Doldron told readers of
Malaysia's Daily Star Saturday amid fears that the sprint star
might also skip the Games.
	   ``He will be here to win the 100m gold with a new world record.
He will be in Kuala Lumpur by tomorrow night.''
	   If Boldon, also the world 200-meter champion, runs in the 100,
he may come under pressure from Obadele Thompson of Barbados, who
ran 9.87, .03 off Bailey's world mark, running at altitude in the
World Cup meet at Johannesburg Friday.
	   England's Dwain Chambers ran 10.03 there and also competes in
the 100 meters here along with European champion countryman Darren
Campbell, who is hopeful of shaking off a leg injury.
	   But Games organizers have been dismayed by the 100-meter
pullouts, starting several months ago with Olympic and world
champion Bailey who, coincidentally, ruptured his Achilles tendon
Friday while playing basketball with friends.
	   Earlier this week, Fredericks, a two-time Olympic silver
medalist over 200 meters, pulled out of the Namibian Games' team,
angered that Prime Minister Hage Geingob had considered boxer Harry
Simon, a newly-crowned world champion, as the nation's No. 1
athlete.
	   ``Frank is a world class sprinter, but he doesn't have a gold
from Olympics yet,'' Geingob said. ``By way of being Namibian
heroes, they will rank about the same, but Harry is a world
champion.''
	   Fredericks was slated to run the 100 and 200 meters and also in
Namibia's 4 x 100 relay team.
	   None of the Nigerian sprint stars are running because the nation
was expelled from the Commonwealth in 1995 over human rights
violations.

Dazzled by the opening, India seeks Malaysian help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dazzled by the grand opening of
the Commonwealth Games at Kuala Lumpur's new stadium, India on
Saturday sought Malaysia's help in sports.
	   Visiting Indian Human Resource Development Minister Murli
Manohar Joshi met with Malaysian Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin,
the national news agency Bernama said.
	   ``He was impressed with our performance and commended Malaysia
for successfully organizing it,'' Muhyiddin told reporters.
	   Malaysian assistance in training Indian athletes was discussed,
he said.
	   The 10-day games opened Friday with a ceremony watched by more
than 100,000 spectators and several hundred thousand TV viewers
around the world.
	   India, a nation of nearly 1 billion people, has a woeful record
in international sports. The only important sporting events India
has staged are the 1982 Asian Games and the 1996 World Cup for
cricket.

Ruling party mobs clash with opposition in 6th day of unrest

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with convoys of supporters rolling through
city, U.N. official urges dialogue.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen staged a major
show of force Saturday, bringing more than 5,000 supporters into
the capital and turning them loose with clubs and chains to beat
outnumbered opposition protesters calling for his ouster.
	   At least two people were badly beaten, but there were no reports
of shootings or new killings to add to four confirmed deaths in six
days of street violence. Belief on the streets is that many more _
including Buddhist monks _ have been slain.
	   The new clashes follow warnings by King Norodom Sihanouk and the
powerful head of the army to pressure opposition leaders to accept
Hun Sen's victory in disputed parliamentary elections and stop
``anarchy'' in the streets.
	   Hun Sen assembled supporters of his Cambodian People's Party
from strongholds in the Phnom Penh region. They rolled through the
capital in convoys of trucks, occasionally joined by truckloads of
troops.
	   Organizers threatened to double the size of the mob by Sunday,
when the opposition has called a massive peaceful rally _ declared
illegal by authorities _ that may pit Hun Sen's control of the
security apparatus against deepening anger against him on the
streets.
	   About 3,000 Hun Sen supporters marched from the Independence
Monument to the opposition rallying point near the U.S. Embassy and
the home of Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   They chanted for the arrests of the opposition leaders _
Ranariddh, the king's son, and his ally, Sam Rainsy _ calling them
``traitors.''
	   Riot police and soldiers, who had served as Hun Sen's shock
troops in his crackdown until he shifted to plainclothes mobs
Friday, allowed them to assemble freely. Every man carried a
weapon.
	   About 200 opposition supporters, braving intimidation by elite
police with Kalashnikov rifles and dirt bikes, shouted insults as
pro-Hun Sen crowd came into view, then scattered and threw stones
when they charged. A pedicab driver was badly beaten and ran for
refuge to the U.S. Embassy.
	   Though leaders insisted Hun Sen's crowd were volunteers, orders
were heard for organizers to return to the provinces to bring in
more men and to offer each 10 kilograms (24 pounds) of rice.
	   One club-wielding Hun Sen supporter, Prak Sokhan, 43, said: ``We
want to see all demonstrations stopped.''
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of relatively peaceful protests
against his 13-year rule Monday after grenades were thrown at his
home. He was not there and no one was hurt. He blamed Sam Rainsy,
his most vocal critic, and called for his arrest.
	   Sam Rainsy has sought refuge in the local U.N. offices and
called the charges a ``ridiculous pretext.''
	   About 1,500 Hun Sen supporters went Saturday to the hotel where
the offices are located and presented a message to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Its contents were not divulged.
	   ``Since the beginning of the situation, we've tried to convey
the message as much as possible from our secretary-general that
problems should be resolved through dialogue,'' U.N. military
observer Jan Wanderstein said.
	   Cambodians have been horrified and outraged by a week of
violence where police have used guns, clubs, rifle butts and water
cannon against demonstrators, including Buddhist monks. Despite
fears of violence, some 6,000 people took part Thursday in a
spontaneous opposition march.
	   The violence has been the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh
as co-prime minister in a coup last year. He made progress toward
regaining international legitimacy by holding the elections, but
appears to be losing it at home.
	   The opposition asserts Hun Sen won by massive fraud and have
threatened to boycott the National Assembly when it meets Sept. 24,
denying him the two-thirds majority needed to form a new
government.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Bret Saberhagen pitched six shutout innings and
John Valentin hit a three-run homer as the Boston Red Sox beat the
Detroit Tigers 6-2 Friday night.
	   The Red Sox, who remained five games ahead of Toronto in the AL
wild-card race, had lost six of their previous seven.
	   Saberhagen (13-7) gave up five hits, struck out six and walked
none to win for only the third time in 10 starts. Tom Gordon got
the final out for his AL-leading 40th save.
	   Brian Powell (3-7) gave up six runs _ all unearned _ and six
hits in 5 1-3 innings as Detroit lost for the seventh time in nine
games.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Yankees 4
	   In New York, in a game interrupted by a beanball-induced bench
clearing, Rogers Clemens pitched five innings before leaving with
an apparent bruised right palm and a no-decision.
	   Tony Fernandez hit a two-run homer and Carlos Delgado, Jose Cruz
Jr. and Shannon Stewart each hit solo homers off Hideki Irabu
(11-0) as Toronto won for the 12th time in 14 games.
	   Clemens, who hit Derek Jeter during spring training and again in
a July 17 game, drilled Scott Brosius in the fourth. Irabu then hit
Stewart in the fifth.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre was ejected after the first beanball,
and New York bench coach Don Zimmer was ejected following the
second along with New York reserve infielder Homer Bush, Toronto
manager Tim Johnson and Blue Jays pitcher Bill Risley.
	   Carlos Almanzar (2-2) pitched 1 1-3 innings, and Robert Person
pitched the ninth for his second save.
 &UR; Orioles 8, Angels 3
	   In Baltimore, Scott Erickson (15-11) allowed nine hits in his
AL-best 10th complete game and Eric Davis homered and drove in five
runs. Anaheim remained two games ahead of second-place Texas in the
AL West.
	   Rafael Palmeiro hit his 42nd homer for the Orioles, who have won
three straight for the first time since Aug. 18. Chuck Finley
(11-7) allowed eight runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Devil Rays 3, Rangers 2
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Bobby Smith hit a two-run homer and

hitting streak.
	   Tony Saunders (5-14) allowed three hits in seven innings, and
Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his 25th save.
 &UR; White Sox 3, Indians 2
	   In Cleveland, Jim Abbott (2-0) allowed two runs and five hits in
7 1-3 to win two straight starts for the first time since 1995.
Abbott dropped out of baseball in 1997 after going 2-18 with the
Angels in 1996.
	   The AL Central-leading Indians' magic number to clinch their
fourth straight division title remained six.
	   Jeff Abbott _ no relation _ broke a 2-2 tie with an RBI double
off the left-field wall in the seventh off Charles Nagy (13-10),
who scattered seven hits in his second complete game.
 &UR; Mariners 6, Royals 3
 &UR; Royals 8, Mariners 5
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, (AP) _ Kevin Appier, making his first
appearance since shoulder surgery last March, won the second game
despite allowing four runs and six hits in five innings. Glendon
Rusch pitched the final four innings for his first major league
save.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. went 1-for-8 in the doubleheader, but three
times barely missed his league-leading 51st home run when drives
were barely foul down the line in right.
	   In the opener, Jeff Fassero allowed all three runs and five hits
in eight innings for his first win in nine starts since July 25,
and Mike Timlin finished with a perfect ninth for his 15th save.
	   Brian Barber (2-3) lost the first game and Bill Swift (11-9)
lost the second.
	   Dean Palmer homered in each game, raising his total to 33.
 &UR; Athletics 3, Twins 2
	   In Minneapolis, Kenny Rogers (14-7) pitched a four-hitter for
his sixth complete game. He is just 4-7 on the road but 10-0 at
home.
	   Oakland broke a 2-2 tie in the sixth when Ben Grieve singled and
scored on a double by Eric Chavez and an error by outfielder Otis
Nixon.
	   Bob Tewksbury (7-10) allowed three runs and 10 hits in six
innings.

Braves beat Marlins 8-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ For the first time ever, a team has gone from
World Series champion to 100-game loser.
	   The Florida Marlins, at the top of baseball last October,
plummeted to their 100th defeat Friday night with an 8-2 loss to
the Atlanta Braves, who got a pair of homers and five RBIs from
Gerald Williams.
	   Last year, the Marlins went 92-70, won the NL wild-card berth,
then beat San Francisco and Atlanta in the playoffs and Cleveland
in the World Series.
	   But shorn of all their high-priced stars, traded away during
salary slashing, the Marlins have the worst record in baseball at
48-100. Florida has lost five in a row and 14 of 15, dropping nine
straight on the road.
	   John Smoltz (15-3) became Atlanta's fourth 15-game winner this
season. He allowed both runs and six hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Brewers 13, Cubs 11 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit his 59th homer, but the Chicago Cubs
lost and remained tied for the NL wild-card lead with the New York
Mets.
	   Sosa's fifth-inning shot ended a five-game homer drought and
left him three behind Mark McGwire's record total.
	   Cubs starter Don Wengert (1-4) gave up five runs in 2 1-3
innings, and Terry Adams threw two run-scoring wild pitches in the
sixth.
	   Gary Gaetti hit a two-run homer and Jeff Blauser had an RBI
triple as the Cubs closed to 10-9, but Adams' wild pitches and
Fernando Vina's RBI double put the Brewers ahead 13-9.
 &UR; Expos 5, Mets 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Vladimir Guerrero and Fernando Seguignol hit
consecutive homers in the eighth inning as Montreal beat New York.
	   Montreal starter Carl Pavano (5-8) allowed one run and three
hits in 6 1-3 innings to win for the first time in his last seven
starts. Ugueth Urbina got the last four outs for his 30th save.
	   Guerrero led off the eighth with his 36th homer, tying Henry
Rodriguez's team record for homers in a season set in 1996.
Seguignol followed with his first career homer to give Montreal a
5-1 lead.
	   Bobby Jones (9-8) allowed three runs and five hits in seven
innings as the Mets lost for the first time in his last six
starts.
 &UR; Astros 8, Cardinals 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Mark McGwire went 1-for-4 with a single, remaining
at 62 home runs, as Houston won its seventh straight.
	   A crowd of 52,186, the second-largest crowd in Astrodome
history, saw the Astros win for the 12th time in 14 games.
	   McGwire, who has five homers against Houston this year, is
homerless in nine at-bats since connecting off Chicago's Steve
Trachsel on Tuesday night for No. 62. McGwire grounded out in the
first and fourth innings, struck out in the sixth and singled to
left in the eighth.
 &UR; Pirates 6, Phillies 1 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Chris Peters became the first Pittsburgh
starter to win in over two weeks as the Pirates beat the
Philadelphia Phillies for the first time in seven games this year.
	   Peters (8-9) allowed the one run and five hits in seven innings,
struck out six and walked three. The previous Pittsburgh starter to
win was Sean Lawrence, against Arizona on Aug. 25.
	   Pittsburgh won for only the third time in 14 games. The Phillies
have lost 14 of their last 18.
 &UR; Reds 13, Diamondbacks 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Brook Fordyce and Sean Casey hit three-run homers
to lead Cincinnati over Arizona.
	   The Reds sold only 16,579 tickets for the opener of the weekend
series, a major comedown from the big crowds that came out to watch
Mark McGwire and the Cardinals the previous two nights.
	   The Reds piled up a 10-1 lead after four innings. Damian Jackson
and Dmitri Young each had three hits for Cincinnati.
	   Brett Tomko (12-11) got his first victory since Aug. 16 by
holding the Diamondbacks to four hits over seven innings.

Australian cyclist Sweet wins games' first gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Jay Sweet sprinted
ahead of four rivals over the last 100 meters Saturday and captured
the first gold medal of the 1998 Commonwealth Games, winning the
184-kilometer cycling road race.
	   Cheered on by the home crowd, Malaysian Effandy Rosli finished a
close second, winning his nation's first medal ever in Commonwealth
Games cycling.
	   Canada's Eric Wohlberg was third.
	   Those three, along with Paul Esposti of Wales and David George
of South Africa, opened a lead over the rest of the field in the
11th of the 12 laps, and the lead changed frequently over the last
30 kilometers.
	   Sweet mostly let the others lead before making his sprint over
the last 100 meters in temperatures in the 30s Celsius (90s F). His
winning time was an unofficial 4 hours, 31 minutes, 57 seconds.
	   He leaned over and rubbed his calf muscles for a while before
celebrating his victory.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first medal, Boldon to run in track events &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ England's Sue Rolph stunned
herself with a Commonwealth 100-meter freestyle record Saturday and
Australian cyclist Jay Sweet won the Games' first gold medal with
host Malaysia taking a surprise silver.
	   Rolph, who held the record jointly with compatriot Karen
Pickering at 55.79 seconds, clocked 55.65 in her heat on day one of
the swimming program.
	   ``I nearly had a heart attack when I looked up the board,''
Rolph said. ``I love it when that happens, to go so fast and you're
not expecting it.''
	   The English swimmer said she was confident of going even faster
in Saturday night's final, where her main opposition will come from
Australia's Sarah Ryan (56.57) and Susie O'Neill (56.61).
	   But on the form of the heat, where she defeated O'Neill
head-to-head, Rolph declared, ``there's definitely more to come.''
	   ``I feel brill (brilliant), and I always swim faster at night,''
Rolph said.
	   Pickering also qualified for the night's first final, finishing
second behind Ryan in their heat with 56.91.
	   After a grueling 184-kilometer road race around Kuala Lumpur in
30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat, Sweet made his move barely
100 meters from the finish line.
	   Breaking out of a leading group of five, the Australian pulled
away to beat Malaysia's Effandy Rosli by two cycle lengths and win
in 4 hours 31 minutes 57 seconds.
	   Effandy was mobbed at the finish line after gaining his
country's first ever Commonwealth cycling medal and Canada's Eric
Wohlberg took the bronze.
	   Australian stars Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim, both world
champions at different disciplines, tangled with New Zealand's
Olympic gold medalist Danyon Loader later Saturday in the 200 meter
freestyle final.
	   Thorpe, world champion at 400m, led qualifying and said the
longest-standing men's mark might come under threat later.
	   ``It could take close to a world record to win tonight,'' Thorpe
said after finishing in one minute, 48.51 seconds. Italian Giorgio
Lamberti set the world record of 1:46.69 in 1989.
	   Klim, who is world titlist for 200, was only sixth fastest.
	   Other swimming finals at the National Aquatics Center Saturday
were the men's 100 breaststroke, involving Australian defending
champion Phil Rogers, the women's 400 individual medley and the
women's 4 x 200 freestyle relay.
	   Gymnastics was another sport to start Saturday with the men's
team title being decided in the Putra stadium.
	   Athletics events at the 100,000-capacity National stadium at
Bukat Jalil don't start until Wednesday and there was a boost for
the fans when Trinidad's team manager, Ken Doldron, gave an
assurance that sprint star Ato Boldon would compete.
	   The withdrawal of Canada's world and Olympic titlist Donovan
Bailey and Namibia's sprint star Frankie Fredericks had dismayed
organizers and Boldon, who has run 9.86 this year, had indicated he
might not run either.
	   ``I urge everyone not to worry,'' Doldron told readers of
Malaysia's Daily Star Saturday amid fears that the sprint star
might also skip the Games.
	   ``He will be here to win the 100m gold with a new world record.
He will be in Kuala Lumpur by tomorrow night.''
	   Obadele Thompson of Barbados, who ran 9.87, .03 outside Bailey's
world record while running at altitude at the World Cup meet in
Johannesburg Friday, also is on his way.
	   Some 5,000 athletes from 70 nations are competing here, easily a
record and well up on the 3,200 at the last games in Victoria,
Canada, in 1994.
	   The number of sports has been increased from 10 to 16 with men's
and women's field hockey, squash, tenpin bowling and women's
netball joining rugby and cricket as newcomers.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnians began voting
Saturday in a two-day election considered crucial for the future of
the 1995 peace plan that ended a devastating war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Voters chose between hard-line candidates who promote ethnicity
and more moderate ethnic leaders favored by Western powers for
their commitment to the Dayton peace agreement that halted the 3
1-2-year war.
	   It is the second national election since the Dayton plan set up
two ethnic-based entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat
federation _ with the goal of slowly forcing a democratic evolution
in the one-time communist territory.
	   In Sarajevo, the capital, only one pensioner showed up at a
polling station just after it opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT).
Officials there said they expected few people so early because
voting also takes place on Sunday.

McCord follows the bouncing ball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Gary McCord frequently jokes about his
undistinguished playing career during golf telecasts. He came up
with some new material during the first round of the Comfort
Classic.
	   The CBS announcer, making his second Senior PGA Tour start, had
a 10-over 10 on the par-5 15th hole Friday.
	   ``Both drives landed on the cart path and went through the
chain-link fence,'' said McCord, who was 5 under through 14 holes.
``The third, which was really hard to believe, hit up by the green,
hit a rock wall, and went 70 yards straight left and through
another fence by two inches.
	   ``It was a day of ricochets. I'm fine. I have a job. You can
deal all you want to me. I going to just keep going. Weird stuff
out there. We're talking dark-side-of-the-moon stuff.''
	   He bogeyed on Nos. 17 and 18 for a 2-over 74 that left him 10
strokes behind leader Bruce Summerhays.
	   Summerhays, the State Farm Senior Classic winner in July,
birdied six of the final eight holes.
	   ``It was one of those days that come, well, once in a year,''
Summerhays said. ``When you have greens like these where you have
to place the ball, I like that. It's more of a challenge. You have
to get your putting going.''
	   He had nine birdies and one bogey.
	   ``I think people like to see birdies,'' Summerhays said.
	   Terry Dill, Simon Hobday, George Archer and Bobby Stroble were a
stroke back at 65s. Stroble had two eagles and two birdies on the
back nine to match the course record of 30.
	   Hale Irwin, a six-time winner this year who leads the money list
with dlrs 2,302,350, topped a five-player group at 66. The
three-time U.S. Open champion needs dlrs 41,015 to break the money
record he set last year.
	   ``If you didn't birdie every hole out there, you felt like you
were behind,'' Irwin said after 48 of the 78 players broke par.
	   Hubert Green, also at 66, had a hole-in-one on the 173-yard
seventh hole. He used a 5-iron.
	   Defending champion David Graham shot a 75. The Australian
withdrew from the Emerald Coast Classic last week because a
strained chest muscle.
	   ``I feel terrible,'' Graham said. ``Quite frankly, I shouldn't
be here, and I may leave yet. It's really affecting my game.''

Opposition calls off demonstration after supporters attacked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition calling off Sunday protest, accusing
Hun Sen of ``Pol Pot-style massacre.''
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen staged a major
show of force Saturday, bringing more than 5,000 supporters into
the capital and turning them loose with clubs and chains to beat
outnumbered opposition protesters calling for his ouster.
	   The opposition called off a planned mass rally for Sunday. Mu
Sochua, a senior member of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, said the
risk of clashes and bloodshed was too great and accused Hun Sen of
planning a ``Pol Pot-style massacre.''
	   At least two people were badly beaten Saturday, but there were
no reports of shootings or new killings to add to four confirmed
deaths in six days of street violence. Belief on the streets is
that many more _ including Buddhist monks _ have been slain.
	   The new clashes follow warnings by King Norodom Sihanouk and the
powerful head of the army to pressure opposition leaders to accept
Hun Sen's victory in disputed parliamentary elections and stop
``anarchy'' in the streets.
	   Mu Sochua said the warnings would be rejected as long as the
opposition felt forced to comply.
	   Hun Sen assembled supporters of his Cambodian People's Party
from strongholds in the Phnom Penh region. They rolled through the
capital in convoys of trucks, occasionally joined by truckloads of
troops.
	   Organizers threatened to double the size of the mob Sunday to
crush the opposition's planned rally. Orders were overheard to
bring in more men from the provinces and to offer each 10 kilograms
(24 pounds) of rice.
	   One club-wielding Hun Sen supporter, Prak Sokhan, 43, said: ``We
want to see all demonstrations stopped.''
	   About 3,000 Hun Sen supporters marched from the Independence
Monument to the opposition rallying point near the U.S. Embassy and
the home of Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   They chanted for the arrests of the opposition leaders _
Ranariddh, the king's son, and his ally, Sam Rainsy _ calling them
``traitors.''
	   Riot police and soldiers, who had served as Hun Sen's shock
troops in his crackdown until he shifted to plainclothes mobs
Friday, allowed them to assemble freely. Every man carried a
weapon.
	   About 200 opposition supporters, braving intimidation by elite
police with Kalashnikov rifles and dirt bikes, shouted insults as
pro-Hun Sen crowd came into view, then scattered and threw stones
when they charged. A pedicab driver was badly beaten and ran for
refuge to the U.S. Embassy.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of relatively peaceful protests
against his 13-year rule Monday after grenades were thrown at his
home. He was not there and no one was hurt. He blamed Sam Rainsy,
his most vocal critic, and called for his arrest.
	   Sam Rainsy has sought refuge in the local U.N. offices and
called the charges a ``ridiculous pretext.''
	   About 1,500 Hun Sen supporters went Saturday to the hotel where
the offices are located and presented addressed to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Its contents were not divulged.
	   ``Since the beginning of the situation, we've tried to convey
the message as much as possible from our secretary-general that
problems should be resolved through dialogue,'' U.N. military
observer Jan Wanderstein said.
	   Cambodians have been horrified and outraged by a week of
violence where police have used guns, clubs, rifle butts and water
cannon against demonstrators, including Buddhist monks. Despite
fears of violence, some 6,000 people took part Thursday in a
spontaneous opposition march.
	   The violence has been the worst since Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh
as co-prime minister in a coup last year. He made progress toward
regaining international legitimacy by holding the elections, but
appears to be losing it at home.
	   The opposition asserts Hun Sen won by massive fraud and have
threatened to boycott the National Assembly when it meets Sept. 24,
denying him the two-thirds majority needed to form a new
government.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Investigators trying to piece
together the final moments of Swissair Flight 111 now have two
major clues that could help them: the jet's so-called black boxes.
	   Divers recovered the cockpit voice recorder Friday, 180 feet (55
meters) below the ocean surface. It was found near the spot where
dive teams on Sunday located the flight data recorder, which
measures the jet's mechanical data.
	   Together, the two devices may shed some light on the cause of
the wreck that killed all 229 people aboard.
	   Flight 111, which originated in New York, lost contact with air
traffic controllers six minutes before it crashed into the Atlantic
on Sept. 2.
	   Although investigators already had a transcript of the
conversation between the Swissair pilots and air traffic
controllers, the cockpit voice recorder may have picked up
additional words between the two pilots or irregular noises in the
aircraft.
	   Stored in a box of fresh water to help preserve it, the black
box was sent to Ottawa on Friday for analysis. Its condition was
not immediately known, although the boxes are designed to withstand
a tremendous impact, transportation board officials said.
	   Divers had been searching simultaneously Friday for the box and
for remains of victims of the Geneva-bound MD-11.
	   ``People come first,'' said Stan Ferguson, superintendent of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, just hours before the voice box was
found. ``To overlook the recovery of human remains is not right.''
	   Late Thursday, divers recovered remains of passengers from the
bottom of the ocean. The 22 divers, who can spend just 30 minutes
combing the Atlantic floor at any one time, carried the remains 180
feet to the surface in bags.
	   It was the first time remains had been recovered from the ocean
floor. Until then, body parts had only been found floating on the
surface of the Atlantic or washed up on the shore.
	   Out of respect for the families of the victims, authorities
wouldn't say how many passengers may have been represented among
the recovered remains. Rick Town, commander of the Canadian navy
supply ship Preserver, said even a guess was impossible.
	   So far, only four victims have been identified out of the
remains recovered.
	   On Friday, Swiss police sent Canadian authorities the results of
blood tests taken from family members of flight victims to help
identify remains. The blood tests will help in the construction of
DNA profiles.
	   The police also gathered information about victims' personal
belongings, documents and fingerprints.
	   The USS Grapple, which helped with the undersea recovery of
wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996, began
preparations to lift the mangled jet from the ocean depths _
perhaps early next week.
	   Military spokesmen said the fuselage and other parts will not be
hoisted until the human remains have been retrieved.
	   Memorial services for the victims were held Friday in Geneva,
Zurich, New York and at the United Nations.
	   ``The tragedy of Halifax has just sadly reminded of the
fragility of our life and the absurdity of our frantic
lifestyles,'' Swiss President Flavio Cotti said at the service in
Geneva.
	   A service at the United Nations in New York honored eight U.N.
workers and one former employee who were killed in the crash.
	   ``We share your grief all the more because the deaths of these
nine exceptional people on a flight so familiar to many of us that
we called it the U.N. airbus, come as a deep blow to their other
family, too _ that which we call the United Nations family,''
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told family members.
	   At the end of the one-hour service, Annan presented a folded
blue U.N. flag to each family. One woman kissed her flag and hugged
it tightly as she cried.
	   Also in New York, about 1,000 people solemnly gathered at
Lincoln Center to pay homage to the crash victims.
	   ``We commemorate this day for these persons we loved and lost.
... We recollect the sound of a voice, the touch of a hand, the
uniqueness of a smile,'' said the Very Rev. Harry H. Prichett, Jr.,
of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. ``We're here to share the
pain that pierced the life left behind.''
	   The attendees, some with small children in tow and all clutching
white roses, barely stirred. Occasionally, a handkerchief was
raised to wipe a tear.
	   Representatives of the victims' families and the Swiss
government also spoke at the memorial service.

Satirist dons a dress to take on right-winger in upcoming election

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing Australian lawmaker Pauline
Hanson has a new nemesis _ a male satirist with a penchant for
female attire and a song mocking the controversial pol.
	   University lecturer and humorist Simon Hunt, also known as
``Pauline Pantsdown,'' launched a campaign on Saturday for a seat
in the Oct. 3 national elections at a record store in Sydney's
nightclub district.
	   ``There are too many politicians. If you vote for me I promise
to vote politicians out for you,'' said the candidate, outlining
part of a ten-point plan for the future of Australia.
	   In a bright ginger wig and two-piece women's business suit, Hunt
mocked Hanson, leader of the One Nation party. Hanson has gained
notoriety for saying that Australia is in danger of being ``swamped
by Asians.''
	   Hunt has been nominated to run as an independent in Australia's
Upper House of Parliament, the Senate.
	   Dropping the satire for a brief moment Saturday, Hunt said he
does not expect to win, but hopes to strike an anti-racist,
anti-xenophobic note in the campaign.
	   Hunt penned a spoof song last year making fun of Hanson which
had to be withdrawn after the lawmaker threatened to sue. A new
song has just been issued which he hopes will be less libelous.
	   But what's his policy on makeup?
	   ``As much as possible. Stick your head in a bucket of foundation
each morning; invest in mascara stock.''
	   And advice for Bill Clinton?
	   ``Do it somewhere else. Get a hotel room or something.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Jay Sweet sprinted
ahead of four rivals over the last 100 meters Saturday and captured
the first gold medal of the 1998 Commonwealth Games, winning the
184-kilometer cycling road race.
	   Cheered on by the home crowd, Malaysian Effandy Rosli finished a
close second, winning his nation's first medal ever in Commonwealth
Games cycling.
	   Canada's Eric Wohlberg was third.
	   Those three, along with Paul Esposti of Wales and David George
of South Africa, opened a lead over the rest of the field in the
11th of the 12 laps, and among those five, the lead changed
frequently over the last 30 kilometers.
	   Sweet mostly let the others lead before making his sprint over
the last 100 meters in temperatures in the 30s Celsius (90s F).
	   The top three all were timed in 4 hours, 31 minutes, 56 seconds,
with Sweet two bicycle lengths ahead of Effandy.
	   The 23-year-old Australian leaned over and rubbed his crampled
calf muscles for a while before celebrating his victory.
	   ``This is the first time I've represented Australia at a
Commonweatlh Games or Olympic Games and to win the only event I'm
doing here is just fantastic,'' Sweet said.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnians began voting
Saturday in a two-day election crucial for the 1995 peace plan that
ended the war in the former Yugoslav republic.
	   Voters chose between hard-line candidates who promote ethnicity
and more moderate ethnic leaders favored by Western powers for
their commitment to the Dayton peace agreement that halted the 3
1-2-year war.
	   It is the second national election since the Dayton plan set up
two ethnic-based entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat
federation _ with the goal of slowly forcing a democratic evolution
in the one-time communist territory.
	   In Sarajevo, the capital, only one pensioner showed up at a
polling station just after it opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT).
Officials there said they expected few people so early because
voting also takes place on Sunday. On Saturday, polls close at 1700
GMT and results are not expected until Tuesday.

Hong Kong Stock Exchange has no qualms with government

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top official of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
told legislators on Saturday that the exchange has no objection to
government efforts to keep speculators out of the market.
	   Alec Tsui, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said
the exchange would not oppose measures giving the territory's
leader, Tung Chee-hwa, a free hand to fend off market speculators.
	   Tsui told legislators, however, that he hopes the government
would only resort to such steps under special circumstances.
	   After a two-week buying spree last month to prop up the
benchmark stock index and ward off speculators, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang unveiled a 30-point plan earlier this week which calls
for setting up a body to regulate the markets.
	   The plan recommends empowering the body to expel brokers who
breach Hong Kong's trading regulations.
	   But Laura Cha, acting chairman of the Securities and Futures
Commission, said the commission opposes a government proposal
requiring the futures exchange to disclose large positions on a
daily basis.
	   Hong Kong Futures Exchange Chairman Geoffrey Yeh said its
members were nervous about the proposed disclosure rules, adding
the exchange hopes for more negotiations before any final decisions
are made.
	   The Hong Kong government has come under heavy criticism for
spending an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 billion in
reserves last month to buy stocks. The intervention buoyed the
benchmark stock index up to a level where speculators who had been
short-selling stock futures were stuck with huge losses.

Aid reaches flood-ravaged southern Mexico as residents bury dead

	   VILLA COMALTITLAN, Mexico (AP) _ Aid is trickling in to nearly
half a million people cut off by deadly flooding in southern Mexico
that has swept away whole towns and forced people to bury those
killed in muddy holes.
	   Two settlements near this Pacific coast town were washed away by
the muddy torrents that tore down Chiapas state's coastal plain
after eight days of constant rain, killing more than 100 people in
the state.
	   About 20,000 people had been evacuated in Chiapas, and nearly
500,000 cut off by washed-out roads and downed bridges, Interior
Secretary Francisco Labastida said Friday in Mexico City.
	   As the sun began to bake the muck and residents shoveled mud out
of their homes, people stopped to remember on Friday what the area
looked like before this week's catastrophe.
	   In the town of Escuintla, schoolteacher Edilberto Hernandez, 39,
stood where the coastal highway came to an abrupt end after a river
tore a huge gap through it.
	   He peered over the jagged edge of the roadbed, toward people
standing 200 yards (meters) across the gap torn through the
highway.
	   ``There was a settlement of about 35 houses here,'' he said,
pointing to middle of the river's course. ``It was called Francisco
Pineda. Now it doesn't exist anymore.''
	   In Pijijiapan, one of the worst-hit towns, Guadalupe Saucedo
Vidal sat outside a cemetery waiting to bury the body of her
daughter-in-law.
	   Vultures circled overhead, near an area where deep muck still
choked the remains of houses, some of them with just their roofs
sticking above the mire.
	   Eleven of Saucedo's relatives are missing, including her
husband.
	   Saucedo's home washed away early Wednesday.
	   ``It sounded like a train when the roar came at 1 o'clock.
Everything went under,'' she said.
	   More than a dozen people were reported dead in the states of
Nayarit, Jalisco, Sinaloa, Guanajuato, Guerrero and Oaxaca.
	   With Chiapas' road system broken by surging rivers and
mudslides, the government sent aid into Guatemala to be carried
back north by truck. Army troops and rescue workers began to
deliver the first packages of food and medicine to reach isolated
villages.
	   About 10,000 people have sought refuge in temporary shelters set
up across the state.
	   In Tapachula, the largest city in the region, crews unloaded
boxes of aid from half a dozen military cargo planes. A dozen
helicopters prepared to ferry supplies to affected regions.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo visited Tapachula on Friday and said
he would fly over flooded coastal areas by helicopter Saturday.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City announced Friday that it would
donate dlrs 25,000 in aid to the state of Chiapas.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second national
election since the end of its devastating war began Saturday,
pitting hard-line candidates who promote ethnicity against more
moderate ethnic leaders favored by Western powers.
	   The two-day election is considered crucial for the future of the
1995 Dayton peace plan that halted the 3 1-2 year war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia was divided into two
ethnic-based entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat
federation _ with the goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the
one-time communist territory.
	   But progress has been slow due to the lingering hatreds and
mistrust between the three ethnic groups that fought the war. An
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot return to their
homes in areas controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   Delays occurred at some polling stations throughout the country
because organizers failed to deliver voters' lists in time. Most
opened as scheduled, with few people arriving early because voting
also will take place Sunday.
	   At the bus station in Sarajevo, the capital, Muslims expelled
from their villages by Bosnian Serbs during the war prepared to
travel home to vote.
	   Any other time, hard-line Serb officials prevent refugees from
even visiting, but the threat of severe penalties for such
harassment during an election creates an opening for a quick trip.
	   ``Every year, but only for elections, we get to see our homes,''
said Hilmo Dzaferovic, 60, who was going to Medjedja, now in the
Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Western allies led by the United States and European Union, who
run the country now under the Dayton plan, hope ethnic-driven
political parties that waged the war lose support this weekend and
fade away.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong among Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Croats, and the outcome of major races involving
their candidates were uncertain as campaigning ended Thursday.
	   A total of 83 candidates, parties and coalitions are on the
complicated ballots, with voters only choosing leaders in the
entity in which they registered. More than 2.7 million of Bosnia's
4.3 million people are registered.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   After the vote, Western powers hope to push harder for elected
officials to fully implement Dayton's provisions, such as allowing
refugees to move back to their homes. Hard-line leaders, especially
in the Bosnian Serb republic, oppose that because it will erode
their ethnic-based support.
	   Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, one of the nation's
three-member presidency under the Dayton accord setup, was expected
to easily win re-election to the panel.
	   The races for the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat members of the
presidency looked much tighter, with the results certain to
influence how much further progress is made in adopting the Dayton
requirements.
	   International officials complain the Bosnian Serb member of the
presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, has obstructed efforts to implement
the peace plan and openly oppose his re-election.
	   Because the three-member presidency has often failed to agree on
policy issues, the European overseer of Bosnia _ High
Representative Carlos Westendorp _ has been given what amounts to
absolute power to force decisions on the panel.
	   That has brought measures aimed at moving Bosnia toward
operating as a single nation, something Krajisnik and his fervently
Serbian nationalist party and allies oppose.
	   To them, the Bosnian Serb republic is a separate entity in
Bosnia with stronger ties to Yugoslavia than the Muslim-Croat

PAL union members still must vote on tentative agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Union members of Philippine Airlines
must ratify a tentative accord to save the ailing airline,
including a provision which suspends their collective bargaining
agreement for 10 years, a union official said Saturday.
	   On Friday, PAL chairman and majority owner Lucio Tan agreed to
give 20 percent ownership of the company to its employees as part
of the deal. Under the proposed agreement, employees will also get
three seats on the airline's 15-member board of directors.
	   Each employees will receive 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000
pesos (about dlrs 6,896) from the Tan group's shareholdings in PAL.
However, they will not be allowed to dispose of or sell their
shares until their retirement, the airline said.
	   The accord commits the company to refrain from cuts in salaries
and medical benefits, and retrenched union members who have not
received separation pay will be rehired, the airline said.
	   A majority of the 21 board members of the PAL Employees
Association, which represents ground crew workers, have voted to
accept the proposal.
	   The same offer was made by PAL to the flight attendants' and the
pilots' unions, but there was no immediate response from either
group.
	   Alex Barrientos, president of the ground crew union, said the
agreement would have to be ratified by a majority of his union
members in a vote next week.
	   ``Employees would take the risk of letting PAL survive by
supporting the programs of the company,'' he said in explaining why
union leaders accepted the offer.
	   He said company officials assured them their union would still
be recognized, but he warned Tan not to trick them.
	   The airline said last week it lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51
million) in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning April 1,
mainly because of work stoppages.
	   A 22-day pilots' strike in June caused the heaviest damage,
causing revenue losses of about 200 million pesos (dlrs 4.6
million) a day, PAL said.
	   The airline said its losses also rose because of soaring
dollar-denominated payments and continuing lease payments on unused
planes which have not yet been returned.
	   In the previous fiscal year, the carrier reported a loss of 8.08
billion pesos (dlrs 185 million).
	   PAL is seeking to restructure its debts and has obtained
permission to suspend payments to domestic and international
creditors amounting to dlrs 2.1 billion while it prepares a
rehabilitation plan. The plan includes the disposal of most of the
airline's planes and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   The suspension of the collective bargaining agreement was also a
key condition required by the airline's creditors, PAL said.
	   Barrientos, however, said there was ``no assurance'' that the
airline would survive even if all the unions support the deal.

ATLANTA: seven innings.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Padres 1, Dodgers 0 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In San Diego, Joey Hamilton pitched eight effective innings as
San Diego moved closer to the NL West title.
	   The victory, combined with San Francisco's loss to Colorado,
reduced the Padres' magic number to two.
	   The Padres set club records with their 93rd victory and 51st
home win. It was just the third loss in 10 games for the Dodgers,
who saw their three-game winning streak snapped.
	   Hamilton (13-12) allowed six hits, struck out six and walked
four. Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his major league-leading
48th save, retiring Charles Johnson on a game-ending popup with a
runner on third.
 &UR; Rockies 7, Giants 6 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Darryl Hamilton, traded away by San Francisco
six weeks ago, hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning as the
Colorado Rockies rallied for their season-high sixth straight win.
	   San Francisco remained 2 1/2 games behind New York and Chicago
in the NL wild-card race.
	   The Giants took a 6-4 lead in the sixth on consecutive
run-scoring singles by Jeff Kent and Ellis Burks, acquired from
Colorado on July 31 in exchange for Hamilton and pitchers Jason
Brester and Jim Stoops.
	   Stoops (1-0) picked up his first major league win with an inning
of relief, and Jerry Dipoto pitched the ninth for his 17th save.

Australian cyclist Sweet wins games' first gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another quote from Sweet, comment from Northern
Ireland manager. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Jay Sweet sprinted
ahead of four rivals over the last 100 meters Saturday and captured
the first gold medal of the 1998 Commonwealth Games, winning the
184-kilometer cycling road race.
	   Cheered on by the home crowd, Malaysian Effandy Rosli finished a
close second, winning his nation's first medal ever in Commonwealth
Games cycling.
	   Canada's Eric Wohlberg was third.
	   Those three, along with Paul Esposti of Wales and David George
of South Africa, opened a lead over the rest of the field in the
11th of the 12 laps, and among those five, the lead changed
frequently over the last 30 kilometers.
	   Sweet mostly let the others lead before making his sprint over
the last 100 meters in temperatures in the 30s Celsius (90s F). He
made the break despite suffering cramps.
	   ``I was cramping really bad, I think it was just the
dehydration,'' Sweet said. ``After the line I had to stop and I
could barely walk.''
	   The top three all were timed in 4 hours, 31 minutes, 56 seconds,
with Sweet two bicycle lengths ahead of Effandy.
	   The 23-year-old Australian leaned over and rubbed his cramped
calf muscles for a while before celebrating his victory.
	   ``This is the first time I've represented Australia at a
Commonweatlh Games or Olympic Games and to win the only event I'm
doing here is just fantastic,'' Sweet said.
	   Many riders said the humidity made the race one of the toughest
they had experienced.
	   ``The climate is totally alien to us. It's a grueling event,''
said Alastair Irvine, manager of the cycling team from Northern
Ireland. His best rider, Connor Henry, came in 12th.

Swissair to Geneva: Few flights could seem safer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Swissair Flight 111, bound from New York to
Geneva, crashed on the evening of Sept. 2 a few miles (kilometers)
off the Nova Scotia shore, killing all 229 people on board. This is
a reconstruction of that night, based on accounts from Swissair
staff, air traffic controllers, victims' relatives and others
involved in the aftermath of the disaster.
	   ___
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Pierce J. Gerety Jr. had flirted
with danger many times, but this was meant to be a peaceful day.
	   The Yale- and Harvard-educated relief expert was finishing up a
three-week vacation with family and friends, spent partly in Maine.
He was sharing the last day in Brooklyn with his wife before
returning to his job as director of a huge U.N. refugee operation
in Central Africa.
	   Gerety's wife, Marie de La Soudier, refused to detail their last
moments together. ``They are very private family things,'' she
said. ``All I can say is that it was a good last day.''
	   She did say that before most of his trips, they would
``prepare'' each other because of the danger of his work. There was
no such preparation this time; it seemed unnecessary for a flight
to Geneva.
	   ___
	   The 215 passengers converged on the evening of Sept. 2 at the
Delta terminal at New York's Kennedy airport, where Swissair
operates. It is a huge circular structure, formerly the Pan Am
terminal. Down a long hallway, there are gates for several
international carriers. The Swissair gates are the first in line.
	   ___
	   Out on the tarmac, the two seasoned pilots of Swissair Flight
111 were preparing to fly one of the world's most reliable jetliner
models, the wide-bodied MD-11, for one of the world's safest
airlines.
	   The captain, Urs Zimmermann, was about to celebrate his 50th
birthday. Married, with three children, he was one of Swissair's
most experienced pilots and a popular instructor for younger
pilots. He starred in a Swissair film, ``Taking Off,'' about the
dream job of a Swissair pilot.
	   Stephan Loew, the co-pilot, also had three children, the
youngest an infant, and also was rated as an instructor for the
MD-11.
	   The MD-11 has one of the lowest rates of fatal accidents of any
airliner in the world, although some technical problems have
surfaced over the years. Swissair says its MD-11s have been
dependable, but plans to replace them with Airbus A-340s in 2002.
	   The plane piloted by Zimmermann joined the Swissair fleet in
1991 and underwent a major overhaul two years ago. Named the Vaud,
after a Swiss canton, it passed its most recent one-day exam on
Aug. 10.
	   ___
	   Flight 111 was a mainstay for U.N. officials like Gerety who
often commuted between U.N. headquarters in New York and their
Geneva-based agencies. They sometimes referred to the flight as the
``U.N. shuttle.'' It was so vital to the expatriate community in
Geneva that World Radio Geneva, an English-language station, made
its arrival time a regular feature of its morning drive-time
program. The plane was scheduled to arrive daily at 9:30 a.m. local
time (3:30 a.m. EDT), but could be a half hour early if tailwinds
were brisk.
	   ___
	   The jetliner took off from Kennedy at 8:18 p.m. EDT that
Wednesday, rumbling down Kennedy's longest runway, 13-Right.
Constantly monitored by air traffic controllers, it headed out over
Long Island Sound, then turned east to fly over the vacation island
of Nantucket.
	   Passengers _ including an array of distinguished doctors,
business executives and U.N. officials, even a Saudi prince _ would
have been relaxing after the plane reached cruising altitude,
perhaps donning slippers in business and first class while sampling
hors d'oeuvres. Dinner in economy class would have been well under
way as the plane crossed into Canadian airspace at what navigators
call BRADD, a point over the Atlantic about 160 miles (260
kilometers) east of Kennebunkport, Maine.
	   In first and business class, passengers could select individual
videos to watch in their seats. September's choices included
``Night Watch,'' ``City of Angels,'' ``As Good As It Gets'' and
``Titanic.''
	   There were 12 flight attendants caring for the passengers,
including Jeannine Pompili, 42. She was on call that week and put
on Flight 111 as a late replacement.
	   Pompili had visited the Nova Scotia fishing village of Peggy's
Cove last year on vacation and came back bubbling with enthusiasm
about the rocky coast.
	   A woman in love with her job, she once told her mother, ``Mum,
if anything ever happens to me on a flight, you can tell people
that I died very happily.''
	   ___
	   It was a routine evening _ which means intensely busy _ at the
air traffic control center in Moncton, New Brunswick. About 30
controllers were on the job, in a windowless room the size of
gymnasium where each night they help guide about 500 planes
eastward over the North Atlantic.
	   At 9:58 p.m. Atlantic time (8:58 p.m. EDT), the Swissair MD-11
crossed into Canadian airspace with a casual greeting.
	   ``Moncton Center, Swissair Flight 111 heavy (jargon for a
wide-bodied jet), good evening,'' the cockpit reported.
	   The flight appeared as a bright green hexagon on a large round
screen showing the coast of Nova Scotia. The airplane's name,
SWR111, and its altitude appeared near the icon.
	   The controller told the crew of the jumbo jet there was mild
turbulence ahead. Nothing else was discussed with air traffic
control for 16 minutes.
	   Then, at 10:14 p.m. a frightening call from the cockpit:
``Swissair 111 is declaring a Pan, Pan, Pan. We have smoke in the
cockpit, request immediate return to a convenient place, I guess,
uh, Boston.''
	   When the plane dropped off the radar screen minutes later,
controllers gathered together. Supervisors called on a
psychologist, and some controllers were consoled by their
colleagues.
	   There were tears. The men and women responsible for keeping the
plane on track were the first to cry for Flight 111.
	   ___
	   It may never be known exactly what confronted Zimmermann and
Loew in their high-tech cockpit. But their final, 10-minute
conversation with controllers gives many hints of a sudden crisis
that grew more desperate by the second.
	   Following the ``Pan, Pan, Pan'' declaration _ a distress call
just below ``Mayday'' in urgency _ the jet began a wide turn toward
Boston for an emergency landing. The Moncton controllers suggested
the alternative of Halifax airport _ 70 nautical miles (110
kilometers) away compared to 300 (480) to Boston.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second national
election since the end of its war began Saturday, pitting hard-line
candidates who stress ethnicity against more moderate leaders
favored by Western powers.
	   The two-day election is crucial for the future of the 1995
Dayton peace plan that halted the 3 1/2 year war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Under the plan, Bosnia was divided into two ethnic-based
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the
goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the one-time communist
territory.
	   But progress has been slow due to the lingering hatreds and
mistrust between the three ethnic groups. An estimated 1 million
displaced people still cannot return to their homes in areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   Delays occurred at some polling stations because organizers
failed to deliver voters' lists in time. Most opened as scheduled,
with few people arriving early because voting also will take place
Sunday.
	   At the bus station in Sarajevo, the capital, Muslims expelled
from their villages by Bosnian Serbs during the war prepared to
travel home to vote.
	   Any other time, hard-line Serb officials prevent refugees from
even visiting, but the threat of severe penalties for such
harassment during an election allows for a quick trip.
	   ``Every year, but only for elections, we get to see our homes,''
said Hilmo Dzaferovic, 60, who was going to Medjedja, now in the
Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Western allies led by the United States and European Union, who
run the country under the Dayton plan, hope ethnic-driven parties
that waged the war lose support this weekend and fade away.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong among Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Croats, and the outcome of major races involving
their candidates were uncertain as campaigning ended Thursday.
	   A total of 83 candidates, parties and coalitions are on the
complicated ballots, with voters only choosing leaders in the
entity in which they registered. More than 2.7 million of Bosnia's
4.3 million people are registered.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   After the vote, Western powers hope to push harder for elected
officials to fully implement Dayton's provisions, such as allowing
refugees to move back to their homes. Hard-line leaders, especially
in the Bosnian Serb republic, oppose that because it will erode
their ethnic-based support.
	   Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, one of the nation's
three-member presidency under the Dayton accord setup, was expected
to easily win re-election to the panel.
	   The races for the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat members of the
presidency looked much tighter, with results certain to influence
how much progress is made in adopting Dayton requirements.
	   Voters also will choose a national parliament, separate
parliaments in each entity, cantonal or district officials and a
president for the Bosnian Serb republic.

Swissair to Geneva: Few flights could seem safer

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Swissair Flight 111, bound from New York to
Geneva, crashed on the evening of Sept. 2 a few miles (kilometers)
off the Nova Scotia shore, killing all 229 people on board. This is
a reconstruction of that night, based on accounts from Swissair
staff, air traffic controllers, victims' relatives and others
involved in the aftermath of the disaster.
	   ___
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Pierce J. Gerety Jr. had flirted
with danger many times, but this was meant to be a peaceful day.
	   The Yale- and Harvard-educated relief expert was finishing up a
three-week vacation with family and friends, spent partly in Maine.
He was sharing the last day in Brooklyn with his wife before
returning to his job as director of a huge U.N. refugee operation
in Central Africa.
	   Gerety's wife, Marie de La Soudier, refused to detail their last
moments together. ``They are very private family things,'' she
said. ``All I can say is that it was a good last day.''
	   She did say that before most of his trips, they would
``prepare'' each other because of the danger of his work. There was
no such preparation this time; it seemed unnecessary for a flight
to Geneva.
	   ___
	   The 215 passengers converged on the evening of Sept. 2 at the
Delta terminal at New York's Kennedy airport, where Swissair
operates. It is a huge circular structure, formerly the Pan Am
terminal. Down a long hallway, there are gates for several
international carriers. The Swissair gates are the first in line.
	   ___
	   Out on the tarmac, the two seasoned pilots of Swissair Flight
111 were preparing to fly one of the world's most reliable jetliner
models, the wide-bodied MD-11, for one of the world's safest
airlines.
	   The captain, Urs Zimmermann, was about to celebrate his 50th
birthday. Married, with three children, he was one of Swissair's
most experienced pilots and a popular instructor for younger
pilots. He starred in a Swissair film, ``Taking Off,'' about the
dream job of a Swissair pilot.
	   Stephan Loew, the co-pilot, also had three children, the
youngest an infant, and also was rated as an instructor for the
MD-11.
	   The MD-11 has one of the lowest rates of fatal accidents of any
airliner in the world, although some technical problems have
surfaced over the years. Swissair says its MD-11s have been
dependable, but plans to replace them with Airbus A-340s in 2002.
	   The plane piloted by Zimmermann joined the Swissair fleet in
1991 and underwent a major overhaul two years ago. Named the Vaud,
after a Swiss canton, it passed its most recent one-day exam on
Aug. 10.
	   ___
	   Flight 111 was a mainstay for U.N. officials like Gerety who
often commuted between U.N. headquarters in New York and their
Geneva-based agencies. They sometimes referred to the flight as the
``U.N. shuttle.'' It was so vital to the expatriate community in
Geneva that World Radio Geneva, an English-language station, made
its arrival time a regular feature of its morning drive-time
program. The plane was scheduled to arrive daily at 9:30 a.m. local
time (3:30 a.m. EDT), but could be a half hour early if tailwinds
were brisk.
	   ___
	   The jetliner took off from Kennedy at 8:18 p.m. EDT that
Wednesday, rumbling down Kennedy's longest runway, 13-Right.
Constantly monitored by air traffic controllers, it headed out over
Long Island Sound, then turned east to fly over the vacation island
of Nantucket.
	   Passengers _ including an array of distinguished doctors,
business executives and U.N. officials, even a Saudi prince _ would
have been relaxing after the plane reached cruising altitude,
perhaps donning slippers in business and first class while sampling
hors d'oeuvres. Dinner in economy class would have been well under
way as the plane crossed into Canadian airspace at what navigators
call BRADD, a point over the Atlantic about 160 miles (260
kilometers) east of Kennebunkport, Maine.
	   In first and business class, passengers could select individual
videos to watch in their seats. September's choices included
``Night Watch,'' ``City of Angels,'' ``As Good As It Gets'' and
``Titanic.''
	   There were 12 flight attendants caring for the passengers,
including Jeannine Pompili, 42. She was on call that week and put
on Flight 111 as a late replacement.
	   Pompili had visited the Nova Scotia fishing village of Peggy's
Cove last year on vacation and came back bubbling with enthusiasm
about the rocky coast.
	   A woman in love with her job, she once told her mother, ``Mum,
if anything ever happens to me on a flight, you can tell people
that I died very happily.''
	   ___
	   It was a routine evening _ which means intensely busy _ at the
air traffic control center in Moncton, New Brunswick. About 30
controllers were on the job, in a windowless room the size of
gymnasium where each night they help guide about 500 planes
eastward over the North Atlantic.
	   At 9:58 p.m. Atlantic time (8:58 p.m. EDT), the Swissair MD-11
crossed into Canadian airspace with a casual greeting.
	   ``Moncton Center, Swissair Flight 111 heavy (jargon for a
wide-bodied jet), good evening,'' the cockpit reported.
	   The flight appeared as a bright green hexagon on a large round
screen showing the coast of Nova Scotia. The airplane's name,
SWR111, and its altitude appeared near the icon.
	   The controller told the crew of the jumbo jet there was mild
turbulence ahead. Nothing else was discussed with air traffic
control for 16 minutes.
	   Then, at 10:14 p.m. a frightening call from the cockpit:
``Swissair 111 is declaring a Pan, Pan, Pan. We have smoke in the
cockpit, request immediate return to a convenient place, I guess,
uh, Boston.''
	   When the plane dropped off the radar screen minutes later,
controllers gathered together. Supervisors called on a
psychologist, and some controllers were consoled by their
colleagues.
	   There were tears. The men and women responsible for keeping the
plane on track were the first to cry for Flight 111.
	   ___
	   It may never be known exactly what confronted Zimmermann and
Loew in their high-tech cockpit. But their final, 10-minute
conversation with controllers gives many hints of a sudden crisis
that grew more desperate by the second.
	   Following the ``Pan, Pan, Pan'' declaration _ a distress call
just below ``Mayday'' in urgency _ the jet began a wide turn toward
Boston for an emergency landing. The Moncton controllers suggested
the alternative of Halifax airport _ 70 nautical miles (110
kilometers) away compared to 300 (480) to Boston.

Detectives foil Tamil rebel plot to kill defense minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Detectives from the anti-terrorism
Special Investigation Unit arrested a would-be Tamil suicide
bomber, foiling a rebel plot to assassinate Sri Lanka's defense
minister, police said Saturday.
	   Sathasivam Thirukeshwaran, 18, was assigned to kill General
Anuruddha Ratwatte, who is leading the military's campaign to
defeat rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The group is
fighting for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority.
	   Thirukeshwaran, a student, was arrested in the temple town of
Kandy, 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of Colombo Friday, said a
police official in Kandy, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ratwatte, 60, is also from Kandy.
	   In Colombo, the military's top spokesman Brigadier Sunil
Tennekoon said he could not give details as it may hamper
investigation.
	   Thirukeshwaran was arrested the same day Tamil rebels bombed the
City Hall in their former stronghold of Jaffna, killing the
moderate Tamil mayor and at least 11 others.
	   Friday's bombing set back efforts to pacify a region scarred by
Sri Lanka's 15-year civil war. The rebels say that the country's
3.3 million Tamils can prosper only in a sovereign area, away from
the domination of the majority Sinhalese who are 76 percent of Sri
Lanka's 18.5 million people.
	   The government says it is willing to grant limited autonomy
Tamil majority areas, but no independent state.
	   At least 25 people were wounded in Friday's blast in Jaffna
which destroyed much of the mayor's office, flinging sections of
the roof up to 300 feet (yards) away.
	   No arrests have been made, but detectives were piecing together
evidence and information on how rebels concealed two Claymore mines
in the roof of the well-guarded City Hall.
	   Military officials did not give any details about the
investigations but said Jaffna was back to normal Saturday.
	   In Colombo, President Chandrika Kumaratunga warned moderate
Tamils of the LTTE's designs.
	   ``What else have the (Tamil) Tigers done except betraying the
Tamil people by exploding bombs at a time when the government is
doing everything possible to develop Jaffna and create a peaceful
environment for its citizens...,'' Mrs. Kumaratunga said in a
statement.
	   ``All those who value peace and humanity reject the acts of
terror perpetrated by the LTTE which is facing desperate situation
(at the war front) in the face of defeat,'' she said.

Asians shocked and worried by report detailing Clinton affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO _ Asians reacted with shock and dismay following the
release of the report detailing President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, expressing worry the political
crisis in Washington comes at a time when the world needs strong
American leadership.
	   Clinton's trouble pushed local stories off the front pages of
papers from Sydney to Singapore. Japan's largest circulation daily,
the Yomiuri newspaper, devoted more than half of each its first
three pages to the White House scandal.
	   All across Asia, people worried that the crisis would leave the
United States without an effective leader.
	   An editorial in the The Sydney Morning Herald said the scandal
``couldn't come at a worse time.''
	   Citing a ``wobbly global financial system,'' and troubles in
Russia and North Korea, the paper lamented that ``when strong
(U.S.) leadership is needed, political paralysis may be the only
thing on offer.''
	   In Thailand and Singapore, newspaper and television reports left
out the more sexually graphic details included in U.S. Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on his eight-month investigation of
Clinton.
	   Papers in South Korea, though, summarized sections of the report
including when and where sexual encounters took place, and what
parts of Lewinsky's body Clinton touched.
	   ``What an embarrassment! The Americans should have handled this
more quietly,'' said Park Min-ja, a 55-year-old housewife in Seoul.
``How is he going to stand before children?''
	   Closer to the United States, the reaction was similar.
	   Mexico's Televisa television network called the Starr report
``500 pages of shameful details.'' Commenting on the report on
Televisa's nightly news program, the anchor asked ``What has become
of the pride, the dignity of the most powerful nation on earth?''
	   Across Asia, papers and people focused on Clinton's possible
removal from office and some even called for him to step down.
	   ``The US is the only hope for leadership, for action. And it
cannot take its proper role with Clinton at the helm,'' read an
editorial in the Bangkok Post. ``The president must resign,'' it
said.
	   Hong Kong newspapers were more forgiving.
	   The South China Morning Post _ which had Clinton stories on its
first three pages _ said in a commentary that ``public revelation
of some of the graphic details of the dalliances in the Oval Office
study might be so embarrassing as to be punishment in itself.''
	   In Japan, too, where the economy is in the midst of its worst
recession in decades, some said Americans should count their
blessings.
	   ``It was not a good thing, but as long as the economy is in good
shape doesn't matter,'' said Masato Fujita, 30, a manager at a
maintenance company.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he regards Clinton as a
``very close friend and ally,'' and his office stated Blair still
intends to meet with the U.S. leader later this month during a trip
to the United Nations headquarters in New York.
	   But British newspapers were less supportive in their Saturday
editions, which devoted numerous pages to the Starr report.
	   ``Clinton's Sex Files,'' screamed The Mirror, a tabloid, in a
front-page headline. The Express, another tabloid, ran an inside
story about Hillary Clinton under the headline: ``I'm with you all
the way...you vile creep.''
	   A Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, The Sun, declared in an
editorial that Clinton was ``unfit to be president'' and ``must
go.''

Primakov gets down to work as Russia's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov got down to work
Saturday in one of the world's toughest and most thankless jobs,
searching for solutions to the nation's worst economic crisis since
the Soviet collapse.
	   Primakov sailed through his parliamentary confirmation on
Friday, offering what one Moscow daily called something for
everyone.
	   ``In the space of a few minutes, he managed to say what people
on the left, on the right, patriots and pro-Westerners wanted to
hear,'' the Nezavisimaya Gazeta commented Saturday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin chose the 68-year-old, former foreign
minister and intelligence chief as a compromise candidate after his
previous pick, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was rejected twice by the
Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament.
	   Primakov told lawmakers he had no ready answers to the country's
chronic economic problems, but he did sketch the broad outlines of
his approach to solving the crisis: continued reform with more
state control, increased involvement of Russia's powerful regional
leaders, improving the government's own discipline, and using the
financial system to boost Russian industry as well as fill the
state's coffers.
	   He stressed that the crisis demanded unity among parties and
among Russia's disparate regions, and that his government would
draw on the expertise of many different political groups.
	   Primakov likened his proposed approach to emergency measures
taken by the U.S. government during the Great Depression of the
1930s.
	   ``So what must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had up
till now? Or use the experience of other countries?'' he asked.
	   Russian policy makers have proposed at least three economic
programs for the new government.
	   Acting deputy prime minister and tax chief Boris Fyodorov favors
tying the Russian ruble to a stable currency like the U.S. dollar
or the Euro, accelerating bankruptcy procedures and lowering the
burden on tax payers. Chernomyrdin had presented this plan to the
Duma before being voted down.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, the Communist who has already been named to the
new government, backs a policy based on strong support for
industry. According to the pro-reform Izvestiya daily, his plan
calls for massive printing of money, large budget expenditures and
a significant state budget.
	   The third plan was advanced by the former secretary of the
Russian Security Council, Andrei Kokoshin, and Dmitry Vasilyev,
chairman of the market watchdog Federal Securities Commission. It
would reverse the previous government's decision to suspend
domestic and foreign debt payments.
	   ``These measures, of course, could restore the confidence of
domestic and foreign investors ... in Russian state bonds. But
there is a no less serious problem: restoring the very capacity of
the state to pay its debts,'' Izvestiya commented.
	   Primakov, 68, is seen as a technocrat, non-ideological and loyal
to Yeltsin. As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for
his efforts to restore some of Russia's diminished international
clout and create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance
U.S. dominance.
	   ``Our foreign policy should be democratic and predictable,
defend our national interests and at the same time steer clear from
confrontation with other nations,'' Primakov told the Duma. ``We
don't need confrontation, a return to the Cold War.''

Floods ease in parts of Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Floods that have submerged this delta
nation for more than two months eased in the hardest-hit northern
region on Saturday, giving a sliver of hope to millions of
displaced people anxious to return home.
	   According to the Flood Forecast and Warning Center, large rivers
that submerged much of Bangladesh - the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and
the Jamuna - have begun receding.
	   ``The fall in the water levels in the major rivers has started
improving the flood situation in 13 northern and northwestern
districts,'' the center reported.
	   But waters remained high in large parts of the capital, Dhaka,
and other districts in the center and south. Already 900 people
have died from the deluge which has displaced more than a quarter
of the country's 124 million people since July 10.
	   The center predicted a fast recession of water, draining out
from the north to the south into the Bay of Bengal, provided there
are no fresh rains.
	   On the Islamic sabbath Friday, Bangladesh offered prayers for an
end to their miseries.
	   ``Let us trust that Allah will help us to overcome this
disaster,'' Moulana Obaidul Huq, chief preacher at Dhaka's main
Baitul Mukurram mosque told a congregation.
	   People chanted prayers from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   Though the Baitul Mukurram mosque is dry, floods have submerged
or damaged thousands of mosques across the country, half of which
has been under water for two months. Many worshippers knelt in
prayers on rooftops of submerged mosques and on boats.
	   In past four days, rescue workers have concentrated on saving a
32 kilometer (22 mile) long embankment that was threatened by the
overflowing Buriganga river, a tributary of the Ganges.
	   Officials have estimated the food loss caused by the floods at
2.3 million tons. But the deficit could reach 4 million tons,
economists said.
	   A U.S. plane carrying dry food, water purification tablets and
medicines is due to reach Dhaka late Saturday. The U.S. has also
committed 400,000 tons of wheat in flood aid.
	   Bangladesh has asked for dlrs 889 million in foreign aid and has
so far received pledges totaling dlrs 172 million.
	   The government said it has a stock of 700,000 tons of rice and
another 1.3 million tons are in the pipeline from foreign aid and
commercial imports.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second national
election since the end of its devastating war began Saturday,
pitting hard-line candidates who promote ethnicity against more
moderate ethnic leaders favored by Western powers.
	   The two-day election is considered crucial for the future of the
1995 Dayton peace plan that halted the 3 1-2 year war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia was divided into two
ethnic-based entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat
federation _ with the goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the
one-time communist territory.
	   But progress has been slow due to the lingering hatreds and
mistrust between the three ethnic groups that fought the war. An
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot return to their
homes in areas controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   A computer problem prevented voters' lists from arriving at 107
of the 2,627 polling stations, said Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for
the Organization of Cooperation and Security in Europe, which is
running the vote.
	   She said the OSCE would send the lists by e-mail to stations
that could receive them that way, and that helicopters from the
NATO-led military force stationed in Bosnia would deliver the
others. Any polling stations that opened late would remain open
past the scheduled 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) closing time Saturday, Szulc
said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Canterbury came back from a 16-0
deficit late in the first half Saturday to beat Newcastle 28-16 in
extra time and advance to the National Rugby League semifinals.
	   Newcastle was eliminated while Canterbury plays Parramatta next
weekend for the right to advance to the Sept. 27 grand final.
Brisbane plays Melbourne in a match Sunday, with the winner
advancing to the semifinals next weekend against Sydney City.
	   Ahead 16-0 just five minutes before halftime, the Knights'
walking wounded again ran out of steam to drop out of the
premiership race in coach Malcolm Reilly's farewell match before
returning to England.
	   Canterbury captain Darren Britt sealed the win with a
93rd-minute try and fullback Rod Silva scored four minutes later
after the teams were tied 16-16 at fulltime. (djp)

Despite heat and cramps, Australian cyclist Sweet wins gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian cyclist Jay Sweet shook
off leg cramps, tropical heat and a tenacious Malaysian challenger
to capture the Commonwealth Games gold Saturday in the
184-kilometer road race.
	   After trading the lead with four other riders in the last lap,
Sweet grinned and raised his arms in weary triumph as he hit the
finish line, just ahead of home favorite Effandy Rosli. Canada's
Eric Wohlberg took the bronze.
	   All three finished in 4 hours, 31 minutes, 56 seconds in the
first gold medal race of the games, which opened Friday. David
George of South Africa and Paul Esposti of Wales were fourth and
fifth.
	   In the final lap, the 23-year-old Sweet signaled to Australian
teammate Stuart O'Grady that he was in trouble, although he managed
to sprint from behind in the last 100 meters.
	   ``I was cramping really bad, I think it was just the
dehydration,'' he said. ``Every time I put pressure on the pedals
up on the hills, my legs were just locking up. ... After the line,
I had to stop and I could barely walk.''
	   Defying expectations that he would bow out, outsider Effandy
trailed the four leaders before sprinting for the silver. Ecstatic
Malaysian fans mobbed his bike, briefly giving the impression that
he was the gold medalist, not Sweet.
	   Malaysia is hardly a cycling powerhouse, but it has invested
more money in sports over the last few years in the hopes of a
healthy medal count at these Commonwealth Games, the first held in
Asia. That effort paid off in the 12-lap road race, which meandered
past a technology institute, upscale homes and low-cost housing
projects.
	   Many riders said the heat made the race one of the toughest they
had experienced. Temperatures were in the 30s Celsius (90s F), with
90 percent humidity.
	   Over the last few months, some Northern Irish cyclists tried to
adapt by competing in summer events in Belgium and Spain and
training in temperature-controlled chambers where their bikes were
mounted on sets of rollers.
	   Their best rider, Connor Henry, sprinted toward the leaders in
the last lap, but in vain. He came in 12th in 4:32:19.
	   ``The climate is totally alien to us. It's a grueling event,''
said Alastair Irvine, team manager of Northern Ireland. ``That's
the nature of cycling. It's an endurance event. This makes it even
harder.''

Troops still deployed in Indonesian capital after days of protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Some lounging under trees, their
automatic weapons stacked in neat piles, hundreds of troops
remained deployed in the Indonesian capital Saturday following days
of rowdy protests against the president.
	   With heavy security in place, central Jakarta was quiet.
	   Dozens of troops were stationed at the state palace complex,
which houses the offices of President B.J. Habibie and other senior
government officials. Squads of soldiers were also stationed in
adjacent Merdeka (Freedom) Square.
	   Their deployment follows a series of demonstrations against
Habibie as the nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30
years. Student activists are demanding Habibie lower soaring food
prices or resign.
	   Similar protests against Habibie's autocratic predecessor
President Suharto took place before riots erupted in May.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in power and quit after about 1,200
people died in the violence.
	   On Friday, armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto restated his
loyalty to Habibie by warning that his troops would take ``stern
action'' against disruptive protests.
	   He said the military would not allow the interests of 202
million Indonesians or the economy's chances of recovery to be
endangered.
	   Wiranto said he had been told that some protesters have been
paid by unidentified groups to demonstrate against the government.
	   Acknowledging growing anger over soaring inflation, the
government Friday announced new measures to bring down the price of
rice and to help feed millions of poor families.
	   The rice price has trebled over the past year, drawing
discontent with Habibie's crisis-bound presidency. Looting and
riots have hit several areas in recent weeks.
	   On Monday, students marched on Parliament and tore down the
gates of the Parliament.
	   Troops and police used sticks, shields and tear gas to evict
them from its grounds the next day.
	   On Wednesday, a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 students and opposition
supporters protested and clashed with security forces.
	   The following day, about 700 students staged a noisy rally
outside of the palace in Jakarta after they were blocked by troops
and police.

Chinese deputy mayor convicted of trying to have boss killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES reference to crackdown; new to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A hitman stalking the mayor posed as an
investor to meet him. Offering 500,000 yuan (dlrs 60,500) for the
murder was the mayor's own deputy.
	   But police got wind of the plot in the southern Chinese city of
Yangchun and tricked the killers into betraying themselves by
falsely announcing Mayor Zeng Mou was dead, a Chinese newspaper
says.
	   Yang Qizhou, dismissed Sept. 3 as Zeng's deputy, was sentenced
this week to 16 years in prison for plotting against his boss and
taking bribes, the Xinmin Evening News reported Friday.
	   The tale of graft and attempted murder adds another sordid
chapter to a nationwide crackdown on rampant official corruption,
which has outraged the public and undermined acceptance of
communist rule.
	   Abuses are worst in the south, where Yangchun is located in
Guangdong province west of Hong Kong. Central state controls are
weak there, and an influx of foreign investment has increased
chances for graft and extortion.
	   Convicted with Yang were Lin Qiju, former deputy manager of the
Yangchun city trade office, a Canadian citizen named Tan Guozheng
and another man, the Xinmin Evening News said. Ms. Lin was
sentenced to seven years, Tan to four years and the other man to
three years. The report did not give Tan's hometown in Canada.
	   In a report last week, the newspaper said Yang and Ms. Lin paid
Tan and the second man a 100,000 yuan (dlrs 12,000) deposit and
promised five times that much if they succeeded.
	   The motive was to cover up corruption, the report said, but it
did not give any details of the corruption that they hoped to hide.
	   Tan posed as a potential investor in the city in order to meet
the mayor and learn his address and daily routine, it said.
	   The killers were preparing to act in late March when two people
arrested in an unrelated case told police they had heard of the
plot, Xinmin said. Police stepped up security around Zeng and
announced he had been killed.
	   When Ms. Lin, ``wild with joy,'' arranged to meet the killers to
hand over the money, police moved in and arrested the group, the
newspaper said.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second national
election since the end of its war began Saturday, pitting hard-line
candidates who stress ethnicity against more moderate leaders
favored by Western powers.
	   The two-day election is crucial for the future of the 1995
Dayton peace plan that halted the 3 1/2 year war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Under the plan, Bosnia was divided into two ethnic-based
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the
goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the one-time communist
territory.
	   But progress has been slow due to the lingering hatreds and
mistrust between the three ethnic groups. An estimated 1 million
displaced people still cannot return to their homes in areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   A computer problem prevented voters' lists from arriving at 107
of the 2,627 polling stations, said Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for
the Organization of Cooperation and Security in Europe, which is
running the vote.
	   She said the OSCE would send the lists by e-mail to stations

Thai grassroots groups petition for removal of health minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Grassroots organizations around
Thailand have launched a drive to collect 50,000 signatures on a
petition to oust the public health minister and his top aides over
a corruption scandal.
	   Scores of social and political organizations were out on the
streets and at college campuses Saturday gathering signatures from
eligible voters.
	   Under a new constitution enacted last year, the Senate can expel
a politician suspected of wrongdoing if it receives a petition from
voters with 50,000 signatures.
	   The petition drive marks the first time the Thai public is
attempting to exercise that clause in the new Constitution.
	   The call for the ouster of Public Health Minister Rakkiat
Sukthana and his top officials came after a scandal broke over
corrupt purchasing in hospitals.
	   A number of rural doctors complained that hospitals were being
forced by some ministry officials to buy medical supplies from
handpicked companies at several times the market price.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has appointed a committee of
independent outsiders to look into the charges and issue a report,
but the grassroots organizations are demanding stronger action,
saying the committee has no legal power.
	   Academics and students at the Khon Kaen University, 390
kilometers (242 miles) northeast of Bangkok, sent Chuan an open
letter demanding that the government provide protection for health
officials who come forward with information about any corruption.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul urged the people to put
off signing the petition until the committee completed its
investigation.
	   Yongyos Thammavut, president of the Rural Doctors Society, the
organization that made the allegations, said he is ready to resign
from the civil service if the fight to end corruption in the health
ministry does not change things for the better.
	   Members of the Law Society of Thailand urged him on Saturday to
stay on.

Asians shocked and worried by report detailing Clinton affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS dropped word to quote in 16th graf; EDITS.
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO _ Asians reacted with shock and dismay following the
release of the report detailing U.S. President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, expressing worry the political
crisis in Washington comes at a time when the world needs strong
American leadership.
	   Clinton's trouble pushed local stories off the front pages of
papers from Sydney to Singapore. Japan's largest circulation daily,
the Yomiuri newspaper, devoted more than half of each its first
three pages to the White House scandal.
	   All across Asia, people worried that the crisis would leave the
United States without an effective leader.
	   An editorial in the The Sydney Morning Herald said the scandal
``couldn't come at a worse time.''
	   Citing a ``wobbly global financial system,'' and troubles in
Russia and North Korea, the paper lamented that ``when strong
(U.S.) leadership is needed, political paralysis may be the only
thing on offer.''
	   In Thailand and Singapore, newspaper and television reports left
out the more sexually graphic details included in U.S. Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on his eight-month investigation of
Clinton.
	   Papers in South Korea, though, summarized sections of the report
including when and where sexual encounters took place, and what
parts of Lewinsky's body Clinton touched.
	   ``What an embarrassment! The Americans should have handled this
more quietly,'' said Park Min-ja, a 55-year-old housewife in Seoul.
``How is he going to stand before children?''
	   Closer to the United States, the reaction was similar.
	   Mexico's Televisa television network called the Starr report
``500 pages of shameful details.'' Commenting on the report on
Televisa's nightly news program, the anchor asked ``What has become
of the pride, the dignity of the most powerful nation on earth?''
	   Across Asia, papers and people focused on Clinton's possible
removal from office and some even called for him to step down.
	   ``The U.S. is the only hope for leadership, for action. And it
cannot take its proper role with Clinton at the helm,'' read an
editorial in the Bangkok Post. ``The president must resign,'' it
said.
	   Hong Kong newspapers were more forgiving.
	   The South China Morning Post _ which had Clinton stories on its
first three pages _ said in a commentary that ``public revelation
of some of the graphic details of the dalliances in the Oval Office
study might be so embarrassing as to be punishment in itself.''
	   In Japan, too, where the economy is in the midst of its worst
recession in decades, some said Americans should count their
blessings.
	   ``It was not a good thing, but as long as the economy is in good
shape it doesn't matter,'' said Masato Fujita, 30, a manager at a
maintenance company.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he regards Clinton as a
``very close friend and ally,'' and his office stated Blair still
intends to meet with the U.S. leader later this month during a trip
to the United Nations headquarters in New York.
	   But British newspapers were less supportive in their Saturday
editions, which devoted numerous pages to the Starr report.
	   A Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, The Sun, declared in an
editorial that Clinton was ``unfit to be president'' and ``must
go.''
	   The Express, another tabloid, ran an inside story about Hillary
Clinton under the headline: ``I'm with you all the way...you vile
creep.''

Is Yeltsin losing his grip? Some compare him to Brezhnev
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hair is no whiter, the girth, perhaps, no
wider. But the Boris Yeltsin who is trying to lead Russia out of
its latest crisis is not the same man who led his country
triumphantly out of the communist past.
	   By nearly all accounts, Russia's president moves more slowly and
appears to think less clearly than he did just a few years ago _
changes that might not be unusual in a 67-year-old man, but that
could have profound implications for his country.
	   To be sure, Yeltsin is still very much in charge of a government
that concentrates enormous power in the hands of the president.
	   He has even seemed energized at times in recent weeks as he
battled with parliament over his choice for prime minister. The
president settled on a compromise candidate, Yevgeny Primakov, who
is a year older than Yeltsin and also has suffered serious health
problems in recent years.
	   Yeltsin still wields more power than any person or institution
in Russia. The constitution he rammed into law after an attempted
coup by parliament leaders in 1993 gives him sweeping powers and
often makes the legislature more of an advisory body than a true
partner in government.
	   With two years left in his term, Yeltsin remains a masterful
political tactician.
	   He is also a man whose health and mental acuity are almost
certainly diminished.
	   The change seems so marked that Russians and Westerners alike
are starting to make a comparison that would have been unthinkable
not long ago. They say Yeltsin reminds them of the late Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev, whose last years in office were a painful
parody of leadership.
	   Alexander Bovin, former Russian ambassador to Israel, was
recently quoted by a newspaper as saying Yeltsin is a lot like
Brezhnev in his ``middle period,'' when the Soviet leader was
marked by a ``slow gait, stateliness, somewhat royal appearance,
sometimes not fully articulated speech.''
	   One difference, Bovin said, is that Yeltsin seems to be ``more
cloistered and cut off from objective information and the people
than Brezhnev was.'' Those are harsh words, given the Brezhnev
era's reputation for stagnation.
	   ``The late Brezhnev, the late Yeltsin _ they're much the same,''
said Marshall Goldman, a Russian scholar at Harvard. ``Look at a
video of (Yeltsin) in August 1991 and look at the difference in
behavior today.''
	   That August, Yeltsin, then the president of the Russian republic
of the Soviet Union, became an international hero when he clambered
atop a T-72 tank and defied a coup attempt against Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
	   He was a strapping, vigorous man, quick on his feet both
physically and mentally, whose seemingly spontaneous action and
words stirred a nation to resist a return to totalitarianism.
	   Today, Yeltsin often seems sluggish. His face frequently appears
puffy. Even after a month of vacation this summer, he had bags
under his eyes and appeared tired.
	   When he finally appeared in public after weeks of lying low, one
Russian newspaper featured a sarcastic headline: ``He lives!''
	   His physical health has been a concern for some time. Yeltsin
was suffering from heart disease during the 1996 presidential
election and had a heart attack, followed by multiple bypass
surgery, in the months after his victory.
	   Of equal concern these days is his mental agility.
	   At a recent news conference, Yeltsin appeared to have difficulty
understanding reporters' questions and had his press secretary
repeat them several times.
	   He has fired his entire government twice this year. The man
considered Yeltsin's top economic adviser, Anatoly Chubais, has
been fired three times. On a recent trip to Novgorod, Yeltsin made
three proclamations that he later contradicted, one within an hour.
	   Such behavior once was chalked up to Yeltsin's well-documented
fondness for liquor. But few people believe that explains his
lapses now.
	   Ariel Cohen, a Russia analyst for the Heritage Foundation in
Washington, said Yeltsin has to marshal all of his strength these
days merely ``to cling to power.''
	   For all the concern, Yeltsin remains a formidable politician
with remarkable survival skills.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, a former Yeltsin aide who now heads the
social democratic party Yabloko, says he has a stock answer for
anyone who doubts Yeltsin's staying power: ``He will catch a cold
at your funeral.''

Opposition calls off demonstration, fears ``Pol Pot'' violence

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Ranariddh calling off protest,
opposition accusing Hun Sen of ``Pol Pot-style massacre.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen staged a major
show of force Saturday, bringing more than 5,000 supporters into
the capital and turning them loose with clubs and chains to beat
outnumbered opposition protesters calling for his ouster.
	   Fearing a ``Pol Pot-style massacre,'' the opposition called off
a planned mass rally for Sunday, saying the risk of a clash was too
great.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' said opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh after an
urgent meeting of his royalist FUNCINPEC party.
	   The references to the dead Khmer Rouge leader _ whose reign of
terror caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people in the
1970s _ follows the worst week of violence since Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh as co-premier in a bloody coup last year.
	   At least two people were badly beaten Saturday, but there were
no reports of shootings or new killings to add to four confirmed
deaths in six days of street violence. Belief on the streets is
that many more _ including Buddhist monks _ have been slain.
	   The new clashes follow warnings by King Norodom Sihanouk and the
powerful head of the army to pressure opposition leaders to accept
Hun Sen's victory in disputed parliamentary elections and stop
``anarchy'' in the streets.
	   Ranariddh said he would see the king, his father, Tuesday and
defied threats from Hun Sen to arrest him, saying members of
parliament from his party will go to jail with him.
	   ``With the arrest of Ranariddh, there will be bloodshed,'' the
prince said. ``It is my duty to end the bloodshed, violence, but
still respect the will of the people.''
	   Hun Sen assembled supporters of his Cambodian People's Party
from strongholds in the Phnom Penh region. They rolled through the
capital in convoys of trucks, occasionally joined by truckloads of
troops.
	   Organizers threatened to double the mob Sunday to crush the
opposition's planned rally. Orders were overheard to bring in more
men from the provinces and to offer each 10 kilograms (24 pounds)
of rice.
	   One club-wielding Hun Sen supporter, Prak Sokhan, 43, said: ``We
want to see all demonstrations stopped.''
	   About 3,000 Hun Sen supporters marched from the Independence
Monument to the opposition rallying point near the U.S. Embassy and
the Ranariddh's home. They chanted for the arrests of Ranariddh and
his opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, calling them ``traitors.''
	   Riot police and soldiers, who had served as Hun Sen's shock
troops in his crackdown until he shifted to plainclothes mobs
Friday, allowed them to assemble freely. Every man carried a
weapon.
	   About 200 opposition supporters, braving intimidation by elite
police with Kalashnikov rifles and dirt bikes, shouted insults as
the pro-Hun Sen crowd came into view, then scattered and threw
stones when they charged. A pedicab driver was badly beaten and ran
for refuge to the U.S. Embassy.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of relatively peaceful protests
against his 13-year rule Monday after grenades were thrown at his
home. He was not there and no one was hurt. He blamed Sam Rainsy,
his most vocal critic, and called for his arrest.
	   Sam Rainsy has sought refuge in the local U.N. offices and
called the charges a ``ridiculous pretext.''
	   About 1,500 Hun Sen supporters went Saturday to the hotel where
the offices are located and presented a letter addressed to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Its contents were not divulged.
	   ``Since the beginning of the situation, we've tried to convey
the message as much as possible from our secretary-general that
problems should be resolved through dialogue,'' U.N. military
observer Jan Wanderstein said.
	   Cambodians have been horrified and outraged by a week of
violence where police have used guns, clubs, rifle butts and water
cannon against demonstrators, including Buddhist monks. Despite
fears of violence, some 6,000 people took part Thursday in a
spontaneous opposition march.
	   The opposition asserts Hun Sen won by massive fraud in the July
26 elections and have threatened to boycott the National Assembly
when it meets Sept. 24, denying him the two-thirds majority needed
to form a new government.

Six policemen killed in Caucasus attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Six policemen were killed and one was wounded
Saturday in a predawn attack on a police checkpoint in the
violence-torn Caucasus region of Russia, the Interior Ministry
said.
	   The policemen were manning a joint post on the border of
Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia, two Russian republics that fought
a short but bloody war in 1992. Breakaway Chechnya is nearby.
	   The checkpoint was attacked by unidentified assailants armed
with rifles and a grenade-launcher, a duty officer at the Interior
Ministry said.
	   Four of those killed in the village of Maysky were Ossetian and
two were Ingush, the NTV television station reported.
	   More violence was reported in another Caucasus republic,
Dagestan. Attackers fired automatic weapons on a police patrol car
on Saturday, seized an unknown number of police officers who were
riding in it and took them to Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

China lauds latest defeat of Taiwan UN bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Saturday praised the latest defeat of an
effort to gain membership for rival Taiwan in the United Nations.
	   The defeat Friday of a proposal for Taiwan to receive U.N.
representation ``fully demonstrated the firm will of the vast
majority of U.N. member states to safeguard the U.N. Charter ...
and the norms of international law,'' the state-run Xinhua News
Agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao as saying.
	   The steering committee of the U.N. General Assembly decided
Friday not to include in the assembly's agenda a proposal by 15
mainly African and Caribbean countries for Taiwan membership.
	   It was the sixth consecutive year China defeated such a
proposal.
	   Taiwan, governed by Nationalists who lost a civil war to the
Communists and fled the Chinese mainland in 1949, held China's seat
in the United Nations until October 1971, when the General Assembly
transferred the U.N. seat to Beijing and expelled Taiwan.
	   China considers Taiwan a renegade province to be retaken by
force if necessary, and vehemently opposes any effort to lend the
island international recognition.
	   ``Taiwan, as a province of China, lacks qualification necessary
for U.N. membership,'' Zhu was quoted as saying, adding that
attempts to grant it a seat were ``doomed to failure.''
	   Zhu urged the countries that backed Taiwan's membership to
consider their ``long-term interests'' and to not ``harm the
sentiments of the Chinese people again by standing in opposition to
the vast majority of U.N. member states.''

Sailor dies after killing eight crew members on Russian submarine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report sailor killed self, Defense Minister
sending condolences to family. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian sailor who had barricaded himself inside
the torpedo compartment of a nuclear-powered submarine after
gunning down eight crew members died when security officers stormed
his hiding place early Saturday, military officials said.
	   The Defense Ministry press office and a spokesman for the
Northern Fleet said that the 19-year-old sailor, Alexander
Kuzminykh, killed himself during the security operation to end his
rampage, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
	   Earlier, Interfax had cited the Federal Security Service as
saying Kuzminykh was killed by an anti-terrorist unit that was
dispatched to the submarine after the sailor had refused to
surrender.
	   ``There was no way to preserve Alexander Kuzminykh's life,''
Interfax quoted Federal Security Service officials in the northern
port of Murmansk as saying.
	   Kuzminykh, who was drafted into the navy last year, went on a
shooting spree overnight Thursday on the vessel in Severomorsk,
near Murmansk, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
	   He stole a machine gun and shot the crew members to death before
barricading himself in the vessel's torpedo section, officials
said.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev sent his condolences Saturday to
the families of the slain crewmen.
	   The submarine belonged to the Bars class, a fleet submarine
normally armed with nuclear cruise missiles and torpedoes, navy
officials said.
	   There were no missiles on board the docked submarine. Still, the
torpedo compartment where Kuzminykh was holed up did contain
conventional explosives, Interfax reported.
	   Interfax said Kuzminykh had been in detention on disciplinary
charges when he seized the weapon.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal living conditions and a
tradition of hazing. The country's chronic economic problems have
left the military extremely stretched financially.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen staged a major
show of force Saturday, bringing more than 5,000 supporters into
the capital and turning them loose with clubs and chains to beat
outnumbered opposition protesters calling for his ouster.
	   Fearing a ``Pol Pot-style massacre,'' the opposition called off
a mass rally planned for Sunday, saying the risk of a clash was too
great.
	   But after being scattered in the morning, a crowd of 400
anti-Hun Sen protesters dared a new march Saturday afternoon. They
avoided trucks of riot police and kept clear of the city center,
where Hun Sen's crowd was camped out.
	   A score of trucks packed with hundreds Hun Sen's supporters
bearing clubs, pipes, rocks and other weapons moved out to
intercept them toward the airport.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Prince Norodom Ranariddh said after a meeting of his
opposition FUNCINPEC party.
	   The references to the dead Khmer Rouge leader _ whose reign of
terror caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people in the
1970s _ follows the worst week of violence since Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh as co-premier in a bloody coup last year.
	   At least two people were badly beaten Saturday, but there were
no reports of shootings or new killings to add to four confirmed
deaths in six days of street violence. Belief on the streets is
that many more _ including Buddhist monks _ have been slain.
	   The new clashes follow warnings by King Norodom Sihanouk and the
powerful head of the army to pressure opposition leaders to accept
Hun Sen's victory in disputed parliamentary elections and stop
``anarchy'' in the streets.
	   Ranariddh said he would see the king, his father, Tuesday and
defied threats from Hun Sen to arrest him, saying party legislators
would go to jail with him.
	   ``With the arrest of Ranariddh, there will be bloodshed,'' the
prince said. ``It is my duty to end the bloodshed, violence, but
still respect the will of the people.''
	   Hun Sen assembled supporters of his Cambodian People's Party
from strongholds in the Phnom Penh region. They rolled through the
capital in convoys of trucks, occasionally joined by truckloads of
troops.
	   Organizers threatened to double the mob Sunday to crush the mass
opposition rally. Such gatherings had drawn as many as 20,000
people in recent weeks. Orders were overheard to bring in more men
from the provinces and to offer each 10 kilograms (24 pounds) of
rice.
	   One club-wielding Hun Sen supporter, Prak Sokhan, 43, said: ``We
want to see all demonstrations stopped.''
	   Saturday morning, 3,000 Hun Sen supporters marched from the
Independence Monument to the opposition rallying point near the
U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home. They chanted for the arrests of
Ranariddh and his ally, Sam Rainsy, calling them ``traitors.''
	   Riot police and soldiers, who had served as Hun Sen's shock
troops in his crackdown until he shifted to plainclothes mobs
Friday, allowed them to assemble freely. Every man carried a
weapon.
	   About 200 opposition supporters, braving intimidation by elite
police with Kalashnikov rifles and dirt bikes, shouted insults as
the pro-Hun Sen crowd came into view, then scattered and threw
stones when they charged. A pedicab driver was badly beaten and ran
for refuge to the U.S. Embassy.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of relatively peaceful protests
against his 13-year rule Monday after grenades were thrown at his
home. He was not there and no one was hurt. He blamed Sam Rainsy,
his most vocal critic, and called for his arrest.
	   Sam Rainsy has sought refuge in the local U.N. offices and
called the charges a ``ridiculous pretext.''
	   About 1,500 Hun Sen supporters went to the hotel where the
offices are located and presented a letter addressed to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Its contents were not divulged.
	   Cambodians have been horrified and outraged by a week of
violence where police have used guns, clubs, rifle butts and water
cannon against demonstrators, including Buddhist monks.
	   The opposition asserts Hun Sen won by massive fraud in the July
26 elections and have threatened to boycott the National Assembly
when it meets Sept. 24, denying him the two-thirds majority needed
to form a new government.

Detectives foil Tamil rebel plot to kill defense minister

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Detectives from the anti-terrorism
Special Investigation Unit arrested a would-be Tamil suicide
bomber, foiling a rebel plot to assassinate Sri Lanka's defense
minister, police said Saturday.
	   Sathasivam Thirukeshwaran, 18, was assigned to kill General
Anuruddha Ratwatte, who is leading the military's campaign to
defeat rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The group is
fighting for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority.
	   Thirukeshwaran, a student, was arrested in the temple town of
Kandy, 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of Colombo Friday, said a
police official in Kandy, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Ratwatte, 60, is also from Kandy.
	   In Colombo, the military's top spokesman Brigadier Sunil
Tennekoon said he could not give details as it may hamper
investigation.
	   Thirukeshwaran was arrested the same day Tamil rebels bombed the
City Hall in their former stronghold of Jaffna, killing the
moderate Tamil mayor and at least 11 others.
	   Friday's bombing set back efforts to pacify a region scarred by
Sri Lanka's 15-year civil war. The rebels say that the country's
3.3 million Tamils can prosper only in a sovereign area, away from
the domination of the majority Sinhalese who are 76 percent of Sri
Lanka's 18.5 million people.
	   The government says it is willing to grant limited autonomy
Tamil majority areas, but no independent state.
	   At least 25 people were wounded in Friday's blast in Jaffna
which destroyed much of the mayor's office, flinging sections of
the roof up to 300 feet (yards) away.
	   No arrests have been made, but detectives were piecing together
evidence and information on how rebels concealed two Claymore mines
in the roof of the well-guarded City Hall.
	   Military officials did not give any details about the
investigations but said Jaffna was back to normal Saturday.
	   In Colombo, President Chandrika Kumaratunga warned moderate
Tamils of the LTTE's designs.
	   ``What else have the (Tamil) Tigers done except betraying the
Tamil people by exploding bombs at a time when the government is
doing everything possible to develop Jaffna and create a peaceful
environment for its citizens...,'' Mrs. Kumaratunga said in a
statement.
	   ``All those who value peace and humanity reject the acts of
terror perpetrated by the LTTE which is facing desperate situation
(at the war front) in the face of defeat,'' she said.

Kenyan cyclist peaks early, then fades

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Kenyan rider streaked ahead
Saturday at the start of the men's cycling road race and dominated
the first half. Then, all of a sudden, he was gone.
	   Cyclist David Kinja pulled out in the 8th of 12 laps in the
184-kilometer test at the Commonwealth Games, a victim of injury,
inexperience and lack of training. The gold went to Jay Sweet of
the tested Australian team.
	   ``Too hard, too early,'' murmured a spectator as the 23-year-old
Kinja slowly steered his bike through the crowd after his flashy
run.
	   For years, Kenya has churned out world-class runners who benefit
from high-altitude training at home.
	   Cycling, however, has failed to get the same attention there,
partly because equipment is so costly.
	   Races are few, perhaps one every two months, and riders hop from
town to town in hilly terrain. They have had little exposure to
international-standard routes like that used at the 12-lap race in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``If we get a chance to do more of these races, we can be
good,'' Kinja said as an assistant iced his weak left knee. ``You
can train up to a certain level. Then after that, you need tougher
guys to take you higher.''
	   He and a few other riders, including Kenyan Maurice Waweru, led
the race for more than two hours, at one point beating the pack by
almost 5 minutes. Waweru finished 43rd in 4 hours, 50 minutes, 35
seconds, almost 19 minutes behind Sweet.
	   Kinja and his three teammates trained together for only one
month, while other teams at the games have honed strategy over
years.
	   Cycling as a sport may not have caught on in Kenya, but it is
popular as a means of getting around in a nation where many people
can't afford any other form of transport.
	   ``The best cyclists come from poor families,'' Kinja said. ``You
have to keep on riding your bike, maybe going to school or
traveling from one place to another.''

Waugh and Ambrose resume with a lack of hostility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Steve Waugh's greatest moment in
cricket came in the Caribbean when he defied Curtly Ambrose to
score a double century that gave his team the 1994-95 series
victory.
	   Waugh stood firm under a barrage of bouncers and snarls, meeting
the gaze of the giant paceman as Australia beat the West Indies
away for the first time in more than two decades.
	   They met again Saturday, perhaps for the last time, as Australia
beat Antigua by seven wickets in the Commonwealth Games limited
overs competition.
	   Ambrose managed to rattle the Australian batsmen early on, but
again Waugh had the better of the great West Indian speedster.
	   He also noticed a change in Ambrose's nature.
	   ``I don't think he was at full tilt today but he was still a
handful,'' Waugh said. ``He was friendlier than normal. He actually
mentioned my name today. He said, `Steve, I'm going around the
wicket.' He might be mellowing in his old age like we all do.''
	   Ambrose is renowned for his lack of communication on and off the
field. On it he speaks with glares, and off it he refuses
interviews.
	   Ambrose made an exception at the end of the 1996 tour to
Australia, giving a news conference to mark the end of his last
trip there. The tape was passed around among cricket-loving
journalists as if it were a Beatles bootleg.
	   Antigua's team, which will play Canada in its final pool match
before bowing out, is led here by another famous West Indian star,
Viv Richards.
	   Richards carried the flag for the country at Friday night's
opening ceremony, as the games welcomed cricketers for the first
time.
	   ``It was the greatest thing to ever happen,'' Richards said
Saturday. ``To be there in that particular capacity in a
Commonwealth Games, to be carrying your nation's flag, it just
leaves a little lump in your throat and I don't think I could ever
better that. When I was asked, I would have cut some limbs off to
have done it.''

Bali-bound Boeing 747 aborts takeoff on Tokyo airport runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Garuda Indonesia jumbo jet bound for the
Indonesian resort island of Bali aborted its departure from Tokyo's
main international airport Saturday after the pilot detected engine
trouble, an airport spokesman said.
	   None of the 397 passengers or 18 crew members reported injuries.
	   Problems with one of the Boeing 747's four engines caused the
pilot of Garuda Flight 881 to abandon takeoff after the plane
started down the runway at the New Tokyo International Airport in
Narita, said spokesman Shinichi Hayase.
	   Narita is located 65 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   The plane turned off onto a taxiway and shut down its engines.
It was then towed into a hangar for inspection by maintenance
workers, Hayase said.
	   The plane's departure for Bali was rescheduled for around 9 p.m.
(1200 GMT) Saturday pending an inspection, he said.
	   In 1996, a Garuda DC-10 crashed seconds after takeoff from an
airport in southwestern Japan, killing three people and injuring
about 100.

Five policemen killed in Caucasus attack

comments.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five policemen were killed Saturday in a predawn
attack on a police checkpoint in the violence-torn Caucasus region
of Russia, the Interior Ministry said. One attacker was killed and
another wounded.
	   The policemen were manning a joint post on the border of
Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia, two Russian republics that fought
a short but bloody war in 1992. Breakaway Chechnya is nearby.
	   The checkpoint was attacked by unidentified assailants armed
with rifles and a grenade-launcher, a duty officer at the Interior
Ministry said. The ITAR-Tass news agency said there were six
attackers, and that they disarmed the policemen and took them away
from the checkpoint before shooting them.
	   The five policemen killed in the village of Maysky were
Ossetian, and the attackers were Ingush, ITAR-Tass said, citing the
Interior Ministry in Northern Ossetia.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin expressed his
condolences to the families of the slain policemen and ``committed
the police organs to take exhaustive measures to search for the
criminals,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   More violence was reported in another Caucasus republic,
Dagestan. Attackers fired automatic weapons on a police patrol car
on Saturday, seized an unknown number of police officers who were
riding in it and took them to Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

Sailor kills self after killing eight on Russian submarine

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Federal Security Service confirmation of suicide

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian sailor who had barricaded himself inside
a nuclear-powered submarine after gunning down eight crew members
killed himself when security officers stormed his hiding place
early Saturday, officials said.
	   The Defense Ministry press office, the Federal Security Service
and a spokesman for the Northern Fleet said that the 19-year-old
sailor, Alexander Kuzminykh, killed himself during the security
operation to end his rampage, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news
agencies reported.
	   Earlier, Interfax had cited the Federal Security Service as
saying Kuzminykh was killed by an anti-terrorist unit that was
dispatched to the submarine after the sailor had refused to
surrender.
	   The sailor took his life after speaking with his older brother,
who had traveled from St. Petersburg, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Kuzminykh, who was drafted into the navy last year, went on a
shooting spree overnight Thursday on the vessel in Severomorsk,
near Murmansk, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
	   He stole a machine gun and shot the crew members to death before
barricading himself in the vessel's torpedo section, officials
said.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev sent his condolences Saturday to
the families of the slain crewmen.
	   The submarine belonged to the Bars class, a fleet submarine
normally armed with nuclear cruise missiles and torpedoes, navy
officials said.
	   There were no missiles on board the docked submarine. Still, the
torpedo compartment where Kuzminykh was holed up did contain
conventional explosives, Interfax reported.
	   Interfax said Kuzminykh had been in detention on disciplinary
charges when he seized the weapon. He apparently used drugs and his
mother said he had suffered from psychological problems in
childhood, ITAR-Tass said.
	   There has been a rash of mass killings in the Russian armed
forces, which are plagued by brutal living conditions and a
tradition of hazing. The country's chronic economic problems have
left the military extremely stretched financially.

Asian markets anticipate another tough week, but Wall Street's
</HEADLINE>
rebound may reduce the risks &QL; 
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Regional economic woes are expected to maintain
the pessimistic mood in Asian stock markets this week, but some
analysts believe that Wall Street's latest recovery could give
share prices at least a temporary lift.
	   Tokyo's announcement Friday that the nation is sliding even
deeper into recession served as a firm reminder of Japan's economic
woes, and its apparent inability to lead international efforts to
help out Asia's other economies, analysts said.
	   ``The key thing is the trends in Japan's domestic economy,''
Jonathan Hazell, a market strategist at Barclays Capital Asia in
Singapore, said in an interview.
	   There are few factors to support the Japanese yen, which has
recently gained against the U.S. dollar, and if it turns weak again
that could hurt regional stock markets, Hazell said.
	   But analysts also said that the surprising recovery on Wall
Street Friday is one sign of hope. The Dow Jones industrial average
shot up 179.96, or 2.4 percent, to finish at 7795.50, producing a 2
percent improvement for the past week.
	   Asia's top three markets went just the other way Friday. The
major barometer for the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged more than 5
percent, followed by a 3.5 percent decline in Hong Kong and a 1.9
percent fall in Singapore.
	   Analysts said that the political crisis brewing in the United
States over President Bill Clinton's sex scandal and his possible
impeachment is unlikely to affect Asian markets this week as much
as other troubles closer to home.
	   ``I don't think that the political drama in the U.S. makes a lot
of difference,'' Hazell said.
	   For example, Malaysia recently imposed capital and market
restrictions, banning overseas trading of the ringgit and stocks.
That dealt a serious blow to neighboring Singapore, whose banks are
heavily exposed to Malaysia in loans and ringgit deposits.
	   Banks in Singapore last week gave customers a choice of
transferring ringgit back to Malaysia or converting them to U.S.
dollars. Bankers said most clients chose conversion.
	   In Hong Kong, traders are still dealing with the government's
recent efforts to penalize the biggest speculators on the stock
market and with a new price war among property developers.

Wife of war crimes suspect votes

<TEXT>
	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The wife of war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb war leader, voted Saturday and
said her husband's party would win if the Bosnian election is run
fairly.
	   Karadzic, who is believed to be hiding in Bosnian Serb republic
to avoid arrest, cannot participate in the national election taking
place Saturday and Sunday.
	   His wife, Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic, cast her vote in this
stronghold of Bosnian Serb hardliners 16 kilometers (10 miles) east
of Sarajevo.
	   Asked to predict the outcome, she told The Associated Press:
``If there is no election theft this time, then the results of the
elections will be the same as in 1991,'' when her husband won
power.
	   Karadzic heads a list of Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects who
remain free, despite their indictment by an international war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   International officials running Bosnia under the 1995 peace
treaty that ended the war call the failure to arrest Karadzic and
others one of the biggest obstacles to faster progress in fully
implementing the peace plan.

People loot and burn rice storehouse in East Java
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people have looted a rice
warehouse then burned it down, and an onion field spanning three
provinces in Java was plundered, police said Saturday.
	   There were no arrests in either of the incidents.
	   In East Java, about 500 villagers looted rice Friday from a
storehouse in Gondanglegi Kulon, a village on the outskirts of
Malang, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, police
said.
	   After looting the rice owned by a Chinese businessman, the
villagers then put the remaining 70 tons outside and burned them
along with the storehouse, they said.
	   The mob was angry because the owner has held his stock despite a
severe food shortage, police said. The owner was being interrogated
by police for illegal stockpiling, they said.
	   A mob of about 1,500 looted an onion field stretched from
Central Java's town of Losari Timur and West Java's Losari Barat on
Friday, police said.
	   Rice shortages and rising prices have become a major source of
discontent among Indonesia's 202 million people. Shortages of the
country's No. 1 staple have led to sporadic looting and riots
around the country.
	   In an agreement with the International Monetary Fund Friday, the
Indonesia government said it would supply rice to 7.5 million
families. Initially, the government had promised rice to 2 million
families.
	   Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib said early this week that
those convicted of hoarding rice and other goods could be punished
with death.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, is facing
its worst economic crisis in three decades that started in July
with a deep plunge of the national currency, the rupiah.

Hattori takes four-stroke lead in Japan LPGA Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIHO, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori fired a 3-under-par 69
Saturday and took a four-stroke lead going into the final round of
the Japan LPGA Championship, one of the tour's three major events.
	   Hattori, seeking her third title this season and 10th overall,
bogeyed the first hole but recovered with a birdie on the fourth.
	   On the back nine, Hattori sank a 2-meter (7-foot) birdie putt on
the 12th, holed from the edge of the green of the 17th for birdie
and finished the round with her fourth birdie of the day on the
18th.
	   The round, the day's best, left the 29-year-old Hattori at
2-under 214, the only under-par score after 54 holes over the
par-72 Miho Golf Club course, a layout known for its narrow fairway
and punitive rough.
	   ``My shots off the tee are solid and then I'm hitting the ball
close,'' said Hattori, winner of the 1984 Japan Women's Amateur and
the 1985 U.S. Women's Amateur.
	   ``This is a tough course where it's hard to shoot a good score
like 65. So I'll just try not to crash tomorrow,'' she added.
	   Hattori is in contention for her second major title of the tour.
She won the 1994 Japan Women's Open.
	   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima also shot a 69 and shared
second place at 2-over 218 with Yuri Fudo, who turned in a 70.
	   ``This course demands every shot in the bag. Otherwise you'll
easily end up with a bogey or double bogey,'' said Fukushima, the
tour's top money winner in the last two seasons.
	   Fukushima is seeking her second victory of the season and 13th
overall. She has so far won two major tournaments, including the
1997 Meiji Nyugyo Cup.
	   Overnight leader Lee O-soon of South Korea struggled to a fat 77
and fell into a tie for fourth at 220 with Yuri Kawanami, who shot
a 74.
	   Hiromi Kobayashi, winner of the Rainbow Classic on the U.S. tour
last month, carded a 71 and was alone in fifth place at 221.
	   First-round leader Yuko Moriguchi was another stroke back at 222
after a 3-over-par 75.
	   The 70 million yen (dlrs 518,000) event offers a top prize of
12.6 million yen (dlrs 93,000). The winner also gets a five-year
exempt status on the tour.

Fiji starts with strong win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World champion Fiji made a fine
start to the first ever Commonwealth Games rugby sevens
competition, beating Wales 54-7 Saturday.
	   Marika Vunibaka scored a hat-trick of tries in an
eight-try-to-one victory.
	   The other leading contender for the rugby gold, New Zealand,
began with an 80-0 demolition of Sri Lanka. Captain Eric Rush was
one of three players to score twice, while All Blacks fullback star
Christian Cullen also crossed as the Kiwis piled on 12 tries.
	   South Africa began its campaign with a 29-22 win over Papua New
Guinea.
	   Bobby Skinstad and Andre Venter, part of the Springboks'
15-a-side team which recently won the tri-nations series, scored
tries in a five-tries-to-four win.
	   The tournament features 18 teams which will each play two
matches Saturday on the opening night of a three-day competition.

Japan's Toyota to expand production at plant in West Virginia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest carmaker, said
Saturday that it will start producing automatic transmissions in
West Virginia, boosting its investment at its new plant there by
about dlrs 200 million.
	   Toyota plans to manufacture 360,000 automatic transmissions a
year from 2001 at its plant in Buffalo, West Virginia, creating
some 200 new jobs, company said in a statement.
	   The transmissions will be used in North American-built Camrys,
it said.
	   Construction of a 300,000-square-foot facility for making the
transmissions will begin in mid-1999, it said.
	   In January, Toyota announced an expansion of an engine factory
under construction at its West Virginian plant. The dlrs 700
million plant will produce both six-cylinder and four-cylinder
engines.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of poor villagers who lost
their crops and homes in devastating floods in Bangladesh could
swamp cities looking for work once the water recedes, economists
predicted Saturday.
	   Nearly 35 million people _ one quarter of the country's
population _ have been displaced by the floods that destroyed at
least 2.3 million tons of rice, the government said. At least 37
percent of the country's 124 million people are too poor even to
buy food.
	   ``There is a fear that there will not be enough work for the
vast agricultural work force after the floods to support them,''
said Anu Muhammad, a teacher at Dhaka's University's Economics
Department.
	   On Saturday weather officials reported the floods were easing
after more than two months. However, it will take a couple of weeks
for displaced people to return home, they said.
	   At normal times, thousands of poor people come to the national
capital Dhaka in search of jobs. With the floods, the migration may
rise by 20 percent in the coming months, Muhammad said.
	   Bangladesh has told foreign donors that it will need dlrs 889
million in emergency aid to cope with the flooding crisis. The
United States and other donors have so far committed dlrs 172
million to buy food and medicines.
	   ``Without massive international assistance anything between 10
and 20 million people will find it very difficult to survive the
next four months,'' Michael Elmquist, a U.N. official said after
leading a team of experts to assess the flood damages Thursday.
	   The government acknowledged the trouble ahead, but insists there
will be no famine.
	   ``We have food stock enough to avert starvation and more food
aid is coming,'' Finance Minister Shah Mohammad Kibria assured the
nation last week.
	   The government has a current stock of 700,000 tons of rice and

Two miners trapped in collapsed tunnel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) _ Two miners remained trapped Saturday
for the second straight day inside a tunnel that collapsed in a
central Philippine gold mine, officials said.
	   Jose Anievas, vice president and resident manager of Philex Gold
Philippines, Inc., said in a statement that a cave-in inside a
70-meter (229-foot) tunnel occurred before dawn Thursday when eight
meters (26 feet) of loose soil crashed on the miners.
	   The miners, Estanislao Bariquit, 57, and Fortunato Bastida, 54,
were employed by Paramina Earth Technologies Inc., one of several
firms contracted by Philex at its mine operations in Bulawan,
Negros Occidental province, about 570 kilometers (354 miles) south
of Manila.
	   Anievas said six 2-inch (5-centimeter) holes had been drilled
through the collapsed area to allow air and water to reach the two
men.
	   He gave no details on their condition.

Against backdrop of clashes, U.S. envoy holds more talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes erupted for a second day
Saturday in at least two West Bank towns, injuring at least a dozen
Palestinians, amid a burst of fury over Israel's slaying of two top
fugitives from the radical Islamic group Hamas.
	   The Israeli military was on high alert and the Palestinian lands
remained sealed off for a second day as Hamas threatened to stage
bomb attacks inside Israel in retaliation for the killings of
brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, who were wanted for a string of
violent acts.
	   About 80 Palestinian teen-agers, some masked and armed with
slingshots, hurled stones and bottles at Israeli troops near at the
Jewish enclave of Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts of Bethlehem. At
least three Palestinians were slightly hurt by rubber bullets.
	   In and around the West Bank town of Ramallah, soldiers fired
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse dozens of stone throwers.
Army radio said at least 10 Palestinians were hurt.
	   Against this tense backdrop, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sat down
Saturday for more talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _
even though the Palestinian Cabinet suggested Israel's killing of
the two fugitives was timed to scuttle the mediator's mission.
	   ``There is no hope for progress if Israel continues with such
policies,'' said a statement issued late Friday after the weekly
Palestinian Cabinet session.
	   The Ross-Arafat meeting was held in the tense northern West Bank
town of Nablus. While the two spoke, about 2,000 students at a
nearby university staged a rally to protest the killing of the
Awadallah brothers and call for a halt to any peace talks.
	   ``Revenge, revenge!'' the marchers screamed. Some wore white
shroud-like clothing sometimes used to symbolize suicide bombers,
and others were dressed in military-style fatigues.
	   Ross, who arrived Wednesday, was to meet later Saturday in
Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So far,
the meetings have yielded little sign of progress.
	   The deaths of the fugitive brothers, killed in a volley of
bullets as Israeli troops raided their hideout outside the West
Bank town of Hebron, triggered violent protests the next day. Five
people were hurt in clashes in El Bireh, the pair's hometown.
	   The killings spotlight an issue that Ross has been trying to
untangle during this visit: the quarrel between Israel and the
Palestinians over how much Arafat's Palestinian Authority should be
expected to do to fight Islamic militants.
	   A security blueprint was worked out by Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. security officials last December, but was rejected by
Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days had softened their position. Now, though, that
may change.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour claimed Israel chose to
carry out the killings now to bolster its contention that Israel is
under constant threat from militants. But Netanyahu's senior
adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel pursues suspected terrorists
at all times, regardless of possible political repercussions.
	   At its meeting, the Palestinian Cabinet demanded that Israel
accept all elements of a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback in
the West Bank which was first presented in January and is the basis
of Ross' current mission. Israel has been seeking changes to it.
	   Under that plan, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank and the Palestinians would work more closely with he
United States in fighting Islamic militants.
	   In a show of defiance, the Palestinian Cabinet also said it
discussed peparations for a declaration of statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Arafat has said he would make the announcement
of statehood on May 4, 1999, regardless of whether a final peace
agreement with Israel has been negotiated.
	   It has been more than a year since there was a suicide bombing
attack in Israel, but the slayings prompted Hamas' harshest threats
in months.
	   In Gaza City, Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin convened the group's
leadership, and a spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar, said Israel would ``pay
a high price'' for killing the Awadallahs.
	   Hamas said the retaliation would be on par with the group's
response to Israel's 1996 assassination of its chief bomb maker,
Yehiyeh Ayyash.
	   At that time, Hamas carried out four suicide bombings over nine
days that killed scores of Israelis, disrupted peace talks and
helped propel Israel's right-wing leader, Netanyahu, to power.

KLM begins investigating how near miss plane strayed off course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was
Saturday investigating how one of its planes strayed 45 miles (70
kilometers) off course causing two other aircraft to take evasive
action after their electronic sensors warned of a possible mid-air
collision.
	   The two planes, a British Airways Boeing 767 and a Swissair
MD-11, changed course to avoid the risk of colliding with a KLM
MD-11 bound from the Dutch Antilles to Amsterdam's Schiphol
airport. All three planes later landed safely and there were no
reports of any injuries.
	   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said it was too early to say what
had caused flight KL0752 to stray off course.
	   ``We are looking into the matter and we will do everything
necessary,'' Wellhuner said. ``We have an open mind to find out
what caused this problem.'' He could not give an indication of when
the investigation would be completed.
	   The near misses occurred within 10 minutes of each other at 3.30
p.m. (1330 GMT) Friday, 450 miles (720 kilometers) west of Ireland,
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said.
	   The Swissair MD-11 is the same type of airliner that crashed in
Canada last week, killing all 229 people on board. The route on
which the incident took place was also the same.
	   Wellhuner said Friday that the KLM and Swissair flights would
have missed each other by 8-10 kilometers (5 - 6.2 miles) even
without the evasive action.
	   British Airways declined to comment Friday, but said that it
understood that one of its New York bound flights had been involved
in the incident.

Rival supporters clash again; opposition fears `Pol Pot massacre'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with new street battles. Trims

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival party supporters fought street
battles Saturday in a sixth day of unrest as strongman Hun Sen
brought some 5,000 armed partisans into the capital, staging a
massive show of force to crush calls for his ouster.
	   Ten gunshots were fired after about 100 Hun Sen partisans became
separated from their comrades and were hit by a hail of stones
thrown by opposition backers, the only time Saturday the sides
confronted each other in equal numbers.
	   At least three people were badly hurt _ two Hun Sen backers and
a bystander. It was unclear if they had been struck by bullets or
clubbed. Two people were badly beaten in an earlier clash, but
there were no reports of new deaths to add to the four since
Monday.
	   The opposition supporters, who had otherwise tried to avoid
contact as Hun Sen's men hunted them through the city, chased and
attacked them with their own clubs, dropped in panicked flight. The
shots seemed to have been fired wildly by Hun Sen's men in the
melee.
	   Accusing Hun Sen of escalating tensions for a ``Pol Pot-style
massacre,'' the opposition called off a peaceful mass rally planned
for Sunday, saying the risk of bloodshed was too great.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh said.
	   The references to the dead Khmer Rouge leader _ whose reign of
terror caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people in the
1970s _ follow the worst week of violence since Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh as co-premier in a bloody coup last year.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's victory in
parliamentary elections July 26. They assert he won by massive
fraud and threaten to boycott the National Assembly to prevent a
new government forming.
	   Ranariddh said he would see the king, his father, Tuesday and
defied threats of arrest, saying all his party's members of
parliament would go to jail with him.
	   ``With the arrest of Ranariddh, there will be bloodshed,'' the
prince said. ``It is my duty to end the bloodshed, violence, but
still respect the will of the people.''
	   Hun Sen assembled supporters of his Cambodian People's Party
from strongholds in the Phnom Penh region. They rolled through the
capital in convoys of trucks, occasionally joined by truckloads of
troops.
	   Organizers threatened to double the mob Sunday to crush the
opposition rally. Orders were overheard to bring in more men from
the provinces and to offer each 10 kilograms (24 pounds) of rice.
	   One club-wielding Hun Sen supporter, Prak Sokhan, 43, said: ``We
want to see all demonstrations stopped.''
	   Saturday morning, 3,000 of Hun Sen's partisans marched toward
the opposition rallying point near the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's
home. They chanted for the arrests of Ranariddh and his ally, Sam
Rainsy, calling them ``traitors.''
	   Riot police and soldiers, who had served as Hun Sen's shock
troops in his crackdown until he shifted to plainclothes mobs
Friday, allowed them to assemble. Every man carried a weapon _
clubs, chains, pipes, slingshots and a few concealed guns.
	   About 200 opposition supporters shouted insults as the pro-Hun
Sen crowd came into view, then threw stones and scattered.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of relatively peaceful protests
against his 13-year rule Monday after grenades were thrown at his
home. He was not there and no one was hurt. He blamed Sam Rainsy,
his most vocal critic, and called for his arrest.
	   Sam Rainsy has sought refuge in the local U.N. offices and
called the charges a ``ridiculous pretext.''
	   Cambodians have been horrified and outraged by the week of
violence where police have used guns, clubs, rifle butts and water
cannon against demonstrators, including Buddhist monks.

Primakov gets down to work as Russia's new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Primakov pledging Russia will pay its
debts, meeting with Foreign Ministry officials, Luzhkov comments,
monopolies' plans to fight inflation. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Saturday
that Russia would pay its debts, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   ``Let nobody doubt this. Russia is not a country to declare
itself bankrupt and never will be. The new government will see to
that and is already working along these lines,'' Primakov was
quoted as telling top Russian editors.
	   Primakov started work Saturday in one of the world's toughest
and most thankless jobs, searching for solutions to the nation's
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. Aside from his
meeting with editors, he also held a working meeting with his
former colleagues in the Foreign Ministry.
	   Primakov sailed through his parliamentary confirmation on
Friday, offering what one Moscow daily called something for
everyone.
	   ``In the space of a few minutes, he managed to say what people
on the left, on the right, patriots and pro-Westerners wanted to
hear,'' the Nezavisimaya Gazeta commented Saturday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin chose the 68-year-old, former foreign
minister and intelligence chief as a compromise candidate after his
previous pick, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was rejected twice by the
Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament.
	   Primakov told lawmakers on Friday he had no ready answers to the
country's chronic economic problems, but he did sketch the broad
outlines of his approach to solving the crisis: continued reform
with more state control, increased involvement of Russia's powerful
regional leaders, improving the government's own discipline, and
using the financial system to boost Russian industry as well as to
fill the state's coffers.
	   Russian policy makers have proposed at least three economic
programs for the new government.
	   Acting deputy prime minister and tax chief Boris Fyodorov favors
tying the Russian ruble to a stable currency like the U.S. dollar
or the Euro, accelerating bankruptcy procedures and lowering the
burden on tax payers. Chernomyrdin had presented this plan to the
Duma before being voted down.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, the Communist who has already been named to the
new government, backs a policy based on strong support for
industry. According to the pro-reform Izvestiya daily, his plan
calls for massive printing of money, large budget expenditures and
a significant state budget.
	   The third plan was advanced by the former secretary of the
Russian Security Council, Andrei Kokoshin, and Dmitry Vasilyev,
chairman of the market watchdog Federal Securities Commission. It
would reverse the previous government's decision to suspend
domestic and foreign debt payments.
	   ``These measures, of course, could restore the confidence of
domestic and foreign investors ... in Russian state bonds. But
there is a no less serious problem: restoring the very capacity of
the state to pay its debts,'' Izvestiya commented.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov urged the new government on Saturday
to support small enterprise, the Interfax news agency reported. He
said that the lack of a well-defined government program to
encourage small enterprise and protection of small business against
criminals, as well as the enterprises' own lack of trust in the
authorities, had kept the number of small enterprises across Russia
on the order of a low 850,000.
	   Luzhkov said that ``no matter how dire and problematic the
situation in in large industry might seem, only through the
development of small business can Russia rise from its knees,''
Interfax reported.
	   Russia's two biggest power utilities, Gazprom and Unified Energy
Systems, and several government ministries and committees on
Saturday announced a joint plan to keep down inflation. Interfax
said they were committed to ``having a palpable influence on
lowering the tempo of inflation and stabilizing Russia's economic
and financial situation.''

Australia beats Antigua by 7 wickets; India trounces Canada by 112

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Damien Fleming's haul of five
wickets and opener Adam Gilchrist's 43 runs propelled favorites
Australia to a 7-wicket victory Saturday over Antigua in a
preliminary match of the Commonwealth Games.
	   Chasing a run rate of only 1.47 an over, Australia scored 101
runs in 17.5 overs in reply to Antigua's 99 all out in 30.1 overs.
	   Swing bowler Fleming set up the victory when he cut through the
Antiguan top order for 5-24 off nine overs.
	   In another match, India defeated Canada by 112 runs. In reply to
India's 157 runs, thanks to one-down Ajay Khursia's 83, Canada was
bowled out for 45 in 23.5 overs.
	   ``This was the most committed bowling performance I have ever
seen,'' captain Ajay Jadeja said. India's star batsman Sachin
Tendulkar made two before being bowled by Davis Joseph.
	   At the Kilat grounds, Australia never appeared in trouble even
when Sylvester Joseph took diving catches in the slips to help
dismiss the top three batsmen _ Mark Waugh, Ricky Ponting and
Michael Bevan _ with 46 runs on board.
	   Those were the only wickets _ two claimed by Curtly Ambrose and
one by Winston Benjamin _ that Antigua managed as Gilchrist and
captain Steve Waugh produced a winning 55-run partnership.
	   Waugh said he was relieved at the result.
	   ``When they have got five quick bowlers in the side and one is
Ambrose, one of the greatest quick bowlers ever, it is always going
to be hard,'' he said.
	   Gilchrist's 57-ball innings contained three fours. Waugh scored
25 in 33 balls and hit two boundaries. He admitted that Fleming's
early dominance turned the match in Australia's favor.
	   Producing variations of swings, Fleming was twice on a
hat-trick. The young Antiguan side was no match for the
Australians, who have fielded virtually a regular Test side in the
16-nation competition _ cricket's debut at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Reeling at 62 for eight, Antigua produced a late recovery with a
36-run partnership by No. 9 and No. 10 batsmen, Ambrose and Hamish
Anthony, who took the score to 98 for nine. Just as Antigua
appeared to be progressing well, Benjamin tried a foolhardy pull
off Tom Moody, giving a high catch to Gavin Robertson. He made 17
including one six.
	   Before that, Antiguan wickets fell so regularly that the
Ambrose-Anthony partnership was the biggest and Eldine Baptiste was
the highest scorer at 22, including two sixes and two fours.
	   In the fifth over, Fleming took out former West Indian captain
Richie Richardson, who was caught by Ricky Ponting at silly point.
The next ball he had Joseph leg before wicket.
	   In the sixth over, Hayden Walsh (15) tried to pull Fleming, but
ballooned the ball to square leg, where Brad Young took a catch
leaping backward. With the next ball, Fleming trapped the new man,
Ridley Jacobs, leg before with the ball striking low just above the
ankle.
	   Fleming recently overcame shoulder problems to return to the
Australian side and play in India earlier this year.
	   In other matches: Pakistan defeated Kenya by 129 runs and Sri
Lanka defeated Jamaica by 67 runs.

Against backdrop of clashes, U.S. envoy holds more talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ The fury over Israel's slaying of
two top Hamas fugitives led to a second day of clashes on the West
Bank on Saturday, leaving at least a dozen Palestinians injured.
	   The Israeli military was on high alert and the Palestinian lands
remained sealed off for a second day as the militant Islamic group
Hamas threatened to stage bomb attacks inside Israel in retaliation
for the killings of brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, who were
wanted for a string of violent acts.
	   About 80 Palestinian teen-agers, some masked and armed with
slingshots, hurled stones and bottles at Israeli troops near the
Jewish enclave of Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts of Bethlehem. At
least three Palestinians were slightly hurt by rubber bullets.
	   In the area of the West Bank town of Ramallah, soldiers fired
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse dozens of stone throwers.
Army radio said at least 10 Palestinians were hurt.
	   Against this tense backdrop, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sat down
Saturday for more talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _
even though the Palestinian Cabinet suggested Israel's killing of
the fugitives was timed to scuttle the mediator's mission.
	   ``There is no hope for progress if Israel continues with such
policies,'' the cabinet said in a statement issued late Friday
after its weekly meeting.
	   The Ross-Arafat meeting was held in the tense northern West Bank
town of Nablus. While the two spoke, about 2,000 students at a
nearby university staged a rally to protest the killing of the
fugitives and to call for a halt to peace talks.
	   ``Revenge, revenge!'' the marchers screamed. Some wore white
shroud-like clothing sometimes used to symbolize suicide bombers,
and others were dressed in military-style fatigues.
	   Ross, who arrived Wednesday, was to meet later Saturday in
Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So far,
the meetings have yielded little sign of progress.
	   The deaths of the brothers, killed in a volley of bullets
Thursday as Israeli troops raided their hideout outside the West
Bank town of Hebron, triggered violent protests the next day. Five
people were hurt in clashes in El Bireh, the pair's hometown.
	   The killings spotlight an issue that Ross has been trying to
untangle during this visit: the quarrel between Israel and the
Palestinians over how much Arafat's Palestinian Authority should be
expected to do to fight Islamic militants.
	   A security blueprint was worked out by Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. security officials last December, but was rejected by
Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days had softened their position. Now, though, that
may change.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour claimed Israel chose to
carry out the killings now to bolster its contention that Israel is
under constant threat from militants. But Netanyahu's senior
adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel pursues suspected terrorists
at all times, regardless of possible political repercussions.
	   At its meeting, the Palestinian Cabinet demanded that Israel
accept all elements of a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback in
the West Bank that was first presented in January and is the basis
of Ross' current mission. Israel has been seeking changes to it.
	   Under the U.S. plan, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank and the Palestinians would work more closely with the
United States in fighting Islamic militants.
	   In a show of defiance, the Palestinian Cabinet also said it
discussed preparations for a declaration of statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Arafat has said he would make the announcement
of statehood on May 4, 1999, regardless of whether a final peace
agreement with Israel has been negotiated.

German chancellor backs Yeltsin, new Russian premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl is voicing
confidence that Russia's new premier, Yevgeny Primakov, will
continue with economic reforms.
	   Primakov is ``certainly not the prototype of the reformer, but
he moves in the right direction,'' the German leader was quoted
Saturday as saying by the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ``I respect
him a lot.''
	   ``I am convinced that Russia will not slide back into the old
times,'' Kohl said.
	   He staunchly defended his friend Boris Yeltsin against critics _
including German opposition leaders _ who view the Russian
president as weakened by country's financial crisis.
	   ``It would be good for Russia's stability if he would serve out
his term,'' Kohl told the newspaper.
	   Yeltsin has two years left in his term.

Taliban jets bomb Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province:
</HEADLINE>
opposition says &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Taliban fighter jets pounded the
central Afghan province of Bamiyan on Saturday as minority Shiite
Muslims tried to repel advancing Taliban troops, opposition sources
said.
	   The Taliban religious army began a push Friday to try to take
control of central Bamiyan province, an area controlled by the
opposition Shiite Muslim group Hezb-e-Wahadat.
	   There were earlier reports of hundreds of Shiite Muslims fleeing
the area fearing they would be killed by conquering members of the
Taliban militia.
	   However the report was impossible to confirm, and the
Taliban-controlled radio warned Taliban fighters to ``protect''
their Shiite captives and newly conquered areas.
	   The Taliban has been accused of the widespread killing Shiite
Muslims in August in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Among the dead were 10 Iranian diplomats, whose bodies were
later found in a grave outside the city. The Taliban army, which
rules 90 percent of Afghanistan, says the killing of the Iranians
was done by renegade soldiers and was not sanctioned by the Taliban
movement's leader Mullah Mohammed Omar.
	   Tehran has warned that it would avenge the killings and Iranian
authorities said it will carry out another military exercise on its
eastern border with Afghanistan.
	   According to some Taliban commanders in the Afghan capital, as
many as 10,000 Taliban soldiers have been sent to western Afghan
province of Herat both as a show of strength and because of fears
of possible cross-border incursions from Iran.
	   Amnesty International has condemned the Taliban and accused its
troops of killing thousands of people in Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
The victims, according to Amnesty, were members of Afghanistan's
minority Shiite Muslim community.
	   The Taliban have denied the accusations, but relations between
them and the Hezb-e-Wahadat party plummeted following the massacre
last May of an estimated 2,000 Taliban soldiers in Mazar-e-Sharif.
The Taliban allege that the killings were carried out by
Hezb-e-Wahadat soldiers and their allies.
	   The Taliban captives were reportedly forced to jump into open
wells and grenades were thrown in after them, according to
opposition soldiers who participated in the massacre.
	   When the Taliban marched toward Mazar-e-Sharif again in August
many feared the Taliban would seek retribution for the massacres.
	   The Taliban has allowed only the International Red Cross into
Mazar-e-Sharif and the organization has so far refused to comment.

Military rebellion simmers in African kingdom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The leadership of Lesotho's
powerful military, which has a history of coups, was being
contested Saturday by different army factions amid a mutiny by
several dozen soldiers.
	   The unrest in the small kingdom of 2 million people, which is
located within South Africa's borders, comes as opposition parties
were disputing the results of the general elections, which the
ruling party won overwhelmingly last May.
	   Lt. Gen. Makhula Mosakeng went on state radio Friday night to
announce his resignation as commander of the Lesotho Defense Force.
He and several other senior officers had reportedly had been
arrested earlier in the day by the junior-officer mutineers.
	   On Saturday, he was at home. In a brief telephone conversation
with The Associated Press, he declined to comment.
	   ``It would be wise if I don't speak for now,'' he said.
	   Foreign Minister Tom Thabane said Mosakeng had not submitted his
resignation to the defense minister, as would be required.
	   ``The army is not under proper control,'' Thabane said in a
telephone interview. He declined to comment further, citing fears
for his own safety.
	   An American diplomat said he believed Mosakeng had resigned over
the radio ``under duress.''
	   ``It is not our belief that Mosakeng's expression over the radio
was voluntary,'' Raymond Brown, the deputy chief of the U.S.
Embassy, said in a telephone interview.
	   Mosakeng had said on the radio he was giving control of the
military to a brigadier-commander, identified only as Thibeli.
	   The mutiny began Friday, and the rebels were apparently still
holed up at military headquarters, Brown said.
	   ``It is a mutinous group who isolated and put incommunicado most
senior commanders,'' Brown said.
	   The mutineers reportedly had control over the weapons arsenal.
	   They have made no demands and were describing the insurrection
as ``an internal army matter,'' Brown said.
	   The American diplomat said the mutineers did not appear to be
trying to overthrow the government.
	   ``There is no coup d'etat,'' Brown said.
	   There were no unusual troop movements Saturday on the
traffic-clogged streets of the capital, Maseru.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe _ called on to mediate the
election dispute _ have reportedly concluded in a report that
Lesotho's electoral commission mishandled the May vote, which gave
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy a landslide victory.
	   The so-called Langa Commission report, which hasn't been made
public yet, was to be discussed by the presidents of the three
countries at a summit in Mauritius that starts Sunday.
	   The report calls for a political solution to the crisis,
according to Frank Chikane, top aide to South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki.
	   Lesotho has a history of political upheaval.
	   In 1970, the first elections after Lesotho gained independence
from Britain were cancelled because the ruling party was afraid it
would lose.
	   The military staged a coup in 1986. The coup leader was later
ousted by another soldier.
	   The military allowed elections in 1993, but the vote was widely
criticized as fraudulent, with one party winning every seat in
parliament.
	   In early 1994 dissident troops kidnapped several Cabinet
ministers and assassinated Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo.
Loyal troops crushed the rebellion.

Gorbachev wants international guarantees for Russian bank deposits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has called
for international guarantees on private deposits in Russian
commercial banks, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
	   In a letter to the Group of Seven leading industrialized
nations, international financial organizations and Russia's new
government, Gorbachev appealed for action to restore citizens'
trust in the banking system and in market economic principles, as
well as in the West's intentions regarding Russia.
	   He said a joint committee should be formed to formulate ways of
guaranteeing private deposits in Russian banks, ``given the fact
that for the second time in seven years the state has virtually
expropriated its citizens' private savings,'' Interfax reported.
	   On Sept. 2, the Central Bank froze private accounts in a number
of commercial banks that have been virtually bankrupted by the
government's default on its debts, then reversed its decision two
days later.
	   Many depositors have been unable to withdraw their money from
the banks, or have been able to recover part of their dollar
accounts in rubles at an unfavorable exchange rate.
	   Treasury officials and other top representatives of the Group of
Seven are to meet in London on Monday to mull over responses to
Russia's economic crisis.

<TEXT>
	   CHEROK TOK KUN, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister went to his rural hometown Saturday to defend himself
against sexual misconduct allegations and launch his nationwide
political reform campaign.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar Ibrahim as his
deputy and finance minister on Sept. 2, saying he was immoral and
unfit to lead this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Police are investigating eight criminal charges against him and
say he could face arrest.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied all allegations, saying they were
crafted by his former mentor to undermine his growing popularity
and challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   He called on some 5,000 supporters Saturday who had traveled for
miles to dismiss the allegations and stand by him.
	   ``I'm back in Penang, I haven't forgotten my roots,'' Anwar
shouted from a raised platform outside his father's modest,
two-story house in the northwestern state of Penang. ``I'm
launching the reformation movement here.''
	   He said he would travel the nation to rehabilitate himself and
be reinstated to the ruling United Malaysia National Organization,
from which he was expelled last week. He also plans to spell out
his government reform platform, which calls for more democratic
freedoms and government transparency.
	   ``The newspapers have vilified me,'' Anwar said. ``My name has
been smeared on national television, but the more they smear me,
the stronger the support.''
	   The rally was attended by several UMNO division chiefs, one who
launched a petition drive calling on Mahathir to reinstate Anwar
into the party that has dominated Malaysian politics since
independence from Britain in 1957.
	   Mazlan Saad, a spokesman for a non-government organization, the
Malaysian Reformist Organization, said his group had always taken
on social causes and shied away from politics.
	   But with the Anwar sacking, MRO would now throw its weight
behind Anwar.
	   ``The action against Anwar is a culmination of what's rotten in
the government,'' Mazlan said. ``Anwar symbolizes the future of the
country. The one person that really destabilizes Malaysia is
Mahathir.''
	   Though political rallies are illegal in Malaysia without a
police permit, no police were seen at the house or along the
winding dirt road leading to the compound.
	   ``Mahathir is terrified of being toppled,'' said Syed Abdul
Halib, 26, who rode his motorcycle from a neighboring town to
listen to Anwar's speech. ``If Mahathir doesn't like Anwar, just
say so, but don't fabricate lies about him.''
	   Later Saturday night, Anwar was scheduled to hold another rally
in Mahathir's hometown and power base, Alor Setar.
	   Anwar, 51, appears to be courting conservative Muslims often at
odds with Mahathir's secular rule.
	   On Friday, he attended prayers at a mosque at Kampong Baru,
traditionally a gathering place for Islamic scholars to debate
religious policy and push for more Islamic influence over the
government.
	   On Friday night, Anwar visited well-known Islamic scholar Harun
Din, banned from weekly televised religious shows as his views were
seen by the government as too extreme.
	   An aide to Anwar told The Associated Press Friday that Anwar's
strategy was to reach out to conservative Muslims frustrated by
Mahathir's ``secularized Islam.''
	   Malaysia has maintained stability since independence from
Britain in 1957, due in part, the government says, to a degree of
separation between mosque and state. Though 60 percent of the
population are indigenous Malays, who are Muslims, the other 40
percent are ethnic Chinese and Indians, most of whom are Buddhists,
Christians and Hindus.

Rolph breaks record for second time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second record in finals; will be updated with
later races &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ England's Sue Rolph set her sights
on the women's 100-meter freestyle world record after crushing the
Commonwealth mark to claim the gold medal at the Games on Saturday.
	   ``I don't know why, it's just happened,'' said Rolph, whose
55.15 seconds relegated Australia's Susan O'Neill and Rebecca
Creedy to silver and bronze.
	   Rolph broke the Commonwealth record of 55.79, which she shared
with compatriot Karen Pickering, in the morning's heats. Her 55.65
then surprised her, and the later effort in the final was an even
bigger shock.
	   Now she has her aim set at Le Jingyi's world mark of 54.01, set
when China dominated the 1994 world championships in Rome.
	   ``I was just looking at that record this morning and maybe I can
have a go next year,'' said Rolph. ``And by 2000 (Olympics) in
Sydney I'll be hitting my peak.''
	   Rolph said before the meet that she wanted to help her teammates
make a strong start against their Australian rivals.
	   ``They know that I'm out there now,'' said the 21-year-old from
Newcastle, who is seeking two more individual gold medals.
	   Simon Cowley produced the second fastest 100-meter breaststroke
by an Australian to win the gold medal in one minute, 02.00
seconds. National record holder Phil Rogers made a late surge to
get the silver in 1:02.46, while England's Darren Mew prevented an
Aussie clean sweep by taking bronze ahead of Ryan Mitchell.
	   The start of Saturday's program was delayed 25 minutes. No
official reason was given but broadcasters said some seating had
been double booked. A large crowd overfilled the swimming center,
spilling out into the aisles.

Thousands of Kosovo refugees flee renewed fighting; others trapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in northwestern
Kosovo drove thousands of ethnic Albanians from their villages
Saturday, days after their cautious return to attempt resettling,
ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   A separate refugee crisis was developing on Kosovo's border with
Montenegro _ Serbia's smaller partner in what's left of Yugoslavia
_ after an estimated 3,000 refugees were refused entry Friday by
the cash-strapped small republic. Ethnic Albanians pleaded for
emergency aid for them.
	   The refugee drama comes with international officials desperately
trying to help those driven into the open by the six-month-old
conflict before winter arrives.
	   There was no sign of a letup Saturday in the offensive by Serb
security forces, who are trying to crush the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence from Serbia for the
province _ populated largely by ethnic Albanians.
	   About 12,000 people fled their homes late Friday and early
Saturday in the Drenica region, according to the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Most had returned only days earlier to their homes in the area
around Razala, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina, hoping no renewed fighting would drive
them out again, spokesman Himli Zogjani said.
	   ``Refugees are fleeing but they don't know where to go,'' he
said.
	   The ethnic Albanian center said fighting was ``very heavy''
Saturday in the Drenica area, which is considered one of the last
remaining KLA strongholds. It said three ethnic Albanians, two of
them children, had been killed there Friday and Saturday.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center had no immediate reports of fighting
or refugee movements Saturday.
	   To the west of Decani, a new refugee plight developed on the
Montenegro border following the Montenegrin government's decision
Friday to halt the influx of refugees into their territory. More
than 40,000 Kosovo refugees are already in Montenegro.
	   Zogjani said 3,000 refugees were camped in the mountains on the
border, effectively trapped near the village of Bogajice, after
being turned back.
	   ``We appeal for some help for them as they have no food or water
or transportation,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Serb police used loudspeakers Saturday to urge an
estimated 7,000 refugees to leave the meadow where they are camped
in Istinic, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   ``Go home, the police and army won't harm you,'' they said in
Albanian.
	   Police were escorting those who declined to leave.
	   ``I'd like most of all to go to my home but I don't know what's
waiting there for me,'' said Mistar Sejdia, a 70-year-old refugee
who said he's been on the run for over three months.
	   Convoys of humanitarian aid trucks loaded with food, plastic
sheets, medical supplies and clothing were headed Saturday for
Istinic. Humanitarian workers said the meager supplies will help
some but aren't nearly enough.
	   Despite its recent battlefield losses, the KLA vowed to continue
the struggle for independence.
	   ``Reorganized and restructured, the KLA will continue to resist
until final victory,'' the rebel force said in a statement
published Saturday by the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore.

African leaders fail to agree on Congo cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ After an all night session, African
leaders failed Saturday to agree on a cease-fire in Congo's
6-week-old civil war and said more consultations were needed.
	   The Organization of African Unity, which sponsored the talks in
Ethiopia's capital, said in a brief statement the leaders from
seven countries ``will submit the outcome of their deliberations to
their respective governments.''
	   The talks were ``were doomed to failure from the start by
excluding the rebels from participating,'' said a participant on
condition he was not identified further.
	   The meeting in Ethiopia was the fourth formal attempt to bring
peace to Congo.
	   The two-day meeting was attended by ministers from Congo,
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda, and was headed by a
minister from Zambia, which is neutral by borders Congo.
	   A congolese rebel delegation angrily abandoned separate
negotiations Tuesday in Zimbabwe just before a draft of a ease-fire
agreement was expected to be signed.
	   Rwanda, which is accused of intervening on the side of the
insurgents, had earlier complained about the exclusion of the
rebels and renewed a threat to deploy troops in the central African
country to defend its interests.
	   On Friday, Kabila, who was visiting Chad in West Africa,
described rebel leader Arthur Zahidi Ngoma as a ``bootlicker'' of
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda's Vice President Paul
Kagame.
	   ``This affair is not about Ngoma. He is only those leaders'
bootlicker,'' Congolese television quoted Kabila as saying.
	   On Saturday, a senior political adviser to Museveni was reported
as saying Ugandan troops would remain in eastern Congo to fight
Uganda's rebels of the Allied Democratic Front.
	   ``We are just clearing the ground for our safety,'' said Kakooza
Mutale, according to the Njuba Times newspaper.
	   Although the rebels made quick advances early in the conflict,
the government has regained some territory with help from Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia, which have sent in troops to back Kabila.
	   There were no reports of fighting Saturday, but the previous day
loyalist troops recaptured Lubutu, a town on a key route between
two rebel strongholds, killing 49 people, state radio reported.
	   The town is about 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of rebel
headquarters at Goma in eastern Zaire and roughly the same distance
southeast of rebel-held Kisangani on Congo river.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Congo fighting is on the agenda of the annual Southern
African Development Community summit scheduled for Monday on the
Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.
	   Rebels were not invited because ``this is a meeting of sovereign
states,'' executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said Friday.
	   Leader of all 14 member countries, including Kabila, are
expected to participate.

U.S. government asks Czechs to allow broadcast to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The United States has formally
asked the Czech government to allow a U.S.-funded radio station to
broadcast to Iraq from its territory, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Jocelyn Greene in Prague as saying the request was handed to the
Czech Foreign Ministry on Friday.
	   The embassy was closed Saturday and officials could not be
reached.
	   Last month, the Czech Republic's Social Democratic government
agreed to allow Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to
Iran, but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   It said an approval to the broadcast would be considered only if
the U.S. government made an official request.
	   The U.S. government-funded radio station, which operates out of
Prague, intends to start its broadcasts by the end of September.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Ales Pospisil told Mlada Fronta Dnes
that ministry officials met with U.S. Embassy representatives on
Friday, but refused to give any details on the meeting.
	   Following a letter sent to him on Tuesday by U.S. Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, the New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, President Vaclav Havel also
stepped in, trying to persuade his Cabinet to drop objections
against the broadcast.
	   It was not immediately clear if and when the government would
debate the U.S. request. But Foreign Minister Jan Kavan announced a
news conference on the issue for Monday.

Two Kenyans fail to appear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two of the fancied Kenyan team
didn't even make it to the ring on the opening day of the
Commonwealth Games boxing competition Saturday. But the reasons for
their non appearance were clouded in mystery.
	   Their opponents were told they had each suffered ankle injuries
in training but other reports suggested they failed to make the
official weight.
	   Bidding to improve on the two golds they won four years ago at
Victoria, British Colombia, the Kenyans sent 10 newcomers to the
Games but had a disastrous start.
	   Nicholas Oyugi pulled out of his bantamweight fight with
Scotland's Craig Docherty who was told the Kenyan suffered an ankle
injury during training.
	   Bernard Njoroge was scheduled to meet Australia's Erle Wiltshire
in a first round flyweight contest and the Australian team also
heard the problem was an ankle injury.
	   But boxing officials at the Malawati Stadium told the Malaysian
news agency, Bernama, that the two Kenyans failed to make the
weight.
	   Both Docherty and Wiltshire had to go through the motions of
getting into the ring, hear the first bell toll, and then get
awarded the fight.
	   Docherty, who has a good chance of gaining a medal, now meets
Namibia's Joshua Veiko who outpointed Hopiang Mabele, of Lesotho.

Scotland's Nicol, other seeds, advance to last 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Scotland's Peter Nicol, the
world's top-ranked squash player, breezed into the round of 16 at
the Commonwealth Games Saturday, trouncing Papua New Guinea's Scott
Evans 9-0, 9-0, 9-0.
	   The top-ranked woman player, Australia's Sara Fitz-Gerald, also
won without yielding a point, ousting Andrea Goodridge of Barbados.
	   Nicol has given up only one point in his first two matches, but
he said, ``I am sure that will change in the next round.''
	   On Sunday, he faces No. 10 seed Graham Ryding of Canada, who
beat Malaysia's Ong Beng Hee 10-9, 9-2, 9-1.
	   Fitz-Gerald meets South African Natalie Grainger, the 12th seed,
who beat Malaysian Sharon Wee 9-0, 9-4, 9-0.
	   Men's No. 2 Jonathan Power of Canada advanced with a 9-0, 9-2,
9-0 victory over Zambia's Patrick Chifunda, and now faces Zarak
Jehan Khan, seeded 14th, who beat Pakistan compatriot Shams Islam
Khan 9-5, 9-0, 0-9, 9-4.
	   No. 3 Rodney Eyles beat Botswana's Cunning Machinya 9-3, 9-2,
9-0, and now meets fellow Australian David Palmer, the 12th seed,
who ousted Pakistan's Mansoor Zaman 8-10, 9-2, 9-2, 9-2.
	   No. 4 Alex Gough of Wales easily defeated Botswana's Lefika
Ragontse 9-1, 9-0, 9-1. He now plays Malaysian Kenneth Low, seeded
15th, who struggled to a 9-3, 9-3, 2-9, 5-9, 9-5 victory over South
African Glen Whittaker.
	   Women's No. 2 seed Michelle Martin advanced to a round of 16
match against Australian compatriot Robyn Cooper, the 11th seed.
	   ``This match isn't really an indication of my play. It's pretty
hard to read anything into this match as there wasn't any real
competition here,'' Martin said after beating Singapore's Millie
Moy 9-6, 9-0, 9-1.
	   Cooper defeated Zambia's Victoria Chishimba 9-5, 9-6, 9-1.
	   English players Cassie Jackman, No. 3, and Sue Wright, No. 4,
both advanced. Jackman beat Kristina Evelyn of Barbados 9-0, 9-0,

9-1.
	   Jackman next meets South African Claire Nitch, the ninth seed,
who trounced Singapore's Della Lee 9-1, 9-2, 9-0. Wright plays Lisa

Guyana.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO _ Asians reacted with shock and dismay following the
release of the report detailing U.S. President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, expressing concern that the
political crisis in Washington comes at a time when the world needs
strong American leadership. Clinton's trouble pushed local stories
off the front pages of papers from Sydney to Singapore. ``What an
embarrassment! The Americans should have handled this more
quietly,'' said Park Min-ja, a 55-year-old housewife in Seoul.
``How is he going to stand before children?'' The South China
Morning Post _ which had Clinton stories on its first three pages _
said in a commentary that ``public revelation of some of the
graphic details of the dalliances in the Oval Office study might be
so embarrassing as to be punishment in itself.'' (CLINTON-WORLD
REAX)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival party supporters fought street
battles Saturday in a sixth day of unrest as strongman Hun Sen
brought some 5,000 armed partisans into Cambodia's capital, staging
a massive show of force to crush calls for his ouster. Ten gunshots
were fired after about 100 Hun Sen partisans became separated from
their comrades and were hit by a hail of stones thrown by
opposition backers, the only time Saturday the sides confronted
each other in equal numbers. At least three people were badly hurt
_ two Hun Sen backers and a bystander. One was struck by two
bullets in the leg. Two people were badly beaten in an earlier
clash, but there were no reports of new deaths to add to the four
since Monday. (CAMBODIA)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised on
Saturday that Russia would pay its debts, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. ``Let nobody doubt this. Russia is not a country to
declare itself bankrupt and never will be. The new government will
see to that and is already working along these lines,'' Primakov
was quoted as telling top Russian editors. Primakov started work
Saturday in one of the world's toughest and most thankless jobs,
searching for solutions to the nation's worst economic crisis since
the Soviet collapse. Aside from his meeting with editors, he also
held a working meeting with his former colleagues in the Foreign
Ministry. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   CHEROK TOK KUN, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister went to his rural hometown Saturday to defend himself
against sexual misconduct allegations and launch his nationwide
political reform campaign. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked
Anwar Ibrahim as his deputy and finance minister on Sept. 2, saying
he was immoral and unfit to lead this Southeast Asian nation.
Police are investigating eight criminal charges against him and say
he could face arrest. Anwar has vehemently denied all allegations,
saying they were crafted by his former mentor to undermine his
growing popularity and challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule. He
called on some 5,000 supporters Saturday to dismiss the allegations
and stand by him. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second national
election since the end of its war began Saturday, pitting hard-line
candidates who stress ethnicity against more moderate leaders
favored by Western powers. Delays occurred at some polling stations
because organizers failed to deliver voters' lists in time. Most
opened as scheduled, with few people arriving early because voting
also will take place Sunday. A computer problem prevented voters'
lists from arriving at 107 of the 2,627 polling stations, said
Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization of Cooperation and
Security in Europe, which is running the vote. She said the OSCE
would send the lists by e-mail to stations that could receive them
that way, and that helicopters from the NATO-led military force
stationed in Bosnia would deliver the others. Any polling stations
that opened late would remain open past the scheduled 7 p.m. (1700
GMT) closing time Saturday, Szulc said. (BOSNIA-ELECTION)

Asians shocked and worried by report detailing Clinton affair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES AP logo.
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asians reacted with shock and dismay following the
release of the report detailing U.S. President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, expressing worry the political
crisis in Washington comes at a time when the world needs strong
American leadership.
	   Clinton's trouble pushed local stories off the front pages of
papers from Sydney to Singapore. Japan's largest circulation daily,
the Yomiuri newspaper, devoted more than half of each its first
three pages to the White House scandal.
	   All across Asia, people worried that the crisis would leave the
United States without an effective leader.
	   An editorial in the The Sydney Morning Herald said the scandal
``couldn't come at a worse time.''
	   Citing a ``wobbly global financial system,'' and troubles in
Russia and North Korea, the paper lamented that ``when strong
(U.S.) leadership is needed, political paralysis may be the only
thing on offer.''
	   In Thailand and Singapore, newspaper and television reports left
out the more sexually graphic details included in U.S. Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on his eight-month investigation of
Clinton.
	   Papers in South Korea, though, summarized sections of the report
including when and where sexual encounters took place, and what
parts of Lewinsky's body Clinton touched.
	   ``What an embarrassment! The Americans should have handled this
more quietly,'' said Park Min-ja, a 55-year-old housewife in Seoul.
``How is he going to stand before children?''
	   Closer to the United States, the reaction was similar.
	   Mexico's Televisa television network called the Starr report
``500 pages of shameful details.'' Commenting on the report on
Televisa's nightly news program, the anchor asked ``What has become
of the pride, the dignity of the most powerful nation on earth?''
	   Across Asia, papers and people focused on Clinton's possible
removal from office and some even called for him to step down.
	   ``The U.S. is the only hope for leadership, for action. And it
cannot take its proper role with Clinton at the helm,'' read an
editorial in the Bangkok Post. ``The president must resign,'' it
said.
	   Hong Kong newspapers were more forgiving.
	   The South China Morning Post _ which had Clinton stories on its
first three pages _ said in a commentary that ``public revelation
of some of the graphic details of the dalliances in the Oval Office
study might be so embarrassing as to be punishment in itself.''
	   In Japan, too, where the economy is in the midst of its worst
recession in decades, some said Americans should count their
blessings.
	   ``It was not a good thing, but as long as the economy is in good
shape it doesn't matter,'' said Masato Fujita, 30, a manager at a
maintenance company.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he regards Clinton as a
``very close friend and ally,'' and his office stated Blair still
intends to meet with the U.S. leader later this month during a trip
to the United Nations headquarters in New York.
	   But British newspapers were less supportive in their Saturday
editions, which devoted numerous pages to the Starr report.
	   A Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, The Sun, declared in an
editorial that Clinton was ``unfit to be president'' and ``must
go.''
	   The Express, another tabloid, ran an inside story about Hillary
Clinton under the headline: ``I'm with you all the way...you vile
creep.''

Russian Foreign Ministry condemns killing of Iranian diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry has condemned the
Taliban religious militia's killing of nine Iranian diplomats in
northern Afghanistan, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif after the Taliban seized the city from rival
forces on Aug. 8.
	   After a month of denying any involvement in the disappearances,
the Taliban acknowledged responsibility Thursday for the deaths of
nine of the 11.
	   There was no word on the other two diplomats' fate.
	   ``The cruel execution was committed despite the repeated
statements by the Taliban leadership guaranteeing the security of
diplomatic and consular representatives in Mazar-e-Sharif,'' the
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   ``We again urge the Taliban leadership to show common sense,
humanity and political foresight, put an end to military actions
and agree to hold talks on normalizing the situation and ending the
bloodshed in the country,'' the statement said, according to
Interfax.

Thousands of Kosovo refugees flee renewed fighting; others trapped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in northwestern
Kosovo drove thousands of ethnic Albanians from their villages
Saturday, days after their cautious return, ethnic Albanian sources
said.
	   A separate refugee crisis was developing on Kosovo's border with
Montenegro _ Serbia's smaller partner in what's left of Yugoslavia
_ after an estimated 3,000 refugees were refused entry Friday by
the small cash-strapped republic. Ethnic Albanians pleaded for
emergency aid for them.
	   The refugee drama comes with international officials desperately
trying to help those driven into the open by the six-month conflict
before winter arrives.
	   There was no sign of a letup Saturday in the offensive by Serb
security forces, who are trying to crush the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army efforts to win independence for the Serbian
province, which is populated largely by ethnic Albanians.
	   About 12,000 people fled their homes late Friday and early
Saturday in the Drenica region, according to the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Most had returned only days earlier to homes in the area around
Razala, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the provincial
capital, Pristina, hoping that they would not be driven out again,
spokesman Himli Zogjani said.
	   ``Refugees are fleeing but they don't know where to go,'' he
said.
	   The ethnic Albanian center said fighting was ``very heavy''
Saturday in the Drenica area, one of the last remaining KLA
strongholds. It said three ethnic Albanians, two of them children,
had been killed there Friday and Saturday.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center had no immediate reports of fighting
or refugee movements Saturday.
	   To the west of Decani, a new refugee problem developed on the
Montenegro border following the Montenegrin government's decision
Friday to halt the influx of refugees. More than 40,000 Kosovo
refugees are already in Montenegro.
	   Zogjani said 3,000 refugees were camped in the mountains on the
border, effectively trapped near the village of Bogajice, after
they were turned back.
	   ``We appeal for some help for them as they have no food or water
or transportation,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Serb police used loudspeakers Saturday to urge an
estimated 7,000 refugees to leave the meadow where they were camped
in Istinic, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   ``Go home, the police and army won't harm you,'' they said in
Albanian.
	   Police were escorting those who declined to leave.
	   ``I'd like most of all to go to my home but I don't know what's
waiting there for me,'' said Mistar Sejdia, a 70-year-old refugee
who said he's been on the run for more than three months.
	   Convoys of humanitarian aid trucks loaded with food, plastic
sheets, medical supplies and clothing were headed Saturday for
Istinic. Humanitarian workers said the meager supplies will help
some but aren't nearly enough for all.
	   Despite its recent battlefield losses, the KLA vowed to continue
the struggle.
	   ``Reorganized and restructured, the KLA will continue to resist
until final victory,'' the rebel force said in a statement
published Saturday by the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore.

Croatian border guards shoot at Montenegrin fishermen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Croatian border guards fired seven
gunshots at a Montenegrin fishing boat near the disputed Prevlaka
peninsula, Montenegro's Montena-fax news agency reported Saturday.
	   The Friday night incident occurred shortly after a Croat army
speedboat approached a Montenegrin vessel off Prevlaka, demanding
the two fishermen on board surrender, Montena-fax said.
	   The two refused, claiming to be inside Yugoslav territorial
waters. An argument ensued in which, according to the fishermen,
Croat border guards pulled out their arms and fired. No one was
injured.
	   The Montenegrin boat was then pursued by the Croat army patrol
boat but the latter turned back after three more Montenegrin
fishing boats approached the site, Montena-fax said.
	   Prevlaka is Croatia's southernmost peninsula bordering
Montenegro, which together with Serbia forms the present Yugoslav
Federation.
	   The peninsula controls access to Montenegro's naval headquarters
and remains the major unresolved issue between Croatia and
Yugoslavia, which established diplomatic relations in 1996 after
almost five years of war.
	   Prevlaka was briefly seized by Serbs in the war, but the two
sides agreed then to let the United Nations deploy its observers
there until they resolve the dispute.
	   The U.N. Security Council did recognize Prevlaka as a part of
Croatia, but it insists the two sides settle the dispute so the
28-man U.N. observer mission can leave.
	   Talks on Prevlaka are due to resume Tuesday in the Croatian
capital Zagreb between two state delegations.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ After an all-night session, African
leaders failed Saturday to agree on a cease-fire in Congo's 6-week
civil war and said more consultations were needed.
	   The Organization of African Unity, which sponsored the talks in
Ethiopia's capital, said in a brief statement that the leaders of
seven countries ``will submit the outcome of their deliberations to
their respective governments.''
	   The talks were ``were doomed to failure from the start by
excluding the rebels from participating,'' said a participant on
condition of anonymity.
	   The meeting in Ethiopia was the fourth formal attempt to bring
peace to Congo, formerly known as Zaire, where rebels trying to
unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila has failed to
implement democratic reforms and has worsened ethnic hatred.
	   The two-day meeting was attended by ministers from Congo,
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda, and was headed by a
minister from Zambia.
	   A Congolese rebel delegation angrily abandoned separate
negotiations Tuesday in Zimbabwe just before a draft of a ease-fire
agreement was expected to be signed.
	   Rwanda, which is accused of intervening on the side of the
insurgents, had earlier complained about the exclusion of the
rebels and renewed a threat to deploy troops in the central African
country to defend its interests.
	   On Friday, Kabila, who was visiting Chad in West Africa,
described rebel leader Arthur Zahidi Ngoma as a ``bootlicker'' of
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Vice President Paul
Kagame.
	   ``This affair is not about Ngoma. He is only those leaders'
bootlicker,'' Congolese television quoted Kabila as saying.
	   On Saturday, a senior political adviser to Museveni was reported
as saying that Ugandan troops would remain in eastern Congo to
fight Ugandan rebels there.
	   ``We are just clearing the ground for our safety,'' said Kakooza
Mutale, according to the Njuba Times newspaper.
	   Although the rebels made quick advances early in the conflict,
the government has regained some territory with help from Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia, which have sent in troops to back Kabila.
	   There were no reports of fighting Saturday, but the previous day
loyalist troops recaptured Lubutu, a town on a key route between
two rebel strongholds, killing 49 people, state radio reported.
	   The town is about 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of rebel
headquarters at Goma in eastern Zaire and roughly the same distance
southeast of rebel-held Kisangani on the Congo River.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The Congo fighting is on the agenda of the annual Southern
African Development Community summit scheduled for Monday on the
Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.
	   Rebels were not invited because ``this is a meeting of sovereign
states,'' executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said Friday.
	   Leader of all 14 member countries, including Kabila, are
expected to participate.

Military rebellion simmers in African kingdom

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The leadership of Lesotho's
powerful military, which has a history of coups, was being
contested Saturday by different army factions amid a mutiny by
several dozen soldiers.
	   The unrest in the small kingdom of 2 million people, located
within South Africa's borders, comes as opposition parties were
disputing the results of last May's general elections.
	   Lt. Gen. Makhula Mosakeng went on state radio Friday night to
announce his resignation as commander of the Lesotho Defense Force.
He and several other senior officers had reportedly had been
arrested earlier in the day by the junior-officer mutineers, who
reportedly have seized the weapons arsenal.
	   On Saturday, he was at home. In a brief telephone conversation
with The Associated Press, he declined to comment.
	   ``It would be wise if I don't speak for now,'' he said.
	   Foreign Minister Tom Thabane said Mosakeng had not submitted his
resignation to the defense minister, as would be required.
	   ``The army is not under proper control,'' Thabane said in a
telephone interview. He declined to comment further, citing fears
for his own safety.
	   An American diplomat said he believed Mosakeng had resigned over
the radio ``under duress.''
	   ``It is not our belief that Mosakeng's expression over the radio
was voluntary,'' Raymond Brown, the deputy chief of the U.S.
Embassy, said in a telephone interview.
	   Mosakeng had said on the radio he was giving control of the
military to Brigadier-Commander Anthony Thibeli.
	   The mutiny began Friday, and the rebels were apparently still
holed up at military headquarters, Brown said.
	   ``It is a mutinous group who isolated and put incommunicado most
senior commanders,'' he said.
	   The mutineers have made no demands and were describing the
insurrection as ``an internal army matter,'' Brown said.
	   The American diplomat said the mutineers were not trying to
overthrow the government. There were no unusual troop movements
Saturday on the traffic-clogged streets of the capital, Maseru.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe _ called on to mediate the
election dispute _ have reportedly concluded in a report that
Lesotho's electoral commission mishandled the May vote, which gave
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy a landslide victory.
	   The so-called Langa Commission report, which hasn't been made
public yet, may be discussed by the presidents of the three
countries at a summit in Mauritius that starts Sunday.
	   The report calls for a political solution to the crisis,
according to Frank Chikane, a South African official.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela said he was not alarmed
by the mutiny.
	   ``If there is any trouble there it is limited to the army,''
Mandela said.
	   Lesotho has a history of political upheaval.
	   In 1970, the first elections after Lesotho gained independence
from Britain were cancelled because the ruling party was afraid it
would lose.
	   The military staged a coup in 1986. The coup leader was later
ousted by another soldier.
	   The military allowed elections in 1993, but the vote was widely
criticized as fraudulent, with one party winning every seat in
parliament.
	   In early 1994 dissident troops kidnapped several Cabinet
ministers and assassinated Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo.
Loyal troops crushed the rebellion.

Man suspected in cafeteria poisoning arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man suspected of tainting salad dressing and a
hot-water pot with pesticide at a cafeteria for supermarket
employees in coastal Japan was arrested Saturday, police said.
	   In a separate case, a lethal dose of sodium cyanide was found
Saturday in a carton of coffee sold at a convenience store in
Saitama Prefecture (state) just outside of Tokyo, police said.
	   No one was injured in either case. But the news comes amid
heightened concern in Japan over a rash of poisonings that began in
the summer, including two that killed five people. There have been
no arrests in the two fatal poisonings.
	   Saturday's arrest was of a 25-year-old man in Toyama Prefecture
on the Sea of Japan coast, 250 kilometers (160 miles) west of
Tokyo, police said.
	   Four people _ including two children _ died and dozens more were
sickened in July after eating curry laced with arsenic at a town
festival in western Japan. And last month a man in central Japan
was fatally poisoned after drinking a can of tea containing
potassium cyanide.
	   Japanese media have been inundated almost daily with reports of
drinks laced with various poisons found at stores and vending
machines.
	   The poisonings have heightened jitters among many Japanese,
usually accustomed to a relatively crime-free society.
	   Dozens of people reportedly have been rushed to the hospital
complaining of sickness after taking a sip from a drink that later
turned out to contain no poison at all.
	   Earlier in the week, police said a junior high school girl
admitted to mailing fake diet drinks containing disinfectant to her
schoolmates. A 15-year-old boy, who drank the liquid, was
hospitalized.

Parliament summoned for vote of confidence in government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Parliament will interrupt its summer recess
this week to hold a vote of confidence on the new Cabinet of Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh, Jordan Radio reported Saturday.
	   It is expected that Tarawneh's government, formed on Aug. 20,
will receive a majority vote in the 80-member Chamber of Deputies,
which is dominated by pro-government politicians.
	   In recent weeks, many members of Parliament expressed
satisfaction with Tarawneh, 50, a liberal politician with moderate
outlooks similar to that of King Hussein.
	   A royal decree read over the state-run radio said parliament
would convene a special session starting Wednesday. It did not say
how long the session would last.
	   Parliament's vote is essential to install any new Cabinet, which
is customarily appointed by the king, the ultimate authority.
	   Hussein asked Tarawneh in a letter of appointment last month to
improve living conditions and economic performance in Jordan, fight
bureaucracy and severe unemployment and poverty.
	   Tarawneh succeeded Abdul-Salam Majali, whose government resigned
after a public outcry over polluted drinking water in the capital,
Amman, and parliamentary accusations that it had misled the country
about statistics on economic growth.

Was it live or canned? Hallyday blasts report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Singer Johnny Hallyday wrapped up a string of
mega-concerts in the Stade de France, blasting a Paris newspaper
for saying some of his songs were lip-synched. But the paper on
Saturday stood by its report.
	   ``I sing lip-synched. By the way, I also talk in lip-sync,''
France's middle-age Elvis joked with the thousands packed into the
new spaceship-like stadium on a rainy Friday night.
	   The 55-year-old Hallyday earlier Friday issued a statement that
he ``never cheated my fans. .. I've always sung live,'' after Le
Parisien daily reported ``seven or eight'' songs were pre-recorded.
	   Hallyday's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, acknowledged that the
orchestra and backup singers for Johnny were ``pre-recorded to be
reinforced'' during the concerts.
	   Le Parisien explained Hallyday had to depend on pre-recorded
songs to avoid feedback during a portion of the concert when his
microphone was too close to massive speakers near the audience.
	   The paper argued that Hallyday, who sings American rock 'n' roll
classics and his own originals, wouldn't have to rely on recordings
if he didn't have ``American-style mega-shows, with special
effects, fireworks and singers in the middle of the audience.''
	   Le Parisien, quoting an unidentified soundman, also claimed
pre-recorded music was also used at Paris concerts by the Rolling
Stones on July 25 at the Stade de France, as well as by the Spice
Girls. There was no immediate comment from those groups.

Turkish foreign minister flies to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ismail Cem flew to Iran
on Saturday in the first high-level visit between the two neighbors
since a diplomatic row ended in January.
	   Cem was expected to discuss rising tensions between Iran and
Afghanistan over the killing of nine Iranian diplomats by the
Taliban religious militia, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Turkish-Iranian ties soured last year when the Iranian
ambassador in Ankara attended a rally advocating an Islamic regime
in secular Turkey. Both countries withdrew their envoys and
exchanged harsh words. New ambassadors were appointed in January.
	   Anatolia said bilateral ties would also be discussed during
Cem's three-day visit.
	   Turkey accuses Iran of harboring rebellious Kurdish guerrillas
and of trying to fuel radical Islam in Turkey. Iran is uneasy over
Turkey's boosting military ties with Israel.

Osanai leads by two strokes in Suntory Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INZAI, Japan (AP) _ Mamoru Osanai fired a 5-under-par 66
Saturday and surged ahead for a two-stroke lead after 54 holes in
the 100 million yen (dlrs 740,000) Suntory Open.
	   Osanai, who has yet to win in two years as a pro, birdied six
holes against a bogey over the par-71 Sobu Country Club course for
an 8-under 205 total.
	   ``I think I'm still too green to win,'' said the 28-year-old
Osanai. ``I only wish that I could outscore Jumbo for the fourth
straight day tomorrow.''
	   He was referring to Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Japan's winningest
golfer with 108 career victories. Jumbo, the eldest among three
Ozaki brothers on the Japan PGA Tour, coaches a score of golfers in
his off-season class called the ``Jumbo's Army.`` Osanai is a
member of the class.
	   Overnight leader Hideki Kase shot his third straight 69 and
placed second at 207.
	   Kazuhiko Hosokawa equaled the day's best score of 66 and was
alone in third at 208.
	   Katsunori Kuwabara, winner of the Japan PGA Matchplay last week,
also shot a 66 to share fourth place at 210 with Ozaki, who went
around in 71.
	   U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen carded a 70 and was in a group of
nine tied for sixth at 211.
	   ``I just tried to salvage a bad day,'' said Janzen, of Orlando,
Florida. He had a 2-over 37 on the front nine but managed a 3-under
33 on the second nine.
	   ``I have had a bunch of birdies on the back nine the last two
days,'' said Janzen. ``I really need to get off to a better start
and find my swing early in the round instead of waiting until the
back nine.''
	   Janzen said the Sobu Country Club course in central Japan is
tough. ``Look at the leaderboard and see that an 8-under is leading
right now. That does mean that it's very tough.''
	   ``I know on our regular tour, they try to make the courses as
tough as they can every week. Yet a 15-under or so wins every week.
Anytime a single digit-under-par wins, it's a very challenging
course.''

Thousands of Kosovo refugees flee renewed fighting; others trapped

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 17-18 with humanitarian worker calling
situation dire &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in northwestern
Kosovo drove thousands of ethnic Albanians from their villages
Saturday, days after their cautious return to attempt resettling,
ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   A separate refugee crisis was developing on Kosovo's border with
Montenegro _ Serbia's smaller partner in what's left of Yugoslavia
_ after an estimated 3,000 refugees were refused entry Friday by
the cash-strapped small republic. Ethnic Albanians pleaded for
emergency aid for them.
	   The refugee drama comes with international officials desperately
trying to help those driven into the open by the six-month-old
conflict before winter arrives.
	   There was no sign of a letup Saturday in the offensive by Serb
security forces, who are trying to crush the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence from Serbia for the
province _ populated largely by ethnic Albanians.
	   About 12,000 people fled their homes late Friday and early
Saturday in the Drenica region, according to the ethnic
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center.
	   Most had returned only days earlier to their homes in the area
around Razala, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital Pristina, hoping no renewed fighting would drive
them out again, spokesman Himli Zogjani said.
	   ``Refugees are fleeing but they don't know where to go,'' he
said.
	   The ethnic Albanian center said fighting was ``very heavy''
Saturday in the Drenica area, which is considered one of the last
remaining KLA strongholds. It said three ethnic Albanians, two of
them children, had been killed there Friday and Saturday.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center had no immediate reports of fighting
or refugee movements Saturday.
	   To the west of Decani, a new refugee plight developed on the
Montenegro border following the Montenegrin government's decision
Friday to halt the influx of refugees into their territory. More
than 40,000 Kosovo refugees are already in Montenegro.
	   Zogjani said 3,000 refugees were camped in the mountains on the
border, effectively trapped near the village of Bogajice, after
being turned back.
	   ``We appeal for some help for them as they have no food or water
or transportation,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Serb police used loudspeakers Saturday to urge an
estimated 7,000 refugees to leave the meadow where they are camped
in Istinic, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   ``Go home, the police and army won't harm you,'' they said in
Albanian.
	   Police were escorting those who declined to leave.
	   ``I'd like most of all to go to my home but I don't know what's
waiting there for me,'' said Mistar Sejdia, a 70-year-old refugee
who said he's been on the run for over three months.
	   Convoys of humanitarian aid trucks loaded with food, plastic
sheets, medical supplies and clothing were sent to Istinic.
Humanitarian workers said the supplies weren't enough, and they
didn't immediately deliver them in Istinic because the refugees
were leaving so fast.
	   ``The situation is very dire,'' said Anthea Web of the World
Health Program. ``They are leaving Istinic but we are not quite
certain where they are going and if they are able to go back.''
	   Despite its recent battlefield losses, the KLA vowed to continue
the struggle for independence.
	   ``Reorganized and restructured, the KLA will continue to resist
until final victory,'' the rebel force said in a statement
published Saturday by the ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was
Saturday investigating how one of its planes strayed 45 miles (70
kilometers) off course causing two other aircraft to take evasive
action after their electronic sensors warned of a possible mid-air
collision.
	   The two planes, a British Airways Boeing 767 and a Swissair
MD-11, changed course to avoid the risk of colliding with a KLM
MD-11 bound from the Dutch Antilles to Amsterdam's Schiphol
airport. All three planes later landed safely and there were no
reports of any injuries.
	   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said it was too early to say what
had caused flight KL0752 to stray off course. On Friday, KLM said
the aircraft's instruments apparently gave a false positional
reading to the pilot and crew.

Ukraine Central Bank head sees reserves rising this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The chairman of the Central Bank said that
Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves could rise by several hundred
million dollars in 1998 if international financial institutions
continue providing loans to the country, the Interfax news agency
reported Saturday.
	   The International Monetary Fund has already disbursed the first,
dlrs 270 million installment of a dlrs 2.3 billion loan it recently
decided to grant to the country. Bank head Viktor Yushchenko said
reserves would be further boosted if the World Bank disbursed a
dlrs 260 million loan in the next few days.
	   Yushchenko said that the bank's reserves now stand at dlrs 800
million, a figure he said ``conforms to our payments of foreign
debt, which is very important.''
	   Moody's Investor Services recently downgraded the country's
foreign debt rating. Yushchenko said Ukraine may be upgraded again
if it strengthens its own economy, and if the situation in Russia
stabilizes. Ukraine has been hard hit by the economic crisis in
Russia, which is its single largest trading partner.

Iran to send 200,000 more troops to Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will stage extensive military maneuvers
on its border with Afghanistan in a show of force now that the the
Taliban has admitted that its soldiers killed nine Iranian
diplomats.
	   More than 200,000 soldiers will participate in the maneuvers,
which are set to begin around the last week of September, the
commander of Iran's ground forces, Brig. Gen. Abdolali Purshasb,
was quoted as saying by Iranian television Saturday.
	   They will mark the second maneuvers in less than a month on the
country's rugged eastern border.
	   Iran vowed on Friday to avenge the killing of its diplomats. The
Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted
earlier that its soldiers had killed them after taking the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran said two other diplomats escaped, but their whereabouts
were still unknown. The fate of a reporter for the state-run
Islamic Republic News Agency remained unclear.
	   The ground and air maneuvers will take place across a
50,000-square-kilometer (20,000-square-mile) area stretching along
Iran's border with Afghanistan and Pakistan.
	   Some of the 70,000 troops who completed three days of military
exercises in the beginning of September have remained there.
	   Iran supports the opposition alliance that was driven from its
northern headquarters in Mazar-e-Sharif. The Taliban have accused
Iran of arming the opposition, a charge Tehran denies.

Solana criticizes lack of strategy Western strategy towards Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
blamed political leaders in Europe and the United States on
Saturday for their lack of decisiveness in addressing Russia's
economic and political turmoil.
	   ``We have a tremendous problem with Russia,'' Solana told
participants at a conference-debate in Brussels on Europe's
institutions and security policy.
	   ``Europe and the United States should map out a new strategy for
Russia,'' Solana said. ``Right now I see neither leadership nor
strategy.''
	   Other speakers included Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene
and the European Union commissioner for foreign affairs, Hans Van
den Broek.
	   Van den Broek lashed out at the international community for its
dilly-dallying over the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``I am afraid to see in Kosovo a repetition of our mistakes in
the early 1990s in Bosnia,'' he warned.
	   More than 200,000 people were killed in the 1992-1995 Bosnian
conflict that ended with the signing of the Dayton peace accord.
	   In Kosovo, tens of thousands of people have been displaced since
Serb forces invaded the breakaway province six months ago. The
United Nations estimates that 600 to 700 civilians have been killed
so far in fighting between Serb-led forces and Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   The EU has repeatedly condemned Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic for ordering troops into Kosovo, but has done little to
back its threats. This week it finally introduced a ban on the
national Yugoslav airline JAT. The ban had been agreed in June.
	   NATO has also spent the last months finalizing a range of
options for military intervention in Kosovo. Earlier this week,
Solana said political leaders must now decide if they want to use
those options.

Thorpe just misses world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with later races, details &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Ian Thorpe finished a
heart-breaking .01 seconds outside the longest-standing men's world
swimming record Saturday as he won the Commonwealth Games 200-meter
freestyle gold medal.
	   Thorpe, 15, touched in one minute, 46.70 seconds after being on
pace at 150 meters to break Italian Giorgio Lamberti's 1989 mark of
1:46.69.
	   ``It was very close, wasn't it _ I can't believe I got that
close,'' said Thorpe. ``I didn't know what pace I was on. I was
hoping, but you really don't know until you hit the wall, turn
around and look at the scoreboard.''
	   He still broke his own Commonwealth mark of 1:47.24, which he
had set at the games trials.
	   The world 400-meter champion, powered by size-16 feet, stomped
on world 200-meter champion Michael Klim as Australia claimed a
clean sweep.
	   Klim, 21, was second in 1:48.05 but the race was all Thorpe. He
hit the water first and led at every wall.
	   The organizers faced a major embarrassment when the scoreboard
malfunctioned during the race, but it was fixed in time for the
final touch. The referee did not immediately sign the official
results sheet, apparently because of a malfunction that resulted in
no split times being recorded.
	   But a results official said the finishing times were correct,
and the ceremony to award the medals went ahead.
	   Daniel Kowlaski, the Olympic 1,500-meter champion, was third in
1:48.26, and the trio will chase the 4x200-meter record later in
the meet along with Matthew Dunn.
	   England's Sue Rolph was also thinking world records after
crushing the Commonwealth mark to claim the 100-meter freestyle
gold medal.
	   ``I don't know why, it's just happened,'' said Rolph, whose
55.17 seconds relegated Australia's Susan O'Neill and Rebecca
Creedy to silver and bronze.
	   Rolph broke the Commonwealth record of 55.79, which she shared
with compatriot Karen Pickering, in the morning's heats. Her time
of 55.65 surprised her, and the later effort in the final was an
even bigger shock.
	   Now she has her aim set at Le Jingyi's world mark of 54.01, set
when China dominated the 1994 world championships in Rome.
	   ``I was just looking at that record this morning and maybe I can
have a go next year,'' said Rolph. ``And by 2000 (Olympics) in
Sydney I'll be hitting my peak.''
	   Rolph said before the meet that she wanted to help her teammates
make a strong start against their Australian rivals.
	   ``They know that I'm out there now,'' said the 21-year-old from
Newcastle, who is seeking two more individual gold medals.
	   Simon Cowley produced the second fastest 100-meter breaststroke
by an Australian to win the gold medal in one minute, 02.00
seconds. National record holder Phil Rogers made a late surge to
get the silver in 1:02.46, while England's Darren Mew prevented an
Aussie clean sweep by taking bronze ahead of Ryan Mitchell.
	   Canada's Joanne Malar won the first gold medal of her long
career, which started at the 1990 games, by winning the 400-meter
individual medley.
	   Malar finished in 4:43.74, easily beating compatriot Elizabeth
Warden (4:47.69). Australian Jennifer Reilly, who just turned 15
last month and is at her first major meet, did well to claim the
bronze medal in 4:48.43.
	   The start of Saturday's program was delayed 25 minutes. No
official reason was given, but broadcasters said some seating had
been double booked. A large crowd overfilled the swimming center,
spilling into the aisles.
	   The organizers then angered the media, bannning all but
television crews from making poolside interviews. The unusual
decision was made after the first race, despite an official
agreement to allow press into the so-called mixed zone.

Financial secretary to visit Europe and the United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Financial Secretary Donald Tsang plans to visit
Europe and the United States to explain the government's recent
intervention in the stock and futures markets, officials said
Saturday.
	   A government statement said during his three-week visit
beginning on Sept. 27, Tsang will meet with finance ministers and
central bankers to reiterate Hong Kong's commitment ``to free and
open markets.''
	   The government is believed to have spent 15 percent of its U.S.
dlrs 96 billion foreign reserves on a two-week buying spree last
month to prop up shares prices and defend the Hong Kong currency in
a battle with speculators.
	   Speculators have played on the currency peg's connection to
local interest rates to drive rates higher and share prices lower,
in an attempt to weaken the peg, which is set at 7.80 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Tsang said he will explain to officials during his visit that
the major reason for the intervention in the stock and futures
markets was to defend the Hong Kong currency.
	   ``Hong Kong is still one of the freest and most
liberally-regulated markets in the world,'' he said.
	   Tsang will visit Germany, Holland, Britain and the United
States.

Report: bin Laden placed under house arrest by Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused
of masterminding the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, has been placed under house arrest in Afghanistan by his
Taliban hosts, a London-based Arabic newspaper said.
	   Bin Laden is being held in a house in the Kandahar region of
southern Afghanistan, Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported Friday.
	   The Taliban religious army has ``prevented any contacts between
him and his followers, and have prohibited'' access to the media,
the newspaper said, citing sources close to bin Laden.
	   There was no immediate way to confirm the report. But it comes
less than a week after a ranking Taliban official said that bin
Laden could stay in Afghanistan as long as he wants, even if his
presence invites another barrage of U.S. missiles.
	   The United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles into
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings, which killed 258 people and wounded thousands.
	   In Afghanistan, two alleged terrorist training camps were hit in
the Aug. 20 attack, including one believed to have been operated by
bin Laden. He was not harmed in the attack.
	   Al-Quds Al-Arabi said the Taliban, fearful of the repercussions
of bin Laden's growing notoriety, put him under house arrest to
prevent him from making contacts with international media.
	   The Taliban controls 90 percent of Afghanistan and has alienated
many with its strict interpretation of Islam. But it has said it
does not share bin Laden's hatred of the United States and will not
interfere in the affairs of other countries.
	   In the past, the Taliban has said bin Laden promised not to be
involved ``with international terrorism from Afghanistan.''

Australia clinches series over United States

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A last-second three-pointer from
guard Kristi Harrower gave Australia a 70-67 win and an unbeatable
3-0 series lead over the United States in a women's basketball
match Saturday.
	   The United States started the match strongly and got off to a
quick lead, with guard Nikki McCray shooting three early baskets to
give the visitors a 12-5 lead six minutes into the match.
	   Australian coach Tom Maher brought 17-year-old Lauren Jackson
into the game, and her seven points in three minutes helped
Australia level at 15-15.
	   Neither side could gain a significant lead in a tight, physical
second half and Australian guard Allison Cook tied the game at
67-67 by making a foul shot with two minutes to play.
	   Jackson top-scored for Australia with 24 points while McCray and
Katie Smith each shot 16 points for the visitors.
	   The fourth game in the five-game series is Monday night in
Wollongong, New South Wales, with the final on Wednesday in Sydney.

	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Jiddah-based Islamic Development
Bank has agreed to provide dlrs 100 million to Malaysian Airlines
to finance the purchase of a new aircraft, a bank statement said
Saturday.
	   The money will be provided by IDB's Islamic Banks Portfolio, a
lending fund managed by the bank in which 20 Islamic banks and
financial institutions are participating.
	   Under the agreement, based on Islamic banking rules that
prohibit interest, the bank will buy the plane and then lease it to
the airline for 10 years. After the 10 years, Malaysian Airlines
will then fully own the plane.
	   The airline is looking to buy a Boeing 777 or Boeing 747, said a
bank official speaking on condition of anonymity.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian and Palestinian businessmen have
asked their governments' permission to set up a joint commercial
services firm to oversee increased trade between them.
	   Hamdi Tabaa, chairman of the Jordanian Businessmen Association,
said Saturday that business executives presented to their
governments earlier this week a memorandum outlining suggestions
for the increased commercial activities.
	   Tabaa said the memorandum was drafted by a council of Jordanian
and Palestinian businessmen in a four-day discussion that ended
Monday on trade between Jordan and the Palestinian territories.
	   ``The meeting determined that our trade ties do not meet our
aspirations because of obstacles placed by Israel in order to
monopolize trade with the Palestinians,'' he said.
	   Jordanian and Palestinian businessmen have long complained that
Israeli bureaucratic procedures at border points linking Jordan
with the West Bank hampered their trade.
	   In 1995, Jordan and the Palestinians agreed on an annual trade
target of at least dlrs 300 million, but the actual exchange is
estimated at less than 10 percent of that figure.
	   Palestinian imports dlrs 2.2 billion from Israel annually.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government will sell the rest of its stake in
the Contracting and Marine Services Co. for 9.25 million dinars
(dlrs 30.22 million), an economic report said Saturday.
	   The shares will be offered in a two-week public subscription
starting Tuesday, according to the weekly report published by the
independent Al-Shall Economic Consultants.
	   The government has been selling its stocks in scores of local
companies, part of an effort to privatize an economy still
dominated by the public sector.
	   The 25 million shares on offer represent 33.3 percent of the
company's stock. In November, the state auctioned 10 million
shares, or 13.3 percent of company stock, for 3.7 million dinars
(dlrs 12.09 million). After the public subscription, the state will
keep a nominal stake in the company.
	   Contracting and Marine Services was established in 1973. Its
paid-up capital is 7.3 million dinars (dlrs 23.85).
	   __
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Businessmen and the governments in three
southern provinces have set aside 7 million pounds (dlrs 2 million)
to help women begin projects to support their families.
	   Women in the provinces of Assiut, Sohag and the New Valley will
be eligible to receive a maximum loan of 5,000 pounds (dlrs 1,470)
for handicraft or agricultural projects, Al-Akhbar newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The businessmen would also help set up exhibitions, where the
women can sell their products, the newspaper said.
	   The newspaper did not give the conditions for the loan or the
method of repayment.

Lukashenko had signed on Sept. 4, setting staple food rations and
prescribing fines for traders who violate the sales limits.
	   With Russia accounting for about 70 percent of Belarus' foreign
trade, Moscow's market collapse has severely affected its neighbor.
The Belarusian ruble has plunged and consumers have picked store
shelves clean in anticipation of further price rises.

Against backdrop of clashes, U.S. envoy holds more talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with report of Israeli soldier
wounded; Ross-Arafat meeting over. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes erupted for a second day
Saturday in at least two West Bank towns, injuring at least 14
Palestinians, amid fury over Israel's slaying of two top fugitives
from the radical Islamic group Hamas.
	   The Israeli military was on high alert and the Palestinian lands
remained sealed off for a second day as Hamas threatened to stage
bomb attacks inside Israel in retaliation for the killing of
brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, wanted for a string of violent
acts.
	   About 80 Palestinian teen-agers, some masked and armed with
slingshots, hurled stones and bottles at Israeli troops near at the
Jewish enclave of Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts of Bethlehem. At
least four Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets, and army radio
said a soldier was injured as well.
	   In and around the West Bank town of Ramallah, soldiers fired
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse dozens of stone throwers.
Army radio said at least 10 Palestinians were injured.
	   Against this angry backdrop, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sat down
Saturday for more talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _
even though the Palestinian Cabinet suggested that Israel's killing
of the fugitives was timed to scuttle the mediator's mission.
	   ``There is no hope for progress if Israel continues with such
policies,'' said a statement issued late Friday after the weekly
Palestinian Cabinet session.
	   Ross has been holding daily meetings with the two sides since
arriving Wednesday in an effort to revive the peace process, which
has been stalled for 17 months. But little progress has been
reported.
	   Saturday's Ross-Arafat meeting was held in the tense West Bank
town of Nablus. While the two spoke, about 2,000 students at a
nearby university protested the killing of the Awadallah brothers
and called for a halt to any peace talks.
	   ``Revenge, revenge!'' the marchers screamed. Some wore white
shroud-like clothing sometimes used to symbolize suicide bombers,
and others were dressed in military-style fatigues.
	   Neither Ross nor Arafat spoke to reporters after their
three-hour meeting, but Arafat walked the envoy to his car and the
two talked for another five minutes before Ross drove off.
	   The death of the fugitives _ killed in a volley of bullets as
Israeli troops raided their hideout outside the West Bank town of
Hebron _ highlighted an issue that Ross has been trying to untangle
during this visit: Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.
	   A security blueprint was worked out by Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. security officials in December, but was rejected by Netanyahu
as insufficient. Israel has long said that Palestinians are not
doing enough to fight Islamic militants.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour claimed that Israel chose
to strike at the Awadallah brothers now to bolster its contention
that Israel is under constant threat from militants. But
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel pursues
suspected terrorists at all times, regardless of political
repercussions.
	   At its meeting, the Palestinian Cabinet demanded that Israel
accept all elements of a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback in
the West Bank which was first presented in January and is the basis
of Ross' current mission. Israel has been seeking changes to it.
	   Under that plan, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank and the Palestinians would work more closely with he
United States in fighting Islamic militants.
	   In a show of defiance, the Palestinian Cabinet also said it
discussed preparations for a declaration of statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Arafat has said he will make the announcement
of statehood on May 4, 1999, regardless of whether a final peace
agreement with Israel has been negotiated.
	   Netanyahu has hinted he might respond to a unilateral statehood
declaration by annexing chunks of the West Bank, which would
probably set off an explosion of violence.
	   It has been more than a year since there was a suicide bombing
attack in Israel, but the slayings of the two fugitives prompted
some of Hamas' harshest threats in months. In Gaza City, Hamas
founder Ahmed Yassin convened the group's leadership, and a
spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar, said Israel would ``pay a high price.''

Report: bin Laden placed under house arrest by Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused
of masterminding the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, has been placed under house arrest in Afghanistan by his
Taliban hosts, a London-based Arabic newspaper said.
	   Bin Laden is being held in a house in the Kandahar region of
southern Afghanistan, Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported Friday.
	   The Taliban religious army has ``prevented any contacts between
him and his followers, and have prohibited'' access to the media,
the newspaper said, citing sources close to bin Laden.
	   There was no immediate way to confirm the report. But it comes
less than a week after a ranking Taliban official said that bin
Laden could stay in Afghanistan as long as he wants, even if his
presence invites another barrage of U.S. missiles.
	   The United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles into
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings, which killed 258 people and wounded thousands.
	   In Afghanistan, two alleged terrorist training camps were hit in
the Aug. 20 attack, including one believed to have been operated by
bin Laden. He was not harmed.
	   Al-Quds Al-Arabi said the Taliban, fearful of the repercussions
of bin Laden's growing notoriety, put him under house arrest to
prevent him from making contact with international media.
	   The Taliban controls 90 percent of Afghanistan and has alienated
many with its strict interpretation of Islam. But it has said it
does not share bin Laden's hatred of the United States and will not
interfere in the affairs of other countries.
	   In the past, the Taliban has said bin Laden promised not to be
involved ``with international terrorism from Afghanistan.''

Troops still deployed in Indonesian capital after days of protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with looting in 12th-13th grafs; minor edit to delete
outdated material. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Some lounging under trees, their
automatic weapons stacked in neat piles, hundreds of troops
remained deployed in the Indonesian capital Saturday following days
of rowdy protests against the president.
	   With heavy security in place, central Jakarta was quiet.
	   Dozens of troops were stationed at the state palace complex,
which houses the offices of President B.J. Habibie and other senior
government officials. Squads of soldiers were also stationed in
adjacent Merdeka (Freedom) Square.
	   Their deployment follows a series of student marches and protest
rallies against Habibie as the nation grapples with its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. Student activists are demanding
Habibie lower soaring food prices or resign.
	   Similar protests against Habibie's autocratic predecessor
President Suharto took place before riots erupted in May.
	   Suharto ended 32 years in power and quit after about 1,200
people died in the violence.
	   On Friday, armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto restated his
loyalty to Habibie by warning that his troops would take ``stern
action'' against disruptive protests.
	   He said the military would not allow the interests of 202
million Indonesians or the economy's chances of recovery to be
endangered.
	   Wiranto said he had been told that some protesters have been
paid by unidentified groups to demonstrate against the government.
	   Acknowledging growing anger over soaring inflation, the
government Friday announced new measures to bring down the price of
rice and to help feed millions of poor families.
	   The rice price has trebled over the past year, drawing
discontent with Habibie's crisis-bound presidency. Looting and
riots have hit several areas in recent weeks.
	   About 500 villagers looted rice from a storehouse owned by a
Chinese businessman near East Java town of Malang, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta, Friday.
	   The mob then put the remaining 70 tons outside and burned them
along with the storehouse. Also Friday, about 1,500 people looted
an onion field stretching three provinces in Java.
	   On Wednesday, a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 student demonstrators and
opposition supporters clashed with security forces.
	   The following day, about 700 students staged a noisy rally
outside the palace in Jakarta.

Thorpe just misses world mark while Australian cyclist Sweet wins

first gold &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thorpe just missing record, two more Commonwealth
marks go, Kenyan boxers fail to show &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ian Thorpe missed a 9-year-old
world record by .01 of a second Saturday as the 15-year-old
Australian swimmer romped to a Commonwealth Games triumph in the
200 meters freestyle.
	   With not even world champion Michael Klim within a bodylength
and Olympic titlist Danyon Loader of New Zealand struggling back in
fourth, Thorpe went within a fingernail of beating the 1 minute
46.69 of Italy's Georgio Lamberti set in 1989 _ the oldest world
record in men's swimming.
	   The world 400-meter champion touched in 1:46.70 to easily win
the title with Klim second, 1.35 behind and 1,500-meter world
champion Dan Kowalski third for an Aussie sweep.
	   ``It was very close, wasn't it _ I can't believe I got that
close,'' said Thorpe. ``I didn't know what pace I was on, I was
hoping but you really don't know until you hit the wall, turn
around and look at the scoreboard.''
	   Thorpe's amazing swim came on the day that England's Susan Rolph
twice beat the Commonwealth record in the women's 100 freestyle and
Australian cyclist Jay Sweet won the Games first medal with host
Malaysia taking a surprise silver.
	   Rolph stunned herself with a Commonwealth record in the heats
and then broke it again by almost half a second.
	   The English swimmer clocked 55.65 in the heat and followed it up
with 55.17 in the final to beat Australia's Susan O'Neill and
Rebecca Creedy.
	   The Australian women's relay team of Julia Greville, O'Neill,
Ann Windsor and Lori Munz produced the third Commonwealth record
performance of the night, clocking 8:03.73 for the 4x200 freestyle.
	   Canada, Australia's other big rival in the pool, scored a 1-2 in
the women's 400 individual medley through Joanne Malar and
Elizabeth Warden with Australians third, fourth and fifth.
	   In the men's 100 breaststroke, defending titlist Australian Phil
Rogers was beaten by countryman Simon Cowley, who clocked 1:02.00.
	   After a grueling 184-kilometer road race around Kuala Lumpur in
30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) heat, Sweet made his move barely
100 meters from the finish line.
	   Breaking out of a leading group of five, the Australian pulled
away to beat Malaysia's Effandy Rosli by two cycle lengths and win
in 4 hours 31 minutes 57 seconds.
	   Effandy was mobbed at the finish line after gaining his
country's first ever Commonwealth cycling medal and Canada's Eric
Wohlberg took the bronze.
	   Gymnastics was another sport to start Saturday with the men's
team title being decided in the Putra stadium.
	   Athletics events at the 100,000-capacity National stadium at
Bukat Jalil don't start until Wednesday and there was a boost for
the fans when Trinidad's team manager, Ken Doldron, gave an
assurance that sprint star Ato Boldon would compete.
	   The withdrawal of Canada's world and Olympic titlist Donovan
Bailey and Namibia's sprint star Frankie Fredericks had dismayed
organizers and Boldon, who has run 9.86 this year, had indicated he
might not run either.
	   ``I urge everyone not to worry,'' Doldron told readers of
Malaysia's Daily Star Saturday amid fears that the sprint star
might also skip the Games.
	   ``He will be here to win the 100m gold with a new world record.
He will be in Kuala Lumpur by tomorrow night.''
	   Two Kenyan boxers failed to make it to the ring on the opening
day of action at the at the Malawati Stadium.
	   Bidding to improve on the two golds they won four years ago at
Victoria, British Colombia, the Kenyans sent 10 newcomers to the
Games but had a disastrous start.
	   Nicholas Oyugi pulled out of his bantamweight fight with
Scotland's Craig Docherty who was told the Kenyan suffered an ankle
injury during training.
	   Bernard Njoroge was scheduled to meet Australia's Erle Wiltshire
in a first round flyweight contest and the Australian team also
heard the problem was an ankle injury.
	   But boxing officials at the Malawati Stadium told the Malaysian
news agency, Bernama, that the two Kenyans failed to make the
weight.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was
investigating on Saturday how one of its planes strayed 45 miles
(70 kilometers) off course, causing two other aircraft to take
evasive action after their electronic sensors warned of a possible
collision.
	   The two planes, a British Airways Boeing 767 and a Swissair
McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, changed course to avoid the possibility of
colliding with a KLM MD-11 bound from the Dutch Antilles to
Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. All three planes landed safely and
there were no reports of injuries.
	   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said it was too early to say what
had caused flight KL0752 to stray off course. On Friday, KLM said
the aircraft's instruments apparently gave a false positional
reading to the pilot and crew.

Melbourne, Adelaide advance to AFL semifinals

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Peter Vardy kicked six goals
Saturday night as defending champions Adelaide booked an Australian
Football League semifinal playoff spot with a 27-point win over the
Sydney Swans.
	   Vardy's performance helped Adelaide to a 14.10 (94) to 10.7 (67)
Australian Rules win and a semifinal next Saturday against the
Western Bulldogs.
	   Earlier Saturday, Melbourne moved into the semifinals after
thumping St. Kilda at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by 51 points.
After trailing at quarter-time, Melbourne went on an eight-goal
unanswered run during the second and third terms to set up its
15.17 (107) to 7.14 (56) win before more than 88,000 spectators.
	   The Demons, who finished last in 1997, will meet North Melbourne
in the other semifinal on Friday with the winners of each semifinal
advancing to the grand final on Sept. 26.
	   Vardy kicked three goals in the space of five minutes to stretch
the Crows lead to an unassailable 32 points 21 minutes into the
third quarter.
	   Tony Lockett lifted the Swans early in the last quarter when he
kicked his only goal from the boundary line in the second minute
and set up Troy Luff two minutes later to close the gap to 19
points.
	   Adelaide restricted Sydney to a goal in each of the second and
third quarters while kicking six goals as it adapted to slippery
conditions caused by a pre-game downpour.
	   Melbourne's Jeff Farmer was responsible for his team's burst
when he kick-started the eight-goal run. The forward pocket kicked
three consecutive goals to drag Melbourne from 14 points down to
take the lead.
	   Melbourne coach Neale Daniher said the win was a major character
test for his team.
	   ``It might have been nerves or a case of the yips at the start
but the most important thing was when it was one goal to four our
nerves were rock solid,'' he said.
	   ``If we hadn't regrouped at that stage our season could have
been over.'' (djp)

Bosnia's second post-war national election crucial to peace plan

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second national
election since the end of its devastating war began Saturday,
pitting hard-line candidates who promote ethnicity against more
moderate ethnic leaders favored by Western powers.
	   Technical glitches caused dozens of polling stations to open
late, but the early turnout was steady and international officials
said it could reach 80 percent by the time polls close Sunday.
	   The two-day election is considered crucial for the future of the
1995 Dayton peace plan that halted the 3 1-2 year war in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia was divided into two
ethnic-based entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat
federation _ with the goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the
one-time communist territory.
	   But progress has been slow due to the lingering hatreds and
mistrust between the three ethnic groups that fought the war. An
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot return to their
homes in areas controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   The election ``will be I'm sure a step forward toward
normalization and democratization of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, the European high representative overseeing the
country.
	   A computer problem caused 107 of the 2,627 polling stations to
open late due to missing voters' lists, said Robert Barry, top
official in Bosnia of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which is running the vote. He said most of the 107 were
operating by midday, and those that opened late would remain open
past Saturday's 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) closing time if needed.
	   The delay caused angry crowds to gather in a few places, but
they all dispersed when the reason for the problem was explained,
Barry said. He predicted a turnout of 70 to 80 percent, based on
early indications.
	   At the bus station in Sarajevo, the capital, Muslims expelled
from their villages by Bosnian Serbs during the war prepared to
travel home to vote.
	   Any other time, hard-line Serb officials prevent refugees from
even visiting, but the threat of severe penalties for such
harassment during an election creates an opening for a quick trip.
	   ``Every year, but only for elections, we get to see our homes,''
said Hilmo Dzaferovic, 60, who was going to Medjedja, now in the
Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Western allies led by the United States and European Union, who
run the country now under the Dayton plan, hope ethnic-driven
political parties that waged the war lose support this weekend and
fade away.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong among Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Croats, and the outcome of major races involving
their candidates were uncertain.
	   A total of 83 candidates, parties and coalitions are listed on
the complicated ballots, with voters only choosing leaders in the
entity in which they registered. More than 2.7 million of Bosnia's
4.3 million people are registered.
	   Individual candidates are running for the three spots on the
joint presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while
parties compete for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also will choose a republic president.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   After the vote, Western powers hope to push harder for elected
officials to fully implement Dayton's provisions, such as allowing
refugees to move back to their homes. Hard-line leaders, especially
in the Bosnian Serb republic, oppose that because it will erode
their ethnic-based support.
	   Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic, one of the nation's
three-member presidency under the Dayton accord setup, was expected
to easily win re-election to the panel.
	   The races for the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat members of the
presidency looked much tighter, with the results certain to
influence how much further progress is made in adopting the Dayton
requirements.
	   International officials complain the Bosnian Serb member of the
presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, has obstructed efforts to implement
the peace plan and openly oppose his re-election.

Son backs Suharto's denial on foreign bank accounts

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Alatas' remark in final two grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A billionaire son of the former
President Suharto has supported his father's denial of allegations
that he has stashed a fortune overseas, Indonesian media reports
said Saturday.
	   Bambang Trihatmodjo, Suharto's second son, challenged critics to
back up their claims with hard evidence.
	   ``Accusations are meaningless unless you prove it,'' Bambang was
quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.
	   Bambang, who used to head one of the country's biggest business
conglomerates, is now under scrutiny over the alleged misuse of
loans made to an insolvent bank that he part-owned.
	   Suharto, 77, denied last week that he held big bank accounts
overseas. He also challenged critics to prove their claims.
	   ``My father has said that there is nothing. But if they keep
claiming there is, they have to prove it and look for it abroad,''
Bambang said.
	   Indonesia's attorney general is investigating claims of
corruption during Suharto's reign.
	   Suharto quit in May following a wave of riots and students
protests over his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said he was ready to try to track
down any dubious accounts allegedly held by the former leader, if
there is such a request from the government.
	   ``That is our obligation,'' he said.

Iran-Taliban differences come to a head over slain diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Divided by separate visions
of their Islamic faith as well as by their politics, Iran and
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have arrived at a perilous standoff
over nine dead diplomats.
	   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's former president and still a
political force, promised the nation that Tehran would avenge the
death of the Iranians after the Taliban admitted that its troops
killed the diplomats.
	   ``I offer condolences to the martyrs' families and promise them
that we will get revenge for their blood,'' Rafsanjani said in a
sermon during Friday prayers at Tehran University.
	   The warnings raised fears of a military conflict, since Iran has
kept 70,000 troops along with fighter-bombers and tanks on its
border with Afghanistan after holding military exercises early this
month in the region.
	   On Saturday, Iran said it would renew military exercises along
its eastern border, and the Tehran Times carried an editorial
demanding that the Taliban be punished. ``When all peaceful means
fail, it is but lawful to resort to force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Tensions had been building between Iran and the Taliban long
before the death of the diplomats, both on political and religious
grounds.
	   Iran sees the fighting between the Taliban and other Afghan
factions as a source of instability on its border. It has tried to
arrange a peace, but the Taliban have twice refused to attend
Iranian-sponsored conferences between the warring factions.
	   The Taliban's brand of militant Islam _ halting women's
education and lashing men who shave their bears _ also comes at a
time when Iran is seeking to emphasize that Islam is a religion
respectful of human rights.
	   Iran, which is still suffering from the social and economic
effects of its devastating 1980-88 war with Iraq, has no appetite
for another fight.
	   But the Taliban admission Friday that its fighters killed the
nine diplomats, an admission that came after a month of denying any
knowledge of their fate, was bound to bring a strong reaction.
	   Public feeling has been running high since 11 Iranian diplomats
went missing when the Taliban overran Mazar-e-Sharif, the
opposition stronghold in northern Afghanistan, on Aug. 8. Iran says
the two other diplomats escaped but their whereabouts remain
unknown.
	   Differences between Iran and the Taliban go back to before the
radical militia rolled into the Afghan capital, Kabul, in September
1996. Iran had aided the opposition, seeing it as a key to Iranian
influence in the neighboring state.
	   The Taliban accuses Iran of continuing to arm the opposition.
The radical militia itself is widely believed to be armed and aided
by Pakistan, the major powerbroker in Afghanistan and Iran's rival
for influence.
	   A shared faith should bind Iran and the Taliban, but their
separate visions of Islam have almost nothing in common.
	   Iran is overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim, while the Taliban imposes
a fervently orthodox version of the mainstream Sunni sect. Human
rights groups have accused the Taliban of killing hundreds of the
Afghan Shiite minority after it seized Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Iran says the Taliban's obsession with the length of beards and
how a thief's hand should be severed is barbaric. It has slammed
the Taliban for barring women from work and school. Iranian women
have the right to vote, to work and to hold seats in Parliament.
	   ``What is being done in our neighborhood in the name of Islam by
a bunch unaware of this religion is neither connected to Islam nor
accepted by its principles,'' Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, said recently in his criticism of the Taliban.
	   There are ironies in the standoff.
	   Shortly after its 1979 revolution, Iran's own obsession with
Islam led to a brief ban on music, chess and playing cards. Even
today, satellite dish antennas are banned, and women cannot sing in
the presence of a male audience.
	   Although Iran is incensed at the storming of its mission in
Mazar-e-Sharif by the Taliban, 20 years ago its own militants
stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.

Michael Schumacher captures pole position for Italian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes, ADDS byline, CORRECTS Irvine's
position to fifth &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Michael Schumacher captured his first pole
position of the year on Saturday as he led qualifying for the
Italian Grand Prix ahead of defending world champion Jacques
Villeneuve.
	   World championship leader Mika Hakkinen and his McLaren-Mercedes
teammate David Coulthard suffered a rare qualifying setback as they
finished third and fourth respectively.
	   The McLaren drivers, who together had captured 12 of the
previous 13 poles, will both start from the second row for the
first time this year.
	   Schumacher, who trails Hakkinen by seven points in the world
standings with three championship races left, turned the fastest
lap on the 5.77-kilometer (3.585-mile) Monza circuit in one minute,
25.289 seconds, or 243.548 kmph (150.999 mph).
	   ``It was time for us to have our first pole position,'' said
Schumacher, whose previous pole dated back to the Grand Prix of
Hungary on Aug. 9 last year.
	   ``I'm happy it came at Monza,'' he added, after jumping on the
pits wall and raising his arms in triumph to answer frantic
applause by thousands of Ferrari fans.
	   The Monza circuit is considered the home track of the Italian
team, along with the Imola circuit which hosts the San Marino GP.
	   Schumacher last won the Italian GP in 1996. Coulthard took the
race last year.
	   Schumacher, a two-time world champion, kept cold blooded as he
waited for the track to dry up from morning showers and clinched
the pole with two minutes left in the one-hour session.
	   ``We took the safe decision as we kept waiting and waiting for
the track to dry up, so as to avoid wet spots,'' Schumacher
explained. ``It's a great result and a great position for the race.
We will be there (for victory) tomorrow.''
	   Most drivers roared off the pits in the last 25 minutes of
qualifying to take advantage of better track condition. But
resulting traffic hampered some attempts of fast turns.
	   ``Traffic slowed me down but I'm still in a good position for
the race,'' said Hakkinen, who enters Sunday's race with a record
of six GP wins and 8 pole positions this year.
	   He leads his German rival and top title contender 77 to 70
points.
	   Schumacher delighted an overwhelming majority of Ferrari
supporters as he edged Villeneuve by 0.27 seconds and Hakkinen by
0.39 seconds.
	   Coulthard, who had been involved in a controversial collision
with Schumacher in the Grand Prix of Belgium last month, had a gap
of 0.69 seconds.
	   Villeneuve, who earned his first season start from the front row
in a Williams-Mecachrome, said he could have done even better
without a mistake on his last lap.
	   ``I hope of dry conditions tomorrow, as it would make the race
easier,'' the Canadian driver said.
	   Eddie Irvine, Ferrari's No.2 driver and the fastest driver in
Friday's free practice, trailed the teammate by 0.87 seconds in
fifth place.
	   Other top qualifiers included Ralf Schumacher, Michael's younger
brother, sixth, ahead of Alexander Wurz and Jean Alesi.

U.S. government asks Czechs to allow broadcast to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The United States has formally
asked the Czech government to allow a U.S.-funded radio station to
broadcast to Iraq from its territory, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Jocelyn Greene in Prague as saying the request was handed to the
Czech Foreign Ministry on Friday.
	   The embassy was closed Saturday and officials could not be
reached.
	   Last month, the Czech Republic's Social Democratic government
agreed to allow Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to
Iran, but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   It said an approval to the broadcast would be considered only if
the U.S. government made an official request.
	   The U.S. government-funded radio station, which operates out of
Prague, intends to start its broadcasts by the end of September.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Ales Pospisil told Mlada Fronta Dnes
that ministry officials met with U.S. Embassy representatives on
Friday, but refused to give any details on the meeting.
	   Following a letter sent to him on Tuesday by U.S. Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, the New York Republican who chairs the House
International Relations Committee, President Vaclav Havel also
stepped in, trying to persuade his Cabinet to drop objections
against the broadcast.
	   It was not immediately clear if and when the government would
debate the U.S. request. But Foreign Minister Jan Kavan announced a
news conference on the issue for Monday.

NATO kicks off 26-nation military exercise in Macedonia

<TEXT>
	   KRIVOLAK, Macedonia (AP) _ With a pretty parachute jump and a
powerful air force fly-by, NATO and its partner countries launched
a 26-nation military exercise Saturday, practicing peacekeeping in
the Balkans.
	   The show of allied and partner military capabilities has nothing
to do with the situation in Kosovo, the restive southern Yugoslav
province struggling for independence. At least that's the official
line from Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, on
down.
	   ``The whole world is watching the situation in Kosovo, and it's
inevitable that conclusions will be drawn on an exercise like
this,'' Clark told reporters after an opening demonstration by
freefall parachutists, fighter and transport craft from several
nations, and an American hostage rescue simulation.
	   Clark, an American four-star general, acknowledged NATO plans
for military intervention in and around Kosovo should the
politicians decide to do so. But he was quick to add: ``There is no
connection between this exercise and any specific NATO plan.''
	   No matter that NATO foreign ministers in June announced
exercises in Albania and Macedonia as part of their response to the
aggressive tactics of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who
was harshly putting down an uprising by ethnic Albanians, who make
up a majority in Kosovo.
	   The practical side is to train the armed forces of the
participating nations in the specific kinds of problems they would
face on the ground in a peacekeeping operation: dealing with
roadblocks, escorting convoys, searching a building, checkpoint
procedures, identifying and marking unexploded ordnance, medical
evacuation.
	   This goes right down to the squad level, groupings of about 10
men who face this sort of situation daily in places like Bosnia,
where 30 nations are working together to enforce the 1995 Dayton
peace agreement.
	   It also teaches the forces of different nations to work together
and shares their various experiences.
	   NATO attaches great importance to the Partnership for Peace
Program, launched at the 1994 summit in Brussels. The program, open
to virtually all non-NATO members, allows countries to benefit from
cooperation with the alliance.
	   ``It will strengthen NATO's capacity when we are called in to
conduct peacekeeping,'' said Clark.
	   There are 13 NATO nations participating and 13 non-member
partner countries such as Azerbaijan, Latvia, Moldova, Ukraine and
Macedonia.
	   ``This will be our contribution toward the peace and stability
of the region,'' said Macedonia's prime minister, Branko
Crvenkovski, as British Harrier jets, Greek and Turkish F-16s,
Canadian F-18s and Dutch and American C-130 aircraft roared
overhead.
	   Americans from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit put on a
demonstration of rapidly inserting forces to evacuate diplomatic
personnel, sweeping in with Cobra attack helicopters to clear the
area, landing four transport choppers full of Marines, loading the
rescuees onto CH-53s and rushing them out, then withdrawing the
Marines, all in a matter of minutes.
	   Participating are about 500 troops from Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway Portugal, Spain,
Turkey, Britain, the United States, Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan,
Bulgaria, Estonia, Macedonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Moldova,
Poland, Romania and Ukraine.

Spanish superteams turn in less-thank-sparkling league victories

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Defending champion FC Barcelona beat
division newcomer Extremadura 1-0 on Saturday, notching up its
first Spanish league win of the season in the second round of the
domestic season.
	   But the 23rd minute goal from Portugal's Luis Figo was hardly
the pounding Extremadura might have expected at Barcelona's Camp
Nou stadium.
	   Barcelona took to the field boasting new signing Patrick
Kluivert of Holland, but its star-studded lineup that included just
two Spanish players failed to sparkle.
	   The visiting team was even close to a last minute equalizer but
Jose Luis Soto muffed a gift shot at an open goal.
	   Spain's other superteam Real Madrid also secured a 1-0 victory
away to Valladolid on the basis of a ninth minute goal from
Yugoslav Pedrag Mijatovic.
	   This was the European Champions first away win in the domestic
league for 13 matches, a dubious record that helped drop the club
to a disappointing No.4 in last season's Spanish table.
	   But the rut-breaking win and maximum points from the season so
far was scant compensation for Brazil's Roberto Carlos da Silva,
visibly upset by being sent off in the 88th minute and banned from
next week's match against arch-rival Barcelona.
	   Fellow countryman Osvaldo Giroldo Juninho was far happier at the
end of his game for Atletico de Madrid at home against Salamanca.
	   Within three minutes of coming on after the break with the score
at 0-0, Juninho had provoked a penalty that was successfully
converted by new signing Vladimir Jugovic of Yugoslavia.
	   Five minutes later Francisco Narvaez ''Kiko,'' scored the second
and last goal of the match from a Juninho pass.
	   Also Saturday Athletic de Bilbao trounced Racing de Santander by
2-0 before a home crowd still relishing last season's No.2 spot in
the final ranking.
	   Andoni Imaz headed in the first in the 17th minute and Ismael
made it 2-0 just before the break.
	   Among the faces enjoying the match was Javier Clemente, watching
his club play for the first time since being hounded out of his job
as Spain's national coach last week.
	   In other matches Saturday Deportivo beat Valencia 1-0, and
villarreal drew 1-1 against Celta.
	   Two late games pitting Tenerife against Real Sociedad and Betis
against Zaragoza were due to finish at 21.45GMT.
 &UR; Deportivo de la Coruna 1, Valencia 0 &QC; 
	   Deportivo's three points for victory came from a fourth minute
goal netted by Argentine Gabriel Francisco Schurrer.
	   Brazil's Djalma Feltosa ``Djalminha'' fluffed a penalty
conversion in the 65th minute, his shot stopped with relative ease
by Santiago Canizares. Villarreal 1, Celta 1 &QC; 
	   Division newcomer Villarreal went one up in the 10th minute with
a goal from Rumanian George Craioveanu, but Celta's Ludo Penev of
Bulgaria equalized in the 32nd.
	   In the remaining second round matches due Sunday, Oviedo
welcomes division newcomer Alaves, while Mallorca hosts Espanyol.

Top Albanian deputy killed by gunmen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A leading Albanian opposition lawmaker
was assassinated by unidentified gunmen Saturday night as he
emerged from his party's headquarters, police said.
	   Azem Hajdari, a prominent Democratic Party deputy who was shot
and badly wounded by a rival legislator in Parliament last year,
was hit by gunmen in two cars parked next to the party building in
the Albanian capital Tirana, police said. He died in a hospital
shortly after the 9:30 p.m. shooting.
	   One of Hajdari's two bodyguards who were with him at the time
also was killed, police said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   The shooting was likely to inflame tensions in already-unstable
Albania, where the Democratic Party of former President Sali
Berisha has tried to organize mass resistance against the Socialist
Party government that took power from it last year.
	   After Hajdari was shot on Sept. 18, 1997, the Democratic Party
ordered days of protests against Prime Minister Fatos Nano and his
Socialist-led government, accusing it of masterminding the attack.
	   Socialist deputy Gafur Mazreku, who shot Hadjari two days after
the two had a fistfight during a tense legislative session, was
convicted of attempting to assassinate a high-ranking public
official and given an 11-year sentence for the shooting.
	   The Democratic Party has threatened to use force against the
Socialist government, which it accuses of corruption and
incompetence. Its protests have increased since last month's
arrests of six opposition politicians in connection with nationwide
riots which erupted last year after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Some victims of this week's flooding
remain in danger, still trapped on islands surrounded by torrents
fed by a week of rain, authorities said Saturday.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo made a helicopter tour of the damaged
areas on the Pacific coast of southern Chiapas state, where more
than 100 people died, 20,000 were forced from their homes and
600,000 residents were cut off by downed bridges and washed-out
highways.
	   Zedillo was surrounded by weeping women in the mountain town of
Motozintla, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of Tapachula,
where a local official said 12 people died and 18 are missing.
	   ``Don't lose hope,'' he told the victims. ``After many days of
national disaster, the first signs of help are getting through,''
he said.
	   Before breaking into tears, Motozintla resident Flavio Vasquez
told Zedillo that ``my two children and wife are buried. Our house
collapsed. They have not found them.''

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The cockpit voice recorder for
Swissair Flight 111 survived a violent crash into the Atlantic and
eight days under water, giving investigators 30 minutes of good
quality tape to analyze what happened to the jet, investigators
said Saturday.
	   In Ottawa, investigators said the voices were clear. But they
declined to give any details at this point about the content of the
recording.
	   They also declined to say whether the recorder stopped six
minutes before the crash, as was the case with the flight data
recorder. Both recorders ran on the same power source.
	   ``All I can say at this time is we do have good voices on the
recorder and there is a lot of sound and conversation taking place
and we have a lot to work with,'' said John Maxwell, director of
air investigations for Canada's transportation safety board.
	   Although investigators already had a tape of the conversation
between the pilots and air traffic controllers, the cockpit voice
recorder would have captured additional talk between the two pilots
as well as any irregular noises.
	   The Geneva-bound MD-11, which originated in New York, lost
contact with air traffic controllers six minutes before plummeting
into the waters off the fishing village Peggy's Cove, killing all
229 aboard.
	   Having the last six minutes of conversation between the two
pilots would certainly help investigators, Maxwell said. But the
problems with the jet would have started well before those final
minutes, leaving it up for debate which would be better to have:
the very end of the tape, or the very beginning.
	   Cockpit voice recorders run on a continuous 30-minute cycle,
taping the most recent half hour of talk and sound.
	   ``We've seen many reports suggesting we're in somewhat desperate
straits if we don't have the last six minutes, and that's certainly
not the case,'' Maxwell said. ``When you've only got 30 minutes of
cockpit voice recorder, it can become a bit of a debating point as
to which is the best 30 minutes to have.''
	   Maxwell said it could take weeks before engineers decipher all
of the sounds and words on the recording. Under Canadian law, the
full transcript will not be released to protect the privacy of the
pilots.
	   The cockpit voice recorder was pulled from the Atlantic on
Friday evening, near the spot where the other so-called ``black
box'' was found five days earlier.
	   The voice recorder could help investigators gain an insight into
what problems the pilots were facing, how they reacted and what
remedies they tried.
	   It also will help make sense of the flight data recording,
``which at this moment is rather confusing,'' Maxwell said.
	   The data recorder, which monitors about 250 different pieces of
data from the jet, appeared to be working normally until the pilots
radioed distress. After that, the recorder shows a rapid increase
in mechanical irregularities, Maxwell said.
	   Maxwell also said Saturday that investigators were going over
maintenance records from the jet, but he did not discuss any
details or possible conclusions.
	   Earlier Saturday, the medical examiner identified another
victim, bringing the total of those identified to just five of the
229 who died 10 days ago.
	   Two other victims of the Sept. 2 crash off Halifax, Nova Scotia,
were tentatively identified, the medical examiner's office said.
	   The flight crashed with such force that only one victim has been
positively identified visually by relatives. Three victims were
identified using dental records, and another victim was identified
through fingerprints.
	   With the two recorders recovered, divers could focus on what
they have said all along was their top priority: retrieving the
remains of victims. Military helicopters were continuing to fly
along the rocky seacoast Saturday, searching for body parts as well
as for wreckage of the jet.
	   A U.S. Navy salvage ship was preparing to hoist larger pieces of
the jet to the surface over the next few days.
	   Also Saturday, investigators said they opened up some waters
that had been closed to fishing since the accident. But waters
nearest to the site of the crash were still closed to the public.

Davenport loses cap, but not cool, in win over Hingis

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport lost her cap, not her cool,
and the U.S. Open crowned its first American-born women's champion
since 1982.
	   Davenport, playing in her first Grand Slam final, slammed
forehand and backhand winners down the lines and won 12 of the last
15 points in a 6-3, 7-5 win Saturday over Martina Hingis, who lost
her touch as she lost her title.
	   Davenport, who did not lose a set in the seven rounds of the
tournament, won a dlrs 700,000 prize on her mother Anne's birthday.
	   In the men's semifinals, unseeded Mark Philippoussis had 21 aces
in a 6-1, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory over No. 10 Carlos Moya and
advanced to Sunday's final against the winner of a match between
defending champion Patrick Rafter and top-seeded Pete Sampras.
Sampras is aiming for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam singles title.
	   Philippoussis won 85 percent of his first-serve points, hitting
some serves as fast as 130 mph (209 kph). His second serves were as
fast as 120 mph (193 kph).
	   Philippoussis, who will be playing in his first Grand Slam
final, finally appears to be living up to the potential he showed
when he made headlines in 1996 by upsetting Sampras in the third
round of the Australian Open.
	   Davenport is the first American-born woman to win the singles
championship since Chris Evert won the last of her six titles in
1982. Martina Navratilova, a native of Czechoslovakia, won the
title as a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983-84 and 1986-87.
	   ``I knew I was playing well. I knew I needed to take advantage
of this opportunity,'' Davenport said. ``You don't know how many
chances you get to get back there.''
	   Hingis, 17, who retains her No. 1 world ranking despite the
loss, was trying to become the youngest woman to retain a U.S. Open
title. She had won her previous three Grand Slam finals.
	   This is the first year since 1990 that four different women have
won the Grand Slam singles titles _ Hingis won the Australian Open,
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario won the French Open and Jana Novotna won at
Wimbledon.
	   On a sun-drenched day, Davenport got an early service break for
a 2-1 lead in the first set by dictating play with sharp volleys
and passing shots. Hingis was hampered by the wildness that
bothered her throughout the tournament.
	   In the seventh game, at deuce, Davenport got a break when the
wind knocked off her white baseball cap as she hit the ball into
the net on a tough volley. Umpire Dessie Samuels ordered a let and
Davenport won the replay to move to break point.
	   Hingis looked on in dismay, then lost the next point to give
Davenport another service break for a 5-2 lead. When she came back
from the changeover, Davenport had secured her cap with bobby pins.
	   Tennis rules state that a let is called and the point replayed
the first time a cap flies off, or a ball falls out of a player's
pocket. The second incident leads to a warning, and the third time
results in a lost point.
	   ``I don't like this rule, it's unfair for the players like me,''
Hingis said. ``I had that point won, it's her fault if the hat
falls down, it's not my mistake. It's a stupid rule. I had a chance
to make that point.''
	   Hingis, who complained about several line calls during the
match, said it was ``pretty ridiculous'' that Samuels, from
Terrell, Texas, was the umpire for a U.S. Open final involving an
American player.
	   Davenport, who moved past Novotna to No. 2 in the world
rankings, wrapped up the first set in 37 minutes with a backhand on
the line.
	   Hingis seemed frustrated at times during the second set,
dropping her racket on the court after losing one point and
screaming at herself after another.
	   Davenport broke for a 4-2 lead but Hingis broke right back and
again for a 5-4 lead. But Davenport regained control, breaking back
as Hingis ended the 10th game with a double fault and shook her
head in dismay.
	   Davenport, whose mobility vastly improved after she lost 30
pounds (13.61 kilos) in the last year, held serve in the next game
and finished off the match with another service break _ hitting a
backhand volley for a winner on match point.
	   The champion put her hands on her head in disbelief, then looked
lovingly at her racket before smiling at her mom.
	   ``It's just a great story. She's the one that used to drive me
hours and hours and hours to go practice, since I was 6 when I
started playing tennis,'' Davenport said.
	   Davenport will face Hingis again Sunday in the women's doubles
final.

Ruling party gets even larger share in local elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LLOYD WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Election officials on Saturday said
Jamaica's ruling party won local government elections by an even
larger margin than originally reported, with 169 seats to 55 for
the main opposition.
	   The Electoral Office of Jamaica cautioned that the results from
Thursday's election were still not final, but the polls confirmed
the landslide victory for Prime Minister P.J. Patterson's People's
National Party.
	   ``We are the strongest party in the Caribbean and we stand ready
to lead Jamaica in the next millennium,'' Patterson said Saturday.
	   Party supporters celebrated Friday when it became clear they had
more than doubled the seats held by the Jamaica Labor Party.
	   Patterson's party now controls all 12 Parish Councils and the
strategically important Kingston and St. Andrew districts. It also
controls 50 of 60 seats in the House of Representatives. The Labor
Party lost its hold on St. Thomas Parish in southeastern Jamaica.
	   Ryan Peralto, the acting chairman of the Labor Party, predicted
the loss would cause a leadership shakeup at the party's annual
conference in November. The party has lost six general and local
elections since 1989.
	   The Labor Party has been dogged this year by internal disputes,
and leader Edward Seaga stepped down because of a disagreement over
whether to boycott the elections.
	   Peralto also said Patterson's party had a more effective
publicity campaign.
	   ``The PNP has mastered that art of communication by using the
powers and tools at their disposal to entrench their propaganda,
their policy and the type of mesmerizing atmosphere that attracts
people,'' Peralto said.
	   In a country where elections are usually hotly contested and
sometimes violent, officials said Friday's voter turnout of 33
percent was astonishingly low. Only 396,000 of 1.2 million
registered voters went to the polls.
	   ``PNP snoozes to victory,'' was the headline in the Jamaica
Daily Gleaner newspaper. The Daily Observer ran a picture of a
bored poll worker.
	   Some 236,000 voters, about 59.7 percent, chose the People's
National Party, the electoral office said Saturday. About 160,000,
or 40.3 percent, voted for the Labor Party.
	   Local Government Elections are scheduled for every three years,
but had not been held since 1990 because of electoral reforms,
introduction of anti-fraud systems and other changes.

Ganguly leads India to easy win in opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY COZIER

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO, Canada (AP) _ Saurav Ganguly led India to victory by
six wickets with 6.2 overs to spare in the opening match on
Saturday of the annual Sahara Cup series against Pakistan.
	   The ambidexterous Ganguly took three wickets for 33 with his
right-arm, medium-pace bowling as Pakistan struggled to 189 for
nine off their allocated 50 overs at the Toronto Cricket, Skating
and Curling Club ground.
	   He then stroked 54 with his fluent, left-handed batting, in
spite of a strained hamstring muscle that forced him twice to
retire, as India easily reached their target, ending 193 for four
off 43.4 overs.
	   The 26-year-old all-rounder from Calcutta was the obvious Man of
the Match, repeating an award he won four times in the five matches
in last year's series when he was also named Man of the Series.
	   Pakistan's innings never gathered any momentum after they were
sent in by India's captain Mohammed Azharuddin on winning the toss.
	   Opening batsman Shahid Afridi smashed his first ball out of the
ground for six but added only two more. After that, tight Indian
bowling, backed by sharp catching and fielding, pinned down the
Pakistanis.
	   Salim Malik, playing his 269th one-day international, topscored
with 41 off 74 balls with four fours.
	   Left-handers Saeed Anwar, with 35, and captain Aamer Sohail, 21,
added 52 for the second wicket. Once they were dismissed in
successive overs, India kept the pressure on throughout the
Pakistan innings.
	   Ganguly bowled his 10 overs in succession to put the brakes on
the scoring in mid-innings. Fast bowler Javagal Srinath tookl three
for 37 from his 10 overs.
	   Ganguly was 10 when he hobbled off the field the first time
after injuring his hamstring muscle. By the time he returned at the
fall of the first wicket, Navjot Singh Sidhu and captain Mohammed
Azharuddin had set India on their way to victory by carrying the
score to 91.
	   Azharuddin hit 28 and Sidhi 45 and, even though they were
dismissed in successive overs.
	   Three runs away from victory, Ganguly aggravated his injury and
again had to leave the field. The assignment was completed by Jalin
Paranjpe who remained unbeaten 23.
	   The second match in the five-match series was set for the same
venue on Sunday.

Philippoussis, Rafter set for U.S. Open final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sampras-Rafter match &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ History will have to wait. It's all Australia in
the U.S. Open men's final.
	   Defending champion Patrick Rafter, playing smart, aggressive
tennis, wore down a hobbled Pete Sampras and moved into the finals
of the U.S. Open with a 6-7, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 victory on Saturday.
	   It was the first time Sampras had lost a U.S. Open semifinal in
six tries.
	   That set up an all-Australian final Sunday, with Rafter facing
unseeded Mark Philippoussis, who defeated Carlos Moya 6-1, 6-4,
5-7, 6-4 in the other semifinal.
	   The last time two Australians played for the U.S. Open crown was
1970, when Ken Rosewall defeated Tony Roche, who is Rafter's coach.
	   Rafter, his pony tail dancing as he ripped shot after shot at
Sampras, wore the top-ranked man down and finished him off with a
backhand shot that whistled past the four-time Open champ.
	   The Australian had 55 winners and just 22 unforced errors in the
five sets. Sampras finished with 16 aces but the same number of
double faults.
	   Sampras, gunning for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam
championship, had revenge on his mind after losing to Rafter on a
disputed ace at match point in Cincinnati three weeks ago.
	   He complained bitterly at the call and was still angry after the
match, when he was asked the difference between himself and Rafter
and snapped: ``Ten Grand Slams.''
	   They looked much closer than that on Saturday, with Rafter,
encouraged by the win in their last meeting, keeping the pressure
on the world's No. 1 player. Rafter had said he was always
intimidated by Sampras before, but that was no where in evidence at
the Open.
	   Even after Sampras won the first set on a tiebreaker at 10-8,
Rafter stayed on top and gained the first break of the match in the
third game of the second set.
	   It wasn't until 1 hour, 43 minutes into the match that Sampras
finally got a break point in the fourth game of the third set. He
converted but shortly after that, he came up limping, favoring his
left leg after a backhand volley return.
	   Leading 5-2, he took an injury time out and had his upper left
thigh massaged and wrapped. He returned to finish out the set 6-2
but was favoring the leg.
	   Now Rafter came right after him, using service breaks at the
start of both the fourth and fifth sets to take control. Sampras
battled gamely but was hobbling on several points.
	   The final turning point came in the fifth set, when Rafter,
protecting the early break, came to the net and turned back three
straight pointblank shots by Sampras, who finally hit wide to
surrender the point.
	   ``I wasn't quite sure what was wrong with him,'' Rafter said.
``He kept serving big serves.''
	   Philippoussis came into the U.S. Open just another name on the
draw sheet, equipped with plenty of weapons and just as much
unfulfilled potential.
	   Now he's in the first Grand Slam final of his life and knows he
poses a real threat to win the championship.
	   ``I feel great,'' the 21-year-old Australian said after
defeating Moya. ``I feel no one can beat me. I feel unbeatable.''
	   That's what happens when a player who already owns one of the
most dominating serves in tennis, shows he can play a big-time net
game, as well.
	   It seemed appropriate that Philippoussis wound up at the net
after converting match point there against Moya. That's because as
much of an edge as his 130 mph (210 kph) serves gave him,
Philippoussis made many of his big points with a serve and volley
game.
	   ``If I can serve like I am and volley like I am, it'll be tough
to break me,'' he said. ``If I apply the pressure, I can win.''
	   Certainly, Moya agreed.
	   ``His serve was unbelievable,'' the French Open champion said..
``His lowest serve was like 100 miles, even the second serve. When
he's playing that way, it's really tough to beat him. His serve was
too good today.
	   ``Serving that way, I was not able to return. You can return one
or two but from 10 serves, he was putting seven in. So I had no
chance.''

Three-shot swing gives Friend lead at Canadian Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ Bob Friend took advantage of an easy
day for scoring and an 18th-hole mistake by Billy Andrade, shooting
a 4-under-par 68 on Saturday to take a two-stroke lead in the Bell
Canadian Open.
	   Playing like someone used to being in contention instead of a
34-year-old grinder looking for his first PGA Tour victory, Friend
birdied three of the last five holes to finish at 12-under 204
through three rounds.
	   Still, he needed some help from Andrade to regain the lead.
	   Andrade hit his drive into the bunker on the 508-yard
(465-meter) closing hole and had to play a low punch under a tree.
He had 158 yards (145 meters) to the hole, but caught his 9-iron
thin and grimaced as it caromed off the rocks and into the water.
	   ``It was the wrong shot at the wrong time,'' said Andrade, who
had to settle for a 3-under 69 for 206. ``Other than that, I played
a great round of golf.''
	   Friend chipped from the back rough to tap-in distance for a
birdie, a three-shot swing that sends him into the final round as
the outright leader for the first time in his three years on tour.
	   Hal Sutton, who could sneak into the top 30 on the money list
with a victory, shot a 67 and was alone in third at 207. Mike
Hulbert was another stroke back, while the group at 209 included
Glen Day, who shot a tournament-low 64 in still, soft conditions at
the Glen Abbey Golf Club.
	   ``I'm a lot better off than when the day started,'' Day said.
	   But he still has some catching up to do. Everyone else might be
in the same boat if Friend can stay relaxed for 18 more holes.
	   ``He played a great round. He's tough,'' said Andrade, a
two-time winner on tour but not since 1991.
	   The son of ex-Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Bob Friend had ample
opportunity to stumble Saturday, but he never strayed from his plan
of taking it one shot at a time and adding the strokes up at the
end of the day.
	   He made an eagle on No. 5 and stayed in front by holing a
40-foot (12-meter) par putt on No. 9. Friend was so impervious to
his surroundings that he didn't even realize what kind of run
Andrade made until he paused after the 15th hole to fill out
Andrade's scorecard.
	   Andrade birdied the 11th, hit a 6-iron to 4 feet (1 1/4 meters)
for birdie on the par-3 12th and then played a 5-iron off the ridge
to 4 feet (1 1/4 meters) for eagle on No. 13.
	   ``That was a nice stretch,'' Friend said.
	   It also gave Andrade a two-stroke lead, but Friend stayed right
on his heels by making a 25-footer (7 1/2 meters) for birdie on No.
14, the toughest hole at Glen Abbey.
	   ``My round kind of evolved,'' Friend said. ``I was just trying
to do the same thing I did the first two days, which worked out
pretty good.''
	   After two days of brittle conditions and wind gusts of 25 mph
(40 kph), the Abbey showed a different face in the third round.
Morning sprinkles, cloud cover and barely a breeze caused the
scoring average to drop by nearly two strokes. Of the 75 players
who made the cut, 47 broke par.
	   Joey Sindelar finished off his 65 that put him at 7-under 209,
looked back over the lifeless course where Andrade and Friend were
must making the turn, and realized he had a lot more work to do.
	   ``This is playing too easy,'' he said. ``You haven't seen
anything near the lead yet.''
	   Day's 64 featured a chip-in for eagle on No. 5, two birdie putts
over 25 feet (7 1/2 meters) and only 22 putts in all.
	   More tame conditions are in store for Sunday, which could turn
into a shootout. Still, only eight players are within six strokes
of the lead and none of them have experienced winning lately.
	   Andrade and Hulbert haven't won since 1991. Sindelar's last
victory was in 1990. Sutton, the 1983 PGA champion, last won in
1995 and it's been 10 years for Scott Verplank, who's at 210 with
Mike Small.
	   ``On any given Sunday, anything can happen,'' Andrade said.
``Guys you've never heard of can come out and win. Or the leader
can go out and tear it up.''
	   Friend wouldn't mind that scenario at all.

Davenport wins U.S. Open title on mother's birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rafter defeating Sampras; SHOULD STAND. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mom always was there, driving Lindsay Davenport
to tennis lessons and providing emotional support, even when others
scoffed at her daughter's ability.
	   And Ann Davenport was there Saturday, celebrating her birthday,
when Lindsay won the U.S. Open.
	   Playing in her first Grand Slam final, Davenport smashed
forehand and backhand winners down the lines and won 12 of the last
15 points in a 6-3, 7-5 victory over defending champion Martina
Hingis.
	   Davenport, the first American-born women's champion at the U.S.
Open since 1982, did not lose a set in the seven rounds of the
tournament, worth a dlrs 700,000 first prize.
	   ``I guess she thinks she's getting a really nice gift now,''
Davenport said as she accepted the check, breaking into a laugh as
she looked at her mom in the players' box.
	   After hitting a backhand volley winner on match point, the
champion put her hands on her head in disbelief, then looked
lovingly at her racket before smiling at her mom.
	   ``It's just a great story. She's the one that used to drive me
hours and hours and hours to go practice, since I was 6 when I
started playing tennis,'' Davenport said. ``I think I've had three
or four people in my career that have stuck with me the whole time
and believed in me since Day 1.''
	   A few hours after Davenport defeated the world's top women's
player, the men's No. 1 lost as well. Four-time champion Pete
Sampras, hobbled by a strained left quadriceps, was ousted 6-7
(8-10), 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 by defending champion Patrick Rafter in
the semifinals.
	   Sampras, aiming for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam singles
title, was hurt late in the third set and played the rest of the
three-hour match with bandages around his leg.
	   The third-seeded Rafter will face unseeded Mark Philippoussis in
an all-Australian final Sunday. Philippoussis had 21 aces in a 6-1,
6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory over No. 10 Carlos Moya.
	   Philippoussis won 85 percent of his first-serve points, hitting
some serves at 130 mph (210 kph). His second serves were as fast as
120 mph (193 kph).
	   Davenport is not the fastest player on the women's tour. Though
she's extremely powerful, she's not as athletic as players such as
Venus Williams, whom she defeated in the semifinals. And she's
never been surrounded by the hype attached to some of her peers.
	   Though she said capturing the U.S. Open always was her biggest
goal, Davenport said winning a Grand Slam title was not essential
to make her life complete.
	   ``I always said that if I never won one, I'd still be a great
person and I'd still like myself and I'd still keep on playing
tennis,'' she said. ``I feel like it's a great, great script. And I
think not a lot of people ever picked me to win a Grand Slam.''
	   Davenport is the first American-born woman to win the singles
championship since Chris Evert won the last of her six titles in
1982. Martina Navratilova, a native of Czechoslovakia, won the
title as a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983-84 and 1986-87.
	   Hingis, 17, who kept her No. 1 world ranking despite the loss,
was trying to become the youngest woman to retain a U.S. Open
title. She had won her previous three Grand Slam finals.
	   This is the first year since 1990 that four different women have
won the Grand Slam singles titles _ Hingis won the Australian Open,
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario won the French Open and Jana Novotna won at
Wimbledon.
	   On a sun-drenched day, Davenport got an early service break for
a 2-1 lead in the first set by dictating play with sharp volleys
and passing shots. Hingis was handcuffed by the wildness that
bothered her throughout the tournament.
	   In the seventh game, at deuce, Davenport got a break when the
wind knocked off her white baseball cap as she hit the ball into
the net on a tough volley. Umpire Dessie Samuels ordered a let and
Davenport won the replay to move to break point.
	   Hingis looked on in dismay, then lost the next point to give
Davenport another service break for a 5-2 lead. When she came back
from the changeover, Davenport had secured her cap with bobby pins.
	   Tennis rules state that a let is called and the point replayed
the first time a cap flies off, or a ball falls out of a player's
pocket. The second incident leads to a warning, and the third time
results in a lost point.
	   ``I don't like this rule, it's unfair for the players like me,''
Hingis said. ``I had that point won, it's her fault if the hat
falls down, it's not my mistake. It's a stupid rule. I had a chance
to make that point.''
	   Hingis, who complained about several line calls during the
match, said it was ``pretty ridiculous'' that Samuels, from
Terrell, Texas, was the umpire for a U.S. Open final involving an
American player.
	   Davenport, who moved past Novotna to No. 2 in the world
rankings, wrapped up the first set in 37 minutes with a backhand on
the line.
	   Hingis seemed frustrated at times during the second set,
dropping her racket on the court after losing one point and
screaming at herself after another.
	   Davenport broke for a 4-2 lead but Hingis broke right back and
again for a 5-4 lead. But Davenport regained control, breaking back
as Hingis ended the 10th game with a double fault and shook her
head in dismay.
	   Davenport, whose mobility vastly improved after she lost 30
pounds (14 kilos) in the last year, held serve in the next game and
finished off the match with another service break.
	   Davenport will face Hingis again Sunday in the women's doubles
final, and Hingis said she hopes her opponent celebrates the
singles title by partying Saturday night. Davenport said that's
likely.
	   ``I probably won't be 100 percent tomorrow, I'll tell you that
now,'' Davenport said. ``This only happens you don't know how many
times in your career. I plan to enjoy the next couple of days a
lot.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Highlights of Saturday's play in the dlrs 14
million U.S. Open tennis championships:
	    &UR; Weather: Sunny and warm, turning cloudy later in the day, with
a high of 87.
	    &UR; Attendance: 21,829.
	    &UR; Results: Lindsay Davenport won the women's singles
championship, beating defending champion Martina Hingis 6-3, 7-5.
It was Davenport's first Grand Slam singles title. Mark
Philippoussis topped French Open champion Carlos Moya 6-1, 6-4,
5-7, 6-4 to advance to his first Grand Slam final. He will face
defending champion Patrick Rafter in the first all-Australian men's
final since 1970. Rafter beat four-time champion Pete Sampras 6-7
(8-10), 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, ending Sampras' bid for a record-tying
12 Grand Slam men's singles titles. In juniors doubles, Americans
K.J. Hippensteel and David Martin took the boy's title while Kim
Clijsters of Belgium and Eva Dyrberg of Denmark won the girl's.
	    &UR; Stat of the Day: Of the combined 16 Grand Slam single finals
berths this year, only Martina Hingis, the Australian Open champion
and U.S. Open runner-up, appeared more than once.
	    &UR; Quote of the Day: ``You never know what your response or your
reaction's going to be. You can't put into words how much it means,
playing for so many years and being a pro for so many years, and
this being the goal always. It seriously was the greatest feeling
you can experience being a professional athlete.'' _ Lindsay
Davenport, on winning her first Grand Slam singles title.

	   DURHAM, North Carolina (AP) _ Bill Gates, the richest man in
America, appreciates the value of an education, even if he never
got a college degree.
	   The software mogul is donating dlrs 20 million to Duke
University, his wife's alma mater.
	   The gift, announced Saturday, will be used to set up the
University Scholars program, providing financial aid and
fellowships to dozens of undergraduate, graduate and professional
students.
	   Melinda French Gates received a bachelor's degree from Duke in

	   PARIS (AP) _ Singer Johnny Hallyday wrapped up a string of
mega-concerts in the Stade de France, blasting a Paris newspaper
for saying some of his songs were lip-synched. But the paper on
Saturday stood by its report.
	   ``I sing lip-synched. By the way, I also talk in lip-sync,''
France's middle-age Elvis joked with the thousands packed into the
new spaceship-like stadium on a rainy Friday night.
	   The 55-year-old Hallyday earlier Friday issued a statement that
he ``never cheated my fans. .. I've always sung live,'' after Le
Parisien daily reported ``seven or eight'' songs were pre-recorded.
	   Hallyday's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, acknowledged that the
orchestra and backup singers for Johnny were ``pre-recorded to be
reinforced'' during the concerts.
	   Le Parisien explained Hallyday had to depend on pre-recorded
songs to avoid feedback during a portion of the concert when his
microphone was too close to massive speakers near the audience.
	   The paper argued that Hallyday, who sings American rock 'n' roll
classics and his own originals, wouldn't have to rely on recordings
if he didn't have ``American-style mega-shows, with special
effects, fireworks and singers in the middle of the audience.''

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield and wife
Janice are celebrating the birth of their first child, a boy. The
boxer even broke training, just briefly, to be there for the
delivery.
	   Seven-pound, 7-ounce (3,175-gram) Elijah Jebediah was born early
Friday at Crawford Long Hospital. The champ described his
physician-wife as ``cool and calm.''
	   Holyfield, who fights Vaughn Bean next weekend at the Georgia
Dome, has eight other children, including three by his former wife,
Paulette.
	   Because of the couple's main event at 2:30 a.m., Holyfield
missed a 5:30 a.m. workout at his home in suburban Fairburn. The
champion's lawyer, Jim Thomas, was shocked to see Holyfield walk
into the gymnasium at his house three hours after the birth.
	   ``He didn't work out, though. He just stretched. He watched Gary
Bell spar with Cedric Fields,'' Thomas said, referring to
Holyfield's sparring partners. ``He said, `Gary'll do my
workout.'''
	   ___
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban leader Fidel Castro made an unscheduled
visit to boxer Muhammad Ali and U.S. actor Ed Asner at a reception
marking the end of their visit to Cuba.
	   ``He (Castro) expressed deep gratitude and deep appreciation for
everybody,'' said Bob Schwartz, executive director of the New
York-based Disarm Education Fund.
	   Ali and Asner, along with their wives, spent three days touring
Cuban hospitals and clinics with representatives of the Disarm
Education Fund and Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Direct Relief
International.
	   With the help of funds raised by Ali and Asner, the groups have
provided medicines and medical supplies to Cuba. Ali and Asner left
Cuba on Saturday afternoon.
	   Schwartz said Castro stayed at the Friday evening reception for
about two hours.
	   ``I was surprised by his deep knowledge of how the Cuban health
care system works,'' said Schwartz, who talked to Castro for about
40 minutes.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A total of 1.4 million clandestine
abortions take place in Brazil every year, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The daily O Globo also said that 250,000 Brazilian women were
hospitalized after complications following the operations.
	   Under a Brazilian law dating back to 1940, abortions are only
allowed after rape or if childbirth threatens a mother's life.
	   Clandestine abortions happen ``in completely uncertain
conditions'', Wilza Vilella, head of a government women's health
program, told the newspaper.
	   Working women who fear they will lose their job if pregnant are
one of the reasons for the high figures, Villela was quoted as
saying.
	   The figures are from a report by the National Network of Women's
Health, said O Globo. It will be published Sept. 28.
	   The report found Brazil has more clandestine abortions than the
rest of South America put together, said the paper.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil wants access to files on Italian
mafia leaders to prevent them hiding in this country, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The agreement was outlined by Italian anti-mafia investigator
Colonel Angiolo Pellegrini and government officials here Friday,
said the O Jornal do Brasil.
	   ``The agreement will help us investigate suspects' transit
between Italy and Brazil and investments made by mafiosi in
Brazil,'' Pellegrini was quoted as saying.
	   Brazil's Anti-Drugs Secretary Walter Maierovitch will fly to
Italy Sept.29 to sign the accord, the O Jornal do Brasil said. ``I
am going to give a final warning to mafiosi: it's time to flee
Brazil,'' Maierovitch was quoted as saying.
	   Brazil is favoured by mafiosi because of the ease with which
foreigners can get citizenship and because of the secrecy of bank
accounts, he told the daily.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Guerrillas firing rockets and lobbing
grenades destroyed a police post and took 20 officers prisoner in
northeast Colombia, authorities reported Saturday.
	   The strike on Las Mercedes, a town in Northern Santander state
about 246 miles (410 km) northeast of Bogota, was a rare joint
action by the country's two largest rebel groups, the 5,000-member
National Liberation Army and the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the army said.
	   Police reported a third rebel faction was also involved.
	   No deaths were reported, but at least one officer was injured
and several houses were destroyed in the bombardment which lasted
from Friday evening to early-Saturday, police and town officials
reported.
	   ``They practically erased the entire block where the barracks
were located,'' said National Police director Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano. ``It's a terrible thing when we're talking about peace.''
	   President Andres Pastrana has vowed to seek peace with both
insurgent groups who have been fighting since the 1960s, and talks
with the larger of the two were expected by November.
	   The rebels hold about 245 soldiers and police captured since
December in attacks against the increasingly outgunned and
outsmarted security forces. About half were taken in an August 3
assault on southern police anti-narcotics base.
	   The rebels have proposed exchanging the men for guerrillas held
in government jails, but Pastrana has said that should be discussed
at the negotiating table.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two gunmen stood up at a Catholic mass
in southern Colombia Friday and fatally sprayed the priest with
bullets, police have confirmed.
	   Reverend Alcides Jimenez, 50, was delivering a sermon when he
took 14 gunshots, including one to the head, police said Saturday.
	   The assailants fled the church located in Puerto Caicedo, about
300 miles (520 km) southwest of Bogota in the state of Putumayo.
	   A woman attending the service was also reported injured in the
attack.
	   The motive for the shooting was unclear, said police, however
Jimenez was gunned down after walking in a march for peace in
Colombia's 34-year civil war.
	   The Catholic Church had not made any statements on the killing,
which took place in a remote, rough-and-tumble region disputed by
leftist guerrillas and rightist paramilitary groups.
	   Drug traffickers also inhabit the area, which produces much of
Colombia's coca, the plant used to make cocaine.
	   ___
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuba's official Communist Party newspaper said the
Starr report on U.S. President Bill Clinton illustrated ``false
puritanism'' in an article Saturday.
	   Political reasons and false puritanism have put in the pillory
the leader of the greatest power in the world, the daily Granma
said.
	   ``The puritanism that American society boasts of showed its
double face as the pages (of the Starr report) offered numerous
intimate details about the Lewinsky-Clinton relationship,'' the
newspaper said.
	   The daily newspaper's report also accused the media of
``morbidly'' taking advantage of the situation.

Organizers hope second day of Bosnian voting free of glitches

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Organizers of Bosnia's
second post-war national elections say glitches that prevented a
few dozen polling stations from opening on the first day of voting
should be resolved Sunday.
	   Computer problems caused voters' lists to arrive late or ballots
to be incorrectly printed at 107 of the more than 2,600 polling
stations. All but about 30 to 40 opened by the end of Saturday's
balloting.
	   The first day of the two-day election was mostly calm, with no
sign of the ethnic rioting that has occasionally threatened
stability in Bosnia since the end of the 3 1-2-year war in 1995.
	   Only one minor incident of unrest occurred when a Bosnian Croat
in the southern village of Miljkovici threatened observers and
scattered the voter registration lists. Local police arrested the
man, who was not identified, election officials said.
	   Angry crowds gathered at some of the closed polling stations,
with one group blocking a road in northern Bosnia to protest the
delay. All dispersed when the problem was explained, officials
said.
	   The election is considered crucial to the future of the Dayton
peace accord, which halted the war in the former Yugoslav republic.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Under the peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two ethnic-based
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the
goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the one-time communist
territory.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   Western allies led by the United States and European Union, who
effectively run the country now under the Dayton agreement, hope
ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war lose support
this weekend and eventually fade away.
	   In the first post-war election in 1996 and a local ballot last
year, the ruling hard-line parties lost significant support among
most Bosnians.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments still remain strong and the
outcome of major races involving hard-line candidates was
uncertain.
	   A total of 83 parties and coalitions, as well as independent
candidates, are listed on the complicated ballots, with voters only
choosing leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than
2.7 million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people are registered.
	   Individual candidates are running for the three spots on the
joint presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while
parties compete for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also will choose a republic president.

Kosovo refugees in `dire' situation, humanitarian workers say

	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of refugees faced what a
humanitarian worker called ``very dire'' conditions in the west of
Kosovo province after police drove them away from their makeshift
camp.
	   The ethnic Albanian refugees were forced to abandon the site
Saturday after police in armored vehicles told them to leave
immediately, moving on to uncertain locations and adding to the
worsening refugee crisis in the Serbian province.
	   Serb police, intent on asserting full control over majority
ethnic Albanians in the independence-minded province, want them to
return to their charred homes. But international officials accuse
the Serbs of heavy-handed tactics against civilians.
	   The refugees, who had numbered as many as 40,000 near the
village of Istinic until Friday, piled on tractors to attempt
returns to their villages _ many razed _ or find other refugee
pockets nearby.
	   ``Go home, the police and army won't harm you,'' police urged in
Albanian, booming the message over loudspeakers to occupants of the
crowded, squalid camp.
	   By day's end, the pro-government Serb Media Center said all the
refugees had left the Istinic encampment.
	   ``The situation is very dire,'' said Anthea Web of the World
Health Program in the village 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital. ``They are leaving Istinic but we are
not quite certain where they are going.''
	   Other pockets of trouble involving trapped or fleeing refugees
were developing elsewhere in Kosovo, wracked by a six-month war
that shows no signs of ending.
	   A United Nations official visited razed villages and refugee
encampments Saturday and had harsh words for the Serbs afterward.
	   ``It is clear to me that in the villages I've visited there was
a disproportionate use of force against civilians,'' Olara Otunnu,
U.N. representative for children and armed conflict, said at a news
conference in Pristina in which he raised his voice frequently.
	   ``I had been especially distressed to see the systematic
destruction of villages which have been completely destroyed with
houses burned down and buildings gutted by fire,'' he said.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said late
Saturday that some refugees had been ambushed and shot at near the
Montenegro border, where an estimated 3,000 refugees were turned
back by authorities in that small Yugoslav republic, already
burdened by 40,000 Kosovo refugees. There was no word on casualties
or other details, and the report could not immediately be
confirmed.
	   Serb authorities, who are trying to liquidate the guerrilla
Kosovo Liberation Army, claim that Serb civilians, too, have been
targeted.
	   The Serbian Media Center reported that 29 corpses _ allegedly
Serb civilians killed by Albanian rebels _ have been found at
Glodjane in western Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian officials dispute the
claim.

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Nursing a stein of beer in the Ratskeller
under Munich's neo-Gothic town hall, Benedict Weeger is the picture
of Bavaria: lederhosen, embroidered white shirt and green felt
vest, even a feathered felt hat.
	   The 72-year-old retired construction worker votes like a typical
Bavarian too, loyally casting his ballot for the archconservative
Christian Social Union, which has governed Bavaria since 1962.
	   That's what he plans to do in Sunday's statehouse vote, and two
weeks later in the national election. ``The CSU is the only party
for me,'' he says with pride.
	   But not all voters in this tradition-loving state appear to feel
so loyal this time, and the result could spell bad news for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's underdog re-election bid.
	   Polls show the CSU, part of Kohl's three-party coalition
government in Bonn, has to worry about making it over the 50
percent mark in a state vote for the first time in decades.
	   After scoring 52.8 percent in 1994, the worst showing in years,
the party's lead candidate, Gov. Edmund Stoiber, says a good result
Sunday would be over 50 percent.
	   That, Stoiber says, will keep his position secure in Munich and
give Kohl a ``hail Mary pass'' to help him catch up to his flashy
Social Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, who holds a steady
lead in the polls.
	   Anything less, though, could take whatever wind is left out of
Kohl's sails just two weeks before the Sept. 27 national vote.
	   Yet even a good showing for the CSU Sunday does not mean Kohl
can rest easy. Polls show many Bavarians planning to vote for
Stoiber are nevertheless disenchanted with Kohl, in office for 16
years.
	   Jutta, a Munich teacher who didn't want to give her last name,
likes the straight-talking Stoiber but gets passionately angry with
the ``wishy-washy'' politics in Bonn.
	   ``I'm a critical CSU fan,'' she says.
	   Complaining about Germany's high unemployment, rising crime and
other problems, pensioner Klaus Meyer can only shake his head.
``The other parties must be able to do it better.''
	   Schroeder's popular appeal to create a ``new center'' seems to
be helping his long-suffering Bavarian comrades as well.
	   Polls show the Bavarian Social Democrats coming in at about 34
percent _ which would be a gain of four percentage points over 1994
and cause for celebration in their camp.
	   But they're not the only ones chipping away at the CSU's base.
	   Several tiny conservative parties are running, including the
far-right Republicans, who are campaigning against foreigners and
European integration.

Thorpe an unlikely champion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ian Thorpe resembles a normal
15-year-old kid, wracked with fears of inadeqacy, living in a
changing body that's doing strange things.
	   But the youngest-ever world swimming champion is also quite an
abnormal teenager: a well-balanced young man in a young man's body,
who is three years shy of being allowed to celebrate extraordinary
wins like Saturday's Commonwealth title with a celebratory drink.
	   Famously, his shoe size is greater than his age, and the size 16
paddles have driven him to some outrageous successes in the pool.
	   The Australian got as close as possible without matching the
men's oldest record Saturday when he clocked one minute 46.70
seconds to win the Commonwealth 200-meter freestyle title.
	   Thorpe was six when Giorgio Lamberti set the record in 1989 and
someone was looking after the Italian Saturday.
	   ``I was a little bit disappointed but I think I was in shock
more than anything else,'' said Thorpe.
	   He was up against world champion Michael Klim, Olympic champion
Danyon Loader and Olympic 1,500-meter silver medalist Daniel
Kowalski.
	   Thorpe won the 400-meter title at January's world championships
in Perth, giving precocious signs of his abnormalities by surging
back to win when most 15-year-olds may well have folded.
	   For all his words of disappointment, there was no outward sign
that Thorpe was hurting after missing Lamberti's record by so
little.
	   His fears of inadequacy seem out of place and the victory sets
him up to be the swimmer of the meet here.
	   ``I'm glad to have swum that race and it does relieve a bit of
the pressure, and the question mark that you usually have on
yourself at the start of a competition.''
	   Thorpe made his first senior national team 12 months ago and his
rapid rise in the rankings has, crucially, been accompanied by a
rapid rise in confidence.
	   ``The most important thing has been my mental preparation, I
think anyone can do the physical work to continue to stay
successful but the difference in striving that little bit harder
and going that little bit extra is the mental preparation you put
into the race.''
	   As the star man in a men's swimming team that rival Canadian
coach Dave Johnson rates the best in the world, better than the
United States, Thorpe's attitude has to be professional.
	   Sometimes you can see the kid, like when asked if his parents
were on hand to watch him rattle Lamberti.
	   ``Yeah I saw them. They said congratulations, the usual hugs and
kisses,'' he said, briefly letting the sheepish side take over.
	   And Saturday was just the start. Thorpe will feature as
Australia's 4x200-meter freestyle team chases a world record Sunday
and has four more events as well including the 100-meter and
400-meter freestyle events and the 200-meter butterfly.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Light-hitting Joe Randa's two-run homer in the
ninth inning against Boston closer Tom Gordon gave the Detroit
Tigers a 3-2 win Saturday as the Red Sox' grip on the AL wild-card
berth slipped.
	   Randa, who had just six homers in 410 at-bats, connected with
two outs after Tony Clark's single. Gordon (7-4) failed in a rare
non-save appearance. He has succeeded in his last 37 save
opportunities, the longest current streak in the majors.
	   Boston managed just four hits in its seventh loss in nine games
as its wild-card lead dropped to four games over Toronto, which
beat the New York Yankees 5-3. The Red Sox have 16 games remaining
and the Blue Jays 14.
	   Matt Anderson (4-1) pitched two hitless innings as Detroit won
for just the fifth time in 18 road games. Starter Bryce Florie
allowed three hits in six innings, and Todd Jones got his 24th save
despite giving up a two-out pinch homer to Midre Cummings in the
ninth.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Yankees 3
	   In New York, Jose Canseco reached 100 RBIs for the first time in
seven seasons and streaking Toronto sent David Wells to his first
home loss in a year.
	   The Blue Jays won for the 13th time in 15 games and closed to
within four games of Boston in the AL wild-card race.
	   Toronto trailed 2-1 until the fifth, when Benito Santiago hit a
drive to the center-field fence with one on and scored when two bad
throws turned his double into a Little League home run.
	   Tony Fernandez then hit a two-run triple on an 0-2 pitch in the
sixth.
	   Wells (17-4) lost consecutive starts for the first time this
year and lost at Yankee Stadium for the first time since Sept. 5,
1997, against Baltimore. New York, hobbling to the playoffs despite
its 103-43 record, has lost 13 of its last 24.
	   Chris Carpenter (11-7) allowed three hits in eight innings to
win for the fifth time in six decisions. Robert Person allowed one
hit in the ninth before getting his third save.
 &UR; White Sox 6, Indians 4 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Robin Ventura's three-run homer in the eighth
broke a tie and the tension in a game marred by a staredown between
Albert Belle and his former team.
	   After Paul Shuey (4-2) allowed a single by Ray Durham and
intentionally walked Belle, Ventura lined a 2-2 pitch from
left-hander Paul Assenmacher just over the wall in right for his
20th homer to give Chicago a 6-3 lead.
	   It gave the second-place White Sox their second straight win
over AL Central-leading Cleveland, struggling to wrap up a fourth
straight division title.
	   A fiery confrontation between Belle and Cleveland starter Dave
Burba in the sixth interrupted a well-played game with several
sparkling defensive plays.
	   With the game tied at 3, Burba set up Belle with fastballs and
sliders away for a 1-2 count. He threw a high and tight fastball
near Belle's face that hit his bat. Belle stood in the batter's box
screaming and motioning at Burba while pointing at the plate _ as
if to show the right-hander where it was.
 &UR; Orioles 3, Angels 2 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Eric Davis singled in the winning run in the
bottom of the ninth after Mike Bordick hit a two-run homer, giving
Baltimore an improbable comeback victory.
	   The Orioles managed only five hits off knuckleballer Steve
Sparks in 7 2-3 innings and trailed 2-0 in the ninth when Anaheim
closer Troy Percival (2-6) entered in search of his 40th save.
	   After Rich Becker hit a pinch-single, Bordick culminated an
11-pitch at-bat by lining a 3-2 pitch into the left-field seats for
his career-high 12th homer this season.
	   One out later, Brady Anderson singled and stole second before
Davis bounced a single up the middle.
	   Baltimore was 1-68 this season when trailing after eight
innings. Anaheim was 72-1 when leading after eight.
	   It was the fourth straight win for the Orioles, who stranded 10
before the ninth.
	   Alan Mills (2-4) got the final two outs in the ninth.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 60th homer and Orlando Merced
had a three-run home run in the ninth inning to cap a wild five-run
rally that sent Chicago to a 15-12 victory over Milwaukee on
Saturday.
	   Sosa became just the fourth player in major league history to
reach 60, driving a seventh-inning pitch from Valerio De Los Santos
over the back fence and out of Wrigley Field.
	   Sosa, tied with Babe Ruth, who hit 60 homers in 1927, is one shy
of the 61 hit by Roger Maris in 1961. And he trails Mark McGwire by
two after the St. Louis slugger failed to homer in Houston.
	   Rod Beck (2-2) got the last out in the ninth for the victory.
Bob Wickman (6-9) was the loser.
	   Jose Hernandez, Gary Gaetti, Glenallen Hill and Tyler Houston
also homered for Chicago. Jeromy Burnitz, Geoff Jenkins and Bobby
Hughes connected for Milwaukee.
 &UR; Astros 3, Cardinals 2 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Randy Johnson walked Mark McGwire in the third
inning, giving McGwire an NL record 152 walks, but Craig Biggio's
two-run double in the seventh rallied Houston past St. Louis.
	   A crowd of 52,493, the largest to see a regular-season game in
the Astrodome, came to see a showdown between Johnson and McGwire.
Johnson (8-1) entered the game with four complete-game shutouts in
the Astrodome.
	   St. Louis took a 2-0 lead in the first on Fernando Tatis' RBI
double and Ron Gant's run-scoring single. Houston made it 2-1 in
the bottom of the inning on Derek Bell's run-scoring groundout off
Darren Oliver (3-3).
	   Billy Wagner finished for his 29th save.
	   McGwire is 1-for-12 since hitting his record 62nd homer.
 &UR; Rockies 1, Giants 0 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Pedro Astacio took a shutout into the ninth
and pinch-hitter Jeff Reed drove in the only run with a two-out
single in the inning as Colorado beat San Francisco.
	   Astacio (12-14) did not allow a runner past first base until the
ninth when Marvin Benard hit a leadoff single and Rich Aurilia
sacrificed. Chuck McElroy relieved and got Barry Bonds to line out
to center.
	   Jerry Dipoto gave up an infield single to Jeff Kent before
getting Ellis Burks on a fly to center for his 18th save. Robb Nen
(7-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Reds 3, Diamondbacks 0 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Bret Boone drove in all three Cincinnati runs,
and Steve Parris pitched 7 2-3 shutout innings.
	   Parris (5-4) allowed three hits, struck out six and walked one
in getting his first win in three September starts. Gabe White
completed the three-hitter for his sixth save. Omar Daal (7-11)
took the loss.
	   Arizona has lost four straight and six of seven.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS debt in 4th graf to dlrs 1 billion, sted dlrs 600
million &QL; 
 &UR; By NORBERTO SANTANA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Seeking candidates
who can rescue this U.S. territory from a crushing debt, Virgin
Islanders went to the polls Saturday in an intensely contested
Democratic primary.
	   Voters were to choose a challenger to Gov. Roy Schneider,
referee a battle over the party's leadership and thin the ranks of
candidates for coveted seats in St. Croix, the territory's
industrial center.
	   Gubernatorial candidates Charles Turnbull and Wayne Chinnery
have both criticized Schneider, a Republican who ran as an
independent in 1994, for failing to rein in the territory's growing
debt.
	   The territory of 102,000 people owes nearly dlrs 1 billion, much
of it in disaster relief loans from hurricanes in 1995 and 1996.
The government owes its own employees dlrs 212 million in back
wages and promised salary increases, prompting a one-day strike by
thousands of public workers on Aug. 25.
	   Turnbull, a former education commissioner, is the
longest-serving member of the local party leadership and has
attracted several party leaders to campaign events. But he angered
some Democrats by voting to oust three party leaders, including
former chairwoman Margaret Stapleton, because of their jobs with
the Schneider administration.
	   Chinnery, an attorney and television talk show host, ran
unsuccessfully for governor in 1994 on an independent ticket.
	   Both have promised to attract new manufacturing and research
businesses to supplement the territory's tourism industry, which
was crippled by the hurricanes.
	   No party leaders have officially backed either candidate.
	   Democrats will also decide the year-long battle over the party's
local chair. After Stapleton was ousted, the party named James
O'Bryan to the party's chair because he was runner-up in the
leadership vote.
	   Voters will also decide which of the eight Democratic candidates
will be eliminated from the race for the seven St. Croix seats.
	   Results were not expected until late Saturday night.

	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Mia Hamm scored two goals and
assisted on four others as the U.S. women's soccer team routed
Mexico 9-0 Saturday at Foxboro Stadium in the opening round of the
Nike U.S. Cup series.
	   The U.S. women, 18-1-2 this year, outshot Mexico by a 34-3
margin before 35,462, the largest crowd to watch a women's soccer
match in America.
	   Kristine Lilly scored twice for the Olympic champion Americans,
while five others players netted single goals.
	   Hamm now holds the American women's record with 99 goals, two
more than teammate Michelle Akers and just nine short of the world
record 108 scored by Elisabetta Vignotta of Italy.
	   The U.S. women scored five first-half goals, two apiece by Hamm
and Lilly. Tiffeny Milbrett scored the third goal and assisted on
three goals.
	   The U.S. women, who have outscored Mexico 21-0 in their previous
two meetings, held a 20-2 edge in shots during the first 45
minutes. Lilly, a 27-year-old forward playing in her world-record
160th match, scored at 18:59 and at 41:05.
	   Shannon Martin, Joy Fawcett, Tisha Venturini and Debbie Keller
closed out the scoring in the second half, all assisted by Hamm,
who now has 18 goals and 20 assists this year.

Ducking talk of Nobel prize, Portugal's Saramago just keeps on
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jose Saramago, one of Portugal and
Europe's best-known writers, has been strongly tipped to win the
Nobel literature prize more times than he cares to remember.
	   And he barely cares any more.
	   At the age of 75, he says he's deeply weary of the annual
Nobel-inspired media frenzy around him and shuns any talk of
literature's top prize. ``Let's not get into that. I just write,''
he insisted in a recent telephone interview from his home in
Spain's Canary islands.
	   Indeed, although his works have been translated into more than
20 languages, he has never courted fame. As a prominent iconoclast,
he's much more accustomed to controversy.
	   He memorably clashed with a government culture official who
chopped Saramago's name from Portugal's nominees for the 1991
European Literature Prize because he said the author's novel ``The
Gospel according to Jesus Christ'' had offended the religious
beliefs of this mostly Roman Catholic country.
	   In the controversial work Saramago, an atheist, portrays a
Christ who, prey to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and
tries to back out of his crucifixion.
	   Such historical and literary cheekiness are something of a
Saramago trademark.
	   In his 1986 book, ``The Stone Raft,'' the Iberian peninsula
snaps off from the rest of the European continent and floats off
into the North Atlantic _ apparently in a metaphorical search for
identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union,
of which Portugal and Spain are members.
	   In ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' from 1989, a Lisbon
proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on
the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors,
thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a
stroke of his pen.
	   ``Blindness,'' his sixth book to be translated into English,
opens with a man suddenly and inexplicably going blind while
sitting in his car in traffic. The blindness spreads rapidly
through the rest of the population ``like a line of gunpowder.''
	   Set in an unnamed country at an unspecified time, and with
nameless characters, the book becomes a grim and universal tale of
social meltdown as society's structures collapse and a panicked
attitude of every-man-for-himself takes hold.
	   It is at times a disturbing allegory, told in a matter-of-fact
fashion. Its sedate pace can sometimes slow to a plod, but
Saramago's message comes through loud and clear.
	   ``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of
rationality,'' he says.
	   ``We're rational beings but we don't behave rationally. If we
did, there'd be no starvation in the world.''
	   And, though disturbing, the horror is in the end transcended by
the prevailing humanity, the ``generosity and altruism,'' which
Saramago as a writer and as a man cherishes so dearly.
	   ``Blindness'' may push Saramago _ whose works have been
translated into more than 20 languages _ closer to the Nobel prize,
which no writer in Portuguese has ever won. But that's the last
thing on his mind.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ``Blindness'' was published Sept. 10 in the United States by
Harcourt Brace. Price: dlrs 22.

	   In the spotlight: Anne Bancroft, forever Mrs. Robinson
	    &UR; Personal stats: Anne Bancroft, whose real name is Anne Marie
Italiano, was born in the Bronx section of New York on Sept. 17,
1931. Her father was a dress pattern-maker and her mother was a
telephone operator at Macy's department store.
	   She said she was a born showoff. ``I was the personality kid.
When I wasn't sick, I was singing.''
	    &UR; Big movie break: After a screen test, she immediately won a
studio contract with 20th Century Fox. Choosing the name of Anne
Bancroft from a list submitted to her by studio czar Darryl F.
Zanuck, she made a series of lackluster movies, then decided to try
Broadway for a while. She won a Tony for her performance as Annie
Sullivan in ``The Miracle Worker'' in 1960. She won an Oscar for
the same part in 1963.
	   She's received Oscar nominations for her performances in ``The
Pumpkin Eater'' in 1964, ``The Graduate'' in 1967, ``The Turning
Point'' in 1977 and ``Agnes of God'' in 1985.
	    &UR; Mrs. Robinson: Because her role as Mrs. Robinson in ``The
Graduate'' endures as such a cultural milestone, it inevitably
affects how she's received by people both in and out of show
business. ``Some men who grew up with Mrs. Robinson in their minds
are terribly intimidated by it. You can't get them to feel
comfortable with you.''
	   She figures it's had an impact on her career, too. ``More than I
know. But I don't have it documented.''
	    &UR; Other roles: Bancroft concedes there may be a lack of leading
roles for women, but she can find even small roles satisfying. The
example she gives: her part in the 1993 movie ``Malice,'' which
amounted to a one- or two-day shoot.
	   ``So there are always good parts. They may not pay what you
want, and they may not have as many days (of) work as you want,
they may not have the billing that you want, they may not have a
lot of things, but (when it comes to) the content of the role
itself, I find there are many roles.''
	   Bancroft, who is married to comedian Mel Brooks, has starred in
more than 60 films. Her voice can be heard in the upcoming
computer-animated feature ``Antz,'' from DreamWorks.
	   Celebrity birthdays for Sept. 13-19:

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On an average weekend, Josh Wink might work as a
disc jockey for thousands at an outdoor festival in England one
afternoon, play to a packed nightclub in Berlin the next night and
then fly to Tokyo for a record store appearance.

British and European top 10 charts. His resume boasts DJ gigs
worldwide. But like many talented American DJs and producers, his
minimal, repetitive dance floor techno has yet to reach the same
level of acceptance in the United States.
	   Back home in Philadelphia, Wink is mostly known as a hero of the
East Coast rave world _ an underground network of promoters, DJs,
record stores and thousands of youthful partygoers.
	   And that suits Wink, 28, who was born Josh Winkelman, just fine.
	   ``I'm an artist, and I'm still going to be doing my artwork
whether people like it or not, and it's been that way for the last
10 years,'' he says. But Wink has been getting a fair amount of
attention with the release of his first full-length album of
original material, ``HereHear.''
	   Released on his own label Ovum in conjunction with Columbia
Records, the LP is an expansive collection of tracks, highlighting
Wink's nightclub expertise and a more experimental side as well.
The idea was to combine organic compositions, based around
vocalists and live instruments, with the inorganic machine sounds,
he says.
	   ``I wanted to balance the album, because the first half of it is
a little more thought-provoking, a little more home listening,''
Wink explains. ``But the second half is more techno and
house-based, more for the dance floor.''
	   Some of the standout tracks are Wink's collaborations. He
provides a thumping stomp for fellow Philadelphian Ursula Ruckers'
spoken word narration on ``6th Sense.'' He also provides a lush,
slow-tempo soundscape for former This Mortal Coil vocalist Caroline
Crawley on ``I'm on Fire.''
	   He intentionally set out to confound some of his fans by
departing from his usual groovy techno sound, Wink says. The
biggest departure is ``Black Box,'' an angry industrial screamer
heightened by a blistering vocal track by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch
Nails. The song runs more than 8 minutes, so listening to it is
certainly not a moment of rhythmic bliss.
	   1. What is the strangest place you have worked as a DJ?
	   Wink: One was in 1992 in Amsterdam. It was on a submarine boat
and it was in the back of Central Station. It opened at 3 a.m. and
went until 10 a.m., and at that time, stuff was so fresh over
there. You had to go down a pier and you had to cross a boat and
then open up this latch and all this fog would come up. It was
freezing cold, and it was so hot inside, all this water was
dripping everywhere. That's just one of many.
	   2. How important was it for you to start your own label?
	   Wink: It's been the biggest thrill in my life. I hadn't really
realized what my next goal was in life after I had obtained so many
beautiful things, and then I realized that I was able to be in a
position where I could help people out and I wanted to do so
through a record label.
	   3. Do you think techno will ever break big in America?
	   Wink: It's bigger than it's ever been, however, what do people
mean by big? That's something I can't control and I don't really
concern myself with it. The thing I can do is focus on putting out
good quality music from my label and that's what makes me happy. If
we can put out good quality stuff, people will want to buy more of
it, and to me, that's acting more responsibly about the whole
thing.
	   4. Does your album sound like your DJ sets?
	   Wink: It's diverse. I've always played different music. I grew
up being able to DJ all different types of music, from hip-hop to
funk to acid house to whatever. And I think that's the way it
should be. My CD sounds like me as a DJ. It's like a mixed CD of my
own music that I happen to be segueing as a continuous mix.
	   5. Do you draw any particular inspiration from Philadelphia?
	   Wink: It's a pretty cool area and it's not as crazy and hectic
as New York is. There is a lot of musical history here in
Philadelphia, which I appreciate now. But I never really
appreciated the whole disco sound because when I was of that age,
it was not the cool thing to like. But now I appreciate it for what
it is. There's a lot of music coming out of here but there really
hasn't been dance music since the '70s.

	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Soft, melodious sound of rubab _ a
traditional guitar-like musical instrument of Afghanistan _ echoes
in the small room of a shabby building in the Pakistani border city
of Peshawar.
	   Five young Afghans sit cross-legged on the floor moving their
fingers skillfully on wires.
	   For hours they practice their music under the supervision of a
teacher, a master of the craft who relentlessly hounds his pupils,
demanding their best.
	   ``Music needs life long devotion and commitment,'' says Mohammad
Mazhar, an Afghan student of rubab. ``We are trying to keep our
music alive, though it is not an easy task.''
	   The Afghan tradition of music struggles for survival in a
foreign land as it has little future in its native Afghanistan,
where the radical taliban army has banned all forms of music other
than religious.
	   In Taliban-run Afghanistan, a public beating is given anyone
found listening to music. Audio cassettes have been smashed and
television, pictures and paintings dubbed ``evil things''.
	   But that doesn't mean Afghan music is dead.
	   There are dozens of professional Afghan musicians in Peshawar
and some in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, who play popular
numbers and classical music of Afghanistan at private gatherings,
often at weddings.
	   ``We have a centuries old tradition of poetry and music. The
Taliban can not root it out from our hearts,'' said an Afghan
artist in Peshawar. But even in Pakistan he is afraid of the
Taliban and refuses to give his name.
	   Kabul once was a liberal city during peacetime, before the
former Soviet Union invaded in 1979 and the Islamic insurgency was
born.
	   Far from the destruction, death and misery of the civil war in
their homeland, these groups offer a glimpse of a happier past to
more than one million Afghan refugees living in neighboring
Pakistan, afraid to return home.
	   The old Khalil Building in Peshawar's Takal Payan district has
become a center for Afghan artists. Here in this rundown
three-story cement building, a rickety old staircase leads to the
small rooms where they practice their music, run private businesses
and meet over sweet green tea to reminisce about better days back
home in Afghanistan.
	   As they speak the sweet strains of musical instruments can be
heard.
	   ``There are more than 40 Afghan music groups in Peshawar
alone,'' said Aziz Ahmad, a vocalist and musician who runs his own
16-member group. Every group is led by a senior artist, who also
acts as the teacher.
	   The going rate for a group is 4,000 to 6,000 rupees (dlrs 68) a
performance.
	   Mohammad Sharif, an Afghan musician, said most Afghan artists
are poor and struggling.
	   Abdul Hafeez, coordinator of Pakistan's Commissionerate of
Afghan Refugees, said many of the refugees who lived in Kabul have
gravitated toward Pakistan's cities rather than the refugee camps.
	   Afghanistan's musicians say they are not interested in the
politics and power struggles that is ripping their homeland apart.
	   ``We don't know about politics. We are artists and want to keep
people happy which is a difficult thing in present situation,''
says a singer Humayun.
	   ``As a fish can not survive without water, artists can not live
without people,'' he said. ``We will go back where we belong once
there is peace. But we don't know when it will happen. But we want
our own people and place to grow.''

The lizard post-mortem: 'We didn't deliver,' filmmaker says

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ In the end, time does matter, and Dean Devlin
and partner Roland Emmerich didn't have enough of it.
	   With the Hollywood hype machine running full bore, they finished
the editing of their latest movie, ``Godzilla,'' and rushed it off
to the lab to make the thousands of prints for the thousands of
theaters that would be premiering it over the Memorial Day weekend.
	   ``We were so determined to make this date that we built a
schedule where we couldn't screen-test, and we should have,''
recalled Devlin, the producer and co-writer. ``I think we really
could have improved the film.''
	   For anyone paying even the least bit of attention to the Great
Godzilla Backlash of 1998, this may seem the understatement of the
summer movie season. But for Hollywood, not known for its
introspection or public self-examination, Devlin's reflections are
unusually candid.
	   ``People expected more,'' he said. ``And we didn't deliver.''
	   In a recent interview in the filmmakers' new offices on the Sony
Pictures lot, the 36-year-old Devlin said ``Godzilla'' had problems
with the script (co-written by Devlin and Emmerich, who also
directed), fallout from the yearlong promotional buildup and even
misunderstanding over the meaning of the now-famous ``size does
matter'' ad slogan.
	   ``It's meant to be a joke, and people took it really serious,
and they thought we were talking about the size of the movie or the
size of the budget or the size of the campaign,'' he said. ``All we
were trying to say was the reason why this is not 'Jurassic Park'
is that it's a bigger lizard. We were making kind of a dirty joke,
but it got totally misinterpreted.''
	   After the movie opened big and then went south in a hurry _
inspiring a million one-liners about how ``Godzilla'' didn't have
legs _ Devlin was surprised by the reaction.
	   ``I think the only thing that was really disappointing for me
was the level of vitriol,'' said Devlin.
	   As it turned out, ``Godzilla,'' which cost some dlrs 170 million
to make and market, reaped nearly dlrs 136 million domestically and
is headed for more than dlrs 200 million overseas. The video
release will bring in more.
	   ``You don't do a long-term deal with someone and drop everything
because something performed very well but not wildly beyond
expectations,'' said Gareth Wigan, co-vice chairman of
Columbia-TriStar Motion Picture Group, part of Sony. ``It's proving
to be a very, very fruitful relationship and a real partnership.''
	   Still, ``Godzilla'' wasn't the movie that Hollywood observers
thought it should have been. Devlin makes it clear it's also not
the movie that he and Emmerich thought it could have been. The pair
have built their reputation on special-effects-filled spectacles,
and ``Godzilla'' was going to raise the bar.
	   Devlin first worked with Emmerich on the 1990 movie ``Moon 44,''
about rival companies fighting over corporate claims to the moon;
Emmerich was the director and Devlin had a part. The two struck up
a friendship, finding a strong mutual interest in fantasy films.
	   Devlin wrote ``Universal Soldier,'' the 1992 action film that
Emmerich directed, and they teamed again on ``Stargate,'' the 1994
film starring Kurt Russell and James Spader about a stone gateway
to another universe.
	   Then came ``Independence Day,'' the 1996 alien-invasion
blockbuster starring Will Smith that established Devlin and
Emmerich as one of Hollywood's hottest writing-producing-directing
teams.
	   ``Godzilla'' seemed the natural project for them: a big,
special-effects-heavy, popcorn-season film based on one of the
best-known movie monsters of all time. After rejecting the project
several times, the pair finally agreed to put a unique spin on the
cheesy Japanese series.
	   ``It's a movie wherein we took a lot of risks, and we knew we
were taking them, but we thought it would be cool,'' Devlin said.
	   The idea was to fashion a sort of ``Frankenstein'' with scales,
starring a beast who starts out scary but becomes increasingly
sympathetic. ``It was really a classic monster movie,'' he said.
	   The problem was that many moviegoers were looking for another
``Independence Day.''
	   ``Godzilla has no evil characters. There is no villain. And I
think, perhaps, after 'Independence Day' people were expecting a
super villain,'' said Devlin. ``I think, for the audience, they
were a bit confused. It was, like, 'Well, are we cheering for the
death of Godzilla or not cheering?'''
	   Another issue with the script, he said, concerned character
development, a point hammered by virtually every critic, who found
the characters _ even by the standards of the summer action film _
too thin.
	   ``We did this structure where we put so much character in the
middle of the film instead of the beginning of the film,'' he said.
``We thought that was kind of interesting. But what we discovered
was that by the time we learned the character's background, we
didn't care anymore.''
	   Some of the problems could have been spotted and corrected
before the movie was released, but time ran out.
	   ``This is the first film we ever put out that we didn't have
time to test screen, and every film we've ever done we improved
tremendously over the test screening,'' he said. ``With
'Independence Day,' for instance, the whole ending was reshot.''

	   But with ``Godzilla,'' he said, ``We literally finished the cut
and went to the printer. And we didn't even have a chance to screen
it for the studio. It was just like, 'We have to go. We'll never
make enough prints to get them into the theater in time if we make
any adjustments.'''
	   Devlin said the Memorial Day deadline was self-enforced, and
that the studio even offered to give them more time, but that the
partners felt compelled to stick to the strict schedule.
	   ``It was a move done from the heart, to say, 'Thank you' to the
studio,'' he said. ``But it also was foolish. It was for all the
right reasons (with) the wrong result.''
	   At the same time, the film was starting to buckle under the
weight of the promotional campaign and mounting expectations.
	   The trailers had started running a year earlier, and
``Godzilla'' hype was reaching its peak. There were TV ads and
billboards, all trumpeting the ``size does matter'' line. The
creature's identity was being kept a secret for maximum suspense.
And just days before the film's release, Sony announced it would be
showing it on a record 3,310 screens.
	   ``Nothing stays popular for a year,'' Devlin said. ``I think if
we released 'Godzilla' in February we'd have had a giant hit. You
know, I really do. But by (Memorial Day weekend), it was, 'I can't
hear from ``Godzilla'' anymore.'''
	   The film opened May 19. By the following Monday it had collected
a staggering dlrs 74 million, seen by many Hollywood observers as a
disappointment because it fell short of the record opening last
year of dlrs 90.2 million for ``Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' and
because it clouded the possibility of a sequel.
	   The next week, ticket sales plummeted about 60 percent, and
``Godzilla'' was as much a punchline as a movie.
	   ``It's the only movie in history that (will) make between dlrs
350 million and dlrs 400 million (worldwide) that's considered a
disappointment,'' Devlin said, laughing. ``Luckily, the studio
didn't feel that way.''
	   The partners' company, Centropolis Entertainment, is working
under a sweet deal with Sony that basically allows them to produce
whatever they want. They've got four films in development _ all
popcorn movies _ including one ready to go before the cameras in
January.
	   ``We're taking more time developing the script this time than we
did before, and we're making sure we have enough time _ post
time,'' he said.
	   Now, Devlin feels like he is back to his pre-''Independence
Day'' status in Hollywood, when the mandate was to put people in
the seats and not records in the books.
	   ``We're back to being to where we used to be: the underdogs,''
he said. ``And we love that.''

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ There's a particular tidbit that record producer
Mathew Knowles likes to mention when pitching his fast-rising
rhythm and blues group Destiny's Child.
	   The four girls who form the Houston-based ensemble have
performed more than Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston combined,
Knowles boasts, and they are only 16 and 17 years old.
	   He offers this nugget not only to impress but to show that the
group's success is due to more than just destiny.
	   ``They're not where they are by luck,'' Knowles says. ``The
success is because the group has already developed. It's all old
hat to them.''
	   Belting out soulful ballads and hip-hop dance tunes might well
be old hat, but fame is a new fringe benefit that these ladies have
welcomed with the enthusiasm of teen-agers and the humility of
professionals.
	   The group's self-titled debut album, released in February, has
gone gold after selling almost 1 million copies worldwide. The
first single, ``No, No, No,'' is double platinum with some 2
million copies sold.
	   Destiny's Child also has been featured on soundtracks for the
films ``Men in Black'' and ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love.''
	   ``It's a trip, but it's a blessing,'' 16-year-old Beyonce
Knowles, Mathew's daughter and the lead singer of Destiny's Child,
says of the group's success.
	   Rounding out the quartet are LaTavia Roberson, also 16, Kelly
Rowland and LeToya Luckett, both 17.
	   The group got its start about seven years ago when Beyonce and
LaTavia, then 9, joined a singing and dancing group called Girls
Tyme.
	   With its hip-hop songs and bubble-gum lyrics, Girls Tyme
performed at birthday parties, talent competitions and clubs from
Houston to Dallas. The group even recorded an album but had no luck
in landing a record deal.
	   Then in 1992, Girls Tyme got its first big break when it won an
appearance on the televised talent competition ``Star Search.'' But
the group was placed in the rap category and performed its only rap
song _ not its best. The girls lost to a rock band.
	   ``We did not win,'' recalls Beyonce, ``but that was the turning
point in our career.''
	   After the disappointing loss, Beyonce's father started managing
the group and set out to change its image. The dancers were
scrapped. LeToya and Kelly came aboard, and the girls began honing
their vocal skills.
	   During the summers, they received voice lessons and rehearsed
daily. Once school started, they rehearsed at night and performed
on weekends. At the end of their ninth-grade year, they quit school
and hired tutors.
	   ``Everybody else was outside playing, and we were working. But
we still played,'' says Kelly. ``We had to make up our own games,
but we made sure we had fun.''
	   All the while, the girls continued recording songs and hunting
for a record deal.
	   Their luck finally changed after a representative from Columbia
Records saw the group perform at a Houston expo. Afterward, they
were invited to perform in a showcase of up-and-coming stars and,
in 1996, Columbia signed them to its label.
	   After two years in the studio, the album ``Destiny's Child'' was
released.
	   John Moran, owner of Digital Services Recording in Houston,
likens the group's deal with Columbia to a baseball player ``coming
out of high school and going directly to the major leagues.''
	   ``It's impressive that they were signed directly to Columbia,''
said Moran, whose studio was used by Destiny's Child to record its
early material.
	   Also impressive is the lineup of stars who pitched in on the
album. Wyclef Jean of the rap group the Fugees collaborated with
the girls on ``No, No, No.'' Dwayne Wiggins of the rhythm and blues
group Tony, Toni, Tone produced several tracks, as did Vincent
Herbert, who has produced hits for Toni Braxton.
	   With its studio backing and talent, Destiny's Child is destined
for big things, says Moran, who describes the quartet as a young
Supremes. The group also could help expand the image of Houston's
music scene, known more for its rap artists.
	   ``There is an intangible quality that is evident in most people
who can be described as stars _ presence. They have that,'' Moran
says. ``And the girls themselves work very, very hard and have been
doing so for many, many years. That is the major key.''
	   The group has no plans to slow down.
	   After three months on tour with the award-winning Boyz II Men,
the girls are getting ready to go back on tour this month. Each is
learning to play an instrument, and work on the next album begins
in February.
	   Despite the hard work and nonstop lifestyle, the members of
Destiny's Child says their success has been a blessing _ one they
won't soon take for granted.
	   ``We appreciate everything, and we do understand that all of
this can be taken away the next day,'' says Beyonce. ``You can be
No. 1 and then the next week, nothing.''

	   Designer Zoe Metro says her handbags _ with their red linings
and reproductions of 15th-century lucky Chinese coins _ attract
money and peace of mind.
	   They also attract celebrity customers.
	   Singer Mariah Carey owns Metro's Disco Fever and Disco Dance
bags.
	   Madonna and New York socialite Blaine Trump wear her bamboo
Chinese charm bracelets. The Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders have them,
too. ``They're into yoga and good luck stuff,'' Metro says.
	   Metro, who studied ancient Asian art at Princeton University,
says that for every accessory, there is a philosophical reason.
	   Consider her Chinese charm bracelets, packaged in Chinese food
containers.
	   ``Our bracelets are modeled after ancient prayer bracelets, and
they come with the four traditions of Chinese good luck: fortune,
wealth, long life and happiness. When you put one on, you say the
four traditions.''
	   Likewise, Metro says, the red linings in her handbags symbolize
good fortune.
	   ``What we're doing is city chic on the outside, good fortune on
the inside,'' the 29-year-old native New Yorker says. ``That's our
slogan. Very simple on the outside, with something special to
discover on the inside.''
	   The purses come in printed leather and fake fur patterns with
monikers like Cheetah Chick, Tempting Tiger, Slinky Snake and
Chocoholic. They retail for about dlrs 100 to dlrs 150.
	   ``Our bags are not about being objects in and of themselves,''
Metro says. ``They're functional. They're pleasurable tools to
allow the customers to free themselves so they can perform, create
and express to the ultimate of their abilities. Everything is
designed for living.''
	   Translated, her handbags are little rectangular flat envelopes
with a zip top and easy shoulder strap, or a strap that goes over
the wrist like a bracelet. ``We designed them to fit a cell phone,
a credit card and lipstick,'' she says.
	   Every order Metro ships to stores is packed in fortune cookies,
not standard packing materials. ``We like the idea of having
something special inside. Just for fun, you know?''
	   She adds, ``We are still painting and packaging everything by
hand.''
	   Metro's designs are definitely attracting attention.
	   ``Her bags really catch the eye. People who see them comment on
them and pick them up right away,'' says Katherine Thomas, women's
accessories buyer for Barneys New York. ``There's an immediate
attraction. They can fit on your wrist, so you look not like you're
carrying a bag, but like it's part of your outfit.''
	   Her motto: ``Cool bags for girls who work.''
	   Metro fits the description. Her apartment is decorated with
``all this fabulous furniture from the Salvation Army right around
the block; all this 1950s stuff that looks very Jetsons.''
	   Her Seventh Avenue showroom, also very cool, is dotted with
small square plots of real grass on a wooden floor. ``I wanted to
have grass. I wanted to have city-meets-ancient.''
	   And Metro, clad in a New York fashionista's typical black suit,
is busy, busy, busy.
	   She's taken to wearing sneakers with platforms ``because ... I'm
running around all the time.''
	   Metro adds, ``Not Frankenstein platforms, but it seems that a
little heel always works.''
	   After graduating from college in 1991, Metro moved to France,
then Prague, and spent several years in advertising, marketing and
creative services. She started her company in October 1997.
	   Metro was 12 and growing up in Philadelphia when she met her
muse, the owner of a clothing store. She was ``this terribly
eccentric woman, sleek black hair in a bun. I was one of her
favorite customers,'' says Metro. ``I would help her do the windows
and had fun with her, mixing very eclectic things.
	   ``She would travel all around the world and bring back eccentric
pieces such as huge beaded necklaces, big jeweled earrings,'' says
Metro. ``Anything that was fabulous was always there.''

Singer almost sailed on 'Titanic' _ substitutes gig on TV

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ She booked passage on the ``Titanic'' but
missed the boat, so Reba McEntire has turned to a TV drama that
leaves her time to sing.
	   The country music star had signed on to play Molly Brown in
``Titanic,'' the movie. But when the production schedule doubled to
six months, McEntire disembarked because it conflicted with her
concert schedule. Kathy Bates came aboard in her place.
	   So McEntire fans can catch her instead in ``Forever Love,''
Sunday (Sept. 27) on the CBS U.S. television network, in which she
plays Lizzie Brooks, 24-year-old wife of Alex (Tim Matheson) and
mother of a young daughter.
	   Lizzie suffers a stroke, lapses into a coma, and awakes 20 years
later into a bewildering new world.
	   ``The movie is based on a true story,'' Miss McEntire said from
her home in Nashville. ``The woman was in a coma for years. After
that, they were able to get her up, give her a shower, take her to
parties. She didn't return to normal for 30 years.
	   ``My character is basically in bed and unconscious for 20 years.
Wouldn't that be a shock? You go into a coma when your child is 2
years old. You wake up and she's 22. I could just not imagine how
heartbroken I would be to wake up and see a man standing there.
'Who are you?' 'I'm your son.'
	   ``In the movie she's my daughter, but I have an 8-year-old son,
and I just can't imagine going through that. What a nightmare. Your
husband's different, everybody's different.''
	   The singer performs two songs in the TV movie, including the
title theme.
	   She is no newcomer to acting, having appeared in TV movies such
as ``The Man from Left Field'' and ``Is There Life Out There?'',
the miniseries ``Buffalo Girls'' and the feature ``Tremors.''
	   For ``Titanic,'' Miss McEntire said, she spent two hours with an
acting coach _ ``the first training I ever had'' _ before meeting
with ``Titanic'' director James Cameron.
	   ``The interview turned out great,'' she said. ``I got the
part.''
	   But she discovered she would be needed for six months. ``I was
already booked all over the country, and that's something you can't
change.''
	   ``Titanic'' is the first film to earn more than dlrs 600 million
in North America.
	   Miss McEntire has been in the country music limelight since
starting with Mercury Records in the late 1970s. A few years later
she moved to MCA Records and started stacking up honors. They now
include 18 gold albums, 14 platinum, six double platinum, five
triple and one quadruple platinum (``Greatest Hits Volume II'').
	   Her popularity is worldwide. She performed in Australia early
this year, and this month makes stops in Scotland and Ireland. She
averages 80 to 90 dates annually.
	   No matter what the continent, she finds audiences react almost
the same way, the only difference being whether or not they are
drinking beer.
	   ``People ask me, 'How was the crowd last night?' When I say they
were very attentive, the comment is, 'OK, so they weren't serving
beer, right?' When I say the crowd was rowdy, the answer is, 'So
they were serving beer, yes.'''
	   Does she have a preference, beer vs. no beer?
	   ``It depends. If I'm singing 'Wrong Night,' which is an up-tempo
Texas two-step, that's where the beer drinkers come in handy. I
might be doing 'Greatest Man,' which is a very sentimental,
touching song about a father who will not say 'I love you' to his
children.
	   ``I set it up by saying how my father was that kind of man: very
supportive, always there for his kids, but just didn't believe in
saying 'I love you' because his parents never did. In the front row
I see the women reaching for their Kleenexes and the husbands
putting their arms around their wives.
	   ``If it's a beer-drinking night, nine times out of 10 there is
someone in the back who has had three or four beers. He says, 'I
luv ya, baby, I tell ya that all th' time.'
	   ``I'll take 'em, any time I can get 'em. I love what I do.
Hopefully the good Lord will let me do it as long as I possibly
can.''

Record companies now have to work a lot harder for hit songs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Music you've never heard before is turning up in
the strangest places.
	   You can hear it over the loudspeaker at minor league basketball
games, on TV sets displayed in department stores or in movie
theaters before the trailers begin.
	   Every note is a measure of the desperation that record companies
feel about having their new music heard by possible buyers in a
radio climate in which decisions on what to play are made by fewer
and fewer people.
	   The search for new ways to expose music even revived a practice
that once shamed the industry: a record company paying a radio
station to play a song. The practice was called payola decades ago.
Now it's called business.
	   Songs will always be able to capture the public imagination,
like this summer's duel between Brandy and Monica on ``The Boy Is
Mine'' or Shania Twain's genre-smashing ``You're Still the One.''
	   But for every hit, there's a bigger pile of misses. The business
of making a hit record is complicated today by changes in how radio
stations operate, the fragmentation of public tastes and the sheer
volume of music competing for air time.
	   ``You can't just count on people hearing it on the radio and
going to the store on Saturday,'' sighed Ron Shapiro, executive
vice president and general manager of Atlantic Records.
	   Subject to the whims of public taste, creating a hit record has
never been a science. Who knew that so many teen-age girls would
swoon over ``My Heart Will Go On,'' or that teen-age boys would
emphatically reject the new Van Halen?
	   At least the process was relatively simple: Get a few key radio
stations to play the record, make sure MTV airs the video, and let
music fans decide.
	   Consolidation of the radio industry has changed the rules.
Dominant companies like Chancellor Media, Jacor Communications and
CBS have bought hundreds of stations across the country. Executives
for these companies often decide what songs will or won't be played
on dozens of stations.
	   It's rare now for one disc jockey to take a liking to a song,
champion it in defiance of industry experts, and see it catch fire.
That's how a hit like Marc Cohn's ``Walking in Memphis'' got its
start a few years ago.
	   ``What made music exciting is when a station somewhere decided
to play one song that nobody else was playing. Now it's so
well-organized and so well-researched,'' said Andy Allen, president
of Alternative Distribution Alliance, a company that delivers music
to record stores.
	   This year, Flip/Interscope Records reportedly paid a radio
station in Portland, Ore., dlrs 5,000 to repeatedly play
``Counterfeit'' by its band, Limp Bizkit.
	   The arrangement raised uncomfortable memories. In the late 1950s
payola scandal, popular disc jockey Alan Freed's empire collapsed
in disgrace after it was revealed he had accepted money from record
companies to play their songs.
	   The practice was made illegal, but not if the arrangement is
disclosed upfront to listeners. A radio DJ might say, for example,
that the song is ``brought to you by'' the record company _ much as
a corporate sponsor would be announced for a commercial break.
	   Is this a smart way to get music heard? Or will consumers reject
a song so tainted by commercialism? Interscope executives wouldn't
talk about whether they considered the experiment a success.
Similar deals reportedly have been in the works for country radio
stations, but none has materialized.
	   ``The idea of a cash transaction for airplay so scares them that
they run to other practices that can't be accounted for,'' said Sky
Daniels, general manager of the trade publication Radio and
Records.
	   Murkier methods could be record companies giving radio
executives free concert tickets to use or give away, or flying in a
hot band to play at a station-sponsored concert _ stunts that don't
show up on a spreadsheet.
	   Some companies are bypassing radio altogether and becoming their
own music programmers. This summer, Island Records produced a
half-hour TV show on two of its artists, Tricky and Pulp, who have
achieved critical acclaim but little radio airplay. The show aired
on local access cable channels in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago
and elsewhere.
	   Columbia and A and M created their own radio or television shows
to spotlight their artists. A and M calls its program ``Cafe
Sound.''
	   The cable channel Access Entertainment Network was created
earlier this year as an outlet for musicians who couldn't get their
videos played on MTV or VH1. Record companies flocked to network
president Bill Bernard, which he sees as a symptom of their
frustration.
	   ``I figured it would be a little slow in the rollout,'' Bernard
said. ``I thought we'd have a lot more convincing to do. But the
initial response was that this was a great idea.''
	   Access Entertainment Network makes no secret that it's a grand
music infomercial. Along with the videos, it contains company
programming like ``Cafe Sound'' for example, and regular shows made
by the record chain Best Buy and Spin magazine. So far, it's
available only at odd times in about 6 million cable homes.
	   It's not the only way music marketers have seized opportunities
to expose new music.
	   Movie soundtracks are almost like mini-radio stations on CDs,
and consumers have lapped them up this year. Victoria's Secret and
Pottery Barn, retailers not traditionally involved in the music
business, sell their own custom compilation CDs.
	   In true 1990s synergy, Atlantic Records placed some of its music
on ``Dawson's Creek,'' the TV serial popular with teen-agers on the
WB network, Atlantic's corporate partner in Time Warner. Sales of
Edwin McCain's song, ``I'll Be,'' rose dramatically when it was on
the series' season finale, Shapiro said.
	   Atlantic has also signed a deal with the Continental Basketball
Association to play its music at arenas. Island arranges to have
videos played on television sets stacked up in department stores or
in art house theaters before a movie.
	   ``When the audience is sitting still doing nothing but thinking,
why not have them listen to music?'' Alexis Aubrey, Island's
marketing director, said.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The first time composer Andre Previn met a
scruffy, unshaven Rodney Gilfry, he was impressed. He had found his
Stanley Kowalski.
	   Previn has set Tennessee Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire''
to music, with Stanley sung by Gilfry, a handsome, 6-foot-3-inch
(1.9-meter) California baritone sometimes termed ``the hunk of the
opera.''
	   The San Francisco Opera will premiere the opera Sept. 19.
	   Lotfi Mansouri, general director of the San Francisco Opera,
suggested Gilfry to Previn. So Previn attended Gilfry's performance
of Benjamin Britten's ``Billy Budd'' at Covent Garden in London.
	   Weeks passed before both men happened to be staying at the same
hotel in Vienna, Austria, and could have a breakfast meeting.
	   ``I had been in rehearsal for a concert for four days and hadn't
shaved,'' Gilfry says. ``I was about to shave that morning. Then I
thought, `You're not going to look like Stanley. You're going to
look like a California beach boy.' So I didn't shave. I put on a
big bulky sweater, to look tough. I slicked my hair back.''
	   When they met, Gilfry greeted Previn with a tough-guy handshake.
``It all went swimmingly,'' the singer says. ``We talked about
music and the role. He seemed to be very happy, like he was
thinking, `This guy will work.'''
	   Four days later, in December 1995, Gilfry and his wife were at
the Kennedy Center Honors banquet in Washington, D.C. He was among
singers in a tribute to one of the honorees, mezzo-soprano Marilyn
Horne.
	   Gilfry spotted Previn at another table and went to speak to him.
Previn didn't recognize him combed and cleanshaven in a tuxedo. So
just in case Previn had second thoughts, Gilfry sent him a video of
his ``Don Giovanni'' _ closer to bad guy Stanley Kowalski than to
nice guy Billy Budd.
	   At the time he signed to sing Stanley, the baritone had never
seen the movie of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' with Marlon Brando
as Stanley.
	   At first he didn't want to see it lest it influence his
portrayal, but finally decided that this ``would be like putting my
head in the sand.''
	   ``The thing that Brando gets that is mystifying is, Stanley
beats up on his wife and you still like him and feel sorry for him.
He's an invincible animal brought to tears. That's a hard thing to
get. Brando is so right on,'' Gilfry says.
	   In the opera, soprano Renee Fleming will sing Blanche and
coloratura Elizabeth Futral will sing Stella.
	   Gilfry, 39, was born in West Covina, Californi. The family moved
to nearby Claremont where he went to school. His father conducted
at the high school and college level. His mother sang in the
Claremont Methodist Church choir, at weddings and funerals. Gilfry
studied music education and physics at California State University
in Fullerton. He still loves science. When he isn't studying roles,
he reads science magazines , works out, and often takes his
mountain bike on performing tours.
	   ``I like to keep myself in shape and some opera directors take
advantage of it,'' he says. ``I have a reputation of being a singer
who can be presented in very physical ways. I've perhaps already
appeared once too often with my shirt off on stage. But Stanley
with his ripped T-shirt, I can't avoid that one.''
	   In college his aim was to teach music, although he did some
small opera roles and won some vocal competitions. But out of
college, singing seemed more appealing than teaching. Gilfry's wife
Tina _ they met as children and married in 1980 _ told him to go
for singing.
	   Gilfry decided to try to become a concert recitalist. Believing
the best route would be as an opera singer who also did concerts,
he auditioned for opera companies. He decided against the San
Francisco Opera's Merola program for young singers, not wanting to
be a student any more, and, with two offers from German opera
houses, accepted Frankfurt instead of Hamburg.
	   ``I was promised 11 roles in the first season,'' he says. ``My
idea was to learn the repertoire, become famous and get out in two
years.'' In 1987, four days before his planned debut in ``Cosi fan
tutti,'' the Frankfurt Opera House burned down. His two years there
were spent performing on makeshift stages.
	   After Frankfurt, he went to the Zurich Opera. ``Zurich had red
velvet and gold leaf. I always imagined, when I was going to
Europe, that I'd be in a house like that. American baritone Thomas
Hampson had been there. He left a void, so I got to do a lot of
lyric baritone stuff and experiment with repertoire.''
	   Gilfry says the most beautiful part of his voice is the top. He
also is most comfortable and has the most stamina singing in his
top register.
	   These days, Gilfry returns to Zurich as a guest artist. The
company is staging a new ``Don Giovanni'' for him in the coming
season.
	   Gilfry made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1996 in Benjamin
Britten's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and will return to sing in
``La Boheme'' and ``Cosi.''
	   This summer he sang ``The Marriage of Figaro'' with the San
Diego Opera and Strauss' ``Capriccio'' at the Glyndebourne Festival
in England. In the coming season he'll sing in ``The Pearl
Fishers'' in Toulouse, France, in ``Manon'' in San Francisco and in
``L'Enfant et les Sortileges'' and ``L'Heure Espagnole'' with
Cecilia Bartoli and the Cleveland Orchestra in Cleveland and
Carnegie Hall.
	   He still likes acting and singing recitals. One dream is to act
in movies or TV in Los Angeles so he can be home more with his wife
and children, 13, 11 and 9.

A meager fall for plays and musicals on Broadway

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Where have all the playwrights gone?
	   Not to Broadway where exactly two new plays are scheduled to
open this fall, and the most anticipated show is an unconventional
ballet extravaganza, ``Swan Lake'' with a gaggle of male swans.
	   The outlook for new musicals before Christmas also is meager,
with no mammoth, eye-catching productions on the order of ``The
Lion King'' and ``Ragtime'' expected to dazzle theatergoers.
	   Before we all say ``Bah, humbug'' and retreat to the nearest
video store, remember that such accomplished writers as Arthur
Miller, Terrence McNally, John Guare, Paul Rudnick and Beth Henley
will have works off-Broadway, all of them in nonprofit theaters.
	   In fact, interest in McNally's play, ``Corpus Christi,''
premiering at Manhattan Theater Club, dwarfs anything else arriving
this fall. Dubbed ``the gay Jesus play'' by New York tabloids, the
drama deals with one man's search for spiritual enlightenment.
	   The play received a blizzard of publicity as well as
condemnation from the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights. MTC canceled the production after receiving death threats,
but quickly reinstated it. Neither McNally nor Manhattan Theater
Club will comment on the production, preferring, their spokesman
says, to let it speak for itself. It talks Oct. 13.
	   Broadway's sparse collection of new plays seems tame by
comparison.
	   Arriving first: ``More to Love'' by Rob Bartlett, best-known as
the full-figured sidekick to radio guru Don Imus. Bartlett has
written a comedy about a large comedian, a man not unlike himself.
He stars _ along with Dana Reeve as his wife and Joyce Van Patten
as his agent. The play opens Oct. 15 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater.
	   Last season, off-Broadway saw Mark Ravenhill's ``Shopping and
... .'' This season, Broadway experiences ``Getting and Spending.''
The play by newcomer Michael Chepiga deals with the good done with
ill-gotten gains from insider trading. Linda Purl plays the
modern-day Robin Hood. ``Getting and Spending'' arrives Oct. 20 at
the Helen Hayes Theater.
	   As for arty and unusual appeal, not much apparently can top
``Swan Lake,'' the classic ballet reinterpreted by English
choreographer Matthew Bourne. In Bourne's version, poor troubled
prince meets swan boy, gets obsessive and dies.
	   The setting has been updated to the 1950s _ ``The House of
Windsor meets `The Manchurian Candidate,''' said one critic _ but
the music is still by Tchaikovsky and the story faithful to the
original. Still, these swans _ all male _ have traded in tutus for
feathery pantaloons and bare chests. The gender-bending production,
already a big hit in London and Los Angeles, bows Oct. 8 at the
Neil Simon Theater.
	   Dancing of a different sort finds its way to the Richard Rodgers
Theater with the arrival Oct. 22 of ``Footloose.'' The season's
first new musical, based on the 1984 movie starring Kevin Bacon,
revolves around a young man who teaches a small town in middle
America to dance. Jeremy Kushnier plays the kid with the fast feet.
Walter Bobbie, who did wonders with the revival of ``Chicago,''
directs.
	   Musical theater of a more serious sort finds its way to Lincoln
Center with ``Parade,'' opening Dec. 17 at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater. The story, adapted by Alfred Uhry of ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' fame, concerns a man wrongfully convicted of murdering a
13-year-old girl. Brent Carver, last seen on Broadway in ``Kiss of
the Spider Woman,'' and Carolee Carmello star. Music and lyrics are
by newcomer Jason Robert Brown.
	   So many musicals have been revived on Broadway in recent years
that Broadway gets two distinctive, if lesser known, shows this
season and one hardy perennial that has been touring the country.
	   ``Little Me'' had an unsuccessful Broadway revival in 1982. Yet
that hasn't stopped the Roundabout Theater Company from dusting off
the Cy Coleman-Carolyn Leigh musical for another look.
	   In 1982, the original starred Sid Caesar playing all seven men
in the life of Belle Poitrine, the ``Little Me'' of the title. At
the Roundabout, Martin Short inherits Caesar's mantle, and Faith
Prince plays the opportunistic Belle. The opening is set for Oct.
29.
	   The Public Theater's George C. Wolfe directed a revival of ``On
the Town'' in Central Park in the summer of 1997. Now, he is
bringing the Leonard Bernstein-Comden and Green musical to Broadway
where it bows at the Gershwin Theater Nov. 19.
	   Newcomers Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Chip), Robert Montano (Ozzie)
and Perry Laylon Ojeda (Gabey) play the three sailors on 24-hour
leave in wartime New York. Lea DeLaria will reprise her role as
Hildy, the tough-talking taxicab driver, and Annie Golden portrays
would-be femme fatale, Lucy Schmeeler, the most glorious name in
all of American musical theater.
	   In a salute to the year ``On the Town'' first opened on Broadway
(1944), all preview performance tickets, beginning Oct. 20, will be
priced between dlrs 19 and dlrs 44.
	   Gymnast Cathy Rigby has staked a credible claim to ``Peter
Pan,'' barnstorming the country for several seasons in the sturdy
musical version of the J.M. Barrie play. Rigby and company play a
seven-week holiday engagement in New York, starting Nov. 20 at the
Marquis Theater.
	   What would Broadway be without its one-man shows. This fall, it
gets three _ including two one-woman presentations.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A circle formed in the crowd of rap
enthusiasts and slowly widened as a DJ played the mechanical beats
of Herbie Hancock's ``Rockit.''
	   Eyes darted around the ring before an athletic 19-year-old guy
who goes by the name of Juice, wearing a tank top and nylon pants,
finally stepped in. Juice swayed his arms and began to step left,
then right, then left again, in time with the rhythm. Suddenly, his
legs shuffled, kicked, dipped, fluttered, twirled and kicked again,
and with one athletic move, he dropped to the floor and spun around
on his back.
	   It was like recalling a lost rite of an ancient civilization. He
was breakdancing.
	   Remember breakdancing? That hip-hop pastime of the early 1980s
when kids everywhere were spinning on their parents' linoleum
floors and exuberantly trying the Moonwalk?
	   Breaking is making a comeback, part of a recent surge in
interest in rap's innocent early days among the generation raised
on harder, harsher ``gangsta'' rap. Performers who've been out of
the big time for almost 15 years now find themselves playing
reunion shows at clubs that don't book contemporary hip-hop acts.
	   They're the pioneers of rap and they're finding a whole new
generation of fans.
	   ``Once again we have a whole crop of kids 20 and under that are
discovering breaking, discovering graffiti, and rap, and saying,
`Yo, I can be a part of this, I can contribute,''' said longtime
rap producer Fred Brathwaite, better known as Fab 5 Freddy. He was
the original host of ``Yo! MTV Raps'' and was one of the headliners
at the recent Wild Style Reunion Jam at the Hollywood Athletic Club
in Los Angeles.
	   ``The young crowd is really embracing the history of it all,
because it was so pure,'' he said. ``Nobody that invented the stuff
was really thinking about making a lot of money. They were really
just trying to have fun.''
	   The Wild Style Reunion Jam drew about 350 people, mostly hip-hop
fans in their late teens and 20s. They watched a screening of
``Wild Style,'' the seminal 1983 movie about rap and hip-hop
culture, and heard some of rap's earliest stars perform.
Grandmaster Flash was on hand, along with Buzy Bee and legendary
breakdancer Crazy Legs from the Rock Steady Crew, whose
headquarters are in Jersey City, New Jersey.
	   The show's promoter, Tony Harris, 25, says old-school rap is one
in a long line of musical forms to enjoy a retro revival in a
culture endlessly fascinated with its recent history.
	   But there's another reason for this nostalgia trip: Many hip-hop
fans, turned off by the violence and negative images in much of
contemporary rap, like old-school for its boastful exuberance and
emphasis on clever rhymes.
	   ``The essence of it is, let's have a good time, let's party,
let's create, let's vibe with it, without all the extra stuff
thrown in just to make it sell,'' said 38-year-old Curtis Brown,
known as Grandmaster Caz, who got started in rap in 1974 and now is
enjoying a second career performing and promoting old-school
culture.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   From ``The Breaks'' by Kurtis Blow (1980):
	   ``Clap your hands, everybody
	   ``If you got what it takes
	   ``'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
	   ``That these are the breaks.
	   ``Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car
	   ``Breaks to make you a superstar
	   ``Breaks to win and breaks to lose
	   ``But these here breaks will rock your shoes
	   ``And these are the breaks
	   ``Break it up, break it up, break it up!''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Frank Nunez, 19, who came to the Hollywood Athletic Club for the
Wild Style Reunion Jam from suburban Montebello, especially likes
breakdancing because of the feeling he gets when he steps into a
circle and shows off his moves.
	   ``I got my little brother doing it now. It keeps you out of
violence,'' he said. ``It gets you hyped up. It's an adrenaline
rush. It's fun. There's no race. It's only breaking.''
	   His friend, Juice, who's so serious about breaking that he has a
tight blue helmet to wear when he spins on his head, adds: ``It's
an element of hip-hop that never should have died. It's the art of
the streets.''
	   Grandmaster Caz celebrated his 22 years with the Cold Crush
Brothers at a July show at Wetlands, a club in lower Manhattan.
Other old-school names like Doug E. Fresh and KRS-One were also
there.
	   Caz feels that unlike most rock or country musicians, who
embrace their elders, few modern hip-hop artists show respect for
the old-school performers who invented the genre.
	   In fact, many old-school artists blame the big-money influence
of large record labels for the changes that washed over rap once
harsher acts like N.W.A got big in the mid-1980s and old-school
started to seem quaint.
	   ``There's nothing wrong with making money by selling records.
Believe me, I'm in this to sell records,'' said Caz, who still
lives in the Bronx, near where he and other early hip-hop artists
started. ``But when it dictates the process ... .''
	   Old-school never dropped completely out of sight, of course.
Groups like the Beastie Boys kept alive many classic elements of
early hip-hop with references in their lyrics and musical samples.
That has made it easy for some hip-hop fans in their teens and 20s
to feel connected to music that was big when they were babies.
	   Even so, that doesn't mean they can breakdance. Fortunately for
them, Crazy Legs gives lessons.
	   As a boy in the South Bronx in the late 1970s, Ritchie Colon
wanted nothing more than to be a baseball player. But that took
money and equipment. So like many of his friends who were left to
their imagination, they made their tattered neighborhood into a
playground.
	   Sometimes, he would hear the rhythms in his head and in the
street and make up dance moves. ``The hallways of a tenement,
that's the ghetto dance studio,'' he said.
	   Ritchie invented so many breakdancing moves and did them so well
they called him Crazy Legs. He showed his stuff in ``Flashdance''
and other movies, and still has a large following, especially
overseas.

Charlie Daniels and his band still on the road after 25 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE EDWARDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Charlie Daniels has performed
everywhere, from smoke-filled, beer-stained honky-tonks to Billy
Graham crusades to most major arenas from coast to coast.
	   Daniels, a fiddler and guitarist who hits the road almost every
week with his five-piece band, has performed twice at the White
House, once at the Super Bowl and throughout Europe. He has done a
casino in Council Bluffs, Iowa; a yacht club in Cape Coral,
Florida, and a chocolate festival in Burlington, Wisconsin. He has
traveled 97,000 miles (156,100 kilometers) this year alone, always
on a bus.
	   He'll play any place, he says, that offers a good crowd and a
good paycheck.
	   But those who associate Daniels with provocative, in-your-face
lyrics should know that at 61, he has softened a bit.
	   His ``Simple Man,'' recorded in 1990, suggested lynching drug
dealers and using child abusers as alligator bait. ``In America,''
released in 1980, delivered a harsh directive to the nation's
enemies. It was this kind of stuff that got him guest spots on
ABC-TV's ``Politically Incorrect'' and the G. Gordon Liddy radio
show.
	   But he has cleaned up the language in ``The Devil Went Down to
Georgia,'' his signature song, about a fiddling duel between the
devil and a guy named Johnny. And in ``Long Haired Country Boy,''
he no longer sings about being ``stoned in the morning'' and
``drunk in the afternoon.'' Now he sings, ``I get up in the
morning. I get down in the afternoon.''
	   He even released a gospel album two years ago, leading to his
appearance with evangelist Graham. ``I guess I've mellowed in my
old age,'' Daniels says.
	   One recent Monday, he took time out from touring for an
interview. He had played in Pittsburgh the day before and was
headed for Gray, Tennessee, the next day. Then it was on to
Louisville, Kentucky.
	   Daniels' Southern boogie, blues and country-rock celebrates the
South, individualism and patriotism. He has made more than 30
albums. The latest, ``Fiddle Fire,'' features blazing fiddle tunes
like ``The South's Gonna Do It (Again)'' and ``The Orange Blossom
Special.''
	   And, of course, there's ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.''
	   Interviewed on the second floor of his log-cabin office 20 miles
(32 kilometers) east of downtown Nashville, Daniels looks like a
character right out of the Louis L'Amour novels that he reads
voraciously. He wears a sky blue Western shirt with longhorn
designs, a huge silver belt buckle, black jeans and his trademark
bull-rider hat. ``We've grown gray together,'' Daniels remarks to
an old acquaintance.
	   An acoustic guitar sits against a wall near an old-time floor
radio. Animal skins are spread throughout the office, whose windows
look out over lush green fields and sprawling shade trees near his
Twin Pines ranch.
	   Daniels takes a seat at a desk and reflects on one of country
music's most enduring careers.
	   The son of a North Carolina lumberjack, he started playing
guitar when he was a teen-ager and then went on to the fiddle and
mandolin. He got into rock 'n' roll, recorded with Bob Dylan and
Ringo Starr, and was featured on albums by artists like Tanya
Tucker, Earl Scruggs and Papa John Creach.
	   His first solo effort came in 1970, and he put together the
Charlie Daniels Band. It released its first LP in 1972 and had its
first major hit with ``Uneasy Rider'' from the second album. With
``Million Mile Reflections'' in 1979, an ode to Daniels' road
travel, the band exploded to worldwide recognition and went on to
win a Grammy award.
	   The following year, Daniels appeared in ``Urban Cowboy'' with
Debra Winger and John Travolta, and became closely identified with
the rise of country music generated by that film.
	   This year, Daniels received the Pioneer Award from the Academy
of Country Music.
	   A pioneer? ``It's hard to cast myself in that light,'' he says.
``But younger guys do tell me they have listened to my music for a
long time.''
	   Daniels will continue to be outspoken and he'll continue to
tour.
	   ``I have never played those notes perfectly,'' he says. ``I've
never sung every song perfectly. I'm in competition to be better
tonight than I was last night and to be better tomorrow than
tonight.''

newly-appointed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov could wreak on

Russia's hyper-inflation and currency devaluation in the early 90's.
(First Run 1500 GMT Europe Late September 12)

MIDEAST: CLASHES  - The West Bank has seen a second day of violent

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Commonwealth Games swimming
program continued to be dogged by problems Sunday when it failed to
start on time for the third consecutive session.
	   Citing technical troubles, the organizers held up the first
event. The meet still had not started 30 minutes after the
scheduled 9:02 a.m. time.
	   The scoreboard clock, source of problems Saturday, had stopped
at 10:20 p.m.
	   The opening night program of finals was held up 25 minutes
Saturday when organizers double booked some sections of seating. It
got under way with overcrowded stands.
	   Saturday's opening morning session did not start on time either,
running almost 10 minutes behind schedule.
	   The scoreboard malfunctioned during the feature race on the
opening night, where Ian Thorpe finished .01 seconds off a world
record. It showed incorrect split times during the race and the
official result was held up for more than 30 minutes because of the
breakdown.
	   Meanwhile, press organizations have written to organizing
committee chairman General Hashim Mohd Ali complaining about a ban
on pool deck interviews.
	   The snafus continued when stadium officials turned out the
lights and locked the doors after Saturday night's program,
trapping the swimming writer for the London newspaper The Times.
	   He said he stumbled around in the dark for about 15 minutes
before he found a way out.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ After a tour of cities wrecked by
floods in southern Mexico, the president on Saturday night
pronounced the flooding the second-worst natural disaster in
Mexican history.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo said only the 1985 Mexico City
earthquake, which killed 10,000 people, was worse. The flooding has
left 400,000 people cut off from the rest of the country and has
forced 20,000 people from their homes.
	   Zedillo met with 10 Cabinet members in the city of Tapachula,
near the Guatemalan border, to lay out his plans for recovery to
the news media. He declared the government response a success.
	   ``We are mounting an operation that has no precedent in our
history,'' he said.
	   The operation includes a temporary work program that will begin
employing 40,000 people on Monday, Zedillo announced.
	   The flooding was sparked by a week of steady rain that swelled
rivers along the Pacific coast of southern Chiapas state. Breaks in
the coastal highway and a parallel railway line have isolated a
100-mile (160-kilometer) stretch of coastline.
	   Although his government has said that more than 100 people died,
Zedillo said that the first systematic count showed that 78 bodies
had been recovered, although he said: ``I totally anticipate that
the number of bodies will be considerably larger.''
	   Zedillo made the statements after a helicopter tour of the
damaged areas. He was surrounded by weeping women in the mountain
town of Motozintla, 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of Tapachula,
where a local official said 12 people died and 18 were missing.
	   ``Don't lose hope,'' the president told relatives of the
victims. ``After many days of national disaster, the first signs of
help are getting through,'' he said.
	   Before breaking into tears, Flavio Vasquez told Zedillo that
``my two children and wife are buried. Our house collapsed. They
have not found them.''
	   Miguel Valdez Galan, the state government's emergency response
director, said helicopters were fanning out across the coast, with
their first priority to rescue people still clinging to perilous
plots of ground near swollen rivers.
	   ``We know what the damages are and we have them prioritized,''
Valdez Galan said.
	   The airborne aid effort was bringing food, water and medicine to
the area, some of it shipped in by land through neighboring
Guatemala.
	   While as many as 1.2 million people were affected by the
flooding, only about 25,000 have gone to government-sponsored
shelters so far, Zedillo said.
	   In Puerto Madero, a port town just south of Tapachula, Reina
Cecilia Fernandez, 19, woke up Saturday with her husband and
1-year-old baby after spending the night on a warped wooden table
on a neighbor's porch.
	   She fled her own home nearby after river water rose chest-high.
``We ran out with what we were wearing and when we came back to
check, everything was gone,'' she said.
	   Fernandez said her family had no water to drink except for the
floodwater that surrounds and fills her house, and they couldn't
afford enough cooking gas to boil the water.
	   ``Yesterday we went to the relief center to get water, but they
wouldn't give us any,'' she said, wading through the street as she
breast-fed her baby. ``So, we're drinking the water that's here,
even though it's dirty.''
	   Mexico's health ministry has flown hundreds of workers to the
affected area, though they are hampered by transportation problems.
	   Two days after the week of rains ended, Valdez Galan said some
flood victims suffered from skin infections, conjunctivitis and
dehydration.
	   Two hundred tons of donated food, clothing, water and medicine
collected by relief agencies, media outlets and government offices
in Mexico City were flown to Chiapas on Saturday.
	   All available helicopters have been pressed into duty, including
some so small that the aid supplies were tied on ropes dangling
below the crafts' landing skids.
	   Zedillo was cynical when asked about charges by the Zapatista
National Liberation Army, which is waging a stalled guerrilla war
in Chiapas state, that the president only notices Chiapas during
disasters.
	   ``These days I've had more important things to do than read
those kind of documents,'' he said.

Revolution 2, Crew 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ The New England Revolution kept
alive their bid to secure the fourth and final Eastern Conference
playoff spot with a 2-0 victory over the Columbus Crew on Saturday
night.
	   Joe Max Moore's sixth goal of the season, at the 35-minute mark
of the first half, proved to be the game-winner for New England
(10-19), which snapped Columbus' five-game winning streak.
	   The victory moved New England out of last place in the Eastern
Conference, one point ahead of Tampa Bay and three points behind
fourth-place Miami.
	   The victory was the first in four games this season for New
England against Columbus, the Revolution having been outscored 11-3
in losing the first three to the second-place Crew (15-13).
	   Ian Feuer, New England's goalkeeper, registered his second
straight shutout and third of the season as the Revolution won for
the second time in the three matches that Walter Zenga has served
as interim head coach.
	   New England, which had beaten Columbus just twice in 11 MLS
meetings, took the lead when Moore curled a 22-yard direct kick
over a defensive wall from the right wing after Revolution forward
Carlos Rocha was tripped just outside the penalty box area.
	   Moore helped set up New England's second goal in the 83rd
minute, when he was tackled hard atop the penalty box area. The
ball squirted loose and Jair scored his third goal of the season on
a 27-yard bullet.

	   In Montreal, pinch-hitter Robert Perez singled home the go-ahead
run in the seventh inning to lead Montreal past New York.
	   New York's loss coupled with Chicago's dramatic victory over
Milwaukee, dropped the Mets a game behind the Cubs in the NL

his 31st save.

	   Arias, starting in place of regular shortstop Desi Relaford, is
the first Philadelphia player to have five hits in a game since
1995.
	   Abreu hit a two-run homer off Elmer Dessens (2-4) in the first.

	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Mia Hamm scored two goals and
assisted on four others as the U.S. women's soccer team routed
Mexico 9-0 Saturday at Foxboro Stadium in the opening round of the
Nike U.S. Cup series.
	   The U.S. women, 18-1-2 this year, outshot Mexico by a 34-3
margin before 35,462, the largest crowd to watch a women's soccer
match in America.
	   Kristine Lilly scored twice for the Olympic champion Americans,
while five others players netted single goals.
	   Hamm now holds the American women's record with 99 goals, two
more than teammate Michelle Akers and just nine short of the world
record 108 scored by Elisabetta Vignotta of Italy.
	   The U.S. women scored five first-half goals, two apiece by Hamm
and Lilly. Tiffeny Milbrett scored the third goal and assisted on
three goals.
	   The U.S. women, who have outscored Mexico 21-0 in their previous
two meetings, held a 20-2 edge in shots during the first 45
minutes. Lilly, a 27-year-old forward playing in her world record
160th match, scored at 18:59 and at 41:05.
	   Shannon Martin, Joy Fawcett, Tisha Venturini and Debbie Keller
closed out the scoring in the second half, all assisted by Hamm,
who now has 18 goals and 20 assists this year.

Klim under pressure

 &UR; Eds: new material throughout, UPDATES with Sunday's heats &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World record holder Michael Klim
faced a defining moment in his Commonwealth Games meet Sunday after
a mediocre performance in qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly.
	   Geoff Huegill, who beat Klim at the Australian team trials, set
a Games record in Sunday's heats to qualify fastest for the final,
while Klim was fifth.
	   Klim, who claimed four gold, two silver and bronze to be the
outstanding swimmer at the world championships in January, was
thumped by Ian Thorpe in his first event, Saturday's 200-meter
freestyle final.
	   Klim's life has been full of sponsor commitments since his
success at the worlds and his training background and concentration
are now on trial.
	   Huegill went under the 53.98 seconds set by fellow Australian
Andrew Baildon in Auckland eight years ago to clock 53.34.
England's James Hickman was the first to break Baildon's record,
recording 53.55 in heat two.
	   ``That was alright,'' said Huegill. ``A fast swim was the main
aim.''
	   Klim was second in his heat behind another Aussie, Adam Pine.
Pine also went under Baildon's mark and his 53.51 made him second
fastest qualifier.
	   Canadian 200-meter freestyle champion Jessica Deglau led
qualifying for the women's event ahead of England's Karen Legg and
Australian Olympic butterfly champion Susie O'Neill.
	   Deglau, like O'Neill a stronger butterfly swimmer than
freestyler, led a packed field with two minutes, 02.25 seconds.
	   ``Any one of six people can win the gold medal in this race,''
O'Neill said.
	   Australian Trent Steed was quickest into the final of the men's
400-meter individual medley with four minutes, 23.13, while Hickman
won the other heat to qualify second. The event is without Canadian
Olympic medalist Curtis Myden, who missed the games because of
study commitments.
	   Former world champion Sam Riley dominated qualifying for the
200-meter breaststroke as she attempts to wipe out a poor world
championships.
	   Riley missed a medal in both breaststroke events in Perth but
said she felt strong Sunday.
	   The swimming program continued to be dogged by problems when it
failed to start on time for the third session in succession.
	   Citing technical problems, the organizers held up the first
event for 45 minutes.
	   The opening night of finals were held up 25 minutes Saturday
when organizers double booked some sections of seating. Saturday's
opening morning session did not start on time either, running
almost 10 minutes behind schedule.

Canada's Bessette wins women's 92-kilometer cycling race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Lyne Bessette, a convert
from track to cycling, edged New Zealand's Susy Pryde by one
bicycle length Sunday for the gold medal of the Commonwealth Games
92-kilometer road race.
	   Australia's Anna Wilson finished third after her left foot
appeared to slip off the pedal in the final sprint.
	   All three were timed in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 59 seconds over
roads left slippery by a light rain.
	   The 23-year-old Bessette, in her first year on Canada's national
team, had been a middle distance runner for 11 years before taking
up cycling two years ago. She now is taking leave from university
to train for the 2000 Olympics.
	   Pryde just missed winning New Zealand's 100th gold medal in
Commonwealth Games history.
	   After three laps of the six-lap race, the three medalists and
Louise Jones of Wales had established a lead of three minutes over
their nearest rivals.
	   Soon after the last lap started, the top three left Jones
behind. They traded the lead back and forth until the final sprint.

Peris-Kneebone to run 100-meters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian sprinter Nova
Peris-Kneebone, who lost a court challenge to run in the 100 meters
at the Commonwealth Games, will get the chance anyway.
	   Peris-Kneebone, a former field hockey international and the only
Australian Aboriginal to win an Olympic gold medal, gained a place
in the lineup when Melinda Gainsford-Taylor withdrew Sunday.
	   Gainsford-Taylor has been struggling with a knee injury. She
will still compete in her favored 200-meter race plus the 4x100-
and 4x400-meter relays.
	   Peris-Kneebone will now run the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay.
	   ``I had to make a decision on what my knee could handle,''
Gainsford-Taylor said. ``It was really hard because obviously it
was an event I really wanted to run.''
	   Peris-Kneebone, who took the Australian selectors to the Court
of Arbitration for Sport over her omission from the 100-meter
event, said she was delighted to be running but disappointed for
her teammate.
	   ``Obviously I'm very excited and I just hope she gets up and can
run a good 200-meter,'' Peris-Kneebone said. ``If there's someone I
don't mind running second to its Melinda.''

Government crowds march through Phnom Penh in show of force

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of government supporters
marched Sunday in a show of strength aimed at intimidating
opposition protesters calling for the ouster of strongman Hun Sen.
	   After battling vastly outnumbered opposition backers for the
past two days, the pro-Hun Sen crowd spent Saturday night in the
city's main sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage
a mass peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of
bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters, many of them trucked in from surrounding
areas, said they would occupy the grounds until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out in the run-up to the first meeting of the newly
elected National Assembly.
	   The move would make it difficult to hold large-scale protests
against the government, which has banned opposition rallies from
the capital but allows its own backers to roam freely with clubs
and other weapons under police protection.
	   About 250 opposition protesters gathered near the U.S. Embassy
and home of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The Hun Sen
crowd passed within two blocks, but unlike previous days made no
immediate move to attack them.
	   The prince and his ally, Sam Rainsy, challenge the results of
July 26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition parties allege massive fraud and have
threatened to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form
a new government.
	   Hun Sen launched a violent crackdown to end weeks of peaceful
protests Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He was not
home and no one was hurt. He has blamed opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, who accuses Hun Sen of staging a pretext for a crackdown.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed and scores
injured after Hun Sen unleashed his police, soldiers and political
supporters at the opposition activists. Scores have been injured.
	   Human-rights workers found a body in a shallow grave Sunday, but
it was too early to tell what the man had died of.
	   A morning rally at the stadium by the Hun Sen crowd was peaceful
until supporters destroyed a cigarette stand after spotting
opposition backers nearby, who ran away.
	   Truckloads of helmeted police with Kalashnikov rifles patrolled
the streets and scanned the city from rooftops. On Saturday, they
openly weighed in on the side of the Hun Sen crowd in street
battles.
	   ``By coming here, we want the opposition to stop the
demonstrations,'' said Prak Sakhan, 43, a Hun Sen backer. ``The
three parties should start having a dialogue.''
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's victory in
parliamentary elections July 26.
	   But Ranariddh has said that though he wants to avoid bloodshed,
he would rather face arrest than accept an election victory for Hun
Sen he says does not reflect the will of the Cambodian people.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Ranariddh said Saturday, referring to the dead Khmer
Rouge leader whose regime caused the deaths of up to 2 million
people in the 1970s.
	   The past week's violence has been the worst since Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year.
