<HEADLINE> China Protests Right-Wing Japanese Landing on Diaoyu Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China is indignant over Japanese
right-wing activists violating China's territorial sovereignty by
once again illegally setting foot on the Diaoyu Islands, which are
an integral part of China.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman made this remark here
today in reply to a report that members of the Japan Youth League,
a Japanese right-wing group, once again illegally landed on the
Diaoyu Islands and established a so-called shrine there on April
20.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the fact that the Diaoyu Islands and its adjacent
islets have been an integral part of China since ancient times,
the spokesman added that China also strongly resents the Japanese
government's disregard of the consensus reached by the two
countries, and its irresponsibility in taking a laissez-faire
attitude toward the misdeeds of the Japanese right-wing activists.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made clear its solemn stance to Japan
through diplomatic channels, adding, "We strongly demand that
Japan honor its commitment, restrict the ring-wing activists, and
prevent similar incidents from recurring."
</P>
<P>
As to whether or not the ring-wing activists established the so-
called shrine on the Diaoyu Islands, according to the spokesman,
the Japanese side said this needs to be determined. China has
urged Japan to make a prompt investigation into the incident, and
give an explanation in a responsible manner, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Musharraf Proposes Pakistan, India Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Saturday proposed a summit meeting
between Pakistan and India to resolve the longstanding Kashmir
issue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, General Musharraf said, he would
certainly like to talk to Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee, "the person who is in charge and who is going to decide".
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said that he is prepared to meet face to
face with the Indian prime minister to discuss the dispute over
Kashmir, a Himalayan area for which the two South Asian neighbors
had fought two of their three wars.
</P>
<P>
"We will be open, very frank, very flexible, very practical and
very realistic but it is the Kashmir issue which we have to
address," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said these talks should be held in a neutral country,
preferably in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Pak-India dialogue was disrupted last May when intense fighting
broke out along the Line of Control which divides the two
archrivals in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has, since his assumption of power in last October,
repeatedly iterated that his government is willing to hold talks
with the Indian government on the Kashmir issue.The Vajpayee
cabinet, however, has ruled out he possibility of resumption of
dialogue with Pakistan in the foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> IPU President Calls for Understanding to Achieve Peace, Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The president of the 103rd
conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Najma Heptulla,
on Sunday called for more understanding between different nations
and cultures to pave the way for peace and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Heptulla, who is also deputy chairperson of the Indian Rajya
Sabha (upper house of parliament), made the appeal in her keynote
speech at the opening ceremony of the IPU conference in Amman,
which is attended by a record 138 delegations and some 1,400
participants.
</P>
<P>
Dressed up in a traditional Indian Saree, Heptullah said the
prime theme of the meeting was to promote peace and dialogue
between civilizations and cultures, which was also part of the
preparations for the United Nations year of dialogue between
civilizations in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the dawn of the new millennium had brought
about a great opportunity and a great challenge as well to the
contemporary world, and she called on participants of the
conference to work on finding ways to understand each other across
nations and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The president said the building of understanding hinged not only
the prospect for global peace in the new century, but also the
success of the global trade system.
</P>
<P>
"We must first understand each other's civilization values,
because these deeply influence social and economic patterns," she
said.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the conference, she said that the IPU must work
to strengthen its ties with the United Nations while adopting a
blue print for inter-parliamentary cooperation in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd conference opened here Sunday evening with a record
138 delegations and some 1,400 parliamentarians and representatives
of international organizations taking part in the six-day bi-annual
event.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1889 and now has 144 members representing
different countries and territories, is the largest international
parliamentary organization.
</P>
<P>
Its conference serves as an important forum for legislative
bodies from countries under different political systems to conduct
dialogue and parliamentary diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Calls For Attention on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Sunday called on participants of the 103rd conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) to pay attention to the widening
gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
In a key-note speech at the IPU conference, which opened here
Sunday evening, Abdullah also called for more dialogue between the
North and the South.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic success achieved by the world
community in the past century did not succeed in bridging the gap
between the haves and have nots, and many poor countries have
lagged behind as the world economy has charged forward.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said many people are now still living in absolute
poverty as a decade ago, and half of the world's six-billion
population live on less than two U.S. dollars a day, while in sub-
Saharan Africa, 46 percent of its population live on less than one
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates of the impoverished countries expected the IPU
meeting to call, in its final statement, for forgiveness of their
debts, greater participation in global economic decision making,
increased aid, exports and greater technology transfers to
underdeveloped countries, the monarch said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Jordan believed the effect and magnitude of
economic impoverishment supercedes that of political conflicts and
regional strife, and casted its shadows on the discussion between
countries and religions.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed his confidence that the IPU meeting would
produce results and recommendations on political, economic, social
and cultural spectrums of global affairs.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's meeting is promoting world peace,
stability and development as well as providing a forum for the
exchange of views on current world affairs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Abolish Laws Restricting Press Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- All legislation that had hampered
the smooth dissemination of information to the public will soon be
repealed by the national assembly, Nigeria's Senate President
Chuba Okadigbo said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Okadigbo as saying in the
west Africa' s capital Abuja Sunday that the country's top
legislature had concluded arrangements to debate the validity of
the laws.
</P>
<P>
He said he was optimistic that within the shortest possible
time, both houses would repeal those found to be undesirable.
</P>
<P>
Although there had been some "excesses" on the part of the
media, the national assembly believed that it would be wrong to
stifle the press and that all legislation that had restricted its
smooth performance should be repealed, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent crisis in the national assembly, Okadigbo blamed
the press for partly engineering it, saying while some of the
architects of the crisis are within the executive arm of
government, others are at the national assembly itself, with the
press used to fuel it.
</P>
<P>
He said that while disagreements and differences were bound to
occur in a democratic setting, a most important ingredient during
such encounters was "mutual respect for each other", instead of
one arm having to interfere in the business of the other.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Team Urges Israel to End Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EILAT, Israel, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian negotiating
team urged here on Sunday the Israeli government to end immediately
its settlement expansion in the West Bank in order to move the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Telling a joint press conference with his Israeli counterpart
Oded Eran after their Sunday afternoon talks, Palestinian chief
negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said the Palestinian side regarded the
settlement expansion in the West Bank as a very serious matter
which could harm the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side can not accept such a settlement expansion
policy of the Israeli government and I have expressed our concern
to Eran about this matter and urged the Israeli government to
cancel immediately this decision," Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government decided on Thursday to build another 174
new housing units for settlers at Maale Adumim settlement, east of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side strongly opposes this decision. Rabbo said
earlier before the talks with Eran that such a decision of the
Israeli government at this moment is very dangerous to the final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
On the same issue, Eran said that during the Sunday afternoon
talks, he will relay the concern expressed by the Palestinian side
to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"I will convey the position of the Palestinian side to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak," Eran said, adding that anyway, the Israeli
delegation expressed its warm welcome to the resumption of the
final-status talks at Eilat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government will follow and implement all agreements
signed with the Palestinians and the Israeli delegation hopes that
this round of talks can produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
According to Rabbo, the two sides mainly discussed the
settlement issue in the afternoon discussions.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks, which started here Sunday afternoon,
will conclude on May 12.
</P>
<P>
As the talks going on inside the Hilton Hotel, dozens of
Israelis demonstrated outside the hotel, urging the Israeli
delegation not to compromise on all key issues which will be
tackled in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Besides the settlement issue, the two sides will also have to
settle the fate of Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugees, borders and
water in the final-status talks. Moreover, the two sides have also
to decide on the scope of Israel's troop redeployment in the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Plan to Hand Over Arab Villages Draws Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plan to hand over three Arab villages on the outskirts of
Jerusalem to Palestinian self-rule encountered severe criticism
from rightist parties on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon, one of
Barak's most closed confidants, confirmed earlier in the day that
the government does plan to transfer Abu Dis, Azariya, and Swahara
to full Palestinian control in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The transfer, according to officials in Barak's office, would
serve as a good-will gesture to the Palestinians in advance of the
final Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which is due to happen by June.
</P>
<P>
The three villages are currently marked as Area B, which is
under Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control. The
pullback from these villages is due to be approved by the cabinet
meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"These areas are areas that are today also under almost complete
Palestinian control," Ramon reportedly argued in an interview with
Israeli Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
However, his remarks invited immediate attacks from rightist
parties, especially two of the ruling partners in Barak's
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Barak on the issue, Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky, leader of the Russian immigrants' Yisrael
Ba'aliya Party, said that he opposes the handover at this stage.
</P>
<P>
National Religious Party leader and Construction and Housing
Minister Yitzhak Levy stated that if the Barak administration
abandons these villages prior to the final status agreement, it
will quit the government.
</P>
<P>
Levy predicted that any withdrawal map including these villages
is destined to be defeated in the Knesset (Parliament). If Barak
chooses to bypass the parliament, the party would join the
opposition in no-confidence motions' vote against the subject, Levy
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The threats to quit by these two ruling partners signal the
great cabinet trouble Barak faces, as two other parties in the
coalition are also threatening to quit the government if their
demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox religious Shas Party and its left-wing foe
Meretz Party are currently fighting over the control and the funds
allocation of Shas's religious school system.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the Arab villages near Jerusalem has been the
controversial topic several times since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Barak's top aides had flied several test balloons about the
approval of the handover. However, the plan was dampened every time
due to great pressure from rightist parties, which are afraid that
the transfer would remove a significant bargaining card from
Israel's hand in talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
They also warned that the transfer would encourage the
Palestinians' demands on Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its "
eternal and indivisible capital" and the Palestinians consider its
eastern part as the future capital for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh are main supporters of handing over the
villages as confidence-building measure before the resumption of
the Israeli-Palestinian talks in Eilat.
</P>
<P>
The talks are designed to resolve such thorny issues as the
status of Jerusalem, the return of refugees, the fate of Jewish
settlements, water, security and border.
</P>
<P>
According to a series of interim deals between the two sides,
Israel should carry out a final withdrawal from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip by June before they reach a final peace deal, which is
due to take place this September.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Barak and his confidants have been
promoting an idea to transfer about three percent of the land as "
down payment" and incorporate the rest into the permanent status
agreement.
</P>
<P>
To Barak's embarrassment, the Palestinians had reportedly
rejected the transfer of these Arab villages, fearing the gesture
would sacrifice a larger territorial compromise in the final status
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we will be able to agree on the percentages, and
only then will be able to discuss any advance payment. But how can
one speak of advances without first agreeing on the principle --
that is to say, how much will be handed over to us?" chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel's Ha'aretz daily
during the weekend.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The new U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator for Iraq, Tun Myat, arrived here on Sunday evening, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Tun Myat told the INA that he will try hard to
make the U.N. oil-for-food program a success, stressing that the U.
N. humanitarian program has failed to meet the needs of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Tun Myat, a native of Myanmar and official for the World Food
Program, was named by the U.N. as the new U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator for Iraq on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Tun Myat replaced Hans Von Sponeck, who resigned at the end of
March to protest the failure of the U.N. humanitarian program in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tun Myat has a law degree from the University of London and has
worked for the Rome-based World Food Program since 1979. He has
served as director of recourses and external relations since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian coordinator is in charge of supervising
the oil-for-food program which began to be implemented in late
1996, under which Iraq is allowed to sell oil to buy humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people suffering from the U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Calls For Attention on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Sunday called on participants of the 103rd conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) to pay attention to the widening
gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
In a key-note speech at the IPU conference, which opened here
Sunday evening, Abdullah also called for more dialogue between the
North and the South.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic success achieved by the world
community in the past century did not succeed in bridging the gap
between the haves and have nots, and many poor countries have
lagged behind as the world economy has charged forward.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said many people are now still living in absolute
poverty as a decade ago, and half of the world's six-billion
population live on less than two U.S. dollars a day, while in sub-
Saharan Africa, 46 percent of its population live on less than one
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates of the impoverished countries expected the IPU
meeting to call, in its final statement, for forgiveness of their
debts, greater participation in global economic decision making,
increased aid, exports and greater technology transfers to
underdeveloped countries, the monarch said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Jordan believed the effect and magnitude of
economic impoverishment supercedes that of political conflicts and
regional strife, and casted its shadows on the discussion between
countries and religions.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed his confidence that the IPU meeting would
produce results and recommendations on political, economic, social
and cultural spectrums of global affairs.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's meeting is promoting world peace,
stability and development as well as providing a forum for the
exchange of views on current world affairs.
</P>
<P>
A record 138 delegations with some 1,400 parliamentarians and
representatives of international organizations are taking part in
the six-day biennial event.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1899 and now has 144 members representing
different countries and territories, is the largest international
parliamentary organization, and its conference serves as an
important forum for legislative bodies from countries under
different political systems to conduct dialogue and parliamentary
diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Arrested for Attending Berlin Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative revolutionary
court on Sunday arrested six Iranian reformists for attending the
controversial conference on Iran held in Berlin earlier this month,
but released two of them on bail.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrants were issued for the reformist journalist
Akbar Ganji, lawyer Mehrangiz Karkhayran Sedehi, a printing house
director Shahla Abdollahzadeh Lahiji and student leader Ali
Afshari, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ganji was imprisoned on April 22, Sedehi and Lahiji were
detained on Saturday while Afshari was jailed on Sunday after the
preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
However, Ezatollah Sahabi, a member of the opposition group Iran
Freedom Movement and another journalist Hamidreza Jalaeepour were
set free on bail after appearing at the court.
</P>
<P>
The six were charged with involvement in activities against
national security, direct and scandalous propaganda against the
political system and its Islamic elements
</P>
<P>
A group of others have also been subpoenaed on similar charges,
the agency said without mentioning their names.
</P>
<P>
Another arrest warrant has been issued for reformist cleric
Yussefi Eshkevari, who had not returned Iran after attending the
conference held on April 7-9 by the Heinrich Boell Foundation on
Iran after the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Iran's powerful conservatives launched nationwide condemnation
on the conference and accused the reformists of advocating "U.S.-
style reforms in Iran," which the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei strongly rejected.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came amid an intensified crackdown on the reformist
allies of President Mohammad Khatami by the powerful conservatives,
which has led to the closure of a dozen of reformist papers and
jailing of journalists in the past week.

<HEADLINE> Reelected Shevardnadze Sworn in as Georgian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Eduard Shevardnadze, who was
reelected as Georgian president for a second five-year term, was
sworn in in Tbilisi Sunday in front of the national parliament
building.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, who won 79 percent of the votes in the elections
on April 9, said a key task of his next five years in office would
be "the restoration of the country's territorial integrity," the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The political settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia and the
Tskhinvali district (the former South Ossetian Autonomous District)
is very important," Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Georgian leadership attaches "prime significance to
the return of more than 300,000 refugees to their homes in
Abkhazia."
</P>
<P>
On Georgia's relations with neighboring Russia, the 72-year-old
president called for a new fundamental treaty between the two
countries, saying the old one, which was never ratified by the
Russian lower house of parliament, had grown outdated.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to think about the drafting and signing of a
new fundamental treaty between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The document should be one that deepens "the cooperation of
Georgia with its great neighbor, Russia," Shevardnadze said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Foreign Minister on Zimbabwe's Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Sunday that the
political upheaval in Zimbabwe could not be solved without
addressing the issue of land distribution.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma made the remarks on South African Broadcasting
Corporation' s Newsmakers program.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis cannot be solved in one meeting, it is a process
that needs to be followed up," Dlamini-Zuma said, referring to a
meeting between President Thabo Mbeki and his counterparts from
Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe on April 21 to find a solution to
the crisis in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"They must address the underlying problem, the problem of
land," Dlamini-Zuma added.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people have been killed since February in
Zimbabwe's political violence and war veterans have seized about
1,000 white-owned farms in the run-up to elections.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma said all the parties had agreed that the land
issue had to be addressed, and it was unfortunate that the
question of land distribution had flared up again so close to
elections.
</P>
<P>
She said the South African government was confident that
Zimbabweans would make every effort to ensure the coming elections
were free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the South African government was slow to react to the
crisis in Zimbabwe, Dlamini-Zuma said it was "human and common
decency" not to condemn another person without having all the
relevant facts.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important for society to understand that we want to
 influence people without condemning them," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative that South Africa maintained good political
relations with countries in Africa, she said.
</P>
<P>
South African businesses must feel confident that the
government can solve any problems they may experience in other
African nations, she said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Keen to Develop Ties With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is keen to develop relations
with Iraq and the bilateral ties will surely witness a great
expansion after the lifting of the U.N. embargo on Iraq, a visiting
Egyptian state minister said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Egyptian Products
Fair, Mokhtar Khatab, Egyptian state minister for public business
sector, said that holding such an exhibition in the Iraqi capital
is a significant step in the development of Iraqi-Egyptian ties.
</P>
<P>
The fair, which will last for one week, exhibits products of
food, medicine, electricity, agriculture and air conditioners
manufactured by Egyptian companies.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister arrived here on Saturday evening for a
visit to promote bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Trade ties between Egypt and Iraq, within the framework of the
U.N. oil-for-food program, have been steadily developing in recent
years, said Khatab, adding that Egypt has signed contracts worth
more than 300 million U.S. dollars with Iraq under the current
seventh phase of the oil-for-food deal, which was launched in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian deal allows Iraq to export a limited
amount of crude oil to finance the imports of food, medicine and
essential parts for its oil and electricity sectors.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian firms have signed contracts worth 1 billion dollars
with Iraq so far, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Finance Hikmet Mizban Ibrahim, who was also
present at the ceremony, expressed the hope that the bilateral
ties, based on mutual understanding, will expand for the benefit of
both countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Grants Amnesty to 4 Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei has commuted the death sentences on four students for
their involvement in the July unrest to 15 years in prison, the
judiciary announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The death sentences on Mehrdad Sohrabi, Ahmad Batebi, Abbas
Deldar and Akbar Mohammadi would not be executed upon Khamenei's
amnesty proposed by Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi
Shahroudi, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The four students were found guilty of being involved in the
unrest last July, which was triggered by a police crackdown on
student hostels of Tehran University to break up a protest rally
against the closure of a reformist newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The unrest, which caused three deaths, was the worst one since
the 1979 Islamic revolution and the trial on 20 policemen for the
dormitory crackdown is going on in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary has recently closed down 17 dailies
and periodicals, mainly the mouthpieces of the reformist allies of
President Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Minister Praises Singapore Way of Facing Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore minister Sunday
praised the key principles and trust established through common
experience as his country's characteristic approach which will
enable Singaporeans to meet the challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the May Day Dinner of the National
Trades Union Congress of Singapore Sunday evening, Minister for
Health and Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang summarized
the Singapore Way as having four key features, namely, personal
responsibility, partnership, pragmatism and pre-emption.
</P>
<P>
By personal responsibility, Lim meant that individual must be
motivated to make the required effort and change to overcome the
problems that confront him."
</P>
<P>
Partnership means that the individual is not left alone to
struggle all by himself. Rather, "We ensures that he or she gets
adequate financial and social support from the government, the
unions, business, and the community."
</P>
<P>
"By pragmatism, I mean that we have no ideological hang-ups.
Instead, we look for the most practical, efficacious and sensible
solution," adding "In turn, this requires us to be flexible and
adapt, to change if circumstances changes," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Pre-emption,the minister said, means that it is better to plan
and act early rather than late and it is of crucial importance for
Singapore to set aside resources for the future and to stay ahead
of the curve given its small size and lack of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong were also present at the dinner.

<HEADLINE> Indian Army Begins Probe into Ammunition Depot Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Staff Court of Inquiry headed by Major General C. B. Suku
began the probe at the ammunition depot. The probe team consists
of army explosive experts and frontlines commanders.
</P>
<P>
Though preliminary reports suggest that the fire began in a
heap of dry grass outside the perimeter of the depot and spread
inside due to high velocity winds and high temperature, army
authorities do not rule out sabotage which explains the unusual
ordering of Staff Court of Inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 tons of small arms, armor and artillery ammunition
stocked in 20 open plinths were destroyed in the fire, which broke
out Friday and was completely put out Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra ruled out
sabotage behind the incident and said that as per his information
till last night, there was no evidence of sabotage in the fire at
Bharatpur ordnance depot.
</P>
<P>
"What we understand is (the fire was caused by the) negligence
of local laborers," he said, adding it was one of the suspicions
and the truth would be known after a thorough probe.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the toll in the fire had risen to
five with two of the injured succumbing to injuries. The
casualties, all civilians, were caused by shrapnel.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leaders Leave for Djibouti Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 45 politician,
traditional leaders including faction leaders Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
General Mohamed Sheikh Osman have left Mogadishu Sunday to
participate the Djibouti reconciliation conference on Somalia
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The delegates, officially invited by Djibouti government, will
attend the opening ceremony of the Somali conference due to start
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 others representing clans and different community
sectors are expect to depart on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to try to bring a central government
to the war-torn Horn of African country which has had no
government for more than a decade. However, the departure of the
delegates has intensified the situation to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the departure of Ali Mahdi, subclans within his Abgal
clan are exchanging heavy gunfire Sunday in Karan district not far
away from his residence.
</P>
<P>
The Eli and Rer-Matan militiamen have already blocked several
streets forcing the public transport buses within Karan district
to stop.
</P>
<P>
There are no casualty figures available at this early stage
since the fighting still continues, but killing and revenge-taking
attacks by the two sides has already claimed more than 10 in the
past three days.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here in Mogadishu, the main
traditional leader of the Marehan clan dominating the border
region of Gedo together with several other traditional leaders
have been taken away by allegedly Ethiopian forces in Bulo Hawo
town on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHF radio reports the Ethiopian soldiers
controlling Bulo Hawo and Dolow towns of Somalia have forcefully
taken away Ugas Omar Ugas Hirsi and six other traditional leaders
and across the border to the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here in Mogadishu by the Somali
National Front (SNF) Marehan faction, more than 30 traditional
leaders including the main Ugas (traditional leader) of the clan
have been abducted by the Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Jama Howleh, the SNF spokesman, said the Ethiopian
forces aim at sabotaging the Djibouti conference which as he put
it the Marehan clan see as a positive step in finding a government
for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
There had been a large gathering by the rival sides of the
Marehan clan in Bulo Hawo town since early last week in an effort
of ending the political differences between the rival SNF
politicians led by General Omar Hajji Masalleh and Ahmed Sheikh
Buraleh. General Omar Hajji Masalleh has not attended the
conference himself, but his traditional leaders and subclan
representatives have been playing his role.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that General Massaleh's supporters have felt
that the Ethiopians are willing to nominate Colonel Abdirizak Bihi
as the new chairman of the SNF faction, and therefore preferred to
rebel from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known about the fate of the Marehan abducted
traditional leaders.

<HEADLINE> Rally Held in Tokyo to Protest Tokyo Governor Ishihara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 250 people including foreign
residents in Japan on Sunday staged a rally in Tokyo to protest
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara's recent derogatory remarks
against foreigners, the Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, featuring 18 speakers including scholars and
journalists, called for continued actions against Ishihara,
including a campaign to have him removed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rally was held partly in response to Ishihara's use earlier
this month of the term "sangokujin", which literally means "people
from third countries" and was used as a derogatory term after
World War II for people from the former Japanese colonies Korea
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, Ishihara asked Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force to
be prepared for rioting by illegal aliens in the event of a major
earthquake, saying, "Atrocious crimes have been committed again
and again by sangokujin and foreigners who have illegally entered
Japan."
</P>
<P>
Pak Kyong Nam, an essayist of Korean descent, said Japanese
tend to forget controversial issues as time goes by and keep them
ambiguous. They should never do so this time, she said.
</P>
<P>
Business consultant Shin Sug Ok, a third-generation Korean in
Japan, called Ishihara's remarks as "inflammatory and insincere."
</P>
<P>
Pak and Shin are among those who have established a citizens
network seeking Ishihara's resignation over the remarks.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, French journalist Etienne Barral suggested
taking court action against Ishihara over his remarks, while Kang
Sang Jung, professor at the University of Tokyo, proposed
publishing advertisements protesting the Tokyo governor.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara expressed regret in a statement April 20, saying his
use of the controversial word was "inappropriate" and pledged
never to use it again.

-- 1,500-year-old Stone Buddha Heads Recovered
</P>
<P>
Seven stone Buddha heads dating back 1,500 years were recovered
recently in Cangxian County, north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Local police conducted an intensive criminal investigation
after the stone heads were stolen in November. They were found
near the site of the Buddha statues of the Tang Dynasty (618-907).

-- Crocodile Prototype of Dragon: Archeologists
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists say studies prove that the crocodile is
the prototype of the dragon, a sacred, mythical animal which has
long been a symbol of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Their conclusion was based on research of the earliest image of
the Chinese dragon, which was formed out of clam shells about 6,
400 years ago. Archeologists unearthed the sculpture in 1987 in an
ancient tomb in the Yangshao relics in Puyang City, Henan Province.

</P>
<P>
The wooden statue belongs to an ancient temple near Xuzhou City,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bright Prospects for Mainland, HK IT Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's mainland and its Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have huge potential to
tap in jointly developing information technology (IT) because of
their complementary advantages, experts have claimed.
</P>
<P>
"The complementarity of the two is obvious," said Vice
President of Chinese Academy of Engineering Zhu Gaofeng, who was
here to attend a IT forum from April 28 to 29.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has top brains, has made well-based basic
researches and has substantial market demands, Zhu said. Hong Kong,
on the other hand, has ample funds supplies, business talents and
wide links with the outside world, which makes the region highly
complementary to the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's opinion was shared by government officials, experts, IT
professionals, entrepreneurs and investors attending the forum
with the theme "Prospects and Business Opportunities for
Cooperation Between the Mainland and Hong Kong," focusing on
exploring prospects and business opportunities for cooperation
between the IT industries of the mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Siu Yu Bun, Principal Assistant Secretary for Information
Technology and Broadcasting of HKSAR, believed Hong Kong IT
ventures will play an important role, especially after China
joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"China's WTO membership will bring immense business
opportunities to Hong Kong, since Hong Kong has well-established
trading partnership with mainland provinces and cities," Siu said.
</P>
<P>
In the IT and telecommunications sector, the opening of the
mainland market will give Hong Kong ventures much leeway to
develop, facilitating their investment in the mainland and Hong
Kong, Siu said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong can also finance IT researches in the mainland and
find markets for mainland IT products, said Siu.
</P>
<P>
Noting some Hong Kong government institutions have included
China enterprises information into their websites and some
colleges and enterprises are cooperating with their inland
counterparts to carry out IT researches, Siu believed such kind of
cooperation will be furthered in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's mature and sound finance and banking
systems will ensure Hong Kong's position as a fund-rasing center
for China's IT ventures, Siu said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has always been the preferred fund-raising center for
mainland enterprises, and 97 percent of China enterprises with the
central government's approval to go listed overseas have chosen to
be listed on the Hong Kong market, Siu said.
</P>
<P>
The newly-launched Growth Enterprises Market will serve as a
platform for more new local and mainland high-tech enterprises,
especially IT-related ones, to raise capital and find cooperation
partners.
</P>
<P>
Siu also believed Hong Kong, as an international city within
the Chinese territory, is well positioned to be an Internet
information center in China and an information center for the
Chinese-language communities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders attending the forum agreed that China's entry
into the WTO will create unlimited opportunities for both Hong
Kong and the mainland's IT businesses, and Hong Kong's IT industry
should shift its role and expand cooperation with their inland
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
With a sound service system and rich experience on world market,
Hong Kong's IT businesses can help their inland counterparts build
up international competitiveness, said Tony Hau, chairman and
managing director of CM Telecom International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The two-day IT forum, which has drawn some 400 officials and
experts from Hong Kong and China's mainland, is viewed as a major
event to explore cooperation opportunities between the mainland
and Hong Kong IT industries.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Unveils New Tourism Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A new tourism logo containing
fresh signature of "City of Life" designed to promote the vigorous
image of Hong Kong was unveiled here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Launched by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), the logo
is formed by a combination of "Hong Kong" in both English and
Chinese and a brush stroke. "City of Life," the creative essence
of the logo, is well presented through the signature's form,
typeface, typographic arrangement and color.
</P>
<P>
"Developing this credible new profile and positioning of Hong
Kong as Asia's top international city is a challenge," said Amy
Chan, executive director of HKTA.
</P>
<P>
The future success of the City of Life campaign will be
dependent on alliance and product development, Chan stressed,
adding that the campaign has been the anchor for different
promotions launched both in Hong Kong and in cities around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new "City of Life" signature, she said, "We
have now moved the concept forward to further encompass our
history and culture. This is our new identity and I believe it
will be a successful portrayal of Hong Kong."

CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The 11th International Furniture Fair, MODEKO' 2000,
held in Izmir, southwestern Turkey, has come to a successful end on
Saturday, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The fair drew the attendance of 107 domestic companies and firms
from seven foreign countries, including Germany, Greece, Israel and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chamber of Wood Works and Furniture Association
Mustafa Kara said that Turkish furniture sector had developed very
quickly and that such activities would help create new markets and
increase furniture export volume.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also holds the potential to compete with the world's
best-known furniture producing and exporting countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The third Eurasian Energy Conference will be held on
May 9-11 in Istanbul, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "A Story of Three Seas: Eurasia's
Energy at the Intersection of Countries." The energy potential of
the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Caspian Sea will be
discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel will inaugurate a fair to be held at
the sidelines of the meeting, which is expected to be attended by
more than 400 people, including the presidents of Georgia,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The fair is organized by the Foreign Economic Relations
Commission, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Cambridge
Energy Research Commission.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has
turned down a plea to impose up to 56 percent tax on steel imported
from Turkey and Venezuela, reported Turkish Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
ITC ruled that cold milled steel imports from these countries do
not harm the U.S. industry.
</P>
<P>
The United States is further expected to refund the charges it
has imposed on Turkish steel since December 1999, when the U.S.
Department of Commerce enforced a temporary tax on grounds that
Turkey was dumping its steel into the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hopes to boost its stalled steel exports under the ITC
ruling.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Kuwaiti government has set aside 400 million
dinars (about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) for construction projects
mainly in the power, water, road and medical engineering sectors,
as well as the 22-million-dinar (72.6 million dollars) Kuwait City
Renovation Project in the 2000-2001 fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
To disburden the public budget, the government has recently
agreed to adopt the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) system and
open the door for multi-source huge investments.
</P>
<P>
The Tender Commission has also endorsed a mega sewerage water
treatment project at 390 million dinars (1.287 billion dollars) to
be carried out under the BOT system by a local and overseas
consortium.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Under a program of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on relieving the debts of the least developed countries, IMF
has agreed to reschedule Yemen's debts of 344 million U.S. dollars.

Yemen's total trade debts are estimated at 420 million dollars. The
rescheduling scheme costs 8.8 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Workers Protest Against Conservative Labor Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Iranian workers on
Sunday staged a rally in front of the Labor Ministry to protest
against a labor bill passed by the outgoing conservative Majlis
(parliament) in March.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the rally, held on the eve of the International
Labor Day on May 1, also condemned the conservative Chamber of
Commerce, Industries and Mines for launching the legislation, which
lifted the requirement to provide workers with insurance coverage
in small workshops with less than five workers.
</P>
<P>
Reformist Majlis deputy Soheila Jelodarzadeh called on the
Majlis presiding board to review the legislation and said that the
reform program put forward by President Mohammad Khatami and
confirmed by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be
carried out in total, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She also blamed the presence of foreign workers in Iran for
depriving Iranian workers of their job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Majlis passed the labor bill, which triggered
angers among Iranian workers, various rallies were held calling for
the cancellation of the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill is believed to be part of a drive by the Majlis to
encourage investment and end a chronic unemployment problem. But,
it will make it easy for small firms to fire workers and pay them
as little money as possible, protesters said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Law, introduced after the 1979 Islamic revolution to
help the economic underclass, makes it almost impossible to fire
workers and imposes employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
The new bill has also met with opposition from organizations
representing labor interests and criticism from the reformist
factions and groups, which won a landslide victory in the February
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The reformist Islamic Labor Party on Saturday night called for
an official recognition of the right to strike as an "indisputable"
right of workers.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement to mark the International Labor Day, the
party termed "strike" as a civil method of expressing protest and
called on the new reformist Majlis to approve a law to govern
strikes in an effort to institutionalize it.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Give Aid to Bangladesh in Combating Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Sunday promised to give Bangladesh all-out cooperation and
assistance in combating Malaria.
</P>
<P>
The WHO's assurance came when a high-level team of the
organization called on Bangladeshi Minister for Health and Family
Welfare Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim at his office.
</P>
<P>
The health minister said malaria is one of the major public
health problems in Bangladesh. The 13 eastern and north-eastern
districts of the country are the malaria-prone areas where 500
malaria patients die every year.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the role of WHO in combating malaria, Selim told
the WHO team that due to poor communication condition,
particularly in the hilly areas, severely ill patients are usually
sent to hospital too late, and death rates remain high even after
proper clinical management.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, drug-resistance of the disease became an
additional serious problem in the management of malaria cases, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The WHO team, comprising Director of WHO Collaborating Center
for Drug Policy Prof. Peter Folb, WHO malaria expert Dr. M. Gomes
and WHO representative in Bangladesh Dr. Hard Jotancjo, agreed to
survey the affected areas and take necessary measures in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
They informed the minister they had already visited some hilly
areas last week to conduct some research work, noting that the
organization will continue to cooperate with the country in
combating the disease and provide necessary financial and
technical assistance.

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following is a round-up of
China's archaeology news for the past week:
</P>
<P>
-- China Tries to Block Auction of Looted Antiques
</P>
<P>
China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) on
April 29 formally denounced Sotheby's and Christie's auction
houses for selling four Chinese national treasures looted from a
Beijing imperial palace 140 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In official letters to the two world-famous auctioneers, SACH
asked that they halt the sales in the Hong Kong.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign HIV Carrier Expelled from Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian who tested
positive for the HIV virus during a medical exam was sent out of
China from the southern city of Shenzhen on Saturday under the
supervision of the local police and quarantine officers.
</P>
<P>
This is the city's forty-ninth case of its kind to date, an
official with the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian was found to have the HIV virus during a
physical check-up required as part of his application for a
temporary living permit in the city, said the official.
</P>
<P>
In order to guard against HIV, Shenzhen has enacted strict
regulations which stipulate that any foreign citizen who applies
for a temporary living permit to live, work or study in Shenzhen
should have a medical exam in the International Travel Health Care
Center under the Shenzhen Quarantine Bureau. Anyone testing
positive for HIV must be deported from China within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Confirmed HIV/AIDS cases throughout China totaled 17,316 by the
end of last year, according to statistics of the Ministry of
Health. But health experts estimate that HIV has actually infected
in excess of 500,000 people scattered in 31 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions across China.

<HEADLINE> New Power Station in Operation on Yangtze Tributary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A major hydraulic power station
built at a cost of 3.7 billion U.S. dollar went into operation
today, three and a half years after construction began.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Qingjiang River on the outskirts of Yidu City,
Hubei Province, the Gaobazhou Hydropower Station has an installed
capacity of 252,000 kw, with a designed generating capacity of
about 898 million kwh a year.
</P>
<P>
The Qingjiang River is the biggest tributary of the Yangtze
River, the world's third longest.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the newly-built station is the second largest on
the tributary following the Geheyan Hydropower Station, which was
built in 1994 for about six billion U.S. dollars with an installed
capacity of 1.2 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Work has begun on the Shuibuya Hydropower Station on the upper
reaches of the tributary, which is scheduled to go into production
by 2008. Estimated cost of the station is nearly 15 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The station is expected to have an installed capacity of 1.6
million kw -- the most powerful of the three leading stations on
the tributary.

<P>
TENGCHONG (YUNNAN), April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tengchong Volcanoes
Tourism Festival opened today at Tengchong County, in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, attracting large crowds of Chinese and
foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
Tengchong County, which borders Myanmar, has 97 dormant
volcanoes believed to be most well-preserved and complete grouping
in China with a lava flow area of 1,038 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As the youngest volcanoes in the world, Tengchong volcanoes are
called a "museum of volcanic geology," where scientists from all
over the world study volcanoes, subterranean heat sources, the
earth's formation and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Open to tourists will be the newly-built Tengchong State
Volcano Park in Shunxiang Township, a suburb featuring
architecture from the Ming and Qing dynasties and a cemetery of
soldiers who died in the War of Resistance against Japan (1937-45).
A fashion show and folk singing and dancing performances are on
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The festival is part of Yunnan's effort to enhance tourism amid
a national drive to develop western China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villagers Report Sighting of Rare Brown Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of villagers in China's
Qinling mountains recently reported seeing a rare brown giant
panda.
</P>
<P>
Described by local experts as "strange, but most good-looking,"
the brown giant panda is the fourth to be spotted in the Foping
National Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of April 26, ten residents of Sanguanmiao
Village, located in the reserve, were planting corn in the nearby
hills when the panda ran past them, said reserve worker Jiang
Tiejun.
</P>
<P>
The villagers quickly reported their sighting to the reserve
officials, describing the giant panda as mostly reddish-brown with
some white fur patches, and "strong and fat."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said reserve workers went to the spot immediately and
could hear the animal munching on bamboo in the woods.
</P>
<P>
Yong Yange, a research fellow at the reserve, said the giant
panda is the same color as one discovered by a group of
researchers in the reserve in 1985, which was believed to be the
first brown giant panda sighting ever reported to officials.
</P>
<P>
A third brown giant panda was seen in 1991, said Yong, who has
studied giant pandas for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species,
with only an estimated 1,000 remaining in western China's
mountains.

<HEADLINE> KMT Members Demand Lee Be Kicked Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The recent remarks by Lee Teng-
hui about his Kuomintang (KMT) Party have continued to fuel the
indignation of KTM members at all levels, so much so that they
want him to be kicked out of the party.
</P>
<P>
Lee, forced to step down from the top post of the KMT, recently
launched another verbal attack against the party, saying that it
is an "outsider" with an old-fashioned name that should be changed.
</P>
<P>
Many senior KMT members, including those from the KMT Central
Standing Committee, have strongly condemned Lee's remarks.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Lee has been more in favor of "Taiwan
independence" than the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and
that if the KMT hopes to be reformed, the "evil legacy" of Lee
must be thoroughly erased.
</P>
<P>
Some senior KMT members noted that in his capacity as head of
the KMT, Lee had shattered party unity and achieved his goal of
giving the island's power to the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Wu Poh Hsiung, a member of the KMT Central Standing Committee,
also pointed out that the reform of KMT should focus on its
content rather than its name.
</P>
<P>
A large number of KMT members at the grassroots level said that
during his 12-year rule, Lee tried repeatedly to undermine the
party.
</P>
<P>
Now, Lee clearly wants to wipe out the party permanently by
changing its name, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
KMT branches overseas, including some based in the U.S. and
Canada, have also begun to call for Lee's expulsion from the party.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Deals Heavy Blow to Malfeasance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's prosecutors have vowed to
deal a heavy blow to officials and government employees found
guilty of malfeasance, warning that abuse of power and dereliction
of duty could jeopardize state interests.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) and nine central
government departments announced Wednesday that they would work
together to handle cases of malfeasance and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The government departments which signed an agreement with the
SPP included the Ministry of Public Security, the General
Administration of Customs, the State Administration of Taxation,
and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, all
regarded as hotbeds of misconduct in office.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to promptly transfer to prosecutors information of
suspected negligence in their own departments, and to cooperate in
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosecutors from across the country who convened
here this week pledged that they "would not be soft on malfeasance
and infringement of citizens' legal rights, which were committed
by government employees" and would intensify investigations.
</P>
<P>
"Along with accepting bribes, dereliction of duty is a type of
corruption which could be even more harmful to the country," said
Li Baotang, a senior official with the SPP.
</P>
<P>
China has taken various measures to prevent malfeasance among
government employees. In the Criminal Law which was amended in
1997, the steepest penalty for this crime was increased from five
years imprisonment to 15.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Deals Heavy Blow to Malfeasance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's prosecutors handled 76,069 cases of malfeasance of
government employees over the past three years, out of which 646
officials involved were investigated or punished.
</P>
<P>
Some 26,827 cases remain under investigation, with the suspects
accused of abuse of power or infringing on citizens' personal or
civic rights.
</P>
<P>
Due to prosecutors' efforts to handle malpractice cases in
state-owned enterprises, direct economic losses totaling 1.45
billion yuan (175 million U.S. dollars) have been prevented over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
However, China's top prosecutor warned that the situation has
not been noticeably improved.
</P>
<P>
"Grave neglect of duty of some government employees has
resulted in frequent and horrifying disasters such as collapsed
buildings and bridges, and fires and explosions. Rash policy-
making by some officials has caused huge losses of state property
which threatens the country's economic safety," noted Han Zhubin,
procurator-general of the SPP.
</P>
<P>
"If the problem is left unsolved, the relations between the
Party, the government and the general public will be jeopardized,
and social stability may be affected," warned Zhao Dengju, deputy
procurator-general of the SPP.

<TEXT>
<P>
The SPP has decided that the prosecutors nationwide would focus
their investigation and prosecution on four categories involving
misuse of administrative power.
</P>
<P>
The first category involves dereliction of duty and abuse of
power by officials above the county level.
</P>
<P>
Cases involving the practice of favoritism, perverting the law,
extorting confessions by torture, and unlawful detention fall into
the second category.
</P>
<P>
The third area includes the misuse of administrative power and
irregularities of law enforcement authorities, especially those
responsible for economic order and security.
</P>
<P>
The violation of legal and democratic rights and interests of
citizens, especially the illegal custody of delegates to the
people's congress, is the fourth classification.
</P>
<P>
In order to help better inform local prosecutors about
malfeasance-related cases, the SPP has encouraged them to report
their findings to the media.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued recently, the SPP asked prosecutors at all
levels to follow news reports about abuse of power to investigate,
while establishing ties with journalists to root out more cases.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Final-Status Talks Start by Qi Deliang, Ma Xiaolin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EILAT (ISRAEL), April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators opened another round of final-status talks in Israel's
southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat on Sunday, in an effort to
reach a framework agreement on final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Abbo headed their respective negotiating
teams to the talks, the third intensive one with the involvement of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo told reporters before the talks that "we intend to have
serious negotiations here and that is why we are here."
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said that the Israeli government's decision to build 174
housing units in the settlement of Maale Adumim, east of Jerusalem,
proves that the Israeli side has no seriousness toward the final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is very dangerous and it will affect greatly the
current round of talks," Rabbo stressed, adding "that shows the
Barak government does not pay enough attention to the this round of
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He said the current round of talks will discuss the settlement
issue.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, who is a member of the Palestinian delegation to
the current talks and chief negotiator on interim issues, also
spoke against the Israeli government's decision on Thursday to
build more housing units in the Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
This decision has constituted another large obstacle for moving
the current talks forward, Erekat said, adding that it is not a
decision of good gesture to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is
scheduled to join next Tuesday the current talks, which will last
till May 12.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have already held two rounds of intensive talks
since March 21 with the involvement of the United States at Bolling
Air Base near Washington, the United States, but no substantial
progress was made.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed last September in
Egypt, the two sides have to reach a framework agreement on final-
status by February 15 and a final-status peace accord by September
13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
But due to slow progress in the talks, Israel has suggested the
two sides reach the framework agreement in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The final-status issues that the two sides have to tackle
include the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian
entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees, the future of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two sides also have to decide the last Israeli
troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Oslo accords signed
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israel has already handed over about 43 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians. Israel has to transfer the remaining
West Bank territories except some military zones and Jewish
settlements to the Palestinians under the Oslo accords.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Peace Now Group Blasts New Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Peace Now, a
nongovernmental organization, Sunday blasted the government for its
approval of publishing new settlement expansion tender.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Construction and Housing Ministry issued a tender on
Thursday for the construction of 174 new housing units in Ma'aleh
Adumim, a mammoth Jewish settlement near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This is the first government tender for building in the West
Bank settlements since Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak imposed a
building freeze last December, a Peace Now statement said Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Gabi Lasky, director of the pro-peace process group, said in the
statement: "Either Barak is reneging on his commitment to a freeze,
or he has lost control of his Government."
</P>
<P>
"Both possibilities are destructive to the peace process.
Continued building in the settlements, particularly building
initiated under the current government, does not accord with a
serious attempt to achieve peace with the Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
The tender was published on the eve of the third-round final
status talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, which
began in Israel's Red Sea resort city of Eilat on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed to reach a framework agreement for the
thorny permanent issues between them, such as the settlements, the
status of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, security,
water and border.
</P>
<P>
It is implicitly agreed in the previous talks that the
settlement expansion in the West Bank should be frozen, except
the "natural growth". However, the Palestinians accused the Israeli
government of utilizing this term to cover settlement construction
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Peace Now stated that the Barak
administration had issued tenders for the building of a further 3,
200 housing units in the settlements in its first five months,
while the rate of the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
administration was 3,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
Under the threats from the Palestinians to boycott the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks, Barak announced a temporary freeze on new
settlement tenders until the conclusion of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the settler leaders had decided to increase their
activities to create accomplished fact on the ground to hold back
further Israeli withdrawal form the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"The 174 units are to be built in the heart of an existing
neighborhood. Never has any government, including Barak's, imposed
a freeze on such building plans," the Council of Jewish Communities
in Judea, Samaria and Gaza said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The council also charged the Peace Now organization with "moving
into the Palestinian camp."
</P>
<P>
In a separated development, Israeli Police Sunday morning
forcibly evacuated a group of Jewish settlers out of a shipping
container, which they had brought in Hebron overnight to expand a
militant settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Settler leaders called on policemen to resist orders to remove
settlers and settlements, claiming that the government has caved in
to Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
Israel controls about 20 percent of Hebron with 400 Jewish
settlers living in military camps there, while about 120,000
Palestinians live in the rest 80 percent, which was returned to the
Palestinian National Authority in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Building Northern Border Fence: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) - Israel's Defense Ministry and
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began to erect security fence along its
northern border with Lebanon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the hi-tech fence, which will act as the
future boundary marker after the scheduled Israeli troops
withdrawal from south Lebanon this July, will begin from the town
of Metulla, nearly 140 kilometers north of Jerusalem, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The fence is regarded by Israeli military officials as a key
deterrent against possible infiltrators from Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas, the Shiite Muslim militant group who has keep on
fighting against Israeli occupation in south Lebanon for decades.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of sensors attached on the fence will report any
attempt to breach the border immediately to the nearby IDF
outposts, in order to nip the possible terrorist attacks against
Israeli northern settlements in the bud.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided last month to end its 18-year-long occupation in
Lebanon and pull its army out of the so-called security zone, which
was set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to protect its
north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, it was reported that Hezbollah and Hezbollah-
recruited fighters from the 300,000 Palestinian refugees in
Lebanese camps will try to infiltrate into northern Israel to
launch attacks.
</P>
<P>
To prevent such things to happen, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak decided to wrap the redeployment plan in an international
legitimate framework, in which IDF will withdraw fully to the 1923
borderline with Lebanon and leave no Israeli positions in Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan had dispatched his
Middle East envoy Terje Larsen to Jerusalem last week to demarcate
the exact borderline.
</P>
<P>
A team of senior advisors and legal experts accompanying with
Larsen discussed the issue with Israeli defense establishment
officials last Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to IDF officers' estimation, of the 150-kilometer
border between Israel and Lebanon, some 40 kilometers of new fence
have to be rebuilt to tally with the 1923 international border.
</P>
<P>
The total expense for the fence building will amount to NIS 80
million (NIS 4 equals one U.S. dollars). The old fence will also be
repaired and upgraded in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In the IDF plan, it will also allocate NIS 400 million for
building new outposts along the borderline, NIS 150 million for
roads to avoid exposing Israeli northern settlements'
transportation to the guerrillas, and NIS 100 million for lighting,
electric gate and other defense measures at these settlements.
</P>
<P>
The IDF military posts currently on the Lebanon side of the
borderline will be blown up once the new fence is completed,
preventing them from falling into Hezbollah hands.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Ministry Director-General Amos Yaron revealed
last Thursday that the total cost of "protection package" after the
redeployment will be at least NIS 1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Israel had hoped the United States will take part in the fence
construction, diverting some of the cost to the U.S. military aid
budget to Israel. However, the Americans ignored the request.

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A non-stop air route between
Shanghai and New York was recently opened by the Air China and the
American Northwest Airlines based on a code-share agreement.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang's Visit to Turkey Fruitful: Chinese Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Ankara Yao
Kuangyi has said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Turkey is
an important step for comprehensive cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Yao made the remarks during an interview with Mehmet Guler, the
General Director of the semi-official Anatolia News Agency and
other senior editors as well.
</P>
<P>
The most important achievement of Jiang's visit to Turkey
between April 18-21 was that "the two heads of state had put
forward their political determination to further improve friendly
relations between the two countries," Yao said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expected that Turkey and China will set up closer
relations within framework of principles of mutual respect,
security, equality and joint development through this fruitful
visit.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the two important documents signed during the
visit concerning the energy cooperation and Joint Economic
Commission meeting's protocol, which was aimed at increasing the
bilateral trade volume which currently stands at 800 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yao recognized that there is a serious imbalance against Turkey
in the trade volume with China, saying that China is ready to take
all necessary measures to change this condition.
</P>
<P>
He said that both countries have agreed to enhance cooperation
in the fields of railways and energy, adding that China is ready to
assist Turkey in construction of hydroelectric power plants.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that frequent exchanges between the two
countries in the fields of culture and sports will be another
achievement of President Jiang's visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He expressed wishes that China and Turkey, the two biggest
countries in the eastern and western sides of Asia, should further
develop cooperations in all fields through Jiang's signigicant
visit to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Majlis Speaker Defends Closure of Reformist Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Sunday defended the recent closure of 17
reformist papers and periodicals by the conservative judiciary,
saying it was not crackdown on press freedom but frustration of
enemies' conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
No one wants the closure of the press, but there are certain
groups who are opposed to the principles of the Islamic Republic
and are taking advantage of the competition between the inner
forces, Nouri said at an open session of the outgoing parliament.
</P>
<P>
These groups affiliate themselves to a certain faction inside
the country, take control of the propaganda field, indulge in
opposition to the principles of Islamism, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is not freedom, this is conspiracy," the conservative
speaker stressed, accusing reformist journalists of creating
division through their poisonous pens, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the conservative judiciary has ordered the closure of
17 reformist papers and journals as part of their stepped-up effort
to curb the country's reformist movement growing since President
Mohammed Khatami took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The measure invited criticism from many circles including the
Association of Journalists, the Islamic Commission of Human Rights
and the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, who accused the
conservatives of curbing press freedom.
</P>
<P>
With the campaigning going on for the runoff election of the
sixth Majlis on May 5, many reformers complain that the lack of
reformist papers will be a great disadvantage for reformist
candidates to compete with their conservative opponents.
</P>
<P>
The runoff election will be held in 52 constituencies to decide
the winners of 66 seats. The first round election was held on
February 18, in which 224 of the total 290 seats were decided, with
reformers allied to President Khatami winning more than 75 percent
of them.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops May Use Tear Gas to Rescue Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops are
reportedly preparing Sunday to shoot tear gas into a tunnel in a
Abu Sayyaf rebel stronghold in a last ditch effort to rescue at
least 27 hostages held captive for a month.
</P>
<P>
The local ABS-CBN television quoted an army official as saying
that government troops are guarding the entries to the tunnel,
where some rebels fled after government forces overran the rebel
group's stronghold in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
But the official said that government troops are unsure how
many hostages and rebels may be inside the tunnel where they plan
to use tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting has continued in the area since about 15,00
troops began attacking the camp on Mount Puno Mahajid eight days
ago to rescue the hostages, mostly children seized from two
schools in Basilan in March, the television said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre
said in a radio interview that the government troops have occupied
the stronghold of the extremist group Abu Sayyaf and are now
looking for at least 27 civilians the group has kept hostages for
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
"They (government troops) are thinking of the hostages of the
Abu Sayyaf. They are very cautious in their movements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that government troops have occupied the hill
where the rebel group had established as its headquarters and they
are looking for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that 10 soldiers were killed and some 50
wounded in the week-long rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado told a press conference
Saturday night that the rescue operations are now at the last
stage.
</P>
<P>
But government forces found no trace of the 27 hostages when
they reached the peak of the mountain stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf
in Sumisip, Basilan, Friday, after a day-long fierce gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the Abu Sayyaf rebels have secret
tunnels in the area which they used to escape during the heavy
bombardment and air strikes by the military.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, the Abu Sayyaf, which means "Father of the
Executioner"in Arabic, took away more than 50 people from two
schools in Basilan as human shield after attacking a government
army post. Later, they held 29 of them as hostages and freed the
rest.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the rebels claimed to have beheaded two male
hostages because both Manila and Washington rejected their demands
for the release of their two comrades and three terrorists jailed
in the United States, including Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of
the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. The rebels
' claim prompted the military rescue operations.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Attract More Investors: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said that the most outstanding problem the country still faces in
its development crusade is to vigorously attract more investors
to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks when meeting with the visiting
delegation of the Foreign Committee of the German Federal
Parliament at State House, according to a press release from the
President's Office which is available Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Other challenges include the modernization of agriculture and
lack of access to the European, American, Japanese, Chinese and
Indian markets, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He called for balanced and reciprocal trade between Uganda and
Europe, America and Asia, saying that "Africa is already
mobilizing to reject the prevailing unfair trade regime".
</P>
<P>
"Uganda is looking forward to the participation of big
companies in the privatization program in the country," the
president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign governments' funding of the development of
small scale enterprises in Uganda is most welcome.
</P>
<P>
Carl-Dieter Spranger, head of the delegation, assured the
president that Germany would be glad to participate in the
privatization process in Uganda by investing in economic
ventures, saying that Germany is ready to assist Uganda to set up
a foundation for modernizing agriculture.

HENAN: Chinese archeologists say studies prove that the

animal which has long been a symbol of the Chinese nation.  Their

years ago. Archeologists unearthed the sculpture in 1987 in an
ancient tomb in the Yangshao relics in Puyang city, Henan Province.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hard Oil War Looms Ahead Around Caspian Sea  by Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- In its energy offensive around the
Caspian Sea, the United States has made a fresh headway by
orchestrating a deal on Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline in Washington over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili, Azeri Foreign
Minister Vilayat Guliyev and Turkish Foreign Ministry official
Midhat Balkan, who gathered in the U.S. capital upon "invitation",
initialed agreements which set the legal framework for investment
in the oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey through Georgia.
</P>
<P>
With the package, the three governments are able now to put an
offer to potential investors in the 2.7 billion-dollar, 1730-
kilometer pipeline.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who presided over
the signing ceremony, said that the development was "a major step
forward in the evolution of this east-west energy corridor."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said in a statement that the initialing
brought the project "a critical step closer to fruition."
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the next phase of this effort, when companies
from the United States, Western Europe and Russia will work with
those of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey to transfer
legal frameworks into commercial reality," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, strongly favored by Clinton, will run from Azeri
Capital Baku, via Georgian capital Tbilisi, to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton conspicuously participated in the signing ceremony of
Baku-Ceyhan accord, which was held on the sidelines of the summit
of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Istanbul last November.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Washington favors this oil route, as well
as a gas route running across the Caspian Sea bed from Turkmenistan
to Turkey via Azerbaijan because they avoid Iran to the south and
Russia to the north.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko, speaking at the
World Economic Forum Summit in Almaty, Kazakhstan last Thursday,
said the energy projects in the region can not be finalized without
the participation of Russia, stressing that Moscow should be
involved in tapping the region's vast natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia
will also appoint an ambassador to be responsible for Caspian Basin
energy resources, just as the United States has.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Ankara say that the move signals that Russia will
pursue a more active policy. They also observe that Moscow has
speeded up its efforts to regain its influence in Caucasus and
Central Asia in the wake of Putin's election as president.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of April, the Azerbaijan International Oil
Company issued a statement announcing that prematurely produced
Azerbaijan oil will begin to be pumped along the Baku-Novorossiisk
(Russia's Black Sea port) pipeline in the middle of April.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the Baku-Supsa (Georgia's Black Sea
port) pipeline is operating at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also strengthened its ties with Turkmenistan. The two
former Soviet republics have decided to sign a 30-year agreement on
natural gas supply.
</P>
<P>
In Kazakhstan, a high-capacity oil pipeline is being built from
the Central Asian former Soviet republic to Russia's Black Sea
coast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran issued a thinly veiled warning to the United
States at the World Economic Forum Summit last Thursday that
Washington's attempts to direct the flow of energy from the Caspian
so as to bypass Iran and Russia threaten to destabilize an already
volatile region.
</P>
<P>
"If the (western) big powers intend to make this region an arena
for unnecessary rivalries, the conditions will undoubtedly lead to
instability and insecurity in the region," Iranian First Vice-
President Hasan Habibi told the summit in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Echoing speeches from other delegates during two days of
discussion at the summit, Habibi said that greater cooperation
within the region offers the best long-term prospects. Economy
rather than politics should dictate key oil projects, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Hossein Adeli told
delegates at the summit on Friday that Iran is in talks on building
a 1,500-kilometer pipeline to ship Kazakh oil to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"This is the cheapest, shortest, most economically viable way to
take 1.8 million barrels per day of oil over 1,500 kilometers,"
Adeli announced. " "Once it gets to the Gulf it may be transported
east or west ... environmentally too it is the safest option," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Adeli estimated the total cost of the project at 1.2 billion
dollars, or about half the cost of the U.S.-backed Baku-Ceyhan
pipeline.

During the first round of balloting last Thursday, as the sole
candidate offered by the five parties in Parliament, Sezer won 281
votes, leading on top greatly but unable to pull in the 367 votes
necessary for election.
</P>
<P>
Behind him, the Virtue Party's (FP) Nevzat Yalcintas won 61
votes, the Nationalist Movement Party's (MHP) Sadi Somuncuoglu 58,
Motherland Party (ANAP) member and Parliamentary Speaker Yildirim
Akbulut 56, and the True Path Party's (DYP) Dogan Gures 35.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that despite their inferior positions, the four
contenders seem determined to enter the second round. In the event
that votes will still be scattered, it looks as if Sezer's hope for
election rests not on Monday's voting, but on Friday's third round.
</P>
<P>
Considering that Sezer secured 281 votes in the first round, the
analysts said he is almost assured of victory in the third or
fourth rounds when the threshold is lowered to 276.
</P>
<P>
That FP's Yalcintas ranked second in the first round indicated
that the main pro-Islamic opposition, despite its claim that they
would support Sezer, actually voted for their own candidate.
Securing 61 votes from the FP made Yalcintas one of the two highest
scorers, who can pin his hopes on the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Just like the FP deputies, it was reported that deputies of DYP,
one of the two oppositions, did not vote for Sezer, waiting and
seeing whether the 348 votes possessed by the DSP-MHP-ANAP ruling
coalition would all go to their joint candidate Sezer.
</P>
<P>
Sezer' score showed that some 66 votes went astray from the
three ruling partner parties. The result has lifted DYP's hope for
former Chief of General Staff Gures, who got 35 of the party's 85
votes.
</P>
<P>
The second round of voting will take place on Monday, during
which if the other candidates do not withdraw, it is not expected
that anyone will secure the required 367 votes. So, analysts said
that it is almost certain that Sezer will be elected in the third
round on May 5 and become Turkey's 10th President.
</P>
<P>
But DYP deputy leader Hasan Ekinci worried about lack of
confidence in the ruling tripartite-coalition who offered their
common candidate Sezer and called for the two oppositions to accept
him.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the consensus reached by all five party
leaders on Sezer's candidacy, when it came to the crunch, the
ruling deputies did not back him.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said that in the first round, only 237
votes from the coalition bloc of 351 went to Sezer, adding that the
coalition will have an even harder time in later rounds, if it can
not guarantee their deputies' submission.
</P>
<P>
He warned that crisis of confidence in the government will lead
the presidential election to repetition of the fate of the aborted
constitutional amendment for President Suleyman Demirel's second
term in office last month.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Vice-president Mills Endorsed as Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's ruling National Democratic
Congress (NDC) on Saturday endorsed Vice-President John Mills as
its presidential candidate for December's election.
</P>
<P>
According Ghanaian News Agency report, the endorsement of Mills
by the party at a national delegates' congress at Ho, a city
about 180 kilometres north of Accra, marks the beginning of the
end of the era of President Jerry Rawlings who has dominated
Ghana's politics since 1979 when he led an abortive mutiny.
</P>
<P>
There was no surprise as Mills was the only candidate and the
huge crowd roared in appreciation as a party official read out
his name as the sole candidate
</P>
<P>
Mills, a former law professor, said he would guarantee a nation
of equal opportunities for every Ghanaian in education, health
and politics.
</P>
<P>
He said he would seek the mandate of Ghanaians in December to
build on the foundation of democracy and development initiated
by Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
"I shall form a new government with a team of experienced and
skilful people. I shall draw the experience of both the old and
the new in close consultation with the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no pre-arranged positions and personal
agreement", he said, to prolonged applause.
</P>
<P>
Praising Rawlings for his excellent leadership and dedication
to the nation, which he described as "sometimes unorthodox, but
never self- glorifying," Mills promised to continue with his
legacies.
</P>
<P>
"President Rawlings has said that he will not go anywhere when
he leaves office and we will not allow him to go anywhere. I have
benefited immensely from his strong personality and charisma,
which led Ghana into a democracy that we are all proud of.
</P>
<P>
"I will be knocking at your door morning, noon and night and
you will always be a valued friend and good adviser."
</P>
<P>
Mills talked about the present economic problems, which he
said were foreseen last year. He said there would be
restructuring which will include increased agricultural
production, diversification of exports and the adoption of tough
measures to halt the importation of goods which could be produced
locally.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Stresses Learning From Model Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee, today stressed the importance of
learning from model workers and advanced personnel.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium here to mark the International Labor Day on May
1, Wei, also president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions,
noted that the nearly 3,000 individuals cited in Beijing Saturday
are the outstanding representatives of the Chinese working class.
</P>
<P>
Their thinking and behavior embodies the noble character and
morals of the Chinese working class. They are indeed the nation's
elite, the country's backbone, and the example for the people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The nation should learn from these people, foster lofty ideals
and spirit of selflessness in work, and arm themselves with
advanced thinking and modern science and technology, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, China's modernization drive has entered into
a crucial historic period and this calls for whole-hearted
reliance on the working class and efforts to maintain the
interests of the laboring people.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that as a non-governmental organization under the
leadership of the Party, the country's trade union is the link and
bridge between the government and the masses. It is imperative to
give full play to the role of trade unions at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Wei stressed that the trade unions should fully recognize the
importance of the Party's policy of reliance on the working class,
rally as many as workers around them and protect the legitimate
rights and interests of the workers.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the trade unions should increase efforts to
protect and arouse the workers' enthusiasm and channel it into the
country's reforms and development and the maintenance of social
stability, Wei said.

CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Upon his return from Lusaka after a three-day visit to
Zambia, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said he delivered a
message from President Hosni Mubarak to Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba on the distinguished relations between the two countries
and present conditions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent late Saturday a
congratulatory cable to the Egyptian national handball team,
praising the team's sweeping victories in the African Handball
Championship, currently being held in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian team secured a prestigious triumph after having
beaten Tunisia, the titleholder, 18-15 earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>

-- A senior Egyptian Foreign Ministry official has expressed
belief that the requirements of security and stability in the
Mideast region entail that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
become universal.

Sayyed Qassem El Masri, advisor to Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, warned that failure to seriously address the nuclear
question in the Middle East and the demand that Israel joins the

<HEADLINE> Iran Needs to Pay off over 5.4 Billion U.S. Dollars in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran needs to pay off 5.415 billion
U.S. dollars of its arrears in the new Iranian calendar year which
started on March 20, the local daily Iran reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), the daily
said that Iran's foreign debts to fall due this Iranian year will
increase by 4.118 billion dollars to 5.415 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran's total foreign debts stood at 11.95 billion dollars in
December, including 3.208 million dollars in short term, 7.887
billion dollars in long term, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report put the total debts and foreign undertakings of the
country at 21 billion dollars in December, which also include
probable undertakings and future interests.
</P>
<P>
The CBI Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh said earlier this month that
the country's foreign trade balance was positive last Iranian
calendar year, with the total exports at 19.5 billion dollars and
imports at 12.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total oil revenues topped 16 billion dollars in
the year due to the rising of oil prices following the cut in
outputs by world major oil producers.
</P>
<P>
Iran's total foreign debts by the end of last Iranian year
declined by 25 percent to 10.5 billion dollars as a result of the
positive trade balance, Nourbakhsh said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Ministers to Face Impeachment: Dailies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two pro-reform ministers of Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami's government may face impeachment by the
outgoing conservative Majlis (parliament) amid intensified
conservative crackdown on Khatami's reformist allies, local
newspapers reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi Lari and Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani, both strong supporters of
President Khatami's reform polices, are likely to be impeached,
informed sources told the reformist Iran News daily.
</P>
<P>
The sources said both the ministers have been summoned to the
Majlis to answer questions by the deputies, adding that the two
will also be questioned in the open sessions of the Majlis on
Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line daily Tehran Times also reported possible action
of the conservative Majlis on Mohajerani, saying that a motion will
be tabled in Sunday's open session for the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no official confirmation of the news, but if
true, there are high chances that Mohajerani will be impeached as
the majority of the Majlis deputies are against him, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani has come under scathing attack in recent weeks by
conservative hard-liners for the performance of the reformist
press, and many deputies in the Majlis wish to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a firm advocate of press freedom, was already
summoned for impeachment last May, but after an eloquent defense he
survived.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Musavi Lari is the successor of reform-minded
Abdollah Nouri, who was impeached after nine months in office and
was jailed in December on charge of insulting the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Lari, who inherited Nouri's reformist and opening thought, came
under strong attacks of the conservatives due to the difference
between his ministry and the election watchdog Guardians Council
over the February parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
Suffering a humiliating defeat in the parliamentary election,
the conservatives recently launched an unprecedented crackdown on
the reformists, annulling parts of the February polls, arresting
reformist activists and banning a large number of reformist papers.

<HEADLINE> Manila Claims Basilan Rescue Operations at Last Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops have
occupied the stronghold of the extremist group Abu Sayyaf and are
now looking for at least 27 civilians the group has kept hostage
for more than a month, a senior official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Sunday morning, Presidential National
Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said this was the latest update
he received from field reports in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"They (government troops) are thinking of the hostages of the
Abu Sayyaf. They are very cautious in their movements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said government troops have occupied the hill where the
rebel group had established its headquarters and they are looking
for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that 10 soldiers were killed and some 50
wounded in the week-long rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado told a press conference
Saturday night that the rescue operations are now at their last
stage.
</P>
<P>
But government forces found no trace of the 27 hostages when
they reached the peak of the mountain stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf
group in Sumisip, Basilan, Friday, after a day-long fierce
gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the Abu Sayyaf have secret tunnels in
the area which they used to escape during the heavy bombardment
and air strikes by the military.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, the Abu Sayyaf, which means "Father of the
Executioner"in Arabic, took away more than 50 people from two
schools in Basilan as human shield after attacking a government
army post. Later, they held 29 of them hostage and freed the rest.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the rebels claimed to have beheaded two male
hostages because both Manila and Washington rejected their demand
for the release of their two comrades and three terrorists jailed
in the United States, including Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of
the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. The rebel
claim prompted the military rescue operations.

BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Over 3 billion baht (84 million U.
S. dollars) has been spent in the senate by-election of Thailand
on Saturday, a research body disclosed Sunday.

eligible voters,according to the Thai Farmers Research Center, a
political research body in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The research center noted that the overall expenditure was a
big loss for the Thai economy and the sum should have been
otherwise saved for development projects.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that parties concerned amend the electoral law to
intensify punishment of vote buyers and allow vote-casting by mail
to save the huge expenses of such a by-election.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Expand Rural Power Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will from
this year invest one billion shillings(around 13.5 million U.S.
dollars) to boost electricity distribution to rural areas
targeting market centers, public facilities and social amenities.
</P>
<P>
The enhanced funding, up from 300 million shillings (around 4
million dollars) previously, is aimed at transforming rural areas
into hubs of economic activity and thus boost rural industry and
income generation, the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Gichuru, Managing Director of the Kenya Power and
Lighting company, made the remarks in a written speech on the
role of his company in poverty eradication to a gathering at the
Institute of Engineers of Kenya in the capital Nairobi on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
He said the expansion of the national grid to more areas of the
country had facilitated provision of quality education in both
urban and rural areas, which is necessary for the development of
a skilled human resource.
</P>
<P>
"Besides contributing to eradication of poverty, the supply of
 electricity to rural areas will continue to play a crucial role
in curbing the rural-urban drift and improving standards of
living," he added.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the rural power distribution program is a
 collaboration effort with a Spanish company, Union Fenosa.
</P>
<P>
Gichuru said that his company will soon start the work of
construction of a 220kv transmission line to the Nairobi from
Kiambere and another 132kv line to Rabai from the Kiperu Power
Station.

This statement was made in response to allegations carried by
the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper that EU foreign ministers had
called for the freezing of Mugabe's assets in Europe as a sign of
their concerns over his alleged blatant disregard for the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
In a statement addressed to the Zimbabwe Independent, which the
 newspaper declined to publish, Director of Information in the
Office of the President and Cabinet George Charamba said, "I drew
the President's attention to your article which sought to ascribe
to all EU foreign ministers views that came from a lamentably
uninformed debate in the British House of Commons."
</P>
<P>
"The President asks me to tell you and your readers that he
exhorts the British government, or any other EU government so
inclined to investigate, establish and to please impound
anything, even bhasikoro kana tsono zvayo (bicycle or needle)
found in Europe which is traceable to him personally," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He asks me to tell your readers that he is a proud Zimbabwean
with no reason to seek or secure a future elsewhere, outside of
this small great country he struggled for," Charamba said.
</P>
<P>
"It is this rooted-ness which makes him fail to understand the
 phenomenon of absentee landlordism on Zimbabwean soil, as well as
that of some eminent business people who claim to be Zimbabweans
but show a lack of belief in their own country by externilizing
funds and running accounts in western capitals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He hopes that British parliamentarians can help Zimbabwe
uphold her law by freezing such illegal accounts so our economy
can begin to enjoy its real earnings," said the statement
</P>
<P>
Allegations that the President owned various properties such as
hotels, palaces and fat bank accounts in Europe have been peddled
around by both the locally owned private media and the
international media without any evidence.
</P>
<P>
Although the President has always denied this, some observers
noted that this was being done to embarrass him personally.
</P>
<P>
Hence the refusal by the Zimbabwe Independent to publish his
response.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Indigenous Business Development Centre
said, "The British should stop scandalizing our president in the
international media.  It just demonstrates their dislike for
him."

<HEADLINE> Envoys In Zimbabwe Deny Report On Hosting Foreign Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign diplomatic missions of
Malawi, South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique in Zimbabwe have
denied that they had made arrangements with Britain to have their
countries used as satellite bases for troops to evacuate British
nationals in the event of turmoil in Zimbabwe, The Sunday Mail
reported.
</P>
<P>
The embassies were responding to press reports, which said that
the countries had agreed with Britain to allow specialized troops
to be stationed in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Sunday Mail, South African High
Commissioner Thomas Rambau said that the reports were not true
since he had not received any information from his government to
that effect.
</P>
<P>
"The only arrangements that I know of were those made during
the Cyclone Eline disaster," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Ministry also confirmed that there were
no evacuation plans agreed with the British government.
</P>
<P>
Zambian High Commissioner Dingiswayo Banda said his government
had not briefed him on the plans while Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba expressed support for Zimbabwe's land reform
program, which was at the center of the disagreement between
Zimbabwe and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Malawi High Commissioner also expressed ignorance about the
issue. "I was in Malawi recently and my government never talked
about the issue of course I saw the article but I don't think it
was correct," she said.
</P>
<P>
The reports came out in a local daily newspaper and were also
splashed on the front page of various German newspapers where the
African Business Forum meeting is currently being held.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Zimbabwe Flimm Sritz said he had read the
report in Frankfurt Allgelneine Zeitung, a newspaper in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
He said after consultations with the government officials in
his country it was discovered that the report was false. He said
the report contained wrong information.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Buy Military Equipment From Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government plans
to purchase military equipment urgently from abroad, the Sunday
Times here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government will buy the military equipment to re-equip the
government troops as part of a modernization move and make up for
the losses during the recent military setbacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Officials headed by Defense Secretary Chandrananda de Silva
have begun meeting manufactures' representatives from seven
countries including Russia, Britain, Iran, Israel and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
These meetings with individual suppliers are to ensure that all
deals are government-to-government and no middlemen are involved,
Defense Ministry officials were quoted as explaining.
</P>
<P>
The procurements include day-to-day items and the state-of-the-
art equipment, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The move came against the backdrop of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga's pledge to the nation on Friday night that she would
continue the war effort to militarily weaken the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are trying to recapture the northern Jaffna
Peninsula,their former stronghold, after they captured the key
northern Elephant Pass army base, a strategic military complex
linking the Jaffna Peninsula to the mainland, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have been reportedly suffering a shortage
of manpower and equipment as they face increased pressure from the
Tamil rebels who have been fighting a war against the government
since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
island country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Buys Military Equipment From Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government plans
to purchase military equipment urgently from abroad, the Sunday
Times here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government will buy the military equipment to re-equip the
government troops as part of a modernization move and make up for
the losses during the recent military setbacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Officials headed by Defense Secretary Chandrananda de Silva
have begun meeting manufactures' representatives from seven
countries including Russia, Britain, Iran, Israel and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
These meetings with individual suppliers are to ensure that all
deals are government-to-government and no middlemen are involved,
Defense Ministry officials were quoted as explaining.
</P>
<P>
The procurements include day-to-day items and the state-of-the-
art equipment, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The move came against the backdrop of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga's pledge to the nation on Friday night that she would
continue the war effort to militarily weaken the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are trying to recapture the northern Jaffna
Peninsula,their former stronghold, after they captured the key
northern Elephant Pass army base, a strategic military complex
linking the Jaffna Peninsula to the mainland, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have been reportedly suffering a shortage
of manpower and equipment as they face increased pressure from the
Tamil rebels who have been fighting a war against the government
since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
island country.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Urged to Take Part in Bangladesh Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Under a new regulation to be
approved by the Bangladesh government, foreign banks coming to the
country should participate in all development activities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
While carrying out trade financing and client services,foreign
banks will have to play "satisfactory" roles in the disbursement
of industrial and agricultural credits, the Financial Express
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The view is expressed in a draft policy worked out by the
Ministry of Finance concerning the opening of branches of foreign
banks in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The draft policy will soon be placed before the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Affairs for its approval.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, any foreign bank, which wishes to open a
branch in Bangladesh, should deposit at least 10 million U.S.
dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bank should be financially solvent, well
established and internationally reputed.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Bangladesh and the country, in
which the bank is registered, the volume of trade between the two
countries and its prospect should be taken into consideration
before such a branch is allowed to open.
</P>
<P>
The policy states that at least one out of three top executives
should be recruited from Bangladesh along with other workers and
employees who will be local citizens.
</P>
<P>
Besides, reciprocity should be given to Bangladesh banks by
countries in which those foreign banks are based in regard to the
establishment of branches.
</P>
<P>
The draft policy also stresses that while approving the opening
of branches by a foreign bank, it is necessary to properly
evaluate the overall situation and the possible impact of the bank
and its contribution to the country's banking sector, especially
in case of transfer of technology.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gold Miners Face Sites Shortage: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite a rising demand for gold
in China, the mining sector is running short of proven gold
reserves, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sector is aiming for an increase of 300 tons to 350 tons in
new proven gold reserves and a gold output of 175 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
China now is the world's third largest gold consumer, and gold
demand on the Chinese mainland increased to 205 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
"Although gold demand growth is very encouraging to the sector,
shrinking proven gold reserves have bottlenecked its sustainable
development", the newspaper quoted an government official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dexue, director of the Gold Administration under the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), said that gold reserves
decreased to 2,300 tons by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's gold reserves have been squandered
by small and low-level gold mines, which hold the lion's share of
the total proven gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the SETC and the State Development Planning
Commission are studying how to remove barriers against foreign
investment in the gold industry thirsty for more funds and how to
use foreign investment in risky prospecting for gold resources.

<HEADLINE> More Germans Lose Confidence in Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- More and More Germans have begun
to lose their confidence in the euro after the exchange rate
between the euro and the U.S. dollar keeps on dropping, a poll
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the poll conducted by the German Forsa poll institute,
four-fifths of those surveyed indicated they have lost their
confidence in the single European currency more and less.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who have completely lost confidence in the
euro rose from 24 percent in February to 33 percent, while those
who have full confidence was down from 20 percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank raised interest rates of a quarter
point on April 27, but the increase failed to curb its continuous
slide.
</P>
<P>
Local economic groups and financial experts attributed the
downslide of the euro to a number of factors including rapid U.S.
economic growth, not powerful enough reform in Germany, France and
Italy on tax, social security and labor market, change of the
Italian government and Austria's threat to boycott the euro.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
expressed his confidence in the currency, saying every economic
index either in Germany or in other countries from the euro zone
is much higher than that in the past few years. He said there is
no reason to worry about the weakness of the euro.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Chess Player Draws With Polgar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Grand Master (GM)
Ruben Gunawan forced women's top player GM Judit Polgar of Hungary
to draw in the 46th move of the seventh round of the JAPFA Classic
International Tournament 2000 in Bali, Indonesia, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the Sicilia defense, Ruben insisted he should have been
able to beat Polgar, but he miscalculated in the 35th move.
</P>
<P>
"My white pawn in g6 should have captured hers in f7. But I
was nervous because time was almost up. I only had 15 seconds to
plan five moves, and I saw that Judit also suffered from the time
constraint," Ruben was quoted by the Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three moves later, Polgar's rook threatened Ruben's in e5, and
Ruben saw he could not escape. Both agreed to draw.
</P>
<P>
At other tables, Indonesian GM Utut Adianto failed to overcome
GM Alexander Khalifman of Russia and bowed out in the 38th move;
GM Gilberto Milos Jr. of Brazil, who played it safe during the
tournament, drew with Yasser Seirawan of the United States in the
25 move with the Queen Indian defense.
</P>
<P>
Two matches were still being played as of press time. Russian
chess legend GM Anatoly Karpov was still playing GM Jaan Ehlvest
of Estonia, while at another table, GM Jan Timman of the
Netherlands was facing International Master Zaw Win Lay of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Should Karpov win the match, he would equal Polgar in the
general standing.
</P>
<P>
After seven rounds, Polgar is still in first place with 5
points. The second position was shared by Khalifman and Milos,
both with 4.5 points. Seirawan has 4 points, Utut has 3 points and
Ruben has so far collected 2 points.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soccer Club Aims to Expose Illegal Drugs Mafia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The patron of an Indonesian
soccer club Nurdin Halid said the club would expose the drug mafia
which was supplying drugs to players in the national league.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to uncover the mafia starting with PSM Makassar (a
soccer club in South Sulawesi)," said Nurdin, who is also the
Soccer Association of Indonesia (PSSI) official in charge of
athlete development.
</P>
<P>
PSM striker Kuncoro, who used shabu-shabu (crystal
methamphetamine) before a match on April 12, has been indefinitely
banned from competition. A report from a medical team confirmed
that Kuncoro had used the drug.
</P>
<P>
"Kuncoro admitted he used shabu-shabu, but we really want to
expose the man behind Kuncoro's addiction to illegal drugs. We
believe he was caught by a bigger criminal," Nurdin was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kuncoro wrote a letter detailing the events surrounding his use
of the drug.
</P>
<P>
"I took shabu-shabu on April 11 at 1 p.m. at Hotel Wetan
Surabaya, where the PSM players were staying. But I was framed
and forced by Persebaya player Mursyid Effency," he said in the
letter read by Nurdin.
</P>
<P>
"I was in the bathroom when Mursyid came in with his friend,
who I had never met before. Mursyid asked me to try the stuff. He
said if I wanted to play soccer without feeling exhausted during
the match, I should take it. He kept urging me and I finally
inhaled the drug three times. I already felt dizzy, but Mursyid
kept telling me to take more, until I had inhaled the drugs six
times," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Kuncoro also said he took four Reactivan tablets that day to
ease his muscle aches.
</P>
<P>
Nurdin said: "Based on the laboratory test results, Kuncoro's
blood sample contained an amphetamine derivate and methamphetamine,
which proved he took illegal drugs. As he also took Reactivan, he
also broke PSSI regulations, which stipulate that Reactivan is a
banned substance."

<HEADLINE> Whirlpool to Expand Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The company will not be deterred by price wars on the Chinese
domestic market and will not get involved in the price wars, Jeff
Fettig, Whirlpool's corporate president and chief operating
officer, was quoted as saying in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Price cutting will help win market shares in the short run,
but in the long run, the manufacturers themselves will suffer the
most," he said.
</P>
<P>
Whirlpool specializes in manufacturing nine categories of home
appliances including washing machines, microwave ovens,
refrigerators, and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Eyeing the largest potential market in the world with 1.25
billion consumers up for grabs, Whirlpool will increase investment
and transfer more advanced know-how into China, said Fettig.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the corporation will soon import a new
assembly line from Europe to produce its latest washing machines
for Chinese consumers.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has invested more than 200 million US dollars
in the country during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It has a washing machine joint venture in East China's Shanghai
Municipality and a wholly owned microwave oven company in Shunde
in south China's Guangdong Province. Last year, it reported a
turnover of 200 million US dollars in the country.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Japanese Premier Stress Bilateral Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori Saturday called for
a broader political dialogue and economic cooperation between
their countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the issues of strengthening
political stability in the world, the solution of pressing
economic and financial problems as well as questions related to U.
N. operations in Russia's resort-port of St. Petersburg, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov who attended the talks told the press
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Much attention was paid to preparations for the upcoming Group-
8 (seven West industrialized countries and Russia) summit in
Japan's Okinawa in July, but the territorial dispute between the
two nations was not discussed, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after a four-hour meeting with
Mori, Putin announced that he is "developing a good personal
relationship" with Mori and they reached understandings on a
number of questions.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed on more contacts in the near future.
They are to meet at the Group-8 summit on Okinawa, the APEC summit
and the Millennium Summit at the United Nations in autumn.
</P>
<P>
Mori confirmed he would invite Putin to come to Japan for an
official visit shortly and Putin was said to have gratefully
accepted this proposal.
</P>
<P>
As for global matters, Russia expects a discussion of ways of
coming to a more predictable, transparent and safer world, and a
more fair solution to key international problems, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He expected the leaders of industrialized nations at the
Okinawa summit to discuss "security and disarmament issues."
</P>
<P>
Besides, "we would want the meeting to raise questions of
economic development in the world," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin praised the Japanese leadership for supporting Russian
economic reforms, and said he was glad that the new Japanese prime
minister made his first foreign visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He was sure that Mori's visit would "make a good contribution
to the development of relations between our countries."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mori told journalists Putin and he had agreed to
build closer personal relations between them.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects of a Japanese-Russian peace treaty,
Mori voiced hope that the latest exchange of opinions with Russia
would allow both countries to "continue a serious dialogue on the
matter on the basis of the Tokyo declaration and the Krasnoyarsk
accords."
</P>
<P>
Mori arrived in St. Petersburg Friday evening for a three-day
working visit in Russia, the first leg of his current tour in G-8
countries ahead of the Okinawa summit. He will wind up his trip in
Russia and leave for Rome Sunday.

decreed a "red alert" in the department (province) of Tarija,

died with the same symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The sanitary emergency is concentrated in the city of Bermejo,
bordering with Argentina, the hometown of a 38-year-old man who
died on April 6, and another, 75, who died Tuesday, whose blood is
being analyzed by specialized labs in the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Tarija Epidemiology director Armando Perez said that a 36-year-
old woman was dismissed Wednesday after a hospital treatment.
</P>

Lung Syndrome, a disease with a mortality rate of more than 50
percent, until the examinations are concluded.

<P>
Henicke said that the old man died with "a respiratory problem
and an ear hemorrhage, and did not have a background of contact
with rodents, trips to rural areas, or activities of hunting or
fishing.
</P>
<P>
The first confirmed decease affected a man who was treated in
Bermejo and transferred to the Argentine city of Oran, where he
died several hours later.
</P>
<P>
The Tropical Diseases National Center confirmed that the Hanta
virus was the cause of the death, so the authorities ordered
actions to combat the carriers of the virus, the long-tailed mice
called "Oligorismis caudatus."
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian Health Ministry decreed the "red alert" in Bermejo
and increased the prevention measures in all the region, even if

case, said Henicke.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government
represented by a seven-man panel has refuted the Human Rights
Watch and Amnesty International reports published and disseminated
on April 25-26 this year, Rwanda News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Bumaya said in a statement that
"reports are aimed at undermining the achievements of the
government of National Unity and eroding its credibility."
</P>
<P>
The reports are "based on lies and questionable research
methods whose purpose is to tarnish the image of the newly sworn
in government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement categorically rejected the reports and challenged
them to an open public debate on their accusations.
</P>
<P>
The panel is composed of three Rwandan ministers and four high
ranking officers, including foreign minister Bumaya, Interior
Minister Gakwaya Rwaka, resident Ambassador at the United Nations
and Minister designate for the Presidency Joseph Mutaboba.
</P>
<P>
Rwaka revealed that the Rwandan government spends a total of 12
billion FRW on prisoners per year and the mortality rate in
Rwandan prisons is lower than 1 percent per year where as it is 3
percent for the free Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the current congestion in prisons to the
phenomenon of the numerous genocide crimes.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's Defense Ministry and Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) began to erect security fence along its northern border with
Lebanon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the hi-tech fence, which will act as the
future boundary marker after the scheduled Israeli troops
withdrawal from south Lebanon this July, will begin from the town
of Metulla, nearly 140 kilometers north of Jerusalem, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The fence is regarded by Israeli military officials as a key
deterrent against possible infiltrators from Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas, the Shiite Muslim militant group who has keep on
fighting against Israeli occupation in south Lebanon for decades.

TEHRAN -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has

on Sunday.

The death sentences on Mehrdad Sohrabi, Ahmad Batebi, Abbas

amnesty proposed by Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi
Shahroudi, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The four students were found guilty of being involved in the
unrest last July, which was triggered by a police crackdown on

Palestinian self-rule encountered severe criticism from rightist
parties on Sunday.

Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon, one of
Barak's most closed confidants, confirmed earlier in the day that
the government does plan to transfer Abu Dis, Azariya, and Swahara
to full Palestinian control in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The transfer, according to officials in Barak's office, would
serve as a good-will gesture to the Palestinians in advance of the

which is due to happen by June. (Israel-Palestinians-Arab Villages)

<HEADLINE> Peres Calls for Delaying Resolutions on Refugee Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Regional
Cooperation Shimon Peres said here on Sunday that resolutions on
the problems of Palestinian refugees must be put off until the
withdrawal from south Lebanon, the Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the security cabinet, Peres explained that Syria is
trying to encourage the refugees against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 360,000 Palestinian refugees live in refugee
camps in Lebanon as a result of the Arab-Israeli wars since the
creation of Israel in 1948. Lebanon has repeatedly said that it
will not guarantee Israel's security as the refugees fight for
their right to go home after the Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
There have also been warnings from Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
intelligence that Palestinian resistance movements in Lebanon would
be reactivated due to the security vacuum left by the planned
pullout.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided last March to pull back its troops completely
from south Lebanon by July, with or without an agreement with
Lebanon or its main power broker Syria. It has also formally
notified the United Nations of its withdrawal plan.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent his special
envoy, Terje Larsen, to the Middle East region to discuss the
deployment of international peacekeepers in the vacated security
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is expected
to be enforced from the current 4,500 to 7,000 if it assumes the
peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since it invasion of
the country in 1978. It set up a security zone there in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed aim of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Hezbollah guerrillas, backed by Syria and Iran,
have been spearheading a war to oust the Israeli occupation forces
and the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) from the country.
</P>
<P>
Also at Sunday's security cabinet meeting, which made no
decisions, some ministers said that Israel has a moral obligation
to the SLA militia and must look out for their future in light of
the deep alliance which has existed.

<HEADLINE> South Africa, Nigeria Ready to Join U.N. Peacekeeping in D.R. Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Nigeria have
offered to put its troops at the disposal of the United Nations in
a peacekeeping operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.
Congo), said a summit held here on the situation in the D.R. Congo
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Six heads of state attending the summit welcomed the offer by
Pretoria and Abuja to help end the war in the D.R. Congo, said the
summit in a communique issued after seven hours of discussion.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Algeria, the D.R. Congo, Mozambique, South
Africa, Mali and Nigeria also appealed to the United Nations to
implement rapidly phase two of its peace plan for the D.R. Congo,
which includes a deployment of a 5,500-man international
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
They called for respect for the territorial integrity of the D.
R. Congo while recognizing the "legitimate concern for security in
the neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
They also appealed to all the belligerent countries and sides
involved in the conflict to respect the truce agreement signed
last July in Lusaka, and expressed their support for the plan of
disengagement adopted by the belligerent countries and sides early
this month in Kampala, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state described the result of the summit as "
encouraging" and "a supplementary step in the collective and
continuous efforts of Africa for resolving the crisis in the D.R.
Congo and in the Great Lakes region."
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the D.R. Congo and its ally countries of Rwanda
and Uganda did not attend the summit, which was initiated by
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the current president of
the Organization for African Unity.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Postpones Visit to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office said
Sunday that Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has postponed a trip to
Iran until July.
</P>
<P>
Cook had spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi,
Saturday and new dates were agreed on, the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
The trip, the first to Tehran by a British foreign secretary
since Iran's 1979 Revolution, had been scheduled for May 8-9 but
will now take place on July 4-5.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said a combination of events had
caused the postponement, which he said should not be seen as a
setback in relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran's second round of parliamentary elections was set for May
5 and the final result would not be ratified until May 8.
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously not usual for a foreign secretary to visit a
foreign country during or within a few days of parliamentary
elections," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the action would not influence the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"This rescheduling is not a setback in our relationship with
Iran," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Iran have been cautiously improving relations since
the Iranian government distanced itself from a death edict passed
on British author Salman Rushdie by Iran's late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi became
the first Iranian minister to visit Britain since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation, including
combating drug trafficking, and assisting Iran's efforts to host
refugees from conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two trams collided in north Wales
Sunday, causing 17 passengers injured.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on the upper section of the Great Orme
Tramway near Llandudno.
</P>
<P>
The passengers involved suffered from minor injuries -- mainly
cuts, bruises and whiplash.
</P>
<P>
There were about 40 people in each tram at the time of the head-
on collision, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Conway County Borough Council, which runs the
tramway, said the tramway would be closed until further notice.
</P>
<P>
She added that there had been minor incidents in the past
involving the tramway, which dates back to 1902, but "nothing
serious."
</P>
<P>
The Great Orme Mines and Country Park is a popular attraction,
drawing crowds in the summer months to enjoy the view from the
carboniferous limestone headland and visit the cafe and visitors'
center there.

<HEADLINE> UK Spy Center to Spread Its Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government is to build
a 25 million pound spy center to monitor criminal gangs through
their use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Government Technical Assistance Center (GTAC) is likely to
be used to unscramble coded Internet messages, tap phones and
intercept e-mails.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office, which confirmed the project Sunday, said it
was at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
Details such as when and where it would be built had not yet
been decided, officials said.
</P>
<P>
But it has been suggested that the GTAC could be sighted at the
M15 headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
Fears have already been expressed that the government could use
the center to increase surveillance of the general public.
</P>
<P>
But the Home Office insisted that proper procedures would be
needed to monitor communications.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that there will be mass snooping and
interception is unwarranted," said a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"Warrants will have to be obtained for every interception. It's
very important that we are competing with the criminals and
ensuring that law enforcement agencies have got the tools to do
the job," she added.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary Clears Diary to Focus on Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua)-- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Sunday canceled a planned trip to the Middle East to
concentrate on the crisis in Zimbabwe, the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
His scheduled trip to Iran from 8-9 May has been postponed to
early July.
</P>
<P>
"It's because Robin Cook is very occupied with Zimbabwe. It's a
major item on his daily agenda," a Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said it could not divulge how large a part Zimbabwe was
playing in Cook's workload but it is believed to be substantial.
</P>
<P>
Cook has repeatedly condemned Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe'
s plans to legalize seizure of the white-owned farms without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"The confiscation of farms without compensation would be a big
step backwards. This cannot be a way to solve the genuine problems
of land reform," Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Britain has offered to fund land reform in Zimbabwe because of
its position as a former colonial power.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at seeking an end to the political violence
which saw supporters of Mugabe occupying white farmers' land and
demanding redistribution.
</P>
<P>
"I have said all along that Britain would be prepared to fund a
fair land reform program within the rule of law," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from Zimbabwe said more than 1,100 farms have
been occupied by veterans of the country's independence war.
