<HEADLINE> Forest Fire in South Bangladesh Under Full Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The devastating forest fire in the
world's largest mangrove in south Bangladesh has been under full
control, a local forest officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Returning from the affected areas in Khulna Division, Mosharraf
Hossain, the division forest officer, told local press that with
the joint efforts of the navy and fire brigade department in
cooperation with local residents, the fire had been brought under
full control although it takes some time to fully extinguish the
fire.
</P>
<P>
At least 200 acres of forest area under the Chanpai forest
range of Sundarban have been gutted by a jungle fire presumably
originated on Friday from the honey collectors, the officer said,
adding that the extent of the damage would not be so high as was
apprehended as the affected areas were not part of dense forest
areas but falls within the thinly plantation zone.

<HEADLINE> Iodine Deficiency Disorders Conference Opens In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- About 200 health experts from 47
African countries started a three-day conference in Harare today
to seek ways of eliminating iodine deficiency disorders (IDDS) on
the continent by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme "the sustainable elimination of iodine
deficiency disorers in Africa by the year 2000" the conference
also seeks political commitment to IDDS control and elimination.
</P>
<P>
The delegates have been tasked to find ways of mobilizing
resources for strengthening and sustaining national programmes to
achieve the objectives of eliminating IDDS.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zimbabwe's Minister of Health and Child
Welfare Timothy Stamps noted that elimination of IDDS was one of
the most feasible of the 27 health development goals pledged by
170 countries at the world summit for children in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, IDDS are estimated to affect more than 40 percent
of this southern African country's population of 10.5 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Iodine deficiency does not only affect afflicted families
directly, but also the community as a whole both socially and
economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
he hoped, "the world's mass media should view this topic
seriously."

<HEADLINE> Senior Military Leader on PLA Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- General Liu Huaqing said that the
PLA should select its officers properly and make better use of
them, especially middle-ranking and senior ones, and place the
greatest importance on work at the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks
during an inspection of military forces stationed in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, from April 12 to 22.
</P>
<P>
"The good selection and proper use of officers at all levels is
closely related to the army's political qualities, the absolute
leadership of the Party, the reliability and stability of the
troops, and the inheritance of the glorious traditions of the Red
Army," Liu, who is himself a Red Army veteran, said.
</P>
<P>
"The highest priority in strengthening education and management
of the army is to set high selection standards and place strict
demands on officers, who must be tested well, and educated and
supervised well," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The prevention of bureaucracy and the adopting of a practical
attitude was stressed more than once by Chairman Mao and comrade
Deng Xiaoping in the past. It has been frequently repeated by
President Jiang Zemin," the general remarked.
</P>
<P>
This year the CMC has set a requirement for all army units to
concentrate on work at the grassroot level, he pointed
out. High-ranking officers must go down to stay with an individual
company, making close observation, and meticulously studying it.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, General Liu also visited the Kunming Army Academy
to meet with 115 young cadets from Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet is an inseparable part of the sacred territory of the
motherland," he said. "One day you will become defenders as well
as constructors of a new Socialist Tibet," he told them.

HANOI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will amend its current
foreign investment law this year to guide the flow of the foreign
capital and to improve the quality of foreign investment,
according to authority sources.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Planning and Investment Ministry noted that
the amendment, rather than posing limit to foreign investment,
will encourage foreign investment in big, technology-intensive
projects.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's current foreign investment law came into effect at
the end of 1987. Foreign-funded projects reached 1,325 by the end

<HEADLINE> International CAF Meeting Opens in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
controlled atmosphere and fumigation in stored products (CAF)
opened here today, focusing on advances in research and
development on gaseous treatments applied to preserve durable
agricultural products in storage.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, which is attended by scientists from 27
countries worldwide, aims at exchanging views and announcing
scientific findings by participants, according to the officials at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also targets at finding new methods for the
preservation of various stored products for the sake of the
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Cyprus' Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou said agriculture has lost its leading
role in the Cypriot economy as a result of the island's 1974
Turkish invasion and the rapid progress which followed in other
sectors, but the government continues to ascribe a great deal of
importance to it.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Cyprus "ascribes a great deal of importance
to agriculture, not only because it remains one of the prime
sectors of our economy but also because we believe in its major
role in many aspects of our life, such as the social development
of the rural population, the preservation of our cultural
identity and in the protection of environment".
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou noted that owing mainly to the use of advanced
technology and better land management, the cereal yield has been
increased from one ton per hectare in the early 1970's to the
present 2.3 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said about 90 percent of the needs in
wheat and about 80 percent of the needs in animal feed grains in
the southern government-controlled areas are imported, mainly
from the European community, the U.S., East European countries
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the island's agricultural sector contributed 5.7
percent to the Gross Domestic Product and provided employment to
12.2 percent of the economically active population, according to
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou urged the participants to report on advances in
research and development, evaluate and discuss the alternative
potential methods for the preservation of agricultural products
and called for dialogue between delegates from technologically
advanced and developing nations.

environment should not be at the expense of the well-being of the
people.
</P>
<P>
He warned that environmental degradation in Zimbabwe has over

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton Satisfied with Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton reached an agreement today that
NATO, at the request of Russia, will not speed up its eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference in the Kremlin, the
presidents expressed their satisfaction with their one-to-one
talks held in the Kremlin earlier today.
</P>
<P>
They noted that their five-hour talks, a little longer than
expected, focused on NATO's eastward expansion, the Chechen
crisis, nuclear disarmament and other bilateral and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Yeltsin said Clinton has promised to
influence "his comrades-in-arms" on refraining from speeding up
NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the press conference that his stand on the issue
remains unchanged. However, his position does not affect Russia in
any way, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agenda of today's talks, Yeltsin said that on
the whole they were "a continuation" of Saturday's nuclear summit
attended by the Group of Seven industrialized nations (G-7) and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "discussed issues related to nuclear
disarmament and reaffirmed their readiness to make headway towards
ratification of the START-2 treaty and the conclusion of a treaty
on a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," according to the Russian
president.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Yeltsin also briefed Clinton of the
latest efforts made by Russia for a peaceful settlement of the
Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for his part, stressed that Chechnya remains a part of
the Russian Federation. But he said his country has urged a
political solution to the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States will continue to support the ongoing
reforms in Russia and hopes for "a strong and stable Russia" in
the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said, relations between Russia and the United
States will largely depend on the results of the forthcoming
presidential elections in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed his confidence that he will win the June 16
presidential election. He also said that the two countries'
presidential elections will "have no impact on the policy" towards
their long-term cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the news conference, Clinton suggested that He and
Yeltsin discuss Middle East problems, particularly the Lebanon
crisis, in the next two days and the Russian president agreed to
contact him by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president arrived in Moscow at the weekend for the
nuclear summit and the bilateral talks and is scheduled to leave
for home later today.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Greece over Aegean Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today lodged a protest
against Greece after a Greek patrol boat opened fire on a Turkish
fishing boat in the Aegean Sea early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Greek Ambassador to Ankara Dimitrios Nezeritis was summoned to
the Foreign Ministry and was handed over a note of protest
following the incident during which a Turkish fisherman was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Greece said the Derya fishing boat, with a previous record
of illegally bringing immigrants to Greek islets in the Aegean
Sea, this morning carried eight Iraqi immigrants to the Greek
islet of Strongili, about 500 meters from the Turkish coastline.
</P>
<P>
A Greek coast security boat chased the Turkish fishing boat
and fired only warning shots to the sky, said a diplomat from the
Greek Embassy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish side maintained that the boat was fishing in
the Turkish waters when the Greek boat opened fire on it.
</P>
<P>
However, both Ankara and Athens seem to keep a low key on the
incident which they hope will not influence the planned meeting
of the two countries' foreign ministers on the wings of the Black
Sea Economic Cooperation summit on April 27 in Bucharest,
Romania.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on whether or not the incident would
affect the planned meeting, Greek Ambassador Nezeritis said "No"
when he left the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Local Anatolia news agency also quoted a Turkish official as
saying that Ankara pins great hopes on the meeting which they
expect will give a start to a "serious effort" to solve the
disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over territorial
waters, airspace and mineral rights in the Aegean Sea and over
the divided island of Cyprus.

JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government has
welcomed the arrival of the United Nations Peacekeepers in
Angola's south-eastern Kuando Kubango Province, the South African
Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Windhoek, Namibia's Information and

forward towards peace and stability" in Angola, Namibia's
northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Amathila said he hoped the Angolan government would soon take
control in the region to fight illegal cross-border activities so
that residents on both sides of the border could feel secure.
</P>
<P>
Amathila said Namibia's north-eastern border would remain
closed until the UN peacekeepers consolidated their position.
</P>
<P>
About 200 UN peacekeepers from the United Nations Verification
Mission in Angola, UNAVEM III, crossed the border into Angola
through Kakutji in Western Caprivi in March.

<HEADLINE> China to Give Military Rank to Reserve Army Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The militia and reserve troops
are important parts of China's armed forces, and must shoulder the
country's construction work and defense under the leadership of
the Party.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came at a national work conference on military
rank system for reserve army officers held here today from General
Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, who
added that the "people's army and people's war are our good
tradition."
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also minister of National Defense, said that
national defense reserve forces have been greatly developed thanks
to Mao Zedong's thoughts on "People's War", Deng Xiaoping's theory
on national defense, and Jiang Zemin's exposition of defense
building.
</P>
<P>
To produce a number of qualified reserve military officers is a
guarantee of adequate forces for mobilization for future wars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A law containing stipulations on the rank system among reserve
army officers was approved by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress in May of last year, and the Central
Military Commission recently decided to apply the military rank
system to reserve officers to increase their determination to
dedicate themselves to national defense.
</P>
<P>
Chi also urged that efforts be made to strengthen the
ideological and political education in the army.

<P>
He also said the results reflected the "strong aspiration" of
the people for further pushing forward the reform, developing the
economy, increasing employment opportunities and narrowing the gap
between the north and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that a center-left government will not let the
voters down.
</P>
<P>
The center-left coalition was formed by six parties including
the Democratic Party of the Left, the Party of Communist
Refoundation and the Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
The center-right coalition, which won the last general
election, got only 116 and 246 seats respectively in the Senate
and the Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party and several other small parties have been
excluded from parliament as they failed to gain the four percent
of votes required to enter the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Punish Culprits under Islamic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Interior
Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz said today that four Saudi
nationals convicted of blowing up a U.S. military mission building
would be "punished under the Islamic Shuria (law)."
</P>
<P>
Under the Islamic Shuria, the four culprits will be executed
after they are convicted of committing the bombing last November.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Television broadcast today confessions by the detainees,
naming them as Abdel Aziz Fahd Al-Nasser, Riad Al-Hajeri, Musleh
Al-Shamrani And Khaled Ahmad Al-Saeed.
</P>
<P>
The powerful blast on November 15 demolished the headquarters
of the U.S. training mission and killed five Americans and one
Indian. Sixty others, including 42 Americans, were wounded in the
blast which ripped through the building used by U.S. military and
civilian personnel to train Saudi security forces in the use of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Three islamic militant organizations, the Tigers of the Gulf,
the Islamic Movement for Change and Warriors of God, had claimed
responsibility then for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Interior Ministry had allocated three million Saudi
riyals (around 800,000 U.S. dollars) and the U.S. announced a two
million dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of
the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The U.S also sent a team of 12 federal agents, headed by a
counter-terrorism expert, to back up the investigations. The team
included crime scene and evidence gathering specialists, as well
as experts in hunting criminal fugitives.
</P>
<P>
The four accused said in their confessions they had planned to
carry out other explosions had they not been arrested. They said
they belonged to Islamic societies linked to Arab fighters in
Afghanistan and explained how they joined these organizations.
</P>
<P>
They also said that some of them went to Yemen to buy
explosives and succeeded in smuggling them into the country.
</P>
<P>
Their confession detailed the role of each one of them in the
plot.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry had announced today the arrest of a
Saudi national trying to smuggle a large quantity of explosives
in his car through Al-Haditha post on the Saudi-Jordanian
borders.
</P>
<P>
It also announced the arrest of others related to the
attempt.

PHNOM PENH, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Co-Defense Minister
Tea Banh tonight praised the moral and material support China has
given to his country.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh told a banquet in honor of visiting Chinese military
leader Zhang Wannian that he appreciated China's assistance to
Cambodia during the United Nations peace-keeping operation that
culminated in U.N.-supervised elections in 1993.
</P>
<P>

<P>
China has made longstanding efforts to support Cambodia's
peaceful reconstruction, said Tea Banh.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Zhang's visit would deepen the
traditional friendship between the two countries and peoples and
strengthen their fraternal solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China and Cambodia have sympathized with and
supported each other in the fight against imperialist aggression
and the struggle for national liberation and economic
development. This mutual support has forged a profound friendship,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the policy of friendship towards China and the
correct 'one China' policy pursued by the Cambodian government,"
Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
He said that his visit is aimed at enhancing mutual
understanding and trust, and developing friendship and cooperation
between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and armed forces are well-disposed
toward the development of relations between the armed forces of
the two countries, Zhang said.

countries would progress smoothly through concerted efforts by

<HEADLINE> Solana: More Effort Needed to Meet Dayton Deadlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Significant efforts are still
needed to ensure complete compliance with deadlines laid down in
the Dayton peace accord, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said
today.
</P>
<P>
But the delays were "mainly due to technical reasons rather
than choice or intent," he told a press conference in the
alliance's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Between 200,000 and 300,000 troops of the former warring
parties in Bosnia were to return to barracks, and up to 6,000
pieces of heavy artillery, including 800 tanks, were to be rounded
up by April 19, 120 days after the implementation of the Dayton
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But today, three days after the "D+120" deadline, Bosnian
soldiers have not all returned to barracks and nor placed all of
their heavy weapons in areas designated by the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe George Joulwan said NATO would now undertake more civilian
tasks as long as this does not undermine its primary role.
</P>
<P>
He also said that IFOR had made Bosnia safe for travel and more
than 90 percent of the population can now be reached on roads
which are open and free of mines.

<HEADLINE> Trial Resumes of South Korea's Two Ex-Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan, on trial for mutiny and treason, said today that he was
not aware of any plot to seize power by him and other military
leaders in early 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said at the fifth session of his trial at the Seoul District
Court that he had never heard or known the contents of the
so-called "operations-K" plan, which was displayed by prosecutors
as evidence of a plot to usurp power by Chun and his accomplices,
including Roh Tae-woo, who later succeeded him as president.
</P>
<P>
However, Chun conceded that there was a plan to deal with the
political chaos in early 1980.
</P>
<P>
The plan was part of the martial law measures imposed to
resolve the domestic chaos prevailing at the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was intended to "foster stability conducive to the sustained
expansion of national strength based on military unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, together with 14 former army officers, have been
indicted on charges of mutiny, treason or both, stemming from
their roles in the 1979 military coup and the bloody crackdown on
a civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju, capital of South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who became the army strongman after the 1979 coup, seized
power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation until February
1988. He was followed in the presidency by Roh, who stepped down
in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted on graft charges, for which Chun has already
stood trial twice and Roh three times.
</P>
<P>
The sixth trial session on the mutiny and treason charges will
be held on April 29.

Mogadishu, April 22 (Xinhua) -- At least two female
demonstrators were injured today when unidentified gunmen
dispersed the anti-fighting march in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 women took part in the demonstration against the
continued hostility between General Aidid and his former
financier Mr Osman Hassan Ali Atto in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were carrying slogans against the hostility
with one reading "No more bloodshed, no more civil war, no more
shelling in the city".
</P>
<P>
They were shelled at the city's former October 21 Parade
Ground. It is not yet independently confirmed who fired upon the
demonstrators, however, the gunmen of General Aidid were accused
of dispersing the peace march by the women this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the demonstrators, they planned to settle
themselves along the front line dividing the two opposing
militiamen. They also said they meant to stay there as long as
possible until they make sure that some sort of solution is

JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has decided to
lift a ban on the United States wheat, a government source said

In terms of the agreement, only wheat from the following US
states could be brought into South Africa with a permit obtained

<HEADLINE> 2 U.S. Phone Companies Agree to Big Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Bell Atlantic and Nynex, two
major telephone companies in the U.S., agreed to the largest
merger in telecommunications, a 23 billion U.S. dollar deal that
creates the country's second largest phone company behind AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
The new company will connect 37 million phone lines covering 13
states and the District of Columbia, said a spokesman for the
company. It will offer vastly simplified service to businesses and
consumers in the Northeast, the nation's most important regional
phone market.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most natural partnership in the world," Raymond
Smith, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic, said in a
statement. "We have worked well together for years."
</P>
<P>
Bell Atlantic, as the combined company will be known, will
employ 133,000 workers, will be based in New York City and will
have combined revenue of 27.8 billion U.S. dollars, base on 1995
figures.
</P>
<P>
The two Baby Bells said they will eliminate 3,000 jobs in the
combination, mostly corporate and administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
Nynex's stock was worth about 22.7 billion U.S. dollars as of
Friday's market close. Since Bell Atlantic shareholders will
control a majority of the new company, Nynex's stock value
represents the merger's value.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes just three weeks after the first-ever
combination of regional Bell companies and follows by two months a
sweeping deregulation of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
As a single phone company, Bell Atlantic and Nynex will offer
one-stop service to businesses that operate in their adjacent
regions.
</P>
<P>
A combined Bell Atlantic-Nynex also will be able to offer
competitive prices and innovative custom oriented services,
according to officials from the two companies.
</P>
<P>
Regulatory approval from state and federal agencies is required
before the merger can be completed.
</P>
<P>
Both companies have been talking for months, but a jolt to
accelerate the process came on April 1, when SBC Communications
Inc. agreed to buy Pacific Telesis Group for 16.7 billion U.S.
dollars. That deal united the phone companies serving the nation's
two most populous states, California and Texas, and five others.
</P>
<P>
The Baby Bells were formed by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, which
separated long-distance and local telephone service. Little more
than a decade later, they are combining and jumping into new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Such mergers could have come previously, but the companies
waited until passage of the telecommunications deregulation bill
in February. It provided a clearer sense of how they would be
allowed into long-distance, TV and other previously restricted
businesses.

<HEADLINE> EU Carbon Dioxide Emissions Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- In 1994 total emissions of combustion
from fossil fuel combustion in the European Union (with 15 member
states), which account for most EU man-made CO2 emissions, were
2.7 percent down on 1990.
</P>
<P>
This is showed by latest figures out today from Eurostat, the
Statistical Office of the European Communities in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
combustion in the EU amounted to 3,103 million tons (8.3 tons per
person) in 1994 compared with 3,188 million tons in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said that it was the third year in a row the emissions
fell.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that achievement of the stabilization
goal is still uncertain as several short-term factors contributed
in large part to the fall in CO2 emissions, in particular:
industrial production down, lower energy consumption in Germany,
closure of coal mines in the United Kingdom and conversion of
power-station to natural gas.
</P>
<P>
"As the effect of these factors wears off, increases in CO2
emissions throughout the rest of the 1990s are likely," Eurostat
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the EU member states, Germany recorded the largest fall
in 1994, 9.5 percent, followed by the UK and France, both 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
But some countries had substantial rises due to a shortfall in
imported and indigenous hydropower, which increased their reliance
on coal for electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
The largest increase was Denmark's 18.9 percent. Finland was
13.9 up and Sweden 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Transport accounts for a quarter of all emissions and here the
trend is still upwards, by 7.6 percent between 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly the result of a 7.2 percent rise in the road
transport share. Air transport emissions were up even more, by
13.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 the EU set a target of stabilizing CO2 emissions at the
1990 level by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warships Continue to Block Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warships today continued
to shell the coastal road stretching southward from Beirut to the
south for the fourth consecutive day, thereby cutting the links
between the Lebanese capital and the country's southern part.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli warships shelled an
area around Awali Bridge, four kilometers north of Saida, and the
road linking the two southern Lebanese port cities of Saida and
Sour.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that shots fired by the Israeli warships
hit a civilian car near Zahrani village, Sour, and killed
the driver.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warships also attacked the northern entrance of
Saida city, preventing cars carrying Beirut politicians and
residents from going southward to Kana, Sour, to attend the
funeral for the victims of an Israeli bombardment last thursday.
</P>
<P>
Today is declared as the "Official Mourning Day." More than 100
civilians were killed last Thursday in the Israeli bombardment of
an United Nations Observation Unit where they had sought
shelter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli air raids and bombardments on southern Lebanese
villages today caused no casualties. This was the first day in
which no civilian casualties were registered since Israel
launched the Operation Grapes of Wrath on April 11.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nabatyeh, A Southern Lebanese Town in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOUR, LEBANON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy Israeli air strikes
and bombardments have turned the southern Lebanese market town of
Nabatyeh into a ghost town with shops shuttered and lights turned
off.
</P>
<P>
Nabatyeh, some 75 kilometers southeast of the Lebanese capital
Beirut, is a small town near the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon. It has become the main target of Israel's
continuous air strikes and shelling since April 11.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, Israeli helicopter gunships carried out strikes
on the Nabatyeh Fauga in the eastern part of the town, destroying
a three-story building, killing 11 civilians and wounding 10
others.
</P>
<P>
When Xinhua correspondents arrived in the town on Sunday
afternoon, the town was unusually quiet. Some cats and dogs were
sleeping on downtown roads. Few people ventured far from home,
only several policemen were patroling. Shattered windows and
collapsed walls could be seen in many places. Israeli shells were
frequently flying over in the sky and exploded near the town.
</P>
<P>
At a hotel in the southern port city of Sour, a French
photographer said that he tried to reach Nabatyeh Saturday, but
was stopped by soldiers at a Lebanese post "because it was still a
dangerous place."
</P>
<P>
Rashid Fahs, a Nabatyeh-based cameraman of Lebanon's state-run
Tele-Liban Television, said most of the town's 85,000 Shiite
Moslem residents have fled their homes to the north. The
remaining 10,000 had to stay in shelters, fearing there might be
more Israeli air raids.
</P>
<P>
He said the evacuation of the residents in the town started on
April 12, the second day after Israel launched its military
operation against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, Israel warned residents in most southern Lebanese
towns and villages to leave their homes. Most of the residents in
Nabatyeh fled to Sidon, Beirut and other northern cities that day,
Fahs told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Mugdad, the principal of a public elementary school in
Nabatyeh, said the school has been closed since Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old principal said when the school opens, he will
spend two days to teach his students patriotism.
</P>
<P>
"I will show them around the buildings destroyed by Israel and
ask them to remember the violent crimes committed by Israel on the
Lebanese people," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I insisted on staying here," he said. "I will be
the eyewitness of the Israeli violent acts."
</P>
<P>
At a clinic located at a hillside facing Israel's Dabsheh
position, several Red Cross volunteers were seen to be ready for
emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
Standing on the hillside, Fahs told reporters that Israeli
cannons and howitzers were stored behind the opposite hill.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, a shell was whizzing past over the hillside and
exploded near the town of Nabatyeh.
</P>
<P>
Since April 11, Israel has carried out continuous air strikes
and bombardments on southern Lebanon, leaving over 150 civilians
dead and hundreds of others wounded. The Israeli attacks also
triggered the exodus of up to 500,000 refugees, about one eighth
of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Israel and pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, exchanged
cross-border gunfire on the 12th consecutive day today.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Blamed For Poor Engineering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria government's poor
funding of engineering infrastructure and inadequate incentives
for engineering practitioners has led to a lack of technological
growth in the country, a senior industry source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The government was "only paying lip service" instead of giving
adequate encouragement in terms of remuneration and adequate
insurance policies for craftsmen because of the risks involved in
construction, said Adnowo Sikiru, President of the Nigerian
Association of Engineering Craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that graduates of the Federal Technical College
have been in high demand in the job market of the country.
</P>
<P>
This is a reflection of the place occupied by technicians and
craftsmen in the society, and the government should give necessary
support in this respect, said a vice-principal of the college.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged To Improve Grain Storage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of Zambia Food
Reserve Security Agency Chance Kabaye said today the government
should improve the grain storage system in readiness for this
year's expected bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a five-day workshop on storage of
agricultural inputs and produce here, Kabaye said it would be
shameful to the nation if the expected bumper harvest this season
was poorly managed and wasted.
</P>
<P>
Storage was a top issue during the harvest period and was also
a critical factor in any food security operation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants drawn from 31 districts affected by
last year's drought to take their lesson seriously and
effectively implement the storage management processes when they
went back to their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, funded by the Finnish Development Agency, will
provide the participants with knowledge and skills for adoption of
improved storage system of inputs and grain at community level.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Diversity of Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegate said at the
U.N. human rights forum today that the diversity of human rights
should be underlined in an effort to promote human rights
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Chinese delegate Zhang Yishan made the statement at the 52nd
session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on March
18-April 26 concerning actions following the World Conference on
Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the universality of human rights, Zhang said in his
speech it is a reality that there exist various cultural
traditions and different social systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Western democracy is by no means the only model, not least the
best one. Nations at various stages of development are entitled to
choose their own systems in the light of their own national
conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The West does not have the right to ask the developing world
to copy their model of democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, human rights issues should not be
politicized as a means to pursue power politics, as what has been
done by some of the Western countries, which practice double
standard, being intolerant of different views.
</P>
<P>
All the time, they have been examining only the human rights
situation in developing countries without self-questioning, he
said.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War ended, some of the Western countries have
made the commission a place for a confrontation between the South
and the North, said Zhang, who stressed cooperation based on
equality and mutual respect instead of confrontation is the only
effective way to promote human rights worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Confrontation will only create estrangement, deepen hostility
and hinder the U.N.'s effort to promote and protect human rights",
he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Profit From Hosting Travel Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tourism industry could
expect considerable profits from hosting international travel
conferences, a world leading tourism-related group said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism industry will see a 20 percent increase
in the year after it hosts the American Society of Travel Agents'
(ASTA) 66th World Travel Congress in October this year, ASTA
Chairman Frank Hoak said at a news conference jointly held with
the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 participants, who are expected to attend the
congress scheduled for October 6-12 in Bangkok, will bring some 10
million US dollars to Thailand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cairo, which hosted the 1992 congress, posted a 21 percent
increase in international visitors, while Lisbon, host to the 1994
congress, also reported a significant increase in tour inquiries
last year, Hoak said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand won the bid for hosting this year's congress on
February 11 over Hong Kong, Australia and Brazil, as the board
members of ASTA regard the country as a gateway for tourism in the
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The ASTA, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, is a society
for the American tourism-related organizations with 30,000 members
in 126 countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
The ASTA annual congress will be a bigger event than the
ongoing 45th annual conference of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association held here on April 22-25 which are being attended by
more than 2,000 delegates from the Asia-Pacific region.

ROME, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy's center-left coalition
dominated by the Democratic Party of the Left won a majority in
both houses of parliament on Monday to form the first center-left
government in the country since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
According to official results announced today, the coalition
won 167 of the 315 seats in the Senate and 319 of the 630 seats in
the Chamber of Deputies (lower house).
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi, prime ministerial candidate of the coalition,
told state television that "it was a great victory for the Olive
Tree (center-left coalition) but we will govern for all of Italy."
</P>
<P>
He also said the results reflected the "strong aspiration" of
the people for further pushing forward the reform, developing the
economy, increasing employment opportunities and narrowing the gap
between the north and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that a center-left government will not let the
voters down.
</P>
<P>
The center-left coalition was formed by six parties including
the Democratic Party of the Left, the Party of Communist
Refoundation and the Popular Party.
</P>
<P>
The center-right coalition, which won the last general
election, got only 116 and 246 seats respectively in the Senate
and the Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party and several other small parties have been
excluded from parliament as they failed to gain the four percent
of votes required to enter the parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China is seeking international
cooperation in mechanizing and modernizing its farming, improving
the basic agricultural infrastructure, an official of the
Agriculture Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Changjie, deputy director of the ministry's Farm
Mechanization Department, told Xinhua that priority will be given
to introducing advanced technology, and equipment and management
expertise in planting, animal husbandry, fisheries, forestry, food
processing, preserving, grain storage, and by-products.
</P>
<P>
He said that great attention will also be paid to the
following: introducing technology for upland farming and
water-saving irrigation in north China where droughts tend to be
serious; spreading advanced agro-technology in economically
developed rural areas; promoting plant protection in key grain-
and cotton-producing areas; and farm machinery maintenance.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes foreign cooperation in developing farm machinery
and implements for plant protection, harvesting rice and wheat,
and for melon, fruit and vegetable processing, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Demand for farm machinery has grown since 1995 and supply has
failed to keep up with it, according to a survey conducted by the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is still thought to be a relatively weak part of
China's economy.

<HEADLINE> Dole: Wage Increase Will Win in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole said the minimum wage increase would win vote in the
U.S. Congress, meaning President Bill Clinton would win another
battle in the election-year strategy.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by CBS Sunday, Dole, who had strongly opposed
increasing the U.S federal minimum wage, acknowledged for the
first time that the increase appeared inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration proposed the increase earlier this
year that the federal minimum wage should be raised from the
current 4.25 U.S. dollars per hour to 5.15 dollars over two
years. It said the real purchasing power of the minimum wage
would reach the lowest level in nearly 40 years unless it was
increased.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, who has been active in pushing the
increase, predicted last week that the increase "will happen in
the next week or two."
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans said that a 90-percent increase would
reduce the employment and lift the nation's unemployment rate.
They said that some studies had suggested the increase would
reduce the employment by 400,000 jobs and even more in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republicans in the U.S. Congress have been
criticizing the government more for "playing politics" on the
matter. House Majority Leader Dick Armey noted last week that
"this is an election year" and the "minimum wage has an extremely
high demagogue coefficient."
</P>
<P>
Armey asked why Democrats had neglected to raise the minimum
wage in 1993 and 1994 when they controlled both the White House
and Congress.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to political reality, the GOP has softened its
resistance to the increase recently, especially after 20 GOP
lawmakers supported a bill to raise the minimum hourly pay to 5.25
dollars over 15 months, 10 cents higher than the government plan.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich has told Republicans in the House
that they should prepare themselves to face a vote on the issue --
a vote that would almost surely lead to an increase.
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans would not give in without a fight. Dole
said Sunday, "What we'll try to do, if there is an increase, is to
package it with some other things." He mentioned other measures
that the Democrats oppose, like tax cuts, or as part of a budget
agreement, thereby dooming any increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Union Vice
President Leon Brittan said here today that the Indonesian
national car policy is not contradictory to the principles of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting President
Soeharto, Brittan said that in the opinion of many EU members the
Indonesian car policy is not against any WTO principle.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed concern about recent measures in the
automotive industry in the country and emphasized the need for
close consultations with the EU on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government recently issued a presidential
instruction, granting a company with a special tax relief on
imported components for three years while increasing the use of
local components gradually from 20 percent to 40 percent and
finally to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan opposed the policy, saying it is a violation of WTO
principles.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who arrived here on Monday for a two-day visit, also
exchanged views with President Soeharto on other issues of mutual
concern, official sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Priroda (Nature) research
module, destined for the Mir orbital station, was launched this
afternoon, the Russian Space Forces press center said.
</P>
<P>
The Priroda module, weighing nearly 20 tonnes, will be put into
orbit by a Proton booster rocket which blasted off from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 15:48 Moscow time (GMT 11:48).
</P>
<P>
The module, which will dock with the Mir station on April 26,
will be the last component of the Russian orbital complex.
</P>
<P>
The main unit of the Mir station was put in space a decade
ago. Since then, four modules -- Kristall, Kvant, Kvant-2 and
Spektr -- have been attached to Mir, and the entire "space
construction project" will be completed soon, the press center
said.
</P>
<P>
The Priroda module is carrying Russian-made research equipment,
such as optical systems to survey the Earth's natural resources,
which will be used by the two cosmonauts, Yuri Onufrienko
and Yuri Usachev, aboard the Mir station.
</P>
<P>
The new module also carries cargo for U.S. woman astronaut
Shannon Lucid, who recently joined the space station to carry out
a U.S. research program.
</P>
<P>
Priroda is scheduled to "tether" itself to the Mir station
three days after blast-off, instead of the nine days new modules
usually take to dock.

ZHENGZHOU, Northern Henan Province, April 23 (Xinhua) --
Veteran driver Lu Ningjun won the inaugural Hengyun Cup Zhengzhou
Auto Rally here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu, at 38 the most experienced driver here who competed for six
times in the Hong Kong-Beijing Rally, clocked an aggregate time of
one hour, 19 minutes and 56 seconds, more than one minute ahead of
runner-up Wen Fan.
</P>
<P>
Wen was timed 1:21:09 and Wang Qin was third at 1:21:26.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who overtook Wen to lead the rally after Monday's three key
special stages that totalled 31 kilometers, did not make much
effort in Tuesday's 3-km special stage.
</P>
<P>
"It is not always a good thing to lead from the start of the
rally," said Lu after the stage. "When I was second to run the
stages on Sunday, I even had an advantage as I could know where to
look out on the sight of heavy braking traces on the road."
</P>
<P>
Thorty-six Chinese drivers and their pilots, all steering
Chinese-made Jettas, set off from here on Saturday. But 11 cars

<HEADLINE> Roundup: International Competition for Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Keen competition between the
U.S. and other countries including France and Russia has caused
the diplomatic endeavors to resolve the crisis in Lebanon to enter
a difficult and critical stage.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of these diplomatic endeavors are not confined
to merely securing a ceasefire, but also include making security
arrangements in south Lebanon with the aim of protecting the
civilians there and stimulating the Middle East peace process on
the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks.
</P>
<P>
After successive meetings in Damascus Monday between Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and the foreign ministers of the U.S.,
France and Russia -- in addition to other meetings between those
ministers -- it became clear that an American integrated plan is
now under consideration and is being modified by both the French
and Russian foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met twice with
Syrian President al-Assad Monday. When leaving Damascus for
Israel, Christopher told reporters that his talks with the Syrian
president focused on ways of reviving the July 1993 understanding
accord.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that he was determined "to effect a ceasefire
in Lebanon and to hammer out a firm understanding capable of
restoring calmness to the region."
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Lebanon noticed that the second round
of President al-Assad's talks with Christopher was delayed because
the Syrian president was holding a meeting with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French and Russian foreign minister also
exchanged views on ways of securing a ceasefire and making
security arrangements capable of making the 1993 understanding
more viable.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also examined the possibility of resuming the
Middle East peace process on both the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-
Israeli tracks, indicating that Russia is attempting to re-emerge
as a superpower that has a say in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
France has offered a three-step plan to resolve the Lebanese
crisis: securing a ceasefire, making securing arrangements capable
of protecting civilians, and resuming the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Malcolm
Rifkind Monday voiced his country's suspicion of the French role
and criticized the multiple mediations which are being made in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
And Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli pointed out that
although the Americans want a purely American settlement, the
European Union could play some role in this connection if it
wishes to do so.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that the U.S., Russia, France and
Italy, as well as other countries, are now trying to play some
role in tackling the present crisis in Lebanon with an aim of
maintaining their own interests.

Australian government for illegally entering Australian waters,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the fishermen on Mafinti Island, Muna Regency,

fishermen for the same reason since the early 1980s, Southeast
Sulawesi governor Kaimuddin was quoted as saying.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said here today that
possibilities of developing the two countries' economic and trade
cooperation are "promising".
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today,
Kumaratunga said her country has signed two agreements with China
in the economic field, and "It's just the beginning of much more
stable and lasting economic relations between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
The president said that Sri Lanka has invited Chinese
investors, state companies, and private firms to Sri Lanka to
invest directly or form joint partnerships. "Today I met a group
of Chinese entrepreneurs and I believe we will have economic
cooperation between our two countries," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Although China has invested in more than 70 Sri Lankan
projects, worth some 55 million US dollars, it is still "a small
fraction of foreign investment" in that country, and the trade
volume last year stood at about 160 million US dollars, but was
"very much in favor of China."
</P>
<P>
The president described her visit to Beijing so far as "very
successful", and pointed out that Sri Lanka and China "have had a
long and friendly relationship."
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries have opened our economic frontiers and we
are developing free market economies, and we can continue cultural
and political friendships we have had into the field of economic
and trade partnership very successfully," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said China will play a "constructive" role politically and
economically, in Asia as well as in the world.
</P>
<P>
She also answered questions on the Sri Lankan situation and its
policy on foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> UK to Propose Selective Slaughter of Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government will
propose later today a highly selective slaughter of cattle in
exchange for the lifting of the world-wide ban on British beef
exports imposed by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is to make the
proposal during his meeting with EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler in Brussels later today, according to a press report.
</P>
<P>
Under the British proposal, some 40,000 cows aged three to six
years which are most at risk from developing BSE or mad cow
disease will be slaughtered, cutting the number of cases of BSE
this year and next by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The herd of origin could be traced from detailed records of BSE
cases held by the British Ministry of Agriculture, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This is a dramatic retreat from the government's recent threat
to take retaliatory measures against the EU for refusing to lift
the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Senior government ministers were reported to be threatening to
impose a tit-for-tat ban on beef imports from other EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
However, British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine
dismissed these threats on Monday night, saying that Britain faced
an "impossible dilemma" and it would be "quite wrong" to threaten
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"Downing Street has made it clear that we are seeking
diplomatic solutions to the issue and any suggestion that we are
about to take up the cudgels would be counter-productive", he
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Interest in Afghanistan Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The recent visits by two senior
US officials to the war-torn Afghanistan drew attention to the
growing US interest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Robin Raphel, US assistant secretary of state for South Asian
affairs, visited Kabul on Friday and Kandahar on Saturday, meeting
with Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Taliban leaders
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, she said, "there has been a heightening of United
States interest in Afghanistan as my visit at this particular time
and the visit of Senator Brown show."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, US Senator Hank Brown visited Afghanistan
and held talks with various factional leaders.
</P>
<P>
He raised a delicate issue of removing Mehmud Mestiri, UN
special envoy to Afghanistan, charging that Mestiri has little
influence on the Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
During a UN Security Council debate on the Afghan conflict on
April 9, the first one of its kind in seven years, the US also
joined other states in supporting the idea of an arms embargo on
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that all these signs showed a rekindled US
interest in Afghanistan although it could not be compared to the
US all-out support to the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet
occupation forces in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989,
the US stopped its countless military and financial aid to the
mujahideen abruptly and closed its embassy in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan official said in Kabul recently, "the Americans
dropped us like a hot potato at the moment the Cold War ended,
apparently believing we had nothing more to offer them."
</P>
<P>
After ignoring Afghanistan for seven years, the US now seemed
to have launched a diplomatic drive to facilitate a solution to
the long-term crisis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the change of the US attitude mainly
to the growing Iranian influence on the Afghan arena.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister, Allauddin Broujerdi, has
visited Afghanistan and Pakistan many times since the end of last
year, establishing stable contacts with many Afghan parties.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, also visited
Pakistan this month to coordinate the basic stands of the two
countries on the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the US fears to see its arch rival Iran gain
influence in any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Other interests which attract the US attention in Afghanistan
include the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism and some
economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to a UN report, Afghanistan has become one of the
biggest drug producing and trafficking centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
And the US government believes that some terrorists whom it
wants are hiding in the border areas between Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Raphel confirmed in Islamabad that a US company is willing to
lay a pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
So it is obvious that the US will get some benefits through
participating in the Afghan peace process, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
However, now it is not clear how deep the US wants to get
involved in the Afghan peace process and what kind of role it
wants to play.
</P>
<P>
Raphel said that the US government would help end the Afghan
crisis through supporting the UN peace efforts instead of direct
mediation among Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Now, all the people who paid much attention to the Afghan issue
are waiting to see what the next step the US will take.

<HEADLINE> Manila Assures Tourist Safety From Ebola Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
assured the safety of foreign travelers here from the Reston
strain of Ebola virus recently isolated from two Philippine
monkeys in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Noriega-Reodica said in a travel
advisory that the Reston strain is totally different from the
African strains of Ebola, which have caused illness and deaths in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
She cited studies conducted by Filipino and American scientists
among monkeys and animal handlers in the Philippines and the US,
which showed that the Reston strain does not cause illness among
human and does not pose a threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
The African Ebola viruses (Zaire, Sudan and Ivory Coast
Subtypes) have not been isolated from any Philippine monkeys, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Big City Development in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- By the end of this century, the
world will have 24 megalopolises with a population of more than 10
million each.
</P>
<P>
The prediction comes from scholars from China, Britain, Canada,
the US, Greece, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, India, and Indonesia who are
attending the four-day '96 Beijing International Symposium on
Metropolitan Development, where the focus is on urban planning in
metropolises in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of metropolises with a
population above one million grew from 83 in 1950 to 325 in 1995,
213 of them in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The scholars point out that by the year 2000, half of the
world's population will live in towns and cities, on which the
other half will depend more for a living.
</P>
<P>
And although big cities stimulate rapid economic growth, they
are part of a population explosion and bring on environmental
problems, and have made regional imbalances and resource shortages
worse, the scholars say.
</P>
<P>
They agree that the traditional development mode of "high
production, high consumption, and high pollution" should be halted
and a new path of sustainable development be sought through
scientific and technological progress and better use of resources.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 participants are expected to do special studies of
Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China, and Vietnam's Ho Chi
Minh City.

<HEADLINE> Japan Should Be Good Neighbor to S. Korea: Kim Young-sam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea should
develop forward-looking, good-neighborly relations based on a
correct perception of history, South Korean President Kim
Young-sam told a visiting Japanese delegation today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of representatives from Japan's ruling coalition,
led by Taku Yamazaki, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's
Policy Affairs Research Council, arrived here yesterday for a
three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"If Japan wishes to play a significant role as a member of the
international community, it should first maintain good-neighborly
relations with its neighbor, South Korea," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tokyo, in trying to improve relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), should first
exchange opinions with Seoul on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that at his meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Bangkok in March, Hashimoto had
pledged that talks to normalize Japan-DPRK relations would not
advance ahead of any progress in inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki said Japan would try to forge forward-looking
relations with South Korea by interpreting history correctly and
retrospecting the past.
</P>
<P>
Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 until Japan's defeat in
World War II in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Sector Up 8.1 Pc in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing sector of
Singapore grew by 8.1 percent in February, with six out of top 10
industries having higher output compared to a year ago, the
Economic Development Board (EDB) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The whole sector chalked up a cumulative growth for
January-February of 17.2 percent over the same period in 1995,
despite the fact that output data for this period was influenced
both by the seasonal slowdown as well as low growth during the
corresponding period of 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
Among the expanding industries in February, the EDB said, the
transport equipment industry recorded the strongest growth of 19.3
percent, contributed by both the marine and aviation segments.
</P>
<P>
For other sub-sectors, the paints and pharmaceutical industry
grew by 14.3 percent in February, leading to a cumulative growth
of 34.1 percent. However, the EDB noted that this high growth was
partly due to the lower output in the first two months of 1995
caused by plant shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
The machinery industry achieved a 14 percent year-on-year
growth, while the electronics industry grew by 13.2 percent
because of strong demand for disk drives, and other computer
peripherals, it said.
</P>
<P>
Four major industries recorded lower output growth compared
with a year ago. Of these, the industrial chemicals sub-sector
showed the least decline, with output dipping by 0.6 percent
following maintenance shutdowns in some plants.
</P>
<P>
The fabricated metal products and plastic products industries
registered declines of 2.9 percent and 6.5 percent respectively in
February, while the output of electrical machinery and appliances
dropped by 9 percent in February because of fewer exports of
motors and transformers, the EDB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua ended a
week-long tour of Henan Province on Monday, and pointed out that
it should make full use of its advantage as one of the country's
biggest grain and cotton producers during the inspection.
</P>
<P>
He urged the province to give priority to agriculture and
electricity production, and should ensure stable increases in
grain and cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' incomes should also be increased, he said, and rural
economic development should be pushed, by expanding processing
firms related to farm produce and industries that serve
agriculture. Water conservation is a top priority item for Henan
in maintaining stable agricultural development, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Increasing electrical output should be listed as one of the top
priorities for basic facilities construction in the 1996-2000
period, said the vice-premier, explaining that per capita power
output in Henan is still low and the demand far exceeds the supply.
</P>
<P>
Zou also urged Henan to make full use of its rich coal
resources and growing market for power.

<P>
HELSINKI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Finland
Yuri Deryabin today warned the Baltic countries not to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local newspaper, Deryabin said that
Russia would be forced to take appropriate measures in response
to the accession by Baltic nations to NATO, which would
completely change the security situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on what those measures would be, but said
Moscow would be compelled to respond if foreign military bases and
nuclear weapons appeared in Baltic countries which have a common
border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of applying for membership of NATO, the Baltic nations
could seek security guarantees from either NATO or Russia, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Sweden, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
border on the Baltic Sea. The latter five countries also have a
common border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Deryabin said the application by Baltic and east European
nations for membership in European Union was quite different from
their entry into NATO, which would cause political, military and
geopolitical problems.
</P>
<P>
Russia also wished to join the EU, he said.

</P>
<P>
Tien, an American-Chinese scientist, says he is optimistic

of the Pacific Ocean," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tien has devoted himself to strengthening Sino-US scientific
co-operation in the past few years. Berkeley established relations

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today
that the Chinese government will support equal mutually-beneficial
scientific and technological cooperation among Asia-Pacific
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"As in the case of many other Asia-Pacific countries, the
future development of China depends on the development of science
and technology," Li said in a meeting with delegates to the
Asia-Pacific Conference for Science and Technology Leaders.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Asia-Pacific
countries and regions to learn from each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
After describing China's reforms and opening to the outside
world over the past 18 years, and the country's Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and long-term development plan to the year 2010,
the premier said that the Chinese government has paid great
attention to the development of science and technology, and
education.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Rise in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Consumer Price
Index A (CPI A) was 6.7 percent higher in March this year than a
year ago, according to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The figure was marginally higher than the 6.6 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
The rates of increase in the Consumer Price Index B (CPI B) and
the Hang Seng Consumer Index (CPI) were respectively 7.3 and 8.2
percent, about the same as that in February.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said here today that the slightly faster
increase in the CPI A in March than in February was mainly due to
higher prices of some fresh food items such as live poultry and
fruits, and higher charges for meals bought away from home.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that adjustments in transport fares also
contributed to the increase.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of 1996, the CPI A and CPI B were on
average 6.4 and 7.1 percent higher respectively over a year
earlier, while the corresponding increase for the Hang Seng CPI
was 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
These figures were much lower than the corresponding increases
of 7.7, 8.1 and 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months ending March 1996, the CPI A and CPI B were,
on average, 7.9 and 8.5 percent higher respectively than the
preceding 12-month period. The corresponding increase for the
Hang Seng CPI was 9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK Police to Deal with Jet Skis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's marine police will
take measures to crack down on unlicensed pleasure craft and jet
skis this summer, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drive followed the deaths of two shop workers earlier this
month in a jet ski accident off Sai Kung.
</P>
<P>
The measures to deal with the jet skis include using
plainclothes officers, unmarked boats and video cameras.
</P>
<P>
The growing popularity of pleasure craft has led to an
increase in maritime offenses.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, police stopped 581 pleasure craft resulting in 57
prosecutions, compared with 615 checks and 51 prosecutions in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Under the marine regulations, anyone owning or using a craft
more than three meters long with an engine of more than four
horsepower must hold valid certificates of competency as a
pleasure vessel master and engineer, or face a fine of 10,000 HK
dollars (about 1,300 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But a marine police officer said that prosecuting jet ski users
was difficult because of the vessels' high speeds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent fatality off Sai Kung tragically
highlighted the potential dangers of jet skis.
</P>
<P>
He said speed restricted zones would be closely monitored by
inshore police patrols.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Scholars Say Macao to Become Leading Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from Taiwan say that Macao
will become a leading port in south China in the coming decade as
economic growth in the region is expected to continue at 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
A scholar from the Taiwan-based Strait Exchange Foundation
(SEF) said at a seminar which opened Monday that Macao will become
a leading city of entrepot trade following Hong Kong in the
coming decade when Hong Kong cannot meet the increasing trade
demand from south China.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that south China, especially the Pearl River
Delta, will maintain an economic growth of about 10 percent in the
coming decade. Hong Kong's capability of entrepot trade will then
reach its saturation point.
</P>
<P>
"As the infrastructure conditions in Zhuhai continue to be
improved, Macao will have the possibility to become a center of
finance, trade, personnel management, entrepot trade and
entertainment in the south China region," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that following the opening of air route
between Taiwan and Macao, trade and tourism income also increased.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, only 228 Taiwan residents visited Macao. But in 1995,
the number increased to 9,063.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two sides reached 215 million US
dollars in 1995, compared with the 7.5 million US dollars in
1985.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A symposium aimed at increasing
business certainty on international taxation, participated by
representatives from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), will be held in Sydney, Australia in October.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said in a statement that
the three-day symposium will cover emerging issues in business
taxation and transfer pricing rules which seek to ensure that
prices paid for goods and services traded between associated
companies are open market prices.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also include an assessment of the general
trends in the taxation of corporate income in the Asia-Pacific
region, and the identification of the main tax obstacles to inward
investment in the region, Costello said.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions of these issues on a multilateral basis can
promote better understanding of international tax issues, and
facilitate a predictable and non-discriminatory international tax
framework, which will increase business certainty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Issues relating to international business taxation will
obviously continue to grow in importance as barriers to cross
border trade and investment continue to decline," he added.

<HEADLINE> Polish Party Demands Justice to Frame-up of Oleksy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Social Democratic Party
will submit a motion in the parliament demanding a trial of those
responsible for the frame-up of the former Polish Prime Minister
Jozef Oleksy.
</P>
<P>
Izabella Sierakowska, vice chairman of the party, said at a
press conference today that after the Polish military prosecutor
declared Oleksy innocent on Monday, those guilty of the unfounded
accusation of Olesky "should be punished."
</P>
<P>
Oleksy has pleaded not guilty ever since former Interior
Minister Andrej Milczanowski first alleged on December 19, 1995
that intelligence agency files included evidence that Oleksy had
spied for Moscow for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
If the allegation had been proved, Oleksy would have been
sentenced to more than five years in prison or even to death.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said he would demand
that all the evidence concerning the case be revealed. He added,
"all the circumstances that led to the unjustified accusation of
the government chief and seriously harmed Poland's image abroad
should be clarified."
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman told reporters that President Aleksander
Kwasniewski would make his own comments on the prosecutor's
decision.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman revealed that before Oleksy was announced
innocent, the president had expressed his trust in the prosecutor,
saying "the decision will be fair."
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of the Parliament Group of the Peasant Party
Janujz Piechocinski said the prosecutor's decision was made
"without any political pressure." He added that the issue of
Oleksy's case will continue to be a focus of political struggles
among different parties, especially in anticipation of the
parliamentary elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The United Unions, the Centrum Agreement, the Conservative
Alliance and other right wing organizations and parties have
expressed their opposition to the decision, saying that as long as
the political institutions remain in the hand of left wing
parties, any explanation about the Oleksy case can hardly be
convincing.
</P>
<P>
The local media widely believed that the prosecutor's decision
can not put an end to the case, but may ignite a new round of
political conflicts instead.

<HEADLINE> 5,000-Year-Old Residential Remains Unearthed in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have discovered
residential remains with a history of 5,000 years in an outlying
island southwest of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The remains of two houses, believed to be part of an ancient
village during the New Stone Age (7,000-1,600 BC), were excavated
in a coastal village in Lamma Island, half an hour nautical voyage
from Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
It is claimed to be the oldest and most complete remains of
houses ever found in Hong Kong and South China's Guangdong
province.
</P>
<P>
At the remains of one house, 13 holes were found in an oval
circle and one bigger hole with a diameter of 30 centimeters was
at the core. Archaeologists believed that these holes were used to
hold pillars of a house to support the roof. From the arrangement
of the holes, they inferred that the house was oval in an eye
bird view.
</P>
<P>
Similar holes were discovered in the remains of the other
house, whose plane figure is a rectangle. There are also remains
of small piles of gravel, burnt earth and stone-made fire ranges,
showing how the primitive human beings lived under the roof.
</P>
<P>
A large number of historical relics were unearthed, including
many pottery pieces and stone instruments such as hammers and
mills.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists from China's inland and Hong Kong spent two
months in bringing the historical remains to light, half a
century after it was first discovered by Father Finn, a teacher
in the Hong Kong University in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ren Shinan, director of the Institute of Archaeology
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, joined in the
excavation. He said that the significant discovery shows that boat
people in the New Stone Age, who were thought to live in boats
all their lives, had fixed residential houses on land.
</P>
<P>
Archaeological studies show that primitive civilization on the
small island fell into the same category as that in South China's
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Tang Chung, an archaeological researcher of the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, said further excavation work will
continue to see whether they can find a comprehensive primitive
village.
</P>
<P>
The research was jointly conducted by the Institute of
Archaeology under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the
Anthropology Museum of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou and the
Chinese University of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese LDP delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged Japanese statesmen to take a long-term view in dealing
with Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in a meeting with a delegation sent by the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan, said that to maintain
Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to generation is the
common desire of the far-sighted people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Sino-Japanese relations are growing well,
Jiang commented.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the two sides should strictly abide by the
principles enshrined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and
the Peace and Friendship Treaty, and develop bilateral ties and
properly resolve problems that crop up, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Past experience is a guide for the future," Jiang told the
visitors, who are led by Masajuro Shiokawa, chairman of the LDP's
Executive Board.
</P>
<P>
"We should educate the young people of both countries with a
correct conception of history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also expressed the hope that Japanese
politicians would take a broad and long-term view in dealing with
Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the Taiwan issue, Jiang explained China's policy
of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese
territory and to realize reunification is the common desire of the
entire Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of
China in which no foreign forces have the right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Shiokawa, also a member of the Japanese Diet, said the purpose
of his visit is to further Japanese-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Beijing, he told Jiang, members of the
delegation held talks "in a frank and friendly manner" with
China's Foreign Ministry and the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He said members of the delegation, including several Diet
members and former senior cabinet officials, gained a better
understanding of China's positions on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese visitors are here as guests of the China-Japan
Friendship Association.

HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Banque Nationale De Paris has
just signed an 84.8 million US dollar facility with Air China to
finance its acquisition of three new A340-300 aircraft from Airbus
Industry, a spokesman of the bank's Hong Kong and China Group said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The 20-month pre-delivery facility is jointly arranged by
Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that stepping into 1996, Banque Nationale de Paris has
been quite active in Airbus financing in the Chinese market. The
bank has also co-arranged package financing, with other European
banks, for one A300-600 to China Northwest Airlines and three
A340-300 to China Eastern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The deal with China Eastern Airlines for a sum of 375 million
US dollars is quite a complex one.
</P>
<P>
The recent big deal for thirty A320 and three A340s concluded
by Chinese Premier Li Peng with Airbus Industry will greatly
enhance Europe's trade business with the mainland and give good
financing opportunities for the banks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Banque Nationale de Paris has enjoyed
good relationship with the Chinese airlines and it will certainly
support the expansion and rejuvenation of their fleet.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Turn Government Debts To Equities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Domestic debts owed by the
Nigerian government, totalling 27.7 billion Naira (about 325
million US Dollars), are expected to be converted to equity
stakes.
</P>
<P>
The government financing program being contemplated to shed
official indebtedness is to tie the domestic debts to viable
projects or companies in which persons being owed could become
shareholders, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, according to the newspaper, the government would
convert the debts into equity and after, to the investing public
for subscription.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Federal Finance Ministry said that some
flexibility would be built so that investors who do not want to
be shareholders would have the choice of holding creditors'
status, while government creditors who do not subscribe to the
equity would be paid their money.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria used to raise funds through issuing development stocks
or bonds.
</P>
<P>
The conversion is also expected to lower the government's debt
burden, relieve its creditors and inject new equities into the
capital market,. they noted.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the country's Securities and Exchange
Commission is billed to meet next month with financial experts to
appraise the option.
</P>
<P>
Capital market operators and analysts in Lagos, according to
the newspaper, agreed that the planned financing mode holds some
promise. But some doubted that the government would get the right
response from the investing public. enditem

NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian police in Delhi have not

<HEADLINE> More Diabetics in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents with diabetes
disease are on the rise, and the number is expected to reach
50,000 by the turn of the century, experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to experts attending a seminar which ended last
weekend, the number of diabetics has now reached 24,000,
accounting for about five percent of Macao's population.
</P>
<P>
They predict that by the year 2000, at least 20 percent of the
population are likely victims of the disease.
</P>
<P>
There were few such patients a decade ago, but the number
exploded over the decade when Macao residents gradually adopted a
new life style.
</P>
<P>
More children and adults become fat persons. Many people who
work under high pressure and do little exercises are more likely
to contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
But experts stressed that the disease can be avoided if people
pay more attention to balance of nutrition, eat more vegetables
rather than meat, and keep doing proper exercises.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that related departments of the Macao government
and some social organizations started to give handouts to
residents on the prevention of the disease several years ago, and
such activities will continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chang Hak-ro, former secretary of
South Korean President Kim Young-sam, admitted the bribery charges
brought against him in a hearing at the Seoul District Court here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was arrested and indicted on bribery charges last
month, testified during the questioning by prosecutors that of the
3.55 million U.S. dollars he received from 14 domestic firms since
January 1990, about 970,000 U.S. dollars could be considered
bribes, or money given in exchange for his influences as a
presidential aide, and the rest was purely gifts.
</P>
<P>
He submitted, through his defense lawyer, a document certifying
that he has contributed 1.5 million U.S. dollars to the rural
youth education and development foundation.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to Kim in 1977 and was his "steward"
for nearly 20 years. When kim became president in February 1993,
Chang was named a presidential secretary in charge of Kim's
personal matters.
</P>
<P>
Following Chang's arrest, Kim apologized to the nation for the
graft case involving his personal secretary.

<HEADLINE> Keating Quits Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian prime minister
Paul Keating quitted his 27-year-long political career and
resigned from the federal parliament today.
</P>
<P>
Keating handed in his resignation notice to Governor-General
William Deane just one week before the new parliament resumes on
April 30.
</P>
<P>
"I leave very proud of what the Labor government did, of what
the labor movement did, and of what Australians did in the past
decade to build a competitive Australian economy and marry it to a
good Australian society," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Keating is expected to use his specialized knowledge in dealing
with Asian countries as former prime minister and treasurer to
advise businesses on expanding into Asia.
</P>
<P>
Kim Beazeley, former deputy prime minister in the Keating
Government, replaces Keating as the leader of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Government lost office to the Liberal-National
parties Coalition in the federal election in March.
</P>
<P>
The new Prime Minister, John Howard, wished Keating and his
family good health and happiness.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have been fierce political combatants for many
years, I have respected the contribution Mr. Keating has made to
the political cause in which he believes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keating became the youngest ever Australian Labor Party (ALP)
member of the federal parliament at the age of 25 in 1969. He was
the treasurer in the Hawke Government and replaced Bob Hawke as
the prime minister in 1991. He was re-elected prime minister in
the 1993 federal election but defeated by Liberal leader John
Howard in the last election.
</P>
<P>
Keating made significant contributions to the country's
strategy of full engagement with Asia. He is also an active
advocator of local economic forums such as the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) group.
</P>
<P>
ALP President Barry Jones said that Keating had made an
extraordinary contribution to Australian public life.
</P>
<P>
Former National party leader Ian Sinclair, who is a veteran in
the Parliament and known as the Father of the House, said that
Keating "had the potential to become a great parliamentarian."
</P>
<P>
"As a shadow minister he was quite outstanding, as treasurer
the deregulation of the Australian economy was his primary
achievement, as prime minister it's too early to tell," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that Keating, 52, still had many years of
productive life ahead of him as a consultant on Asian affairs.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Silk Road City Being Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURPAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese archeologists
have restored a magnificent Buddhist temple in the ruins of
Jiaohe, which was a prosperous city on the legendary Silk Road
2,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Chinese craftsmen and artists toiled for more than five
months to restore the original Buddhist wall paintings and 36
Buddhist statues in the temple, which was built between the fifth
and seventh centuries.
</P>
<P>
The temple is one of some 50 Buddhist sites in the city, which
witnessed 1,000 years of the ascendancy of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Located on a plateau in the Yarnaiz Groove, 10 km west of
Turpan, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
city used to be capital of the Jushi Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It was a place of strategic importance during subsequent
dynasties until it was destroyed by fire during the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The city's most attractive part may have been its architecture,
of which the best examples were built between the third and tenth
centuries.
</P>
<P>
Many of the buildings were made of mud bricks or rammed earth.
</P>
<P>
The ruins were listed as the first group of cultural relics
under state protection in 1961, but have always been subjected to
erosion and damaged by tourists more recently.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to save the city, a trust fund of one million US
dollars for protection and conservation was organized in 1992 by
China's State Bureau of Cultural Relics, UNESCO, and the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese government has collected some one
million yuan for the project, which is expected to be completed by
the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years or so, apart from the temple,
archeologists have excavated an underground place of worship,
cliff tombs, the eastern city gate, and a residential section,
unearthing more than 4,000 rare relics.
</P>
<P>
Conservation work has been done on a small monastery, a cave
containing 1,000 Buddha statues and a cemetery for some 300
infants.
</P>
<P>
A 710-m dike for flood protection, a 3,247-m paved tourist path
with some 1,270 m pave with pottery bricks, and some 100
signboards have been set up under the prerequisite that they do
not affect the view.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, a foundation stone-laying ceremony was held for a
hall to display cultural relics excavated at the site.
</P>
<P>
Shikon Takei, UNESCO representative to China and Mongolia, said
at the ceremony that he will make still greater efforts for the
Jiaohe ruins so as to list it as part of the UNESCO's World
Heritage.

NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Attorney-General Amos
Wako has refuted a report that the Kenyan Government will pay
500,000 Pound Sterlings to John Ward as compensation for his
daughter murdered in the Maasai Mara game park in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's "Daily Nation" reported on Monday that John Ward, the
father of the murdered British tourist Julie Ward will give the
money "in an out-of-court settlement from the Kenyan Government
as compensation."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted London's Sunday Times as saying the money
will be settlement for the amount John Ward spent trying to bring
his daughter's killers to justice over the last seven and a half
years.
</P>
<P>
Amos Wako, who is currently in London, denied the government is
paying John Ward any compensation, East African Standard reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Amos Wako said "I deny emphatically that the
Kenyan Government has agreed to compensate Mr. Ward." "As I
announced the Kenyan Government is committed to finding out the
person or persons who killed Julie Ward, and intends to prosecute
them before the courts in accordance with due process of the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenyan Attoney General admitted that John Wako
has filed a civil suit in the High Court to claim compensation,
but denied.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Approves New Aid to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 23 (Xinhua)-- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has approved 135 million U.S. dollars in aid to Vietnam
in the next five years, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The aid is under a cooperation programme signed earlier between
UNICEF and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The programme, the sixth of its kind and the biggest in the
history of Vietnam-UNICEF cooperation, is designed to help Vietnam
reduce mortality rates among under-five children and mothers, as
well as malnutrition rate.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF's plan of action will focus on assisting women and
children in need in mountainous and remote areas through
development and social welfare projects and programmes.
</P>
<P>
With a budget of more than 93 million U.S. dollars in the
1991-95 fiscal period provided by UNICEF, 88 percent of children
in 98 percent of communes throughout the country were vaccinated,
93 percent of under-five children in 87 percent of the communes
were provided with orezon (oral rehydration solution) against
diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10 million rural children beneficiaries of
UNICEF's safe water programme and tens of thousands of poor women
in rural areas were granted soft loans for production.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: World Trade Congress to Open in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 700 senior government
officials, eminent businessmen, and prominent academicians from
Asia, America, and Europe will gather in Singapore to discuss
issues related to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the World
Trade Congress (WTC) here from April 23 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The future of world trade, the development of the increasingly
rule-based multilateral trading system, and the evolution and
efficacy of the 120-member WTO will be the central themes of
discussion at the two-day Congress, co-organized by the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) and the International Herald Tribune
(IHT).
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, WTO Director General
Renato Ruggiero, Sir Leon Brittan and 40 other speakers and
panelists will preside over the Congress, the TDB said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the WTC was intended to sieve through the spectrum
of international trade issues, concerns and developments faced by
current and future members of the WTO in order to help prioritize
discussions at the inaugural WTO Ministerial Conference, to be
held in Singapore in December this year.
</P>
<P>
"WTO issues and concerns will be extensively discussed both at
the sessions proper, and at side-meetings that will occur during
the Congress. These meetings should substantially contribute to
the crystallization of the agenda for the WTO Ministerial
Conference," Barry Desker, Chief Executive Officer of the TDB said
at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Congress would not only represent "a prime
opportunity for leaders to interact" with each other, but would
also give businessmen and academicians the "best opportunity" to
make their concerns about the global trading system known to
policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
"The IHT's aim in co-organizing the WTC was to encourage
pragmatic discussion among trade practitioners and to provide
momentum in the development of a practical and efficient worldwide
trading regime," Rolf Kranepuhl, Managing Director of the IHT in
the Asia-Pacific region, said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Congress program over the two-day plenary sessions will
cover a broad range of issues including the globalization of trade
and its ramifications for the post-GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade) order, the reconciliation of domestic and
regional concerns with multilateral obligations, and the
challenges and responsibilities of the WTO in maintaining the
integrity of the international trading system, the TDB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A surplus of over two million
tons of maize is expected in southern Africa for the 1996/97
marketing year, according to the SADC regional early warning
unit.
</P>
<P>
The unit said for the first time in many years, Mozambique is
one of only three countries anticipating surpluses in the region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Zimbabwe are the other two countries
expecting to have maize surpluses while shortfalls of varying
magnitudes were forecast in other SADC member countries.
</P>
<P>
The unit said on Monday in its food security monthly update
that the region's overall maize output is expected to rise by 77
percent to 19.95 million tons from 11.10 million tons last year.
The increase in production has been attributed to favorable
rainfall in most countries of the region, which resulted in a
general increase in the area planted.

JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State met

painstaking effort to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the just over one hour talks, Christopher said,
"We discussed the American proposal for a ceasefire and for a
strengthened statement of 1993 understandings, so as to restore
calm to the area of southern Lebanon and northern Israel."
</P>
<P>
"I brought here from Damascus some of the ideas that I heard
yesterday with respect to a strengthened understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a very intense period now ... I proceed in very
serious efforts to deal with difficult problems we are facing
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres estimated the situation by saying that "we are in the
middle of the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
In order to get rid of danger and put an end to the exchange of
fire, he said, all parties are making serious attempts and
Christopher is particularly in an extremely serious involvement.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who flew here late Monday night, is scheduled to
return to Damascus shortly. He is believed to try to combine two
proposals, one from Israel and the other from Hezbollah offered
through Syria, and come up with one acceptable to both
sides.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Pledges More Efforts to Carry Out Court Orders  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Ren Jianxin, China's top judge
urged courts nationwide today to comprehensively strengthen and
improve their work of executing court orders, as "orders are
harder to carry out" today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference here on the carrying out of
court verdict execution work, which opened today, Ren, president
of the Supreme People's Court, said "courts officials must be
fully aware of the importance of this work, and do it well in line
with the political orientation of providing service for reform,
development and stability."
</P>
<P>
Executing court orders, which is just as important as trying
cases, "is an important guarantee for the realization of citizen's
rights and interests, and a major means to protect the unity and
dignity of state laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese courts have carried out orders concerning over five
million cases of various kinds over the past five years, in which
120 billion yuan-worth of property and money were involved, nearly
twice the amount in the five years prior to that, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
However, there were still over 240,000 court verdicts which
have not been carried out, many involving difficult cases which
had been left to pile up for years, by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that to solve this problem courts should first do the
trial work well and provide correct judgments, and the execution
work must be done strictly, comprehensively and accurately
according to law.

<P>
The execution work is prone to lead to confrontations, for if
improperly dealt with, it will become a factor of instability and
intensify contradictions, he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Courts should improve their proficiency level and standardize
their work procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, courts should also rely on the leadership of Party
committees at various levels and better coordinate with each other
to ensure verdicts are carried out in a uniform way.
</P>
<P>
According to the conference, court verdicts in economic cases
are the hardest to enforce, mainly for the following
reasons: interference from local and departmental protectionism,
ignorance of the law, incompetence of law-enforcers and lack of
legal bases and proper means.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its leadership over the work the Supreme People's
Court has set up a special office, and 94 percent of grass-roots
courts and province-level courts have set up enforcement panels.
</P>
<P>
To improve the mechanism of carrying out the work, the
conference will begin formulating a "regulation on verdict
execution of the people's courts".

<HEADLINE> Border Troops: Witness To Better Sino-CIS Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The frontier forces of China and
the Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS) countries have become
envoys for friendship with the improvement of ties between China
and those countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese troops stationed on the Sino-CIS border in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region and their Russian counterparts stationed
in Kirghizstan exchange greetings on each other's national and
army days, and the two sides have signed agreements on increase of
bilateral co-operation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Friendly exchanges between the two forces started six years
ago, when China and the former Soviet Union normalized their ties,
said a Chinese officer.
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War period, the only exchanges the two sides had
were the settling of disputes along the borders.
</P>
<P>
In recent years military delegations from CIS countries have
visited Xinjiang and some special economic zones in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
CIS officers have shown great interest in China's reform and
opening up, said Major Peng Zhongping, a Chinese officer in charge
of receiving CIS military delegations.
</P>
<P>
The major quoted one of his CIS colleagues as saying, "We meet
each other in a relaxed manner and stroll on each other's territory,
as evidence of the peaceful relations between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Colonel Zheng Jingyuan has visited several CIS nations. There
he met with many people who came to China to help the then newly
founded people's republic with its construction back in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"They all cherish the memory of the friendship with their
Chinese colleagues, and expressed their regret about the tension
lasting nearly three decades between the two countries," the
colonel said.
</P>
<P>
At present, frontier forces in Xinjiang and neighboring CIS
nations regularly hold talks on issues covering information
exchanges, joint efforts in cracking down crimes and increased
international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, they jointly confiscated more than 500 smuggled
guns, and investigated over 800 border violations.
</P>
<P>
With flourishing trade along the Sino-CIS borders, Chinese
frontier forces in Xinjiang, besides being defenders of national
security, have shouldered the new task of handling border crossing
procedures and safeguarding the lives and properties of people
coming to China.

WUHAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A new kind of non-polluting
disposable tableware has gone into mass production in this capital
of Hubei Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
The new tableware was developed by Chi Hong, president of the

The new tableware uses vegetable fiber as the raw material, and
therefore is completely biodegradable, Chi claimed.

The factory produces 80,000 pieces of the tableware a day.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China now uses about seven billion pieces
of disposable tableware a year. And several cities have started to

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects PNA's Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan rejected Monday an
assertion by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) officials that a
man who allegedly ordered an assassination attempt against Yasser
Arafat was based in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education Abdullah Ensour and Minister of
Information Marwan Muasher rejected the PNA allegation,
reiterating that Jordan will not allow the kingdom to be used by
any extremist group and that the government was as concerned as
the PNA itself over the security situation in the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
There was no Jordanian named "Ziad Qishawi" identified by the
PNA as the man who is behind the failed assassination attempt,
said Ensour at a regular weekly briefing Monday hosted by Muasher.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have in our records anyone named Ziad Qishawi,"
said Ensour, quoted by the local newspaper Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
Muasher also told reporters that an extensive scrutiny failed
to come with such a person.
</P>
<P>
"Such a name does not exist in our civil status registers,
"said the information minister, adding that "such a man does not
exist in Jordan and no Jordanian by that name is living abroad
either."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the militant group, to which "Ziad Qishawi" was
allegedly belonged, dismissed the PNA charge as theatricals aimed
at diverting attention from the self-rule authority's crackdown on
Hamas activists and discrediting the group.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman in Amman Ibrahim Ghosheh said Monday that "We
are not aware of the plot, and we have no links with (the man
named by the PNA)."
</P>
<P>
"The accusations are aimed at covering up the mass arrests
and the ugly torture of people in jails of the PNA," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This fabricated episode is also aimed at diverting attention
away from the meeting of the Palestinian National Council... to
alter clauses in the national charter that stipulate the rights
of the Palestinian people on their national soil," Ghosheh
added, referring to a crucial meeting of the PNC in the Gaza
Strip Monday to debate revoking sections of the charter that
call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The affair is the latest in a series of charges raised
by PNA officials, including Arafat himself, that Hamas, which
opposes the Palestinian-Israeli autonomy accords and has carried
out many anti-Israeli attacks aimed at undermining the agreements,
was based in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Officials here, obviously seeking not to contribute to
triggering a war of words with the PNA, have been playing down the
allegations, suggesting that Arafat, finding himself in trouble
with opposition groups within the Palestinian territories,
could be resorting to diversionary tactics.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, Jordan Times said the PNA's claims "are
obviously an attempt to shift the pressure it has come under as a
result of Hamas operations in Israel to Jordan."
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that PNA has "no right to go on
making accusations (of the Kingdom) in order to solve its
internal problems."
</P>
<P>
The pressure, which PNA has found itself under, "does not
justify its repeated attempts to drag Jordan into its problem,"
it added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: East African Nations United for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- There have been glad tidings
recently in East Africa: only a week after the revival of the
defunct East African Community (EAC), the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) restructured itself
to face challenges in the world.
</P>
<P>
IGADD was formed in January 1986 at a time when droughts and
locust pests kept stalking the East African region, with the aim
at joining their efforts to combat natural disasters and gain
more external assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda set
up the organization together even when there had been border
conflicts between the first two countries. Eritrea joined in
after getting independence In 1993.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of six member states (with Somalia absent) met in
Nairobi on March 21 after the Council of Ministers met thrice
plus an experts' meeting in the past year. They endorsed an
amended charter which changed its name to Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
In a word, the top political leadership opened a new front to
tackle the region's problems by transforming IGADD into an
economic body which will also deal with conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary General, Dr David Muduuli, told the
press in Nairobi the next day that the mandate of the Authority
has been widened to cover political and social issues beside
economic cooperation and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the regional body is giving priority to
the prevention of conflicts among member countries, setting up a
division within the secretariat to deal with peace and security
affairs in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Muduuli said the new charter has also restructured IGAD to
expand the Council of Ministers, which will have two from each
state -- foreign affairs and any other designated by respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
The summit also mandated Mr Meles Zenawi, Prime Minister of
Ethiopia to deal with Somali's internal conflict on behalf of
IGAD.
</P>
<P>
He also added that the Sudanese conflict has already been
addressed by IGAD.
</P>
<P>
All the countries in IGAD, except Kenya, are among the least
developed countries classified by the United Nations. A civil war
has been going on in the Sudan in the past 13 years and the
country has been at loggerheads with Uganda, Ethiopia and
Eritrea, accusing them of backing the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army in southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a broader outlook of the Eastern African region, one cannot
ignore the events in Rwanda or those threatening stability in
neighboring Burundi.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's paper "Daily Nation"
commented, "There can be no development if the region is in
turmoil... IGAD now must be the instrument for resolving regional
conflicts the African way."
</P>
<P>
Closing the summit, Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi
challenged IGAD leaders to seriously address themselves to the
problems of hostilities and insecurity within and between states
in order to give present and future generations a region of
tranquillity for rapid social economic development, so that they
can compete on an equal footing with other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, only a week before, presidents of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania signed a pact revitalizing the defunct EAC. They
gathered at Arusha in northern Tanzania to be present at the
opening of the secretariat of the East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was set up in 1967 by the three countries. In
mid-1970s, it had a common currency and common services totaling
44 including railways, highways, airlines, post and
telecommunications, harbors, monetary and financial projects.
</P>
<P>
However, just as the common market and common services of the
EAC were envied by the Sudan, Ethiopia, Burundi and Rwanda which
had applied for its membership, the community broke up in 1977
amid political differences among its leaders.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged differences between the Kenyan and Ugandan
Presidents have gradually improved since the 1990s, and after
assuming power last November, Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa
actively mediated and brought the Kenyan and Ugandan presidents
together, laying the foundation for the revival of the EAC.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his first press conference in Nairobi, EAC
Secretary General Francis Kirimi Muthaura said the rebirth of the
organization will not only accelerate socio-economic development
in the region, but will also enhance trade and investment among
the three nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the three heads of state have given his secretariat
the mandate to intensify cooperation in trade, investment,
industry, tourism and infrastructure so that regional economic
integration can be fostered.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyan Times" in an article said, the revival of the EAC
serves as "a new chapter" in East African cooperation and "a
turning point" of bringing the region's huge trading potentials
into full play, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"The East African Cooperation will add an impetus to an
establishment of a trading bloc with about 85 million people in
the market place. The market will then attract investment and
stimulate industrialization process," the paper predicted.
</P>
<P>
It said the integration of the East African states "will usher
in the beginning of a new era full of hope and determination to
forge ahead a new sprint of greater regional cooperation" in the
Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa with a population of
300 million.
</P>
<P>
African states are not reconciled to the situation of being
left behind, and they are trying hard to catch up. The
restructuring of IGAD and the rebirth of the EAC have proved that
they have striven to get united to fight for their survival by
making their economies more competitive in order to meet
challenges posed by the Uruguay Round.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, the country's
highest governing body, has issued a circular guiding the growth
of border trade between China and Russia, marking the latest move
by the Chinese government to encourage such trade.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia share 4,300 km of border, with a large number
of ports of entry. Since 1986, when the border trade between China
and the former Soviet Union gradually resumed, it has become an
important part of trade co-operation between China and the former
Soviet Union, and Russia after the demise of the latter.
</P>
<P>
The ever-increasing trade between China and Russia has helped
promote the economic development and market prosperity and improve
the people's living standards, said a Chinese trade official.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed his convinction that the upcoming visit
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin will surely contribute to the
progress of bilateral economic and trade co-operation, border
trade in particular, between China and Russia.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- As threats of suicide attacks
continue, Israeli police are beefing up their presence in public
places throughout the country for Remembrance Day for the Fallen
of Israel's War today and the Independence Day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted security sources as saying that there is
concern that Palestinian extremist groups may try to torpedo the
memorial day and holiday with an attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
said it would carry out attacks to avenge the killing of
civilians during Israel's military operation against Hezbollah
targets in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people have been killed and hundreds of others
wounded since the military operation, code-named Operation Grapes
of Wrath, began on April 11.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman told Israel Radio this morning that
thousands of soldiers, Civil Guard volunteers, and police cadets
would be used to beef up the police forces.
</P>
<P>
He said a major job for them will be to ensure the Palestinians
not to violate the two-month-old closure, imposed on the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip following a series of suicide bombing attacks
in Israel late February and early March.
</P>
<P>
All vocations for police have been canceled and even policemen
usually in office jobs will be sent on to streets, he added.

Police will especially patrol heavily populated areas,
including shopping malls and picnic and tourist sites, while
helicopters will be used to monitor activities along the Green
Line, and at beaches and picnic sites.
</P>
<P>
Police will also patrol main highways and urban streets, and
roadblocks will be manned at city exits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli public is urged to exercise caution
and to alert police on seeing any suspicious people or
packages.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade With Central Asian Countries Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China has boosted economic and
trade relations with three Central Asian countries, namely,
Kazakistan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan, since the three
countries achieved their independence in the second half of 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation, when the three republics became independent
Li Lanqing, then minister of foreign economic relations and trade,
led the first Chinese government delegation to the three countries
to discuss economic and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the main products sold by China cover
light and textile products, farm machinery, cereals, edible oil
and other food products, while imports from Kazakhstan range from
chemical fertilizer to iron and steel and machinery. The bilateral
trade volume reaches 430 million US dollars-worth in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The official said the trade between China and Kirghizstan is
been handled through Turgat City and China-Kazakhstan
Railway. China sells light industrial and textile products,
cereals and farm machinery, and imports rolled steel, chemical
fertilizer and leather products, with the total trade volume
hitting 100 million US dollars-worth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade between China and Tadzhikistan has also
jumped -- from 3 million US dollars-worth in 1994 to 20 million US
dollars-worth last year.
</P>
<P>
Though the trade volume between China and the three Central
Asian republics is still small, the Chinese trade official
predicted that the trade relations will be further increased with
greater market penetration and the signing of agreements on
enhancing mutual trust in the border areas between China and
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China had purchased 91.9 billion
kg of grain by the end of March this year, overfulfilling the
state quota by two percent, it was revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 2.34 billion kg more than the amount of grain
purchased in the previous year, said an official from the State
Grain Reserve Administration.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Welcomes New Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe International Trade Fair
(ZITF) patron, President Robert Mugabe has said his government
was prepared to negotiate new investment protection agreements
with foreign companies wishing to invest in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who officially opened the fair on Friday, said this in
his welcome message to exhibitors at this year's ZITF exhibition
which began in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo, on
Tuesday and ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president said political stability, brought in by
democratic elections in South Africa and multi-party elections in
Mozambique in 1994, the ongoing peace process in Angola as well
as market reforms in most southern African countries, had enabled
the region to expand investment and trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
''We in Zimbabwe are ready to take full advantage of this new
climate and we invite investors from around the world to
participate and assist in the development process of both our
country and the region in general,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to exhibitors, among them hundreds of companies
from more than 30 countries, to use Zimbabwe's central location
to establish contacts with member countries of the Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).

WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur

single out Butch Reynolds and any test can not be viewed as an
insult.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Reynolds was called on for a random drug test at his

reinstated after being suspended in 1990.
</P>

In July 1995, the world record holder in 400 meters passed the

</P>
<P>
The results of the latest test will not be available in a week

Despite complying with the officials, Reynolds considered the
test as an embarassment, which the IAAF dismissed by saying that
it has conducted some 1,500 random tests annually around the world.
</P>

In 1990, Reynolds was suspended by the IAAF after allegedly
tested positive for steroids, which the US Supreme Court overruled

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Anti-Crime Partnership to be Furthered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Russian partnership in
combating transnational crimes is expected to be further developed
as bilateral treaties on police co-operation are to be signed
during the coming visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
China, a senior Chinese police officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the police of the two countries have
engaged in "multi-channel co-operation and exchanges" and
established a "friendly and co-operative partnership" in cracking
down on transnational crimes and crimes along border areas, the
officer said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Such co-operation and the partnership relations are in response
to the increased contacts between the two countries in the fields
of economy, trade, culture and personnel since 1983, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years the Chinese Ministry of Public Security
has signed ministerial-level treaties with the Russian Ministry of
Civil Affairs, Federal Security Bureau and General Frontier
Defense Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Agreements have been reached to the effect that joint efforts
by police both at central and regional level shall be continued,
each should learn from the other expertise and experience in
combating crimes, and both should co-ordinate and exchange
information in handling criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the Chinese police, with help from
their Russian counterparts, have arrested some 100 Chinese
criminals in Russia, cracking 173 cases, and confiscated illegal
money and goods worth 2.4 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese officer said that two sides protect the rights and
interests of people of the two countries well when they have
cross-border contacts.
</P>
<P>
"The economic development and social stability in the border
regions should be partly owed to the co-operation between the
police forces of the two countries," the police officer said.

SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Individual deposits in this,
China's largest metropolis surged to 158.9 billion yuan in the
first quarter of this year, 19.1 billion yuan more than at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that local residents' incomes are rising
dramatically while choices for investment are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's banks have been cautious in issing loans because the
deposits they received both from residents and enterprises have
not increased as drastically as over the first quarter in 1995,
according to official statistics on the city's financial
performance in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, deposits in banks were 73.1 billion yuan
more than the loans they extended, and the Shanghai branch of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, put more than five
billion yuan into circulation, which is regarded as normal.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Peruvian Economy Begins to Cool Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Peru's economy will continue to cool
down this year as the government attempts to cut its growing
budget and balance of payments deficits through tough monetary and
fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
The government is forecasting an increase in gross domestic
product (GDP), a measure of economic growth, of between 3 and 4
percent, down from last year's 7 percent and a third of 1994's
record 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which has fallen steadily since the hyperinflation
of the early 1990s as Peru embarked on major economic reform, is
forecast to remain static at around 10 percent, the lowest for
almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Financial authorities are also targeting an exchange rate of
2.65 sols per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown is aimed at trying to halt the growing deficit on
its current account, which is approaching eight billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government has had to introduce a tough plan of fiscal and
monetary austerity, which may have a negative effect on plans to
earmark 40 percent of the 22.3 billion soles, or 10 billion
U.S. dollars, budget this year to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to boost exports and improve the
inefficient collection of tax revenues. Tax revenues account for
an average of 9 percent of GDP of other Latin American countries,
but only 4 percent of Peru's, studies have shown.
</P>
<P>
Government coffers should also be increased through continuing
the privatization policy started in the early 1990s. Petroperu,
the state oil company, is due to be privatized this year.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to increase exports, President Alberto Fujimori
visited Mexico, Panama, Venezuela recently and has made overtures
to two major South American trade blocs, the Andean Group and the
Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).
</P>
<P>
Peru's debt repayment problems should begin to ease. It has
already agreed a debt-reduction plan with its foreign commercial
bank creditors through the Brady Plan. In June the country will
renegotiate 60 percent of its public debt -- 9.6 billion
U.S. dollars -- with the Paris Club of private creditors.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of these agreements to change the schedule of
its debt payments will help the country to attract further foreign
capital from industrialized countries for investment projects and
embark on a second wave of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
An increase in foreign investment and the proceeds of
privatizations should help to further improve the country's
foreign reserves, which stood at 6.8 billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
The country faces a major problem in sorting out its troubled
sugar cane industry which has been crippled by losses since
agrarian reform in 1970. Further reform in the pipeline,
including the writing off of tax debts, is aimed at creating an
atmosphere favorable to private investment and so help the
industry become profitable.

the case on January 24 this year, it found no evidence to prove
that Oleksy was guilty of spying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision, which was made without any political
pressure, is legally binding and final, which means that no appeal
could be made.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said the evidence provided by Marian Zacharski,
a senior officer of the State Security Bureau, contained some
errors. It was lopsided and out of ulterior motives, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Oleksy case was brought out by former Interior Minister
Andrej Milczanowski on December 19, 1995, before he left office.
</P>
<P>
Former Polish President Lech Walesa met with the senior
officials days later and asked Milczanowski to report about the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy was accused of providing confidential political and
economic information to Russian intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
If the allegation had been proved, Oleksy would have been
sentenced to more than five years in prison or even the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
On December 22 last year, the Polish Parliament set up a
special committee to look into the case and Oleksy announced
his resignation.
</P>
<P>
On February 7, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz was appointed the new
prime minister of Poland.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Spread Out Weapon Purchases to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said here today
that it would spread out the purchases of equipment for its armed
forces to help trim the country's trade deficit, which stood at
9.2 billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 3.7 billion US dollars) at
the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar, when opening the
Defense Services Asia (DSA 96) exhibition here today, said the
approach would also involve procurement under off-set programs,
transfer of technology packages and joint-ventures which may
include local production.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the country would also try to produce
more commercial products for export based on the defense
technology acquired.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will increase our export capability, thus
reducing our trade deficit," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
Other measures being taken by his ministry, Syed said, would
include privatization of services such as maintenance of equipment
as well as basic training for pilots, drivers and technical
personnel in communications and electronics.
</P>
<P>
The four-day DSA 96 exhibition, which is said to be the second
largest in the region, are being participated by a total of 626
defense companies from 43 countries.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Vietnamese Border Trade Revitalized at Pingxiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sun Mujian, a returned overseas
Chinese now living in Pingxiang on the Sino-Vietnamese border, is
conducting business talks with her Vietnamese friends with the
intention of exporting China-made machine tools.
</P>
<P>
"The once cooled-down border trade seems to have warmed up
again," she said.
</P>
<P>
Her perception is proved by the official statistics which show
that in the first three months of this year Pingxiang, a port of
entry on the border between the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
and Vietnam, handled 404.66 million yuan-worth (some 48.75 million
US dollars) of transactions, a rise of 17.91 percent over the same
period of last year, of which 236.66 million yuan came from border
trade transactions.
</P>
<P>
At the large border trade fairs set up in recent years, lorries
filled with goods are seeing constantly flowing in, with cloth,
herbal medicine, beer, fresh fruit, and tape recorders coming from
China and ox hides, cotton and coconut oil from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who also manages a chicken farm, said that the border
trade is not yet booming but it will boom eventually.
</P>
<P>
The Pingxiang City Border Trade Company is one of the large
Chinese companies which are transferring funds to the revitalizing
border trade, said its general manager.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the border trade rally to the tariff
adjustments made by the Chinese government beginning April 1 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Denies Purchasing Arms from Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 22 (Xinhua) -- President Carlos Menem today
labelled the newspaper stories about Argentina's attempt to
purchase arms from Iran and send them to Ecuador as "absurd."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Menem also categorically denied
the rumors that circulated this past weekend about Defense
Minister Oscar Camilion's resignation over the same case.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry would never have bought arms in Iran and
then sent them to Ecuador since it "doesn't even have the money to
pay salaries," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a federal criminal court in Buenos Aires opened
an investigation into the alleged sale of arms to Ecuador during
the country's war with Peru.
</P>
<P>
The investigations was aimed to determine whether any Argentine
public officials, including the defense minister and the chief of
armed forces, knew about the destination of the arms.
</P>
<P>
Similar investigations have been under way since last year.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine military authorities have declared that they were
deceived because the arms were first shipped to Venezuela, and
then diverted from there to Ecuador.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's certified public
accountants are required to hold licenses when handling
securities-related business, starting this year.
</P>
<P>
The certified public accountants have to pass examinations
before being licenses, according to a regulation announced by the

have no fewer than 60 professional accountants, including at least
eight certified public accountants, and have at least two million
yuan in registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Auditing, verification of assets and consultation for
enterprises issuing and trading in stocks, securities firms and

<HEADLINE> Center-Left May Bring Italy Political Stability, Critics Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy may come into a new phase of
political stability following the victory of the center-left coalition
dominated by the Democratic Party of the Left in the 13th post-war
general elections, observers said here today.
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi's Olive Tree bloc, as the center-left is called,
won a majority in both houses of parliament Monday to form the
first center-left government in the country since the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of the Left also replaced media tycoon
Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Froza Italy party to become
Italy's biggest political party, dealing a fatal blow to
Berlusconi, who was fighting hard to overcome corruption charges
to return to the prime minister's office he held for eight months
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Local media carried comments on the election victory of the
center-left, claiming that the victory opened a new page in
Italian history.
</P>
<P>
Commentators say the triumph was not only a victory for the
winning parties, but of national significance to Italy.
</P>
<P>
They called the results of the elections a victory of just
forces, which also demonstrated that Italy was making progress in
politics.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the center-left's coming into power would end
the technocratic government in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, the coalition's candidate for prime minister, told state
television that "it was a great victory for the Olive Tree, but we
will govern for all of Italy."
</P>
<P>
He also said the results reflected the "strong aspiration" of
the people for further pushing forward the reform, developing the
economy, increasing job opportunities and narrowing the gap
between the north and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that a center-left government will not let the
voters down.
</P>
<P>
However, some people sounded notes of caution, saying the
center-left coalition was the less cohesive of the two main blocs
in Italy and would not find it easy to stay together.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center-left and the center-right have different
political views, especially on the issue of reforming the nation's
political system.
</P>
<P>
Thus, many people expect new rounds of political fighting
between the two rivals in the post-election days.
</P>
<P>
Italy had enjoyed a degree of stability through the Cold War
years until 1992 under a proportional voting system which
delivered a string of revolving-door governments largely made up
of the same faces.
</P>
<P>
That ended dramatically when crusading prosecutors uncovered
massive corruption, unleashing a political earthquake that buried
the long-governing Christian Democrats and their allies.
</P>
<P>
The parties and politicians that replaced them have failed to
create a stable government in a political landscape more confusing
and fractured than ever.

<HEADLINE> Rules for Elections in Bosnia Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The final rules and regulations
for the Bosnian elections, described as the most complex electoral
process in history, were set today by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
But there is still a long way to go before an environment
conducive to free and fair elections is in place, warned
Ambassador Robert H Frowick, the chief of the OSCE mission in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Under the timetable of the Dayton Peace Accord, the elections
should be held in September. The OSCE today said that anyone over
18 and listed in the 1991 census will be eligible to vote in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
But there are likely to be huge problems surrounding the voting
of some two million refugees and displaced people -- half the
country's population -- who fled their homes during Bosnia's
43-month war.
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with the most complex electoral process in
history," said Frowick.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE says that people away from their old homes can
entrust others to vote for them or vote wherever they are living
if approved by local electoral committees or the OSCE mission in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Registering so many refugees and tallying their ballots would
be a massive task in a country where electricity and running water
have still not been restored in some areas, said Frowick.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador is expected to recommend in June whether polling
should go ahead by the Dayton deadline of mid-September. The final
decision will rest with the major world powers.

<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi ex-president H.M.
Ershad who is serving terms of imprisonment Monday went on hunger
strike to press for his release.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Jatiya (National) Party (JP) which

authorities under the rule of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP).
</P>
<P>

30 this year, the JP has called for Ershad's release to lead the
party to race for the coming general elections.
</P>

CARACAS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will propose to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) the need to
renew the organization to suit the changing world, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Mining and Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta said that
the proposal will be presented at OPEC's upcoming meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that some corporations, such as Aramco of
Saudi Arabian and Petroleos de Venezuela or PDVSA, are so powerful
that they can affect the behavior of the energy market, which has
not occurred 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current uneasiness over the protection of the
environment did not exist then either, nor was there such a
discretional control of fuels as a source of revenues for states
being made.
</P>
<P>
In Arrieta's opinion, these changes make it necessary to renew
OPEC's organization.

PRAGUE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States has made clear it
will not support Taiwan's independence and will oppose its entry
into the United Nations, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian was responding to a question in an interview with the
Czech newspaper Pravo on his talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in The Hague on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also China's foreign minister, quoted Christopher
as saying the U.S. side now has a better understanding of the
sensitivity of the Taiwan issue to China.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who will end his three-day visit here today, said
Christopher promised him the U.S. administration will renew
China's most favored nation status despite opposition from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the U.S. side is still dissatisfied with China's
progress in the protection of intellectual property rights, adding
that China will retaliate blow for blow if the United States
announces sanctions against Chinese exports on May 15.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Qian said he appreciated U.S. President Bill
Clinton's proposal to replace confrontation with dialogue.
</P>
<P>
But he accused the U.S. administration of simultaneously
conducting a policy of trying to pressure China while having a
dialogue on human rights, which he said is doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China pays great attention to the negotiations on a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and supports the
implementation of such a ban under a treaty to prohibit and
destroy all nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
He said China is ready to work with all countries to
conclude the test ban treaty by the end of 1996.

</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that tariff cuts for items on the
temporary exclusion list would be phased in over a longer period

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- About 45 people were killed and
at least 70 were missing in a two-week-long flood which hit seven
provinces in Afghanistan, reports from Kabul said here today.
</P>
<P>
Bob Mckerrow, head of the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies, was quoted as saying in Kabul that
flooding in the southwest, west and north of Afghanistan was the
worst in several years.
</P>
<P>
"The flooding has affected about 20,000 families, 120,000
people," he said. "The damage to human life, property, land and
livestock has been significant and was spread over large parts of
the country."
</P>
<P>
The floods were caused by heavier seasonal rains and melting
snows in the mountains, he said.
</P>
<P>
Flooding, a yearly phenomenon in Afghanistan but one that
appeared to be increasing in gravity, was caused by deforestation,
over-grazing and over-cultivation by poor farmers, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Faryab province in western Afghanistan was
the hardest-hit area where 31 people were killed and dozens were
missing.
</P>
<P>
About 2,800 houses, 930 acres of agricultural land, 3,350
cattle, 28 flour mills, 12 mosques and 5 schools were also
destroyed in Faryab.
</P>
<P>
Besides the ongoing civil war, Afghan people also suffer from
natural calamities every year, including floods, landslides and
earthquakes, said observers.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, about 300 people were killed in Badakhshan
province when a massive landslide caused by heavy rains buried the
village of Qara Luk.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican authorities are
investigating four companies used to launder money for Colombian
drug baron Jose Castrillon Hennao who was arrested last Thursday
in Panama, police said today.
</P>
<P>
The names of the companies have been withheld as part of the
investigation but they will be disclosed later.
</P>
<P>
Castrillon Hennao, suspected of being the main leader of the
Cali drug cartel outside Colombia, was captured in Panama after an
eight-month international operation.
</P>
<P>
Police say he entered Costa Rica via the Nicaraguan border on
March 26 using a false Mexican passport in the name of Jacinto
Natalio Ruiloga and left the following day through the Panamanian
border, police said.
</P>
<P>
The drug chief started his career with the cartel as a ship's
captain and rose to be leader of a group based in Puerto
Beunaventura on the Pacific coast, west of the Colombian capital
Santa Fe De Bogota.
</P>
<P>
Drugs were sent from Puerto Beunaventura to the United States
and Europe through Pacific islands, including the Galapagos
Islands, and Central America using a vast fleet of fishing boats.
Several vessels were seized carrying a total of 12 tons of drugs.

basis of their financial, legal and physical capabilities, the
Department of Civil Aviation would permit those qualified airlines
to fly internationally at an early date, an official of the
department told local newspaper The Kathmandu Post.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted a liberal air transport policy last year
in its budget report for the current 1995-96 fiscal year, and last
week it announced that arrangements for private air service in the
international sector had been made.
</P>
<P>
Airlines proposed for international flights have to be
registered in Nepal and they could operate scheduled passenger
services, charter flights and cargo services.
</P>
<P>
Agreements have been reached to allow Nepali airlines to fly to
Britain, Germany, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Japan,
Bhutan, Brunei, Russia, Italy, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore,
Pakistan, China and Egypt, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Till now, only the state-run Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation
could operate international service in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Huge Capital Inflows Pose Inflationary Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's relatively high
interest rates and stable currency this year have attracted large
capital inflows that have become an inflationary threat, according
to a senior official of the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Capital inflows in March are expected to total 1.32 billion US
dollars, more than three times the inflows recorded in the same
period of last year, said Deputy Director of the central bank's
foreign department Nattha Marakanonda.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has used high interest rates to curb
commercial banks' lending. As a result, the inflows of foreign
funds have been increasing since the second half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, fears of the Thai currency's devaluation sparked by
Mexico's peso crisis prompted investors to pull their money out of
Thailand and capital inflows in March 1995 totaled 407.7 million
dollars in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
During this period of last year, the Thai financial market was
very volatile, with foreign money going out as quickly as it came
in, she said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.32 billion dollars' inflows in March, 733 million
dollars poured into non-resident accounts, up sharply from 309
million dollars in March last year.
</P>
<P>
She said that net borrowings in March this year were estimated
at 338.4 million dollars, down from 481.2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
The huge inflows have come at a time when inflation is at the
four-year high, making it more difficult for Thailand's central
bank to put inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has estimated the inflows of funds at
21.88 billion dollars in 1995, up 79 percent from 12.24 billion
dollars in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission (EC) of
Bangladesh has finalized a code of conduct for the coming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to officials concerned today, the 27-point code was
finalized at an EC meeting Monday and will be announced in a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The code was formulated giving due consideration to the views
of different political parties, the officials said, adding that
Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena met with political leaders
separately Sunday and a general consensus was reached about the
code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
Under the final code of conduct, parties participating in the
poll race are prohibited from using racial and communal sentiments
in seeking votes. The use of religious places including mosques,
churches and temples as electioneering platforms is also banned.
</P>
<P>
Candidates or parties or anybody on their behalf will not use
government media for their poll campaign and they must refrain
from using government transport, government officials or employees
and state facilities during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The code also bans parties and candidates to use provocative
and indecent language and such language that would hurt the
religious sentiments of the people.
</P>
<P>
A candidate shall not at any cost exceed the ceiling on
election expenses, the code of conduct says, adding that the
election process will not be influenced by money, arms and muscle
power or local power.

<HEADLINE> Oil Shortage Affects Mongolia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's oil reserves this
year have dropped to the lowest level in recent years and the
shortage of oil will cause difficulty to the country's economic
development, Mongolian businessmen warned.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from officials of the Mongolian Oil Import and
Export Corporation, the country's biggest state-run oil supplier,
in a letter to the State Great Hural (the country's parliament)
and government.
</P>
<P>
The officials of the corporation blamed the oil shortage on the
government's restrictions on the prices of oil products.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, they asked the Great Hural and the government to
lift the restrictions and allocate more money to increasing the
reserves of oil products, which would guarantee the normal
operation and security of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
They complained in the letter that the government's decision in
1994 to fix the prices of oil products in an effort to control
inflation had brought great losses to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, the corporation suffered a loss of 2.3 billion
tugriks (about 5.75 million U.S. dollars) because of the decision.
</P>
<P>
As Mongolia is not capable of turning out oil products itself
at present, the corporation's operation has a direct bearing on
the development of the country's economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China have established
a partnership of mutual understanding, trust and cooperation which
is oriented toward the 21st century, President Boris Yeltsin said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency on the eve of his visit
to China, Yeltsin said, "Our relations have entered a new stage of
mutual understanding, trust and cooperation, and we have good
reasons to regard such a relationship as a constructive
partnership oriented toward the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who will begin his China visit on Wednesday, said that
the past three years have witnessed significant progress in
Russo-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China have begun regular political dialogues
and their common borders are becoming a bond of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Today, there are no problems of political nature between
Russia and China," Yeltsin said, adding that bilateral meetings at
the highest level are very instrumental in promoting such a
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that the common understanding reached between
the two countries on a series of issues will enable them to
actively coordinate in international affairs for world stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that with its fast-growing economy and dynamic
integration process, the Asia-Pacific region has become a foreign
policy priority of all major countries including Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with China is of special importance to Moscow,
Yeltsin noted, because that is helpful for Russia's economic
reform, the economic development in its Far East region and its
participation in the political and economic progress in the
Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Tourism Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia earned 5.2 billion US
dollars from tourism in 1995, up from 3.9 billion in 1993,
according to today's Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, more than four million foreign tourists came to
Indonesia, said Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Minister Jeep
Ave when he reported to Vice President Try Sutrisno Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We established a tourism consolidation forum late last year
with the task of setting up inter-sectoral policies and
recommendations to make tourism the country's number one foreign
currency earner by the year 2005," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the first five-year development plan
(1969-1973), the tourism sector gained 10.8 billion US dollars in
revenues from 86,100 foreign tourists to the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, or by the end of the fifth five-year development plan,
the sector reaped 3.9 billion dollars, almost four times that in
1969.
</P>
<P>
To balance a possible drop in the number of foreign tourist
arrivals, the minister said, the government had made efforts to
increase the number of local tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey launched by the Central Bureau of
Statistics, local tourists made 103.8 million visits in 1994,
spending more than 5 million dollars. In 1991 they only made 72.1
million visits.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador kicked off today a
three-year program for mass distribution of nutritional
supplements to the poor and needy.
</P>
<P>
The program, to be financed with 3.24 million U.S. dollars from
international organizations, is designed to address the
nutritional status of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ecuadoran Health Ministry, 34 out of every 100
Ecuadorans are suffering from chronic malnutrition due to iron and
vitamin deficiency.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the program, iron pills and vitamin A
tablets will be distributed to hospitals, dispensaries and Health
Ministry centers and subcenters.
</P>
<P>
The iron pills will be for 256,000 pregnant women, 45,000
underweight and 14,000 premature babies born every year and
198,000 children below the age of 2.
</P>
<P>
The vitamin A tablets will be given to the extremely poor
inhabitants in 457 zones where the lack of this nutrient affects
21 percent of the population or some 533,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, iron and vitamin A will be added to sugar
and flour, including imported flour, to nourish the Ecuadorans.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will provide sugar cane refineries and
flour mills with equipment to make the mixtures.

GENEVA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Soccer's world governing body FIFA

After consulting with the African Football Federation, FIFA
ruled that Zimbabwe's own evidence was not in accordance with the

Thus, Nigeria will continue to pursue its goal in Atlanta along

<HEADLINE> Australia's Inflation Pressure Eases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia saw inflation
pressures eased in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released today that
the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4 percent in the first three
months of 1996, the lowest quarterly growth in two years.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate in the year to March was 3.7 percent,
down from 5.1 percent in the December quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed that the underlying inflation rate,
which excludes fluctuating short-term factors, reached an annual
rate of 3.3 percent in last quarter. It rose 0.4 percent in the
March quarter over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation rate is expected to have peaked in the
past three months and to fall back within the Reserve Bank of
Australia's (RBA) target of 2-3 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The RBA warned that the inflation rate could not be put on a
hold unless wage growth was curbed.
</P>
<P>
Local economists are pondering the possibility of a lower of
the interest rates by the RBA in the near future because of the
ease of inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
Australia's economy is slowing down due to interest rate hikes
in late 1994. The Treasury predicted that the annual economic
growth rate would drop to a mere 3 percent in the current fiscal
year.

BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth rate of Germany
will be less than 1 percent this year, instead of the 1.5 percent
forecast earlier, Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the Free Democratic Party, Rexrodt
said the economic situation in the latter half of the year will be
better than the first half, adding that the growth rate in 1997
can reach 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Theo Waigel agreed that the present
economic slowdown is not a recession, but a temporary weakness.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, businessmen are more pessimistic. The Federation
of German Industries said a recession is still possible. Though
interest rates were cut again recently, the public doubt whether
there will be any growth at all.
</P>
<P>
The federation also urges the government to control wage rises.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 431 enterprises shows that the present economic
situation is worse than last fall. Investment and orders are
slipping, and there are again more companies firing than hiring
workers since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Frozen Embryo Sets Legal Record in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A local court in Tasmania of
Australia set a precedent in legal history by judging that a
frozen embryo has the right to inherit even after the father was
dead.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in Tasmania decided that the frozen embryos
of widow G and her late husband S had the rights to inherit their
father's estate if they were implanted and born live.
</P>
<P>
Professor Donald Chalmers, an in vitro fertilization (IVF) law
specialist at the University of Tasmania, said it was the first
time in the world that an embryo which had not yet been
transferred to the mother could be considered to have succession
rights even though the father was dead.
</P>
<P>
G and her husband S had successfully produced five embryos
through an IVF program in 1993. G gave birth to a son after three
of the embryos were planted in 1994. They planned to have another
child by planting the remaining embryos. But S died without
leaving any will in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
G determined to go ahead with the implantation of the frozen
embryos, which were produced with her ova and her late husband's
sperm. She is expected to have a child by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The court suggested that a proportion of the late father's
estate be set aside for the in vitro child until the widow became
unable to give birth to a child of her late husband.
</P>
<P>
Justice Pierre Slicer of the Tasmanian court said that an in
vitro child was entitled to share equally with those who were born
in the lifetime of the parent, no matter when the frozen embryo
was implanted.
</P>
<P>
Because some women are able to give birth to children beyond
the age of 50, the court decision means that a child could be born
40 years after its father's death and still a legitimate heir of
the parent's estate.
</P>
<P>
He said that an IVF embryo was treated like a posthumous child.
 Though an embryo or fetus was not regarded as a person by
Australian law, "the fetus is considered to have potential or
contingent legal interest which vests and becomes enforceable upon
its live birth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those contingent interests are recognized in the law of
succession and tort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chalmers said that the landmark case gave rise to similar
succession rights applying to gametes which had used donated
sperm.

<HEADLINE> Power Project Gets Overseas Commercial Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-US joint venture power
plant backed by nine foreign banks with 65 million US dollars in
commercial loans will be built in Wuhu, in east China's Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
The 65-million-dollar deal was clinched on Monday in Beijing,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
It represents China's first deal channeling overseas commercial
loans to the power industry, the newspaper quoted Yang Qing,
chairman of the joint venture, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also for the first time, the Wuhu project will use the overseas
loans to purchase equipment from a domestic machinery plant, the
Shanghai United Electric Corp, the newspaper said, adding that
Chinese power projects have always used export credits to buy
foreign-made equipment.
</P>
<P>
Yang said additional commercial loans will be channeled into
at least two major projects, one in Nanpu, Fujian Province, and
another in Yaomeng, Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in this project, which is under construction
as the fourth phase of the Wuhu Power Plant, will be one billion
yuan. Two 125,000-kw generators will be installed.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhu plant combines the efforts of the Hong Kong-based
China Power International Holding Ltd, the US firm AES China
Holding Co, the Anhui Liyuan Electric Power Development Co and the
Wuhu Energy Development Co.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Power Industry, foreign funds are
expected to account for 20 percent of total investment for the
industry in the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese schools were
recently selected as the first group to carry out a new kind of
environmental education program, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Program of Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the
Environment (GLOBE) was promoted by Al Gore, vice-president of the
United States in 1994, and is designed to urge young people in
various countries to collect local environmental data on their own.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 teachers from the four schools - situated in Beijing,
Shanghai, Wuhan and Shenzhen - started a one-week training session
in Beijing yesterday on how to carry out this program.
</P>
<P>
GLOBE participants from different places can process and
exchange scientific research and information on the Internet by
connecting to the computer center of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) in the US State of Colorado. So far,
2,700 schools in 32 countries have taken part in GLOBE, which is
headquartered in the White House.
</P>
<P>
China has set up a special committee to implement the program
in the country, with State Councillor Song Jian as its honorary
director. At least one school from each of 30 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government will be selected as GLOBE sites in China in the coming
years. The schools will be equipped with a personal computer and a
modem.
</P>
<P>
At yesterday's launching ceremony for GLOBE, Ye Ruqiu, deputy
director of the State Environment Protection Administration,
disclosed that the second group of eight schools across China for
GLOBE sites will be selected this summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- While millions of Chinese high
school students are busy preparing for the national college
entrance exam in July, more adults are preparing for a similar
test next month.
</P>
<P>
Some 94,500 candidates will take the college entrance exam for
adults in Beijing this year, the highest number in recent years,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
But there are only about 50,000 seats available for the
candidates, who are eager for part-time study, at 96 schools under
the administration of the Beijing Education Commission (BEC), the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the candidates will seek slots at schools run
independently by colleges and universities, the paper quoted
sources from the Beijing Adult Examination Office under the BEC as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the 10th rise in the number of people in Beijing taking
the test since 1986, when a unified exam of this kind started
across the country, said Tan Deshen, vice-director of the Adult
Education Office.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge is due to social and economic development, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, employers have attached more importance
to training their workers.
</P>
<P>
Units mainly in finance, trade and construction have selected
experienced employees that are in need of professional knowledge
to take the exam, leading to a seven percent increase in
on-the-job candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
Tan said competition in the job market, which favors people
knowledgeable in more than one subject, has also contributed to
the increasing number of candidates.
</P>
<P>
The top four popular specialties again this year are finance
and accounting, management, computers and English, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Adult education institutes are also changing their curriculums
to make them more in tune to the needs of economic development,
which is spurring more people to take the entrance exam, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Adult Education Office, 70 percent of the
total taking the test are under the age of 25, intending to pursue
higher education either to meet the needs of their current jobs or
to seek new work.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expressed satisfaction with the first round of missile talks with
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies told a press
briefing that the two-day talks in Berlin on Saturday and Sunday
were useful and set a good beginning for further talks between the
two sides on the missile issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is interested in continuing the
discussions, Davies said, adding that the U.S. goal is to
encourage DPRK to join a multilateral group seeking to curb the
international missile trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated denials by Pyongyong, Washington has been
alleging that DPRK has sold long-range Scud missiles to Iran and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government would like to have a DPRK commitment to
stop both the export and production of missiles, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin talks, the first of its kind between Washington and
Pyongyong, were sponsored by the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman noted that the talks were unrelated to
the latest proposal by the United States and South Korea to hold a
four-way talks on the future of the Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Seeks Foreign Help for Renovation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province is
seeking some 10 billion US dollars in the coming five years for
nearly 2,000 renovation projects, a provincial official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
These projects, 350 of which are related to large state-owned
enterprises, are concentrated in the fields of energy,
transportation and key raw materials projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations have been under way in the province for assets
evaluation, debt clearance, and re-employment and pension
issues. The provincial government is studying the possibility of
drafting policy measures to attract foreign investment in the
renovation projects of major state-owned enterprises and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has formed special organizations for most
of the projects with the task of seeking co-operation partners
overseas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the province plans to import 3,000 items of technology
for technological renovation projects in the transportation,
power, building materials, machinery, chemical, metallurgy,
electronics, textiles and light industry spheres.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995 Hebei used over three billion US dollars of
foreign investment, which represented an annual increase of 50
percent. The province has established 5,552 foreign-funded
enterprises, 2,412 of which are already in operation.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province in
northeast China has seen its tourism flourishing in the last five
years. The number of overseas tourists and the amount of foreign
currency earned by tourism have both been growing at an annual
rate of 24 percent.

36,000 overseas tourists, 31 percent up from the same period of

</P>
<P>
Zhang Qinghe, head of the provincial Bureau of Tourism,
attributed the boom to the popularity of Sino-Russian cross-border
trips.
</P>
<P>
From the time the first cross-border tour was opened between
the city of Heihe on the Chinese side and Blagoveshchensk in
Russia in 1988 until the end of 1995, the province received nearly
500,000 tourists from Russia and other CIS nations.

The international community should act to reduce the mine risk
to civilians, the Chinese representative said, adding that the
Chinese government will continue to exercise maximum restraint and
impose strict controls over the export of landmines.
</P>
<P>
An initial round of talks, held in Vienna last October, failed
to produce an agreement on strengthened restrictions on the use of
anti-personnel landmines. Another round of talks in January also
proved to be fruitless.

<HEADLINE> New Scenic Spot Lures Tourists to Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shapotou Scenic Area on the
banks of the Yellow River and next to the Tengger Desert in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is becoming more appealing as new
attractions are being added.
</P>
<P>
After drifting on rafts made of goatskin in the Yellow River
and camel riding in the desert, which are two of the major tourism
programs, visitors will soon be able to bath in a mineral spring,
as a 800-sq-m pool is being built.
</P>
<P>
Other new tourism programs under way include sand therapy
facilities and touring the Yellow River by hovercraft, local
tourism officials said.
</P>
<P>
Shapotou, located in Zhongwei County, became famous nationwide
first of all because of its success in desert control, which
resulted in turning a wilderness into fertile green land.
</P>
<P>
As fruit trees blossomed, local authorities began to turn the
place into a tourist attraction, making use of both the resources
of the river and the desert.
</P>
<P>
After years of effort, a number of tourism programs are now
available, including visiting orchards in the desert, sand dune
tobogganing, viewing the local Hui ethnic culture, and a Yellow
River panorama from a cableway. In addition, there are
numerous sites of historical interest on the banks of the river.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 537,000 domestic tourists and over
13,000 overseas tourists have visited Shapotou so far.

YANGON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior General Than
Shwe has called for achieving economic success in the country's
next five-year plan (from 1996-97 to 2000-2001) which began on
April 1.
</P>
<P>
Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC), made the remarks at a coordination
meeting here Monday, The New Light of Myanmar reported today.

plan (from 1992-93 to 1995-96), according to the official

on the achievements of the last four-year plan.

<HEADLINE> Deal to be Reached on Iraqi Oil Sale, UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali believes that U.N. and Iraq will reach a
memorandum of understanding on the oil-for-food plan in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
In responds to questions outside the Trusteeship Council today,
Boutros-Ghali said, "I am an optimist. I hope that we will be
able to conclude this Memorandum of Understanding in the next few
days."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed economic sanctions, including
ban of oil export, on Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
The long time sanctions have crippled Iraqi economy and resulted
in severe shortage of food and medicine. Iraqi people have
suffered a lot of hardships and some 500,000 children under the
age of five died of mulnutrition, flue and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion dollars in six months
to import food, medicine and other necessities. But, Iraqi
authorities refused to accept the resolution, considering that the
monitoring terms violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Iraq conducted the first and second rounds of
talks on the oil-for-food plan in February and March. The third
round started on April 8 and the Iraqi chief negotiator, Abdul
Amir al-Anbari, expressed his determination to reach a deal during
the current round of talks.

ATHENS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A greek coastguard vessel early
today fired warning shots to stop a Turkish speedboat which had
allegedly landed eight illegal Iranian immigrants on the southeast
Aegean island of Kastellorizo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Merchant Marine Ministry, the Turkish vessel
Derya 1 refused to stop for an inspection by the Greek side after
landing the Iranians on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Greek coastguard vessel fired warning shots in the air but
the speedboat fled to Turkish territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, coastguard officers arrested the
illegal immigrants -- three men, two women and three children, who
are being held on the island.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said later that the same
speedboat and its captain had been involved in similar incidents
in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem of illegal immigrants was another
thorn in Greek-Turkish relations and requested a dialogue with
Turkey to solve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Dole: Wage Increase Will Win in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole said the minimum wage increase would win vote in the U.S.
Congress, meaning President Bill Clinton would win another battle
in the election-year strategy.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by CBS Sunday, Dole, who had strongly opposed
increasing the U.S federal minimum wage, acknowledged for the
first time that the increase appeared inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration proposed the increase earlier this
year that the federal minimum wage should be raised from the
current 4.25 U.S. dollars per hour to 5.15 dollars over two years.
It said the real purchasing power of the minimum wage would reach
the lowest level in nearly 40 years unless it was increased.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, who has been active in pushing the
increase, predicted last week that the increase "will happen in
the next week or two."
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans said that a 90-percent increase would
reduce the employment and lift the nation's unemployment rate.
They said that some studies had suggested the increase would
reduce the employment by 400,000 jobs and even more in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republicans in the U.S. Congress have been
criticizing the government more for "playing politics" on the
matter. House Majority Leader Dick Armey noted last week that
"this is an election year" and the "minimum wage has an extremely
high demagogue coefficient."
</P>
<P>
Armey asked why Democrats had neglected to raise the minimum
wage in 1993 and 1994 when they controlled both the White House
and Congress.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to political reality, the GOP has softened its
resistance to the increase recently, especially after 20 GOP
lawmakers supported a bill to raise the minimum hourly pay to 5.25
dollars over 15 months, 10 cents higher than the government plan.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich has told Republicans in the House
that they should prepare themselves to face a vote on the issue --
a vote that would almost surely lead to an increase.
</P>
<P>
But the Republicans would not give in without a fight. Dole
said Sunday, "What we'll try to do, if there is an increase, is to
package it with some other things." He mentioned other measures
that the Democrats oppose, like tax cuts, or as part of a budget
agreement, thereby dooming any increase.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Begins Re-election Campaign in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of the
U.S. House of Representatives started campaigning for his
re-election today, telling supporters to use grass-roots muscle to
combat a millionaire's money.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, a Republican of Georgia, said he doesn't have the
money to match the 3 million dollars in campaign spending promised
by Democratic challenger Michael Coles. Coles, founder of the
Great American Cookie Co., is the best financed of the Democrats
seeking the nomination to run against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
"I have an opponent who is a liberal millionaire," The
Associated Press quoted Gingrich as saying at his Roswell campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has reportedly raised a total of 1.8 million dollars
in 1995. If he continues at that pace, he will likely raise well
over the 3 million dollars he predicted Coles could spend.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich then went to the state Capitol to sign up for the July
9 Republican primary, and paid the 4,008-dollar qualifying fee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coles qualified on the Democratic side today.

LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Deputy Minister of
Science, Technology and Vocational Training Kangwa Nsuluka today
ordered closure of two private colleges in the capital for not
operating within the required regulations.
</P>
<P>
Nsuluka made the order during his inspection tour of private
colleges in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The Mansfield Training Center and the Capital Trades Training
College in Lusaka were closed immediately because their
operations were not approved by the government and therefore were
illegal, Nsuluka said.
</P>
<P>
Although the private colleges were supplementing the
government's efforts to provide secondary school leavers with
skills, the government insisted that they should operate within
the law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nsuluka observed some private colleges in the country could
neither meet the required standards nor pay tax to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The government would not hesitate to close down any private
college in the country which did not operate within the required
regulations, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Nuclear Plant Shuts Down All 8 Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Pickering nuclear
generating plant in Ontario, southeast Canada, shut down all its
eight nuclear reactors last weekend because of a flaw with a
secondary safety system.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hydro and the Atomic Energy Control Board was
quoted by local press reports today as stressing that public
safety was not compromised by the flaw, which was first detected
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the eight reactors, which make up about 20
percent of Hydro's electrical generating capacity, may last for
eight to 10 days, according to a statement from the Crown utility.
</P>
<P>
Brian Mactavish, spokesman for the Pickering plant, said Hydro
does not anticipate any power shortages as a result of the
shutdown because spring is traditionally a period when demand for
power is low. Pickering's lack of production will cost about
840,000 U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Only 16 months ago, a broken pipe caused an emergency shutdown
of Pickering nuclear station A and marked the first time a Candu
nuclear reactor's emergency coolant system was activated. Eight
months later, the Atomic Energy Control Board ordered Hydro to
improve safety practices or face restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, there was a leak of radioactive heavy water into
Lake Ontario from a heat exchanger on one of the reactors at
Pickering, just east of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "We'll be looking at design changes at the
facility to prevent this from happening again."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
expected to give priority to the promotion of equitable economic
development on the forthcoming world meeting of trade and economic
officials in South Africa, a U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gorg Kell, officer-in-charge of the New York office of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
briefed the program of the ninth meeting of UNCTAD to be held in
Midrand, South Africa, from April 27 to May 11 at a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the U.N. focus issues such as peace-keeping,
social problems and human rights, there was a need to address the
most pressing problem today: the exclusion of the two billion men
and women from the emerging global economy.
</P>
<P>
"After all, economic development is the most basic condition
for overcoming poverty and for attaining higher social standards,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not recognizing the pressing problem of economic exclusion
would be short-sighted and self-damaging in the global community
as a whole and for each member of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly true today when no country can go its own
way in isolation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that UNCTAD's new Secretary General Rubens Ricuperoo,
a former finance minister of Brazil, stressed that the U.N. must
once again give priority to the promotion of equitable economic
development.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 officials from UNCTAD's 188 member governments

DAMASCUS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher left here tonight for Jerusalem after five hours of
talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad on ways of securing a
cease-fire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters before leaving Damascus that the talks
focussed on a restatement of the 1993 understanding, which ended a
seven-day Israeli attacks in south Lebanon in July 1993. The
understanding was brokered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he had reassured Assad of Washington's
"determination ... to achieve an early cease-fire in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
But Christopher has obviously not been able to win agreement
from Assad on U.S. proposals for ending Israel's 12-day-old
Operation Grapes of Wrath against pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he had presented U.S. ideas to Syrian
leaders and got their reaction, but he did not give details.
</P>
<P>
Christopher has been shuttling between Damascus and Jerusalem
for the past three days to seek a cease-fire in the fighting in
Lebanon. Syria is the main power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since April 11, Israel has launched successive air and
artillery attacks against Hezbollah positions in south
Lebanon.

Questioned about the so-called triangle relations between

the "China Card". Russia hopes for good relations between Beijing
and Washington, he stated.

"Although there are certain differences between the two
countries, Russia and China are firmly determined to settle all
disputes on the basis of reason and pragmatic approach," Ryurikov
said.

According to the aide, "a hot communication line" will be
opened between Moscow and Beijing for Yeltsin and the Chinese
leaders during the visit to make prompt decisions on pressing
problems.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Spokesman on Incidents along Lines of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A UNHCR spokesman today blamed
the impatience of Bosnian refugees to return home for the latest
incidents among the Muslim and Serb ethnic groups along the truce
lines in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Impatience to go home and lack of cooperation with the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have led to the clashes
between the Muslim and Serbs" in recent days, UNHCR spokesman in
Banja Luka office Mans Nyberg said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, a few hundred Bosnian Muslims made
several attempts to enter into Serb-held towns of Novi Grad in the
west, and Brcko, Teslic and Doboj in the north to see their old
homes, but they were blocked by the local Serb residents. Clashes
between the two ethnic groups with stone-throwing and
stick-beating have prompted the IFOR troops to intervene and even
forced to fire warning shots into the air to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the UNHCR should have the most important
role in resolving problems of refugees in Bosnia in line with the
Bosnia peace agreement, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Dragan Kijac has stated that
with attempts at illegal entering of Muslims in the Serb
territory, Muslim authorities were trying to provoke incidents
which they would blame on the Serb authorities.
</P>
<P>
But IFOR officials blamed the leaders of both parties for
manipulating the frustrated refugees for their own political
purpose.
