HARTSBURG BRACES FOR MIGHTY CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Craig Hartsburg won't get the chance to
rebuild the Chicago Blackhawks. Instead, he will try to help the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks rebound from one of their most disappointing
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, fired by the Blackhawks after the team failed to make
the playoffs for the first time in 29 years, was hired as the Ducks
coach on July 21. Making the move to the West Coast and to the
Disney-owned Ducks is no less challenging than what he would have
faced if he stayed in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks were 30-39-13 last season, which led Hartsburg to
say just before his firing that the team needed a ``total
overhaul.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ducks were 26-43-13, Hartsburg doesn't think the
Ducks need that kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are quality people here and I'm excited about the
opportunity,'' said Hartsburg, who became the Ducks third head
coach in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, who filled the NHL's last coaching vacancy after
Butch Goring turned it down, is happy to have another job, even if
it's with an organization many consider to be in a state of
disarray as it begins its sixth season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, with less than a month to go before training camp,
have yet to make a major free-agent signing, have an unproven
defense and suspect depth. But Hartsburg, who signed a three-year
contract worth just over $1.2 million, at least has the dynamic duo
of Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne to work with after having
practically no offense in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a team that can skate and generate offense,'' he said.
``The area we need to focus on is to become a solid defensive team.
Our defense as a team needs to improve and not just the
defensmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like deposed coach Pierre Page, Hartsburg worked under Jack
Ferreira in Minnesota. (Ferreira is the Ducks vice president.)
After finishing a 10-year career as a defenseman with the North
Stars, Hartsburg, three times an all-star, was hired by Ferreira as
an assistant coach for the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   Being Ferreira's friend didn't mean much in the way of job
security for Page, who lasted only 10 months. But Hartsburg did get
a good review from Pierre Gauthier, who had yet to take over as
general manager when Hartsburg was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the franchise's guy,'' said Gauthier. ``I know Craig,
he's a solid hockey man and he's really grown as a coach. I feel
very comfortable with him being here. I did interview him when he
came through the second time around, and Jack had my full support
in hiring him.''
</P>
<P>
   But after his experience in Chicago, Hartsburg doesn't come to
Southern California with any preconceived notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be here for 20 years, but I'm not worried about
anything else but making the (Ducks) a team. If I was worried
(about job security) I'm not going to do a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be intense and have fun. If you're not enjoying
it, why bother?''
</P>
<P>
   After four years as an assistant in Philadelphia and one
successful head coaching stint in the Ontario Hockey League
(47-14-5 with Guelph), Hartsburg was 104-102-40 in three years with
the Blackhawks. Chicago made the playoffs twice before the miserly
ways of Chicago owner William Wirtz caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed and hurt,'' Hartsburg said being fired
with two years left on his contract. ``But I had to move on.... I
knew I'd be back. I'm excited about the future, not worried about
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago GM Bob Murray sounded apologetic when he announced
Hartsburg's firing. Most believe the move was ordered by Wirtz, who
was no doubt unhappy with his coaching calling for an ``overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig Hartsburg sold out his soul to try to get this team
going,'' Murray said. ``The things he tried to motivate this team
ran the gamut and nothing worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg's motivational techniques will be needed with the
Ducks. And, one of the first things he must address is his
relationship with Kariya. Already Hartsburg has had some private
conversations with Kariya, who was on the receiving end of a Gary
Suter cross-check that ended his season last Feb. 1. Suter,
Hartsburg and the Blackhawks were soon public enemy No. 1 among
Ducks fans, especially when Suter and Hartsburg doubted the
severity of Kariya's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't set off angry words (on both sides), we wouldn't
be worth a darn,'' he said. ``(But) to me it's over and done with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Paul about it. I was protecting my side, they
were protecting theirs. Emotions were a little high and things were
said on both sides that probably shouldn't have been said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was protecting Gary Suter, this year I'm only
concerned with protecting Paul Kariya.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what Kariya and Hartsburg have said in private, but
before Hartsburg was named coach the Anaheim star said he could
play for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hold a vendetta against everybody who says something
bad about you ... you can't hold grudges,'' Kariya said.
``Everybody says something to everybody else and you've got to deal
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have a problem with him personally. You've got
to take what's on the ice and leave it there.''

Emanuel expects to help lead Bucs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TAMPA, Fla. _ During his playing career at Langham Creek High
School and Rice University, Bert Emanuel was drafted two times in
baseball and once in football, but he did not strike it rich until
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers gave him 16.4 million reasons to leave
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay waited to see if Atlanta would match its four-year,
$16.4 million offer to Emanuel, a transition free agent, but no one
in the Buccaneers organization was more nervous than quarterback
Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ticked down on the seven-day deadline, Dilfer kept
his fingers crossed. After all, Emanuel was just the kind of
receiver the Buccaneers needed to play opposite Reidel Anthony, a
No. 1 pick in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was excited and relieved when Atlanta didn't
match,'' Dilfer says. ``I'd been working on them (Buccaneers
general manager Rich McKay and coach Tony Dungy) to get him for a
year. I knew Bert would fit our system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does he have outstanding speed, but the game's so
complicated, a receiver has to be able to adjust on the run, react
instinctively to blitzes and coverages and still catch the ball. He
can do all those things. That's why he's going to be a great player
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding Emanuel and top draft choice Jacquez Green with Anthony
gives the Bucs a three-receiver formation that has more speed than
a track team.
</P>
<P>
   If Emanuel were a cornerback lining up opposite Tampa Bay's
receivers, he would have one thought in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear,'' he says. ``The fear of being outrun. It has to be in
the back of a defensive back's mind when he plays against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Few receivers are faster than Emanuel, who caught 65 passes for
991 yards (15.2 average) and nine touchdowns last season. In his
first three seasons with the Falcons, Emanuel had 46, 74 and 75
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons tendered him a one-year offer of $2.65 million
thinking no one would top it, but the Bucs stunned them. If Emanuel
ever had any doubts about not being allowed to play quarterback,
his position at Rice, they were put to rest when he was rewarded
with his new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a position where I had no leverage because I was a
transitional guy, but this was the place I wanted to play,''
Emanuel says. ``The Bucs are a team on the rise, and I wanted to be
part of it. It's a young team with an outstanding coaching staff
and great management. The owners take care of their players. All of
that really attracted me to Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   After last season when the Bucs finished 10-6 and made the
playoffs for the first time since 1982, McKay and Dungy vowed to
improve the receivers. They wanted to find a go-to receiver for
Dilfer, who needed a favorite target to bail them out on
third-and-long and to stretch the defense to open up the underneath
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have good receivers to win, and Bert's a great
one,'' Dilfer says. ``You can run the ball 80 percent of the time,
but the 20 percent when you're throwing it, those are usually the
biggest downs in the game. The receivers have to get open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider what defenses are doing and how much they're
getting away with, you must have talented receivers. We were awful
at receiver previously. It was terrible, but they (management)
slowly improved that. Now, I think our corps is going to be one of
the better ones in the league. Speed at receiver is something we
can hang our hat on.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel doesn't want to be recognized just for his speed. He's
also smart and tough and runs precise routes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been in the league for only four years, he
has to be a leader on a young offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership's important because it means you're stepping up and
making plays when the game's on the line,'' Emanuel says. ``That's
something I've been doing the last four years. It's something I've
prided myself on.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Bucs have speed and talent at receiver, Emanuel
knows they will see different tactics from defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some defenses will get in our faces and challenge us,'' he
says. ``Others will back off 10 yards and try to keep us in front
of them. It depends on what kind of corners they have. Teams that
don't have a lot of confidence in their corners will give us softer
coverage. We have to be able to adjust to whatever's thrown at us,
and I'm confident we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel has become a notorious slow starter in the preseason. In
his last preseason with the Falcons, he didn't catch a pass until
the last game. He doesn't have a reception in three preseason games
with the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens to me every preseason,'' he says. ``I was a
little concerned last year because I knew I'd be trying to get a
new contract, and we were learning a new quarterback (Chris
Chandler). I wondered what was going on. Then, everything fell into
place, and I had a good season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it now. I've gotten kind of used to it.
I'm learning a new offense and working with a new quarterback
again. These things take time, but I know it'll all come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel can't believe his good fortune in going from Atlanta to
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day, really,'' he says. ``The attitude
here is that when we step on the field, we're going to win. It
almost feels like we're playing on a different level than everyone
else. That's a mindset, but it's not something I've been used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy can't believe his good fortune, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go after a restricted player, you usually don't get
those guys,'' Dungy says. ``When we found out Bert really wanted to
come here, we zeroed in on him and thought we might have a chance
to get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We followed his career. Naturally, we liked him a lot. He
caught a lot of balls. He's still young. He's a high-class guy, the
kind we're looking for. He was productive every season, and he
improved every season. We just liked everything about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because he is being so well-paid doesn't mean Emanuel is
under more pressure. If he is, he doesn't show it, because he's so
calm and focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I am,'' he says. ``My job title's not going to
change. You know, I've got to catch the ball and make plays. I've
got to score touchdowns. All they're asking me to do are the same
things I've been doing for four years. I'm just getting paid a
little bit more.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors opened a new line of inquiry into
President Clinton's actions on Tuesday, summoning Monica Lewinsky
to testify again to the federal grand jury here, on Thursday. It
was one of several signs that Clinton did not succeed in ending his
legal or political troubles by acknowledging an intimate
relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   The move to bring Ms. Lewinsky back to the grand jury reflected
a decision by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to
pit her testimony against the president's to see whether there are
inconsistencies, according to people familiar with his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, a classic prosecutorial tactic, indicated that
Starr was trying to determine whether Clinton might have perjured
himself before the grand jury, a new subject for an investigation
that has already lasted seven months.
</P>
<P>
   New details emerged on Tuesday about what was described as a
warlike exchange during the president's testimony on Monday, which
was transmitted to the grand jury here. Although Clinton politely
shook hands with prosecutors before and after they squared off, the
questioning turned confrontational, with Starr threatening at
points to subpoena the president for further testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the session, Clinton read a statement to grand jurors
describing his physical contacts with Ms. Lewinsky, a person
familiar with his testimony said. After that point, he deflected
questions posed by Starr and prosecutors about the details of such
encounters. His private lawyers signaled an end to the four-hour
session before Starr and his team had finished.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied under oath, as he did later in his address to the
nation, that he had obstructed justice, lawyers said. Specifically,
they said, he testified that he had not asked his personal
secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve from Ms. Lewinsky some gifts
that he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, said on Tuesday that
the president did not decline to answer any questions about
possible obstruction of justice. ``As to a very few highly
intrusive questions with respect to the specifics of his relation
to Ms. Lewinsky, he gave candid but not detailed answers,'' Kendall
said. ``This was to preserve personal privacy and institutional
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton family, the White House staff and the country
began on Tuesday to absorb Monday's extraordinary events, friends
of Ms. Lewinsky, like many Republican and Democratic officeholders
here, expressed disappointment with the president's speech. They
said that the president should have apologized directly to Ms.
Lewinsky and her family for his role in shoving them into a
maelstrom of legal and media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's four-minute address left even some Democrats
complaining that he fell short of an apology and spoke more in
anger than in sorrow. Some said that they would have to await a
report by Starr to Congress before deciding whether the matter
should be set aside without impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea,
strolled to a helicopter on the South Lawn on Tuesday afternoon and
departed for a vacation on Martha's Vineyard. Aides said the
president would probably interrupt his trip for at least two public
events, putting into practice his argument on Monday night that it
was time to turn from the investigation to ``important work.''
</P>
<P>
   Before departing on Tuesday, Clinton spent more than an hour
with his foreign policy advisers, and he also worked the telephone.
His advisers said that he was mostly fielding supportive calls from
friends on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Assorted characters who had faded from Clinton's long-running
political drama abruptly reappeared on the stage. Dick Morris, once
Clinton's most valued political adviser, testified for nearly five
hours at the federal courthouse here about several conversations he
had with the president in January, after the Lewinsky case became
public. In a television appearance Tuesday night on Fox News,
Morris said that Clinton acknowledged to him in January that
``something'' had happened between him and Ms. Lewinsky and that
the president seemed to be wavering between unburdening himself to
the American people and keeping quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris theorized that Clinton might have been swayed to keep
silent by a confidential poll in January showing that the public
might not forgive him if he had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Morris resigned during the Democratic National Convention in
August 1996, after it was disclosed that he had had an affair with
a prostitute. Starr's decision to call him to the federal
courthouse on Tuesday provided a sharp counterpoint to the
president's plea on Monday night to turn away from seamier aspects
of political life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones, whose sexual misconduct lawsuit against Clinton led
to the Lewinsky investigation, issued a rare public statement on
Tuesday. ``It is very important that Mr. Clinton and other men like
him learn that what Mr. Clinton did to me was wrong and that there
are consequences to taking advantage of other people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones said in her lawsuit that in 1991, when he was
governor of Arkansas, Clinton lewdly propositioned her in a Little
Rock, Ark., hotel room. Her lawsuit was dismissed by a federal
judge on April 1, but she is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Mr. Clinton's lack of remorse for his
wrongdoing shows why it is so important that the trial court's
decision in my case be reversed,'' Mrs. Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied that he had propositioned Mrs. Jones, but in his
deposition in the suit in January he was asked whether he had had a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He denied such a
relationship under oath, unaware that Starr had begun investigating
whether he had tried to obstruct justice by covering up his
contacts with Ms. Lewinsky. Starr added the possibility that
Clinton committed perjury to his list of possible crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he admitted in his testimony Monday to ``inappropriate,
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton said that he
had not committed perjury in the Jones deposition, lawyers familiar
with his sealed testimony said. The president said that the type of
contact he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the definition of sex
used by the Jones lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   About midway through the questioning, Clinton lost his
notoriously volcanic temper at a question posed by a prosecutor.
Shortly afterward, there was a break for nearly one hour while
Clinton huddled with his lawyers in the doctor's office in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   While they talked, an electronic system maintained by the Secret
Service that tracks the president's movements showed that he had
gone to the doctor's office, raising concerns among White House
staff members that he had fallen ill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the White House on Tuesday, senior advisers to the president
were besieged with telephone calls from reporters asking whether
they felt betrayed by his private and public denials of a sexual
relationship with a former intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew there were so many reporters who were worried
about our feelings,'' said John Podesta, the deputy White House
chief of staff. Asked how he felt, Podesta laughed loudly and said,
``I'm curled up in a fetal position,'' before quickly adding, ``I
am doing just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   White House advisers said that for the most part, Tuesday was
spent assimilating the revelations of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that the White House was not overly
concerned about the mixed reaction on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all sort of queasy and trying to figure out the
political implications of this,'' he said. ``They don't want to get
too far ahead of the public in either direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, taken on Tuesday
evening, found that respondents' opinion had not changed in the day
after the president's speech to the nation. In Monday night's poll,
for instance, 58 percent of viewers said they were satisfied with
Clinton's explanation. In Tuesday night's poll the figure was a
statistically indistinguishable 60 percent satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that the public continued to be divided over
whether Clinton was involved in any obstruction of justice.
Thirty-three percent said accusations that he encouraged Ms.
Lewinsky to lie under oath were probably true, 32 percent said the
accusations were probably not true, and 31 percent said they did
not know enough to say.
</P>
<P>
   That division was almost exactly the same as measured last week
by a CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, based on 509 adults nationwide who were
interviewed by CBS News last week, has a margin of sampling error
of plus or minus four percentage points. But polls conducted in
just one night are subject to additional error because of the
limited time available to contact people.

CLINTON WANTED TO TELL, DICK MORRIS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way Dick Morris recalls that fateful Wednesday,
Jan. 21, President Clinton seemed to want to tell the country right
away that he had made a mistake with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day news reports began saying the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, was investigating whether the
president had had a sexual relationship with the former White House
intern and then tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, Clinton told him, ``You know,'' he said, ``ever
since I was elected president, I've tried to stop this kind of
thing and not do this stuff. But I just slipped up with this
girl,'' Morris said on Tuesday night. At another point, the
president told him, ``I didn't do what they said I did, but I did
something.'' But Morris said the president denied that he had urged
Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, a political consultant, said he had not pressed Clinton
on what ``something'' meant, thinking it better that he not be
told. But he said he sensed strongly that Clinton, whom he knew
well from having advised him in the past, wanted to unburden
himself to the people. So why didn't he, instead of waiting for
seven months?
</P>
<P>
   As Morris said Tuesday night on Fox News, Clinton may have felt
worried by the findings of a confidential poll by Morris on Jan.
21.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 that night, Morris said, he called Clinton and told him
the poll showed the American people would forgive adultery. But, he
told the president, ``If they feel that you lied under oath, and
they feel that you suborned perjury in any way, you're cooked. They
want you out. Forgiveness won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, in a deposition he gave in connection with
the sexual-misconduct lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones,
Clinton testified that he had not had a sexual relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky.

RED SOX SWEEP PAST RANGERS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Rangers utilize right-hander John Wetteland as
their closer.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who made his most recent appearance eight days ago,
witnessed the Red Sox sweep yesterday's day//night doubleheader
from his perch in Fenway Park's right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   (Great seat, eh?)
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn, who served as the designated hitter,
ensured there would be no split of this two-game affair with his
seventh-inning, solo home run off right-hander Danny Patterson
(1-5) in the Red Sox's 5-4 victory in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox right-hander Pedro Martinez, who recorded 10 strikeouts
in 8 2/3 innings, surrendered one run on five hits and one walk in
a 4-1 victory in the afternoon opener.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers concluded this grueling, eight-game swing
through Cleveland, New York and Boston with only two victories
during their nine-day excursion. The Rangers returned to Texas this
morning at least 1 1/2 and perhaps 2 1/2 games behind in the AL
West pending the result of the Angels' game against the White Sox
last night in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland pitched only once during this road trip. The
right-hander recorded his 32nd save during the Rangers' 2-1 victory
Aug. 11 against the Indians at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Rangers rendered their closer useless as the
Maytag repairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A closer is only as good as his team,'' right-hander Tim
Crabtree said. ``We can't use him if we're not winning. We just
didn't get the game to John.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers instead placed the burden on right-handers Crabtree,
Patterson and Xavier Hernandez. Those three relievers _ whom
manager Johnny Oates relies on during the sixth, seventh and eighth
innings _ combined for nine appearances in the past four days
despite the postponement of Monday's scheduled game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen is not strained,'' Oates said. ``It's those three
guys. We can't get to John.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could not place the game on Wetteland's right
shoulder after Vaughn's seventh-inning home run. It gave Vaughn
seven home runs in 11 games this season against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams have a `Mo,' but Mo is Mo,'' Oates said, ``and he's
put `Mo' hurtin' on us than most people, especially with the long
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Rick Helling entered the sixth inning with
a 4-2 lead, but he surrendered a leadoff double to shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra and issued a walk to left fielder Troy O'Leary after
the latter fouled off six 3-2 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra and O'Leary eventually scored after a double by
first baseman Mike Stanley and a sacrifice fly ball from catcher
Jason Varitek. Helling threw 127 pitches though his 5 2/3 innings,
which forced Oates to summon Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Burkett (7-13) allowed only one hit to the Red
Sox through five scoreless innings in the afternoon game, but he
could not complete the sixth. The Red Sox tied the score on a
run-scoring double from third baseman John Valentin and took a 2-1
lead on a two-out single by O'Leary. Oates removed Burkett when
Stanley reached after being hit by a pitch to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams summoned a pinch hitter in the
form of former Rangers center fielder Damon Buford, who greeted
left-hander Eric Gunderson with a two-run double on a 2-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an insurmountable deficit with Martinez (16-4)
pitching lights out and strengthening his bid as the No. 1
candidate to become the AL's 1998 Cy Young Award recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to find a better pitcher than him,'' Oates said.
``He's a No. 1 starter. You can pencil him in for 20 victories
before the season begins, and there's not a half-dozen of them in
this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers return to The Ballpark in Arlington for an
eight-game home stand, but it will begin tonight with the first of
two games against the Central Division-leading Indians. The
Yankees, the major leagues' best team, arrive for a three-game
series beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland might make an appearance, too.

INSURER 20TH CENTURY CAUGHT IN MILLENNIUM'S NAME GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS J. PARKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Auto insurer 20th Century Industries Inc. has a
unique Y2K problem. In fact, some might say the Woodland
Hills-based company has a Y20C problem.
</P>
<P>
   That's because 500 days from today, it'll no longer be doing
business in the 20th Century. And who wants a company's products
that are a millennium old?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real issue but it's not a bad one,'' said William L.
Mellick, 20th Century's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Mellick said executives have been discussing what to do about
their company's name for several years. Shareholders also have
quizzed Mellick about it during the company's annual meetings the
past few years, but no changes are imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a brand name identification'' with 20th
Century, Mellick said. The company insures 1.1 million drivers in
California and Arizona and expects to begin offering insurance in
Oregon, Washington and Nevada before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, 20th Century is happy to be, well, not part of the new
century. In fact, the company's main office at the Tishman Plaza is
being renamed the 20th Century Plaza once an 11-story tower is
built next to its current headquarters. The new office is expected
to open in December 1999, just in time to welcome in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company has taken out copyrights on such names as
21st Century Casualty Co. in case officials decide a name change is
necessary by the time the world's calendars change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've positioned ourselves so if that's the way to go, we're
ready,'' he said.

   TENNIS-DRUGS (Undated) _ When Samantha Reeves, a well-regarded
amateur finding her way through her freshman season on the women's

shape after sustaining an ankle injury late in 1997, she said she
decided to experiment with a newfangled ``all-natural'' dietary
supplement, apparently on the recommendation of a friend. The
product promised to help her burn fat and build muscle, and it was
readily available over the counter at health-food stores. It
sounded like the answer to her prayers: a training and diet aid
that would help her get fit fast and get back to the business of
cracking the top 100 in women's tennis. Instead, Reeves' decision
to use the product backfired badly. Required to submit a urine
sample at an event last December as part of tennis' effort to
detect improper drug use, Reeves failed the test. The dietary
product, it turned out, had contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on
the classic steroid nandrolone and one of the substances banned by
the sport. By Robin Finn.

had suspended two traps the night before. Each held a small catch
of frisky, reddish crabs. It is the height of the lobster season,
when most Maine lobstermen let the little crabs go instead of
collecting them, as Eaton does. With so many lobsters, worth so
much more money, most lobstermen don't want to bother with crabs.

AIRLINE TO ERECT `SUPERSIGN' AT MIDTOWN BUS TERMINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The intersection of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue has
always been a lively marketplace but, until recently, not really
the sort to attract a blue-chip national advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the latest example of the changing commercial
climate along 42nd Street, Delta Air Lines has signed a three-year
sublease for space on the corner of the Port Authority Bus
Terminal, where it will erect a 3,000-square-foot supersign
sometime by the spring of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-Second Street is the most exciting out-of-home
opportunity in the world,'' said Jodi Yegelwel, senior vice
president and director of marketing at Transportation Displays
Inc., a division of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   TDI is an outdoor advertising company _ ``out-of-home media,''
as they say in the industry _ that holds a 20-year lease for signs
on the bus terminal from the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's sign will be one of six or so on an open steel framework
that is to wrap around the upper levels of the building, in front
of the distinctive 45-foot-high, X-shaped girders. The
900-foot-long steel grid will rise above and dwarf the current
billboard for the Showtime cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority requires that nothing on the grid interfere
with the ventilation and exhaust systems on the upper levels.
Effectively, that cuts in half the amount of space available for
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus terminal is first and foremost for the 185,000 people
a day who use it,'' said Cherrie Nanninga, real estate director for
the Port Authority. ``We have to be ultra-careful about what is put
up, to maintain safety, comfort and convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   TDI will pay a percentage of the advertising revenue to the Port
Authority in lieu of rent, amounting to about $2 million a year.
The specific terms of the Delta deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Supersigns are a significant property investment. Advertisers on
the terminal must sign five-year leases (Delta was given a break
since it was the first tenant) and pay for design, construction and
installation, which can run into the millions of dollars, as well
as maintenance and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than buying a sign, this is a piece of real estate that
you're buying over a five-year period,'' said Brigg Dinley, the
business development director for special projects at TDI. ``It's
like buying a house.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that this house is seen every day by 185,000
commuters, along with a big percentage of the uncountable millions
of tourists, theatergoers and hotel guests in the area _ plus the
random New Yorker or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is such an important market for all airlines,'' said
Schuyler Wickes, the Delta account executive at the advertising
firm of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in Atlanta. ``Delta is not a regional
carrier anymore. It's a major global carrier. This is an
opportunity to position Delta as exactly that.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the intersection's raffish past, Wickes said that
was no longer a concern. ``That's not considered fringe these
days,'' he said. ``The infusion of hotels, the great American
corporations moving in _ that's the stamp of approval.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cater-corner from the terminal, TDI holds a 20-year lease on the
E Walk retail and entertainment complex being built by Tishman
Urban Development Corp. As many as a dozen supersigns may go there,
said Donald Allman, chief operating officer of TDI.
</P>
<P>
   TDI also has billboards on sidewalk scaffolds along 42nd Street,
from Seventh to Eighth Avenues. ``We think they are the longest
signs in the world,'' Allman said.
</P>
<P>
   These include the 450-foot Showtime sign, a 430-foot NBC sign at
E Walk, a 387-foot Timberland boots sign where Forest City Ratner
is building an entertainment and retail complex, and a 76-foot sign
for Channel 2 (WCBS) in front of the Candler Building, at 220 W.
42nd St.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a quarter-mile of advertising already, but TDI
has more in store. In the fall, it will install seven temporary
advertising panels between the neoclassical columns of the Times
Square Theater, at 219 W. 42nd St.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Cahan, president of New 42nd Street Inc., a nonprofit
organization that holds the lease to the theater, said the sign
would generate about $100,000 over three months. The group will
apply that toward the construction of a new rehearsal space next
door. Ms. Cahan said the sign would be a ``playful'' addition to
the facade, which is eventually to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Levine, senior vice president at TDI, said, ``When the
signs are taken down, you won't know we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   No design details have been made public yet on the Delta sign.
But the airline offered a taste of its unusual approach last
summer, when it erected a ``living billboard'' in a parking lot
across from the bus terminal. This full-scale mock-up of the
fuselage of a jetliner was 44 feet long and 16 feet high, ample
enough to accommodate passengers and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The first airline supersign, for Trans World Airlines, was
erected in 1955 by Artkraft Strauss at Broadway and 43rd Street.
``It wasn't exactly a beautiful sign, perhaps, but it was
arresting,'' wrote Tama Starr and Edward Hayman in ``Signs and
Wonders'' (Currency Doubleday), their new book on spectacular
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the billboard was a 45-foot-long model of a Lockheed Super
Constellation with spinning propellers, blinking running lights and
a cabin full of dummy passengers. In 1996, Artkraft Strauss
installed a 102-foot-long model of a British Airways Concorde at
Broadway and 42nd Street.

CITY CHARTER PANEL DROPS LATEST CAMPAIGN FINANCE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest in a series of hurried retreats, the
mayoral commission considering amendments to the city charter bowed
to sustained criticism Tuesday night and abandoned a campaign
finance measure that had been its main proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said it would drop its proposal to bar candidates
from accepting campaign contributions from donors who do business
with the city. With little time left before its deadline, it said
it would switch to a far less ambitious effort at tackling campaign
finance regulations: a referendum that would prohibit contributions
from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's move came as a more far-reaching plan to
overhaul New York City's campaign finance system was approved
unanimously Tuesday by a City Council committee. The legislation
would be the first major change in the system in a decade, lowering
contribution limits and increasing aid to candidates from the
municipal treasury. If passed, it would become municipal law but
would not be part of the charter, which is essentially the city's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates of campaign-finance changes say the charter
commission's proposal to prohibit corporate contributions will have
little effect, since business people can still contribute as
individuals or through political action committees. But the
measure, however narrow, nonetheless would allow the commission to
accomplish the main goal Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had in establishing
it: blocking a referendum spearheaded by Council Speaker Peter
Vallone that would allow the voters to decide whether the city
should spend money to build a stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan.
Under the law, if a mayoral commission submits a charter amendment,
any referendum placed on the ballot by the Council is postponed
until the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commission's decision to back a proposal that would
have relatively little impact might give new ammunition to
opponents of the mayor who called his creation of the panel a
political ploy. The commission has already been attacked for
earlier ideas that it advanced and then abandoned, including one
that would have abolished the office of the Public Advocate and the
Independent Budget Office, both of which have earned the mayor's
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairman Peter Powers said at Tuesday night's meeting
that it had dropped its broad proposal to bar candidates from
accepting contributions from donors who do business with the city
after receiving complaints that it was vague and confusing. The
commission never specified how it would define who is involved in
business with the $34 billion city government, raising the prospect
that any rules would be riddled with loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was based in large part on the input we got from the
public,'' Powers said of the decision to abandon the proposal.
``The thought was that it was too broad to actually reel in and
define.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and other prominent officials, including Vallone and
Public Advocate Mark Green, have all supported barring corporate
contributions in the city's campaign finance system, which
candidates voluntarily join. But some advocacy groups have said
that while they are not opposed to such a ban, it would have little
impact because donors find other ways of giving, often doing so as
individuals rather than through businesses. They have noted that
corporate contributions have long been banned on the federal level,
but that has not affected the size of the giving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the support from the upper echelons of city government,
some Council members have expressed misgivings about a ban, saying
that in their districts, stores and other corporate entities are
among their major donors.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone proposed a ban earlier this year, but then backed off
after hearing from Council members. The legislation approved
Tuesday by the Council's Committee on Government Operations does
not ban corporate contributions outright, but gives those
candidates who refuse them as much as four times the city financing
for their campaigns as those who do not. As a result, it has
garnered wider backing in the Council.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is being pushed by Vallone, who is hoping to use
its passage to promote himself as a reformer as he campaigns for
the Democratic nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not indicated whether he will sign the Council's
bill. Tuesday, he questioned why it did not include a blanket ban
on corporate contributions, which he said he strongly favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rule they follow on the federal level,'' he said. ``We
should be able to follow it here.''
</P>
<P>
   If both the charter commission's proposal and the Vallone
legislation become law, their differing provisions on banning
corporate contributions would create a legal conflict. It is
unclear how that conflict would be resolved.

A PORTRAIT OF PRIDE AND PAUNCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cobblestone streets around Jessie Nebraska
Gifford's Vinegar Hill home are a no man's land of truckers and
intrepid artists _ of both the visual and stickup kind. This little
neighborhood, bordered by housing projects, the waterfront and the
Brooklyn Navy Yard, makes her feel isolated sometimes. But at least
she had the company of several nude men waiting to be framed.
</P>
<P>
   It was no setup. Seriously. Ms. Gifford is a painter who spent
her summer finishing a five-paneled portrait titled ``Some Nude Men
Working.'' Her subjects were friends and artists who posed for her
in their ``Full Monty'' glory. Actually, they had posed a few years
back for her camera, giving her a set of prints that she used for
an earlier show titled ``Seven Nude Men Think About Architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The current series has more action (no, not that kind). She
rendered them in energetic poses with arms stretched wide, passing
and tugging among themselves. What they share in common is a sense
of pride and playfulness despite paunch, age or imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this guy, he's just so happy to be there,'' she said
of one middle-aged figure. She pointed out another and smiled
admiringly at his hairy torso. Her gaze skipped to yet another man,
balding and somewhat flabby. ``I chose them because I wanted people
who were confident in their skins. The thing about a nude person is
it's a form of architecture. It's a very basic thing of a human
being. The way they feel about being nude is depicted in these
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudes might say a naked man is no subject for a lady. Ms.
Gifford, who was raised in Omaha, still encounters that reaction
even from some collectors who have been buying her work for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sort of thing my grandmother would say,'' Ms.
Gifford, 58, said. ``They think, especially from the era that I am
from, that it's pornographic to even think openly of nude men.''
</P>
<P>
   During a childhood visit to a museum, she asked her mother why
there were no paintings of nude men. Her mother replied _ with a
note of finality _ that women had more beautiful bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't, of course, until later that I went to the Sistine
Chapel that there were paintings of nude men if you looked far
enough,'' she said. ``There had to come a time when I began to
question my mother's opinions. Then I made up my own mind that I
was going to see about nude men.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the first show came to her a few years ago, after
she had returned to more traditional art after years of pursuing
abstract styles. She wrote letters to 13 friends, and six accepted
her invitation to allow her to shoot two rolls of film of them
posing for her. Her husband, Mel, also sat for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very brave soul when it comes to that kind of an
experience,'' explained one of her models, Michael Weinstein, who
is a poet and retired accountant. ``I know when to say `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   And when he saw the final result, he knew it was time for even
more acceptance. Of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a human person, a perceptive person, a sensitive person
who wasn't afraid or ashamed of what he was doing,'' he said. ``If
anyone wanted to make anything of it, like the stuff in scandal
sheets, that was secondary. I had to grow up to what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   These are real men, with real bodies, and Ms. Gifford celebrates
them in a way that makes them special. So what if American culture
seems obsessed with thin thinking? She knows others are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of Russian people from out on the Island came and
stood around the gallery clapping, laughing and cheering,'' she
said of her earlier show of nudes. ``I noticed in the south of
France you get people with the most wrinkled skin, huge women,
wearing tiny bikinis.''
</P>
<P>
   She contrasted that with the ``little ladies'' and ``tiny
women'' she sees on the street or in fashion magazines. Sure, a
Cornell University study released this week found that men would
rather date those girls than bother with someone a little plumper.
But Ms. Gifford finds them not as interesting as people whose
bodies have to deal with gravity or age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all skinny people are doing anything exciting except
having their picture taken,'' she said. ``Around NYU I see all
these skinny little girls. Then I see the ones with more body
carrying movie equipment. Smart people come in different sizes.
They're not ruled by being skinny.''

WATTERS WANTS TO SETTLE IN WITH SEAHAWKS FOR LONG RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Pa., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Watters has a new condo on Lake Washington near downtown
Seattle. He has a new contract _ four years, $12 million, including
a $5 million signing bonus _ with the Seahawks. He loves music and
has written a new rap song with phrases like ``If I ran you over''
and ``bounce to this'' and ``built to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ricky Watters has finally found a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful place, and I want to make this a home for
myself,'' he said recently. ``I want this to be my last stop
because there is no reason to go anywhere else. My game is like my
music _ I can still run you over, I'll make you bounce and I'm
built to last.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 29. He left Notre Dame and played running back for four
seasons in San Francisco and then played the last three in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy always seemed to follow Watters.
</P>
<P>
   As a 49er, he said he didn't get the ball enough. As an Eagle,
he said he didn't get the ball enough. In both places, he got the
ball more than anyone else. Sometimes he looked selfish and
brooding and combustible. A problem child. A target.
</P>
<P>
   But he always produced. He gave both teams toughness in the
running game and soft hands from the backfield, which made
linebackers trying to cover him cringe. His volcanic makeup was
part of his game. He brings all of that to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks surely need it. Chris Warren, their longtime
signature back, is a Dallas Cowboy now. Last season, Warren led
Seahawks rushers with 847 yards; only four American Football
Conference teams featured a team-leading rusher with fewer yards.
Watters gained 1,110 yards last season in Philadelphia. He rushed
for 1,000 yards in four of his seven pro seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long season in Philadelphia last year with all of the
losing,'' Watters said of the Eagles' 6-9-1 team, which finished
with three consecutive losses. ``It was rough on me and rough on
everybody else. We couldn't figure out what happened. That was
adversity, and I had adversity and success in San Francisco. We
were Super Bowl champions, but I never fit in there. Some of it was
my fault. Some of it was they didn't really understand what was in
my heart. But that's football _ in this game, not everyone is going
to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys I've played with, they understand me. My teammates
have always been there. They know where I'm coming from. They know
that I get on them, but I get on myself twice as hard. I really
criticize myself. And I push myself. I have a spirit that is
unquenchable. `'
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 feet 1 inch, 217 pounds. He is the jolt the Seattle
running game needs.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Seattle ran the ball 404 times and passed it 609
times. It was an 8-8 team that rode the arm of quarterback Warren
Moon and the hands of receivers Joey Galloway (72 catches) and Mike
Pritchard (64 catches).
</P>
<P>
   In the preseason, however, Seattle has beaten Dallas, 20-19, and
Indianapolis, 24-21, and lost to San Francisco, 24-21, while
running the ball 114 times and passing it only 91 times.
</P>
<P>
   Watters has rushed 24 times and the rookie back Ahman Green from
Nebraska has rushed 41 times. Both can take the football inside or
outside. Both run behind a line that includes the newcomers Kevin
Glover (center, from Detroit) and Brian Habib (guard, from Denver)
along with the mainstay tackle Howard (House) Ballard. Watters
looks to run the Seahawks out of anonymity and into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It will not happen unless Seattle is unswerving in its
commitment to the running game. It will not happen unless Watters
is used in a variety of ways, running inside and outside and using
his pass-catching skills as a complement. It will not happen unless
the Seahawks tap into Watters' tremendous desire and view his
combustible nature as an asset rather than as a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Home for Ricky Watters means a lot. There is no place like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent on this team is phenomenal,'' Watters said. ``We
have a great chance to win and do something special. We pretty much
have to put it on the line and not cut corners. And take care of
each other. And take care of home.''

COMMENTARY: IN BAD TIMES, BLAME SPECULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial markets are again under stress in Asia and Russia, and
local authorities know whom to blame. It's the speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculators have been deploying a whole host of improper
measures,'' said Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, as
he disclosed that the Hong Kong government had bought millions of
dollars in stock. Among them were the ``spreading of vicious
rumors'' that Hong Kong's currency might be devalued.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's stocks rallied, and the idea of government
intervention is spreading. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamed said he might try the same tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The S-word was also used in Russia, where a central bank
official complained that Russian banks were speculating against the
ruble by buying dollars. The central bank set out to squelch that
speculation by barring such purchases by some banks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to sympathize with the officials involved. They
think their economies and markets are going to get over a rough
spot, and along comes somebody _ often identified as the dreaded
hedge funds run mostly by American investors _ betting that things
will fall apart. If those speculators can just be defeated, then
all will be well.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the government says speculators were trying to
drive the currency and the stock market down, and interest rates
up, to make money in all three markets. To block such manipulation
a little government intervention was necessary, authorities say. So
they bought the local currency and shares in all major Hong Kong
companies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has worked. But a final verdict is not in. In the
early summer of 1997, Thailand routed hedge funds that were
borrowing the Thai baht and selling it, betting it would fall. Big
purchases by the Thai government temporarily raised the value of
the baht. But then a funny thing happened. Ordinary Thai citizens
and companies began to wonder whether a currency that needed such
extraordinary intervention to protect its value was really
fundamentally sound. Companies that owed dollars realized they
would be in trouble if the baht were devalued, so they bought
dollars. A few weeks later the baht plunged, beginning the Asian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, what the Russian central bank saw as speculation was
in fact the reasonable response of Russian banks that were being
pressed to repay loans they had taken out in dollars, and that were
seeking to accumulate dollars as protection in case the ruble was
devalued. When it became clear the government was afraid of such
protection, devaluation became inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong now, investors may be asking themselves whether
share prices really are reasonable if they can be maintained only
by government buying. Perhaps many will decide it would be safer to
reduce their positions. If so, the government will have
accomplished little, other than to lose a lot of public money.
</P>
<P>
   All this is not to deny that speculators had a lot to do with
the current problems. But when the real speculation was taking
place, governments were looking on with glee. That was in 1996,
when foreigners were pouring in money. They invested in Indonesian
companies thinking that the fact the companies were tied to
President Suharto's family was enough to assure profits. They
poured money into Russia thinking it was the next emerging market,
and lent money to Korean banks that were financing shaky
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Now those who foolishly risked money in years past want to
salvage what they can. Companies that owe dollars fear being
bankrupted if the local currencies collapse. Both groups want to
cut their losses. Is that speculation? Or prudence?

DODGERS' PLAYOFF HOPES FADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Los Angeles Dodgers will start making a move
this week even if their players don't.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a slump that continued Tuesday with a dreadful
6-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, the club will begin
interviewing candidates for the general manager's position.
</P>
<P>
   Interim GM Tom Lasorda has been given permission by the Florida
Marlins to speak to their GM, Dave Dombrowski, when the Dodgers are
in Miami on Thursday and Friday. When the Dodgers move on to
Atlanta for a three-game weekend series, Lasorda will talk to
Braves assistant GM Dean Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have someone in place by the end of the season so
we can start to work on the team for next year,'' Lasorda said.
``There is a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, Lasorda has decided he will not be the
one to take them there. Throughout his 20 years as manager of the
Dodgers, Lasorda said he loved his job but often dreamed about
putting together his own club. He will be 71 in September, though,
and doesn't see himself as the one to rebuild the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took this position because they asked me and I never thought
I would be doing it beyond this year,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda has not backed away from the challenge of rebuilding the
team but has been stung by criticism of recent trades and his
alleged role in the June 20 firing of manager Bill Russell and GM
Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that he will be dismissed before the end of the
season, Lasorda is expected to finish out the year before turning
it over to the new man during the first week of October.
Dombrowski, who won the World Series last year with Florida, is a
favorite of the club's new owners at Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski or Dean Taylor would not have liked what went on
Tuesday in front of 12,730 at Three Rivers Stadium. The Dodgers'
ninth loss in 13 games came against a team 11 games under .500 and
dropped them seven games back in the wild-card race with 37 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (62-63) had a 2-0 lead after back-to-back
second-inning home runs by Eric Karros and Bobby Bonilla. But this
remains a team that is not converting in the clutch dating back to
its last trip.
</P>
<P>
   The club went to the East Coast and batting .160 (13 for 81)
with runners in scoring position. At home, it was .160 (13 for 81).
Tuesday, it went 0 for 10 and lost despite three solo home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the signature for team all year,'' Bonilla said.
``We still have a chance, but it's getting late. If we're still six
or seven back in the first week of September, we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Carlos Perez (7-12), winless in his first three
starts with the club, wasn't going to get a victory this time,
either.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed a single and double to open the fourth and Jose
Guillen followed with a two-run single that tied the game. He then
allowed a two-run homer to third baseman Freddy Garcia, who entered
the game 10 for 20 since his recall from Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports on Garcia were that he was swinging a hot bat,''
said manager Glenn Hoffman, who knew his team shouldn't have been
beaten by a career minor leaguer with 174 big league at-bats. ``We
should have gotten this one, but that is not the way it is going
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a chance to go ahead in the top of the sixth
with runners at first and third on no outs. But Jason Schmidt, who
had a string of eight consecutive losses this year after starting
8-1, pulled it together.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who was 10 for 20 lifetime against him, struck out.
Bonilla to ground into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way I've hit Schmidt, I liked my chances,'' Karros
said. ``But I just didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates pulled ahead 6-2 in the seventh after Tony Womack
opened with a single. One out later, Jason Kendall, who had a
string of six multi-hit games stopped, walked and Kevin Young
followed by a sharp one hopper past Bonilla at third.
</P>
<P>
   The ball rolled into the left-field corner and scooted past
Roger Cedeno for a triple, scoring Womack and Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi made it close with a two-run homer in the eighth to
chase Schmidt (10-9) and the Dodgers had the tying run at first in
the ninth when Mondesi flied out to end the game.

VALDES THROWS IN 1ST SIMULATED GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Ismael Valdes, sidelined since late July with a
strained left-side muscle, took a major step toward returning to
the Dodgers starting rotation Tuesday by pitching his first
simulated game.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, injured in his July 27 start against Arizona, threw 30
pitches against live batters for the first time, before the Dodgers
6-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very pleased with the way he threw,'' manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``A lot depends how he feels tomorrow, but if he gets
through that he could be ready for the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   If Valdes come out of Tuesday's session without pain, he will
accompany the team to Florida and pitch Friday in a minor-league
rehabilitation start for Class-A Vero Beach. If that goes well,
Valdes could return to the Dodgers before Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That felt great,'' said Valdes, who was 9-9 with a 3.92 ERA
before the injury. ``I'll throw in Vero, but I really think I'm
ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers then would have to decide which starter would go to
the bullpen. Fifth starter Brian Bohanon has been the club's most
consistent pitcher, allowing just seven earned runs in his last
seven starts
</P>
<P>
   __ Beltre out: With Bobby Bonilla producing at third base, the
Dodgers will sit rookie Adrian Beltre today for the fourth
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to him,'' Hoffman said. ``He knows we have to go
with the best team to get us back in this thing, That is not a
reflection on him. We have Bobby Bo and if he's hitting, he's
playing. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre batted 6 for 23 on the last homestand but made a few
defensive mistakes that led some to believe he is feeling some
pressure. After all, he is 20 years old and was at Class-A this
time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be overwhelming,'' Hoffman said. ``But a lot of
positives have come out of Beltre being here.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaches move: Hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher, who also has
been the Dodgers first-base coach since taking over for Reggie
Smith, will now work from the dugout during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman wants Hatcher to have a more one-on-one approach with
the batters. John Shelby, who has been in the dugout despite
originally hired to be the bullpen coach, moves to first base.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Bonilla, who played with the Pirates from
1986-91, moved into sixth place on the all-time Three Rivers
Stadium home run list with his second-inning homer. He now has 57,
behind Willie Stargell (147), Dave Parker (88), Barry Bonds (87),
Bill Robinson (64) and Andy Van Slyke (61).... Antonio Osuna
pitched the eighth for the Dodgers and was clocked at 97 mph on the
radar gun. He walked one batter but looked effective. ``It was my
first time out in six days,'' said Osuna, who hadn't pitched since
Aug. 12, when he lost for the first time in eight decisions. ``I
was very strong. I felt sharp, too. You know you're going to throw
hard after a layoff. But I'm glad where I put the ball.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ Getting at least seven innings from Jose Lima each
time he steps on the mound has become almost automatic.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So have victories.
</P>
<P>
   Both couldn't have come at a better time Tuesday night. With his
team in desperate need of a lift, Lima was more than willing to
oblige, allowing just four hits over seven innings as the Astros
snapped a two-game losing streak with an 8-2 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies in front of 17,541 at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell tied a season high with five RBIs, and Craig Biggio
had three hits for the Astros, who won for the ninth time in their
last 12 games and maintained their 7{-game lead over the Chicago
Cubs in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he did pretty well was throw strikes,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said of Lima. ``All the rest of our pitchers
have had trouble throwing strikes in this series. The thing he does
well is give us seven innings almost every time. Sometimes, he gets
the ball up a little bit and gets hurt. When he doesn't do that, he
gives us seven innings and keeps the score down. That's why he has
a lot of victories.''
</P>
<P>
   For a pitcher who went through a monthlong winless drought
earlier this summer, Lima (12-6) now can't seem to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Lima was 0-3 with a 5.03 ERA from June 12 to July 17. But the
rejuvenated Lima is 4-0 with a 2.53 ERA over his past five starts,
two of which were complete games.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 25-year-old righthander allowed only two runs _
both in the bottom of the sixth with the Astros already comfortably
ahead 6-0 _ in working at least seven innings for the 17th time in
26 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lima with impeccable timing, as the Astros had been shut
out 4-0 on four hits by the Phillies' Paul Byrd a night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to give the club a chance to win every
ballgame,'' Lima said. ``If I can throw a complete game, I'll throw
a complete game. I know that we are going to win a lot of games. If
I give up three runs in the first inning, we are going to come back
and win, because we have a great team and can score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who have outscored the Phillies 54-25 in eight
meetings this season, put the outcome out of doubt early, scoring
three runs over the first two innings and adding three more in the
fifth. The six runs equaled the Astros' production over their
previous three games combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of guys on base,'' said Bagwell, who also
drove in five runs against Philadelphia on Aug. 7. ``We hadn't
scored a lot of runs in the last four games. It was nice to get
some runs early.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, who went 3-for-4 but provided a brief scare in the
bottom of the first inning when he took an elbow to the rib cage
while chasing a fly ball, led off the game with an infield single,
stole second and advanced to third on a groundout by Derek Bell.
Bagwell drove in the first run with a bloop single to center field,
and Moises Alou followed with a hard grounder to shortstop that
Desi Relaford couldn't handle, allowing Bagwell to score.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who entered this series hitless in his previous 12
at-bats, is 5-for-9 with five RBIs against Philadelphia. He has hit
safely in 21 of his last 27 games and is batting .333 during that
stretch. Bagwell increased his RBI total to 83 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He normally swings the bat well in Pennsylvania,'' Dierker
said of Bagwell. ``He struggled on the homestand but is starting to
come on again. He's kind of been a tease this year. Not that he's
having a bad year, but he hasn't been able to get hot and stay hot
three weeks in a month like he normally does. He's had hits in
spurts all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez singled to begin the second inning, and three
batters later, Biggio hit a blooper to right-center field to give
the Astros a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros weren't done, adding to their lead during a three-run
fifth. Once again, it was Biggio who served as the spark plug with
a leadoff double. Bill Spiers advanced him to third with a single
to right field, and Philadelphia starter Mike Grace (4-6) hit Bell
on the left hand to load the bases. Bagwell delivered a two-run
single up the middle, and Bell later scored on a grounder to second
by Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Phillies mounted a mini-rally in the sixth, it
was too late. Lima hit Doug Glanville with one out in the sixth and
walked Scott Rolen. Rico Brogna, who went 3-for-4, tripled to
center field on the next pitch to clear the bases. Lima walked
former Astro Bob Abreu but got out of the inning on Mark Lewis'
fielder's choice. Lima threw 27 pitches in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed a leadoff single to begin the seventh but escaped
any further damage by getting Relaford to hit into a double play
and striking out Ruben Amaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I gave up those two runs, I didn't let it bother me,''
said Lima, who has registered seven of his 12 wins after an Astros
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell added a two-run double in the ninth. Jay Powell and Doug
Henry combined to pitch two scoreless innings of relief, and Alou
made a pinpoint throw from left field to nail Lewis at home plate
to end the game.

WOODS LEAVES TROJANS CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Another unhappy quarterback emerged from USC
football practice on Tuesday when junior Quincy Woods bolted
training camp for at least a day after being told by coach Paul
Hackett he would not be considered for the top two positions on the
depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' absence could be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   He left UC Irvine on Monday night and took all his belongings,
including his clothes and fan. The only thing Woods left in his
apartment was his playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm urging him to consider a move to wide receiver but not
forcing him,'' Hackett said. ``I told him at this point he's not in
a position to compete at No. 1 or No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he spoke with Woods three times on Monday and told
the quarterback to just ``veg'' and ``relax'' before deciding his
future. But Woods was clearly upset, and had not spoken to any
teammates on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect him to come back. I don't see him coming back
and playing another position,'' said John Fox, who is Woods'
roommate in training camp. ``Quincy's a quarterback, not a
receiver. I don't think he'll transfer; I just don't see him
playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he would let Woods remain at quarterback if the
redshirt junior wishes to stay at the position. Woods can transfer
to a lower-division school and be eligible this season, an option
he considered last year before staying at USC. He was 1 for 6 for 1
yard and one interception in the Trojans' first scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest unusual development for the quarterbacks.
Fox asked to switch to tight end last Thursday, aware of his
decreasing chance for playing time. Freshman Jason Thomas
considered transferring on Monday after Hackett told him he would
be no higher than third on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he is not surprised by some of the emotional
reactions to his decisions regarding the quarterback position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things,'' Hackett said. ``I think it
happens anytime you have a new coach and a new system and new
philosophy. On top of that, we have an extraordinary group of young
people, particularly at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating Woods and Thomas from the top two positions, it
is all but official that freshman Carson Palmer is the backup to
starter Mike Van Raaphorst. Hackett reinforced, however, that Van
Raaphorst remains the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's the starter and we haven't even seen what he can do in
a game.'' Hackett said. ``It's his to lose and he hasn't done
anything to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward sent off: Perhaps R. Jay Soward's comments about
undergoing an attitude adjustment are premature. Soward was kicked
off the field during practice after a verbal confrontation with
wide receivers coach Mike Wilson, who was upset with Soward's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got mad,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he intended to speak to Soward on Tuesday night. He
already suspended Soward from the season opener for poor academic
performance during the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   __ Harris gets MRI: Tight end Antoine Harris underwent a
magnetic resonance imaging test on Tuesday on his sprained right
ankle. No damage was revealed and he should be able to resume
practicing.
</P>
<P>
   __ More position changes: Running back Eric Reese has switched
to cornerback. Fullback Henry Wallace has moved to outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Former Alemany tailback Miguel Fletcher spoke with Hackett on
Tuesday, and it was decided he will remain at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   __ No practice: USC has no scheduled practices at UC Irvine
today.

PYGMY OWL ALERT AIMED AT CENTRAL ARIZONA DEVELOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal wildlife officials are warning central Arizona
landowners for the first time that their developments could be
shrunk, delayed or even halted to protect an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, a 7-inch-long bird
which last year stopped construction of a high school in the
quickly disappearing Sonoran Desert northwest of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is recommending that Valley
developers search for the bird to fend off lawsuits from
environmentalists and possible prosecution should a project hurt or
kill the owls.
</P>
<P>
   Developers are being asked to survey their properties as many as
three times over two years.
</P>
<P>
   But such a timetable could cause costly delays, according to the
Home Builders Association of Central Arizona, whose members
annually build nearly 25,000 homes in the Valley, mostly on
farmland and virgin desert.
</P>
<P>
   Pygmy owls once were common throughout southern and central
Arizona, federal biologists say, especially along streams and
washes lush with saguaros, mesquites, cottonwoods and other
vegetation that owls need for nesting and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Because of urban sprawl and the damming of desert rivers, the
owl's numbers have dwindled in recent years to fewer than 20 in
Arizona, mostly in the deserts surrounding Tucson. Their near
extinction in Arizona led in 1997 to their inclusion on the federal
Endangered Species List.
</P>
<P>
   Following the listing, Fish and Wildlife was required to act to
increase owl populations. But the agency lacks the authority to
require surveys on private property. Instead, the agency made a
suggestion to Pima County landowners, urging them to voluntarily
search for pygmy owls before building.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the owl's historic range, the agency last week
expanded its suggested search areas to include undeveloped parts of
Maricopa County: north of Bell Road, east of Pima Road, south of
Southern Avenue and west of Arizona 303.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the surveys are being suggested this year in Yuma,
Graham, Greenlee, Gila, Santa Cruz, Cochise and Pinal counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're publishing these proposals to help landowners,
developers and other interested parties become more aware of the
pygmy owl, to help them determine if they have potential habitat
for the owl and to find ways to aid in the recovery of the pygmy
owl,'' said Nancy Kaufman, regional director of Fish and Wildlife
in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Such surveys are overdue, said David Hogan, desert rivers
coordinator for the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona has always lacked necessary analysis of the effects of
development on our precious natural resources,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmentalists question the apparent willingness of
Fish and Wildlife to sacrifice owls if they are found in the path
of development. The federal owl survey guidelines released last
week call _ if owls are found _ for the development of Habitat
Conservation Plans, voluntary agreements intended to guide
development away from owls and the plants they need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Once a conservation plan is approved by Fish and Wildlife,
landowners will be issued permits that would allow them to develop
their lands without fear of prosecution if they kill an owl or
destroy its habitat, according to the guidelines. Illegally killing
an endangered species can result in a year in prison and a $100,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said his group will oppose the issuance of any ``take''
permits until owl numbers increase substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Simplot, deputy director of the home builders association,
said doing owl surveys before development of private property is
premature. He suggested that such surveys be concluded first on
federal and Indian lands to determine the extent of pygmy owl
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In surveys earlier this year, a search by state and federal
wildlife biologists turned up 34 owls, mostly in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   Simplot said he would not tell his group's members to boycott
the surveys. But he questioned how much time and money they would
require.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their money. This is their land. They're on the line
to bring it to development. It's important for them to be able to
proceed without unnecessary delays,'' Simplot said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Humphrey, spokesman for Fish and Wildlife, said the surveys
generally cost between $100 and $500, and are conducted by 10 firms
certified by his agency.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners who voluntarily conduct the surveys, Humphrey said,
are showing a ``good faith effort'' to avoid killing owls or
destroying their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Amphitheater Unified School District was sued last year by
the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity to prevent the
construction of a high school in an area where owls were known to
live. That lawsuit is pending before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Simplot said owls found in the past in Maricopa County probably
represented the northernmost extent of their range.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey said the last known pygmy owl in Maricopa County was
found in 1971. &QL;

IMPEACHMENT CLIMATE NEAR, 2 IN ARIZONA GOP SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's combativeness and his failure
to apologize for his sexual relationship with a White House intern
have pushed House Republicans closer to a climate of impeachment,
say two Arizona GOP congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take a significant shift in attitude on the part of
the American public _ possibly on the strength of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress _ to ignite the House's
will and put any impeachment proceeding in motion, the congressmen
say.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shadegg and Rep. Matt Salmon, both known as Republican
mavericks for bucking House leaders, agreed Tuesday that Clinton's
Monday night speech handed Republicans the weapons they will
require to impeach the president, if they decide to proceed. It is
clear from the address, both said, that Clinton lied about his
liaisons with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The key occurred in his testimony in the failed Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit. Clinton denied under oath that he had
had any sexual relationship with Lewinsky. That constitutes
perjury, both said, and perjury is a felony, an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely believe Bill Clinton could have put us in a more
difficult position if he had been contrite, if he had accepted
responsibility,'' Shadegg said. ``I think . . . he hurt his cause
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, favorable presidential poll numbers are keeping
Republicans from criticizing Clinton or calling for his impeachment
or resignation, Shadegg and Salmon agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Morning-after polls indicated that two-thirds of the public want
Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky affair to end without
impeachment or resignation. Clinton's approval ratings remain in
the 60 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, there is no burning desire among Republicans in
the House or Senate to impeach the guy,'' Shadegg said. The payoff
is low since Clinton is a lame duck and Vice President Al Gore, an
only slightly more palatable alternative, would become president,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party seems afraid of rocking the boat,'' Salmon said. ``I
don't believe there's enough political courage to go forward and do
what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about whether the president committed wrong whether
this body will impeach him,'' Salmon said. ``This is strictly a
political question. If the public supports it, the House will
impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether public opinion will change depends as
much as anything on the report of the special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to issue the report this fall. It would be
submitted to the House Judiciary Committee, which could vote to
open an impeachment inquiry if it finds sufficient evidence. At
that point, the panel would hold hearings to obtain evidence, and
that could be a long process of calling many of the same witnesses
Starr called in private, and of studying the same evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If after all of that the president still had not been
embarrassed into a resignation, the Judiciary could draft articles
of impeachment, much like criminal charges, for approval by the
full House, which would act like a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approved the articles of impeachment, the matter
would be referred to the Senate for trial, and the president could
be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were most likely to know what course the House would
take were among the quietest people in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich issued a statement saying that
everyone should keep their powder dry until they hear from Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., House Judiciary chairman, said much the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when the independent counsel sends . . . a report, it
is reasonable to expect answers to many as-yet-unanswered
questions. It is our constitutional duty to provide a fair, full
and independent review of these facts in the proper context,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon wants the inquiry to be sooner, rather than later. Salmon
said that he was joining fellow Arizona Republican Rep. Bob Stump
in signing onto a bill that would force the Judiciary Committee to
open an impeachment inquiry immediately. The bill, sponsored by
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., has 23 co-sponsors, mostly conservative House
members. &QL;

AIDS-RELATED DEATHS FALL TO 14-YEAR LOW IN N.Y. PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The number of AIDS-related deaths among New York
state's prison population hit a 14-year low last year, according to
a report released on Tuesday by the state's Department of
Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that 60 inmates died as a result of AIDS in
1997. The trend has continued this year, with 18 deaths in the
first six months.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are a striking contrast to the 181 AIDS-related
deaths in 1996 and the 258 the year before. The 60 inmates who died
of the disease last year were the fewest since 1984, when there
were 57 AIDS-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The decline comes at a time when state prison officials have
stepped up their efforts to fight the disease by, among other
things, increasing the use of promising but expensive new drugs. As
a result, the cost of AIDS-treatment programs in state prisons has
grown 66 percent in the last four years, to $63 million in the
1998-99 fiscal year from $38 million in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   New York's efforts run counter to those in other states, where
correction officials have been so overwhelmed by the cost of the
new treatments that they have not been widely prescribed, health
officials said. The costs of the new drugs, known as protease
inhibitors, have increased the annual expense of treating an
HIV-infected patient from about $2,000 to as much as $13,000, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, Gov. George Pataki
said the state had little choice but to provide HIV-infected
inmates the most appropriate medical care available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they are incarcerated,'' he said, ``we are obligated to
provide them with medical care that is the equivalent of that found
in the community. Clearly, the people of New York are meeting their
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report drew a mixed reaction from advocates for people
with AIDS. While they lauded the declining death rate among
HIV-infected prisoners, many warned that the improvement should not
be taken as a sign that the AIDS epidemic had been brought under
control, particularly because the state's prison system has the
highest rate of infection of any system in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news that people are able to live with AIDS
longer,'' said Greg Lugliani, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health
Crisis, an advocacy group for people with AIDS. ``But there's this
incorrect perception that AIDS has been reduced because of this
reduction in mortality. The real driving force in the AIDS epidemic
is the incidence of new infections.''
</P>
<P>
   The report issued on Tuesday is considered significant because
of the high rate of infection in the state's prison system. In
1997, the state's prisons housed an estimated 7,500 HIV-positive
inmates, or slightly under 1 percent of all the HIV-infected people
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no mandatory HIV testing in the state system,
officials have no way of tracking exactly who has the virus, but
they said 2,800 inmates had come forward to receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the rate of infection among inmates
entering the prison system had declined. It showed that male
inmates arriving at state prisons in 1996 and 1997 had an infection
rate of 9 percent, compared to the 12 percent rate of infection of
men who entered the system in 1992 and 1993. The infection rate
among women was higher _ 18 percent in 1996 and 1997, down from 20
percent in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed that the sharp decrease in the death rate
among inmates with AIDS led to a similar decline in the number of
terminally ill inmates who qualified for early medical release. In
1994, 54 such releases were approved, compared with 20 in 1997 and
8 in the first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the death rate was largely attributed to the
state's increasing practice of using protease inhibitors in
combination with other drugs, a so-called cocktail that has
produced sharp reductions in viral activity in some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Health-care experts have long argued that prison was an
especially good setting for this sort of treatment. The treatment
relies on identifying the virus early and then following a strict
regimen of medication to guard against breeding a strain of the
disease that is impervious to treatment. That is easier to carry
out in prison, experts say, because the patients are under regular
observation.

McDOWELL'S CAREER AT CRITICAL JUNCTURE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jack McDowell's right elbow is like a string
on one of his guitars; it could snap at any moment. Then again,
it's one thing to have one of your riffs interrupted in a dusky
club and something else altogether to have your baseball career
terminated in front of some 30,000 screaming fans.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the precariousness of his situation better than
McDowell, a pitcher/musician who'll take the mound anyway tonight
when the Anaheim Angels open a two-game set against Detroit. It
will be the Van Nuys native's first start since an abbreviated and
agonizing appearance on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   No one, least of all McDowell, knows how much faith to place in
his elbow, which hasn't been right since he had surgery to remove
loose cartilage in May 1997. Any resemblance he bears to the
pitcher who won the 1993 Cy Young Award is merely skin-deep.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? McDowell, who has suffered through two stints on the
disabled list this season, might have lost a little velocity on his
split-finger fastball, but his ferocity is the same as it always
was.
</P>
<P>
   When you have the Texas Rangers nipping at your ankles, it helps
to have a pit bull on the mound, which is why the American League
West-leading Angels are throwing McDowell to the Tigers and holding
their collective breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that compared to three years ago he
doesn't have as good of stuff,'' said Angels manager Terry Collins.
``What he will do is pitch with what he's got. He will make
pitches. He will not give in. He will not get shaken if he gives up
a big hit. He's a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a realist, which is why there was nary a hitch in his
delivery when the Notre Dame High graduate said, ``I know my days
are limited. There's an urgency to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't doubt McDowell's determination. You only hope the
tendons and muscles surrounding his right elbow are as stubborn as
the rest of him.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen in a major-league uniform, McDowell, 32, was
throwing batting practice to Minnesota. The Twins teed off on him
for 10 hits and five earned runs in 32/3 innings. After the Angels
rallied to win 6-5, the pitcher told Collins, ``I can't do this.
I'm hurting myself. I'm hurting the club.''
</P>
<P>
   That admission, coming from the same guy who had begged to stay
in the last game he pitched before going on the disabled list the
first time, in late April, was so scary, the 1998 season flashed
before Collins' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Talking before the Angels' game Tuesday against the Chicago
White Sox, Collins cringed at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, if this guy says he's hurting, he's really in
trouble,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell's days of pitching pain-free, like his seasons of
leading the AL in complete games, are behind him. But as long as
McDowell has The Glare, opponents best beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, I've seen it,'' Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina said
with a chuckle. ``I remember in 1995, when he was pitching for the
Yankees, it was late in a 2-2 game, there were two outs and a man
on second and he hung me a curve. I got a hit and the run scored
and that look he gave me, it was like, `I let  &UR; !ital! &LR; you &UR; !off! &LR; 
get a hit off me.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing. McDowell has been known to stare menacingly at
any batter rounding the bases after having the audacity to hit a
home run off him. During his year with the Yankees, which was
sandwiched between six seasons with the White Sox and two in
Cleveland, he once gave the Bronx fans the middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   So music critics, consider yourselves warned; you may get
feedback when reviewing ``Feedbag,'' the second CD released by
Stickfigure, the alternative-rock band that McDowell fronts.
McDowell, who plays guitar and bass and sings, wrote and produced
all the songs on the band's first CD, ``Just a Thought.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell suspects there'll be more than the usual number of
thoughts rattling around his brain tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, I was comfortable with my game. I didn't have
to think about every pitch,'' he said. ``Now there's going to be a
little more figuring things out as I go along. It's going to be
about how quick I can make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   That'll come as news to all the batters who thought his mind,
before his elbow started acting up, worked like chess master Bobby
Fischer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart pitcher,'' said Angels center fielder Jim
Edmonds. ``I never had much luck hitting (off) him. He seems like
he works you differently every at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, like most creatures with sharp claws and teeth, gets
even meaner when he's wounded. Get a few runs off him early and
he's liable to wipe that smile right off your face by the sixth or
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Said DiSarcina, ``He's tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will he be as rusty?
</P>

YANKEES DEFEAT ROYALS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Chad Curtis has been hitting so badly of
late, Yankee Manager Joe Torre said before Tuesday night's game
that ``we need a Hoover vacuum cleaner'' to clean out Curtis' swing
``and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis then waited until the 13th inning on Tuesday night before
beginning anew, smacking a tie-breaking single and propelling the
Yankees to a 3-2 victory over Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just his approach,'' Torre said of Curtis, ``and today he
had it through the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Yankees swept their 10-game season series
with the Royals, the first time they have swept a season series
from any team in any year not affected by labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera had blown a 2-1 lead in the ninth inning, when
the Royals scored the tying run on a sacrifice fly _ Rivera's first
blown save since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who had three hits on Tuesday night and leads
the American League with a .358 average, opened the 13th inning
with a single. With two outs, Kansas City's Matt Whisenant threw a
fastball high and wide by a couple of yards, Williams taking second
as catcher Mike Sweeney retrieved the ball from the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, in an 0-for-15 slump and recently in the habit of
flailing at anything within a yard of home plate, then smashed a
grounder through the middle to score Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually pretty good at going, `See the ball, hit the
ball,''' Curtis said after the game. ``For whatever reason, I've
been out of rhythm for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real frustrating stretch to know you've got some
ability and can help the team, and you're not doing it for a
prolonged stretch of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Borowski pitched the 12th and 13th innings for his first
victory with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday night's 7-1 loss to the Yankees, Johnny Damon, the
Royals' center fielder, walked into the weight room, feeling
drained from a night of playing in sweltering midsummer heat, and
was shocked by what he saw. Joe Girardi, who had just caught nine
innings, was lifting weights, and so were Tino Martinez, Paul
O'Neill and Scott Brosius, 10 to 15 Yankees in all, Damon guessed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 92-30, on track to establish the best record in
this century. They have beaten the Royals soundly, outscoring them
by 78-20. To Damon, the sight of so many Yankees diligently going
through their conditioning is one of the signs that they are taking
nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, when a team's in first place, you don't see
guys run out every ground ball,'' Damon said. ``And the Yankees
hustle every time. They go out and they play us hard to the very
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, there are times when we play a team like Tampa Bay or
Oakland, and sometimes we don't take them seriously, even though
their record is like ours but we know they're not as good as the
Yankees. But the Yankees, they go after everybody like it's a
do-or-die situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon sat at a table in the middle of the Royals' clubhouse,
three hours before Tuesday night's game. ``I'm pulling for them to
be one of the best teams of all time,'' he said of the Yankees.
``There have been games when it doesn't seem like we have competed
with them, and if there is a team like that, I would hope they are
one of the best teams of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of class guys over there, humble guys, guys
who really work hard. Last night, after a hot game, they're in the
weight room, working out, trying to better themselves even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams propelled the Yankees into the lead tonight leading off
the second inning, slugging a fastball over the center-field wall,
his third home run in three days. It would not have been a stretch
to think one run was all that the Yankees' starter, Orlando
Hernandez, needed. The right-hander has allowed just 2 runs and 14
hits, with 33 strikeouts over 33 innings, for an 0.82 earned run
average in his last four starts. Tonight, he threw a lively
fastball with impeccable control.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Rivera with runners on first and second and
two outs in the eighth. Rivera got out of the inning when Martinez
made a nice barehanded play on a chopper.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez needed only 27 pitches to get through the first three
innings, allowing only a ground single. Jose Offerman doubled with
two outs in the fourth, but Hernandez struck out Dean Palmer on
three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Hernandez made a mistake, his two-seam
fastball running over the plate enough that Larry Sutton could
extend his arms and drive the ball, his shot carrying over the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   All night, the Royals were griping about Umpire Jim McKean's
strike zone. Pat Rapp walked Martinez and Chili Davis with one out
in the sixth and began barking toward the plate. Bruce Kison, the
Royals' pitching coach, went to the mound to calm Rapp, but he
tried to fire a fastball past Darryl Strawberry, who whacked it
directly at Offerman at second base.
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed just in front of Offerman and seemed to explode,
hopping off the glove that Offerman held out in self-defense.
Martinez raced home for a 2-1 lead the Yankees could not hold.

McElroy puts Cardinals behind him
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TAMPA, Fla. _ Leeland McElroy never will forget draft day 1996. It
was April, and McElroy was in New York at the NFL's invitation. It
was going to be the greatest day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy's family and friends in Beaumont and College Station
would be watching on ESPN. It never crossed their minds he might
not be a No. 1 draft choice. After he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.21
seconds at the Indianapolis scouting combine, it wasn't a question
of whether McElroy would be drafted in the first round; rather, it
was how high he would go in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three seasons at Texas A&AMP;M, McElroy became one of
the best and most exciting multipurpose backs in the country.
Because everyone told him he would be drafted in the first round,
he elected to bypass his senior year with the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that fateful April day. McElroy suffered like no
other. As the No. 1 picks were called out from behind the curtain
to shake the hand of commissioner Paul Tagliabue on center stage at
Madison Square Garden, McElroy never moved. As each name was called
_ each not his _ the camera focused on McElroy, whose emotions went
from sadness to shock.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally was taken by the Arizona Cardinals in the second
round, McElroy's knees were so weak that he wobbled when he tried
to stand. That day signaled the beginning of a tailspin that didn't
end until last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft hit me hard,'' McElroy says during a break in
two-a-day drills for his new team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ``It
was a turning point in my career. I tried to deal with the
situation, but it took a shot at my confidence. I wondered if I
could play in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons later, McElroy isn't the only one wondering.
</P>
<P>
   To say his two years with the Cardinals were a nightmare might
be an understatement. As a rookie, one of the outstanding
multipurpose backs in Southwest Conference history rushed for 305
yards, caught five passes, scored two touchdowns and averaged 21.3
yards on kickoff returns.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McElroy rushed for 424 yards, caught seven passes,
scored two TDs and didn't return a kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to doubt myself,'' he says. ``I started to question
my ability. From the draft through my two years with the Cardinals,
that was definitely the down time in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy never will be more than a footnote in the long, pathetic
history of the Cardinals. When they waived him in early July, he
returned to the place where he had experienced his greatest
conquests on the football field _ College Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to A&AMP;M to take classes since I need 15 hours to
get my degree (business administration),'' he says. ``I was
wondering about my future, wondering if I was going to play
football.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Buccaneers called to tell McElroy he had been claimed
on waivers, he traded in his desert fatigues for a bathing suit and
sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they liked me coming out of college and they
didn't care what happened at Arizona,'' he says of the Bucs.
``Everybody has accepted me with open arms, and nobody has really
mentioned what happened the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new situation, and I'm excited to play for the
Buccaneers. I'm trying to do everything I can to show them they
didn't make a mistake and that the things they thought about me
coming out of college were correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tony Dungy is building one of the fastest and quickest
offenses in the NFL. He claimed McElroy to compete for the backup
job behind halfback Warrick Dunn. McElroy (5-9, 212) is larger than
Dunn (5-8, 178), but both are quick with exceptional speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scouted Leeland in college, and when the second round
began, we saw him and (fullback) Mike Alstott still available,''
Dungy says. ``Leeland went one pick ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs selected Alstott, who is one of their best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked Leeland's speed and quickness, and we wanted to find
a way to best utilize him,'' Dungy says. ``When he became
available, it was an easy choice for us. He hadn't been real
productive for the Cardinals, but you never know exactly what goes
on in someone else's system. When he got here, we told him what we
think he can do, what's expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy hasn't disappointed the Bucs. After three preseason
games, he leads the team in rushing. He is running second-team
behind Dunn and loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like people are wondering what happened to me,''
McElroy says. ``Can I play? Am I one of those guys that's lost in
the shuffle? When I was in Arizona, I began to ask those same
questions. It was a very depressing time in my life, but looking
back, I feel like it was something I had to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from it, and I don't think I'd change
anything, because it made me a stronger person. Now, I feel like I
have something to prove, but at the same time, I'm not going to put
any added pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy has 21 carries for 102 yards (4.9 average) and one
touchdown on a 25-yard run. The Buccaneers also want to look at him
on kickoff returns.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has enjoyed such a good camp and preseason, McElroy
is getting a lot of praise from his teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really helped me,'' he says. ``I came from a situation
where they had given up on me, insinuated that I couldn't play
anymore and released me. It feels really good to be here and have a
chance to play for a Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun playing, like I did at A&AMP;M. I may have lost
that with Arizona. I think the game became more of a job that
became harder and harder every week. When you're not winning,
you're not having fun. I love the direction this team is headed.
It's hard to describe exactly how I feel, other than to say how
much I've been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy turned to his spirituality to withstand booing by the
fans and criticism by the media for two years with the Cardinals.
He is a devout Christian, and his firm belief in God helped him
overcome the pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity has helped me,'' he says. ``Knowing God's in
control of everything helped me be at peace with the situation. I
put God first, family second and football third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was released by the Cardinals, my wife (Vinita) and I
prayed about it. I was very disappointed things didn't work out in
Arizona, so we put it in God's hands and hoped for a more
legitimate opportunity to showcase my skills in an organization
that's a little farther ahead of Arizona. Now, when I look back, I
realize it was just another phase of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that because I experienced failure, I'll sure
know how to handle success.''

NEW FACES LOOK AWFULLY FAMILIAR

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins said he
couldn't imagine a trade that would make his team any better than
it will be with the addition of two new players he'll have in
tonight's lineup against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jack McDowell will make his first start since May 31,
when elbow problems landed him on the disabled list. Darin Erstad
will play for the first time since Aug. 3, when he suffered a
strained left hamstring. He'll start at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you're getting quality people back,'' Collins
said. ``It's like getting new blood.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell signed an incentive-laden contract _ $1 million base
with potential to reach $6 million _ but it hasn't exactly worked
out with all his time on the DL. But with the team in a pennant
race, McDowell says he's satisfied to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I'm in a position where I can help us out,'' he
said. ``Coming back wouldn't have made any difference if we were 10
games out.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said despite a 2{-month layoff he won't be nervous when
he takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something to be nervous about,'' he said. ``It's
something to be locked in about.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell has been on the active roster since Saturday, when he
began serving his four-game suspension for his role in the June 2
fight in Kansas City. But with Erstad activated today, someone must
go.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said reserve outfielder Reggie Williams will start
tonight's game to give Garret Anderson a rest, meaning the likely
odd man out is first baseman Chris Pritchett. Pritchett would stay
if someone was put on the disabled list instead, and Craig Shipley
has been bothered lately with a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   __ Up-Hill battle: Pitcher Ken Hill (elbow) pitched on Tuesday
night for Single-A Lake Elsinore at Stockton in what was supposed
to be his final rehab start. He was supposed to make 90 pitches but
made only 70 in four innings. He gave up four runs (three earned)
and five hits while walking five and striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was expected to be activated to start on Sunday against
Toronto in Anaheim, pushing Chuck Finley back a day to start
against the Yankees in New York. Now, though, the situation might
be a little clouded.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charlie O'Brien has started throwing as part of his
rehab for a broken right thumb but there is no timetable for his
return.

METS SWEEP DOUBLEHEADER FROM ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were no boos for Mike Piazza on Tuesday night,
only standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times since since he was acquired on May 22,
Piazza was treated like a hero. And not just by who was left of the
21,611 on hand who had braved showers to see the New York Mets win
the first of their three doubleheaders this week. Piazza's
teammates, who have begun to tease the All-Star catcher about his
dour mood, seemed genuinely happy for him.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Piazza delivered perhaps the biggest hit as a Met _
a bases-clearing, pinch-hit, three-run double to lift the Mets to a
6-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies in the second game of a
doubleheader. In the opener, Piazza singled in a run in a 6-2
victory that saw four Mets (not Piazza) hit home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep, in the first of three doubleheaders this week for the
Mets, put them a season-best 13 games over .500 and percentage
points ahead of the Cubs in the National League wild-card chase. It
was the Mets' fourth doubleheader sweep of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who is now 3 for 3 with the Mets as a pinch-hitter,
could even be heard telling a joke. When kiddingly asked if he
would go to the bench for the good of the team in light of his
pinch-hitting success, Piazza laughed and said: ``Whatever it
takes. But I'd be the highest-paid pinch-hitter in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked afterward if he felt it was his biggest hit as a Met,
Piazza said: ``Yeah, probably. But I like to think all of them are
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said: ``That's as big a hit as
we've had this year. That was a blast. Vintage Piazza.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's double off the left-hander Chuck McElroy with two
strikes and the Mets trailing, 3-1, capped a two-out rally that
began with a John Olerud single off the Rockies' right-hander John
Thomson. Colorado Manager Don Baylor then called on McElroy to turn
the next batter, Todd Hundley, around to the right side of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was sound. The switch-hitting Hundley was 1 for 12
with 11 strikeouts and 1 walk hitting right-handed when the day
began. But McElroy, who never even came close to the strike zone,
walked Hundley on four pitches. And up stepped Brian McRae.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-2 count, McRae hit a dying quail pop-up toward second.
But no one decided to try to make the catch. The ball plopped in
front of second baseman Mike Lansing, as both McElroy and first
baseman Todd Helton helplessly watched the play. McRae had a
75-foot hit. And the bases were loaded for Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they were loaded for Carlos Baerga. But Valentine
sensed that this was the moment. And Piazza did not fail. With the
crowd on its feet and cheering noisily, Piazza took a ball, then
fouled three consecutive pitches straight back _ a sign that he was
closing in on McElroy.
</P>
<P>
   On McElroy's fifth pitch, Piazza delivered his three-run double
to make a winner out of Mel Rojas (5-2). And, after Lenny Harris
drilled his first homer of the season, a two-run shot off the
former Met Jerry DiPoto in the eighth, John Franco closed out the
sweep for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Edgardo Alfonzo, Hundley, Olerud and McRae hit
home runs off Pedro Astacio to support Al Leiter (12-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the defense kept us in the game, the homers put us
in front and Al battled all the way against a very good-hitting
team,'' Valentine said between games, speaking of the Mets' first
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Lopez and Olerud provided the best defensive gems behind
Leiter, who surrendered 10 hits but allowed just 2 runs in 8
innings before Turk Wendell pitched a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't particularly sharp,'' said Leiter, who labored
through 135 pitches in his first start in eight days. ``And I
didn't feel like I was as complete today. But any time you allow
two runs in eight innings against a Colorado team, I'll certainly
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, Leiter decided to abandon his changeup and
curve and, in his words, ``resort back to what you know best,
which, for me, is hard in.''
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a lot of cruelty to some Colorado bats _
especially the ones swung by Lansing, Dante Bichette and Larry
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm right and the ball's moving a lot, I break a few
bats,'' Leiter said. ``I got three of Lansing's and Bichette a
couple of times. And Walker might've been the most mad. He might
have had a lucky bat or something. I know for him tonight it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as lucky as the Mets' bats were for Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's second homer of the season was his first at Shea since
he hit his 30th (and last) home run last Sept. 8, before
reconstructive elbow surgery. On Tuesday, Hundley belted a 2-1
pitch from Astacio into the bullpen in right to lead off the fourth
and give Leiter a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had earned it. In the top of the fourth, the left-hander
had left the bases loaded after his defense failed him. Alfonzo
began the fourth by throwing high to first on a grounder to third
by Bichette and pulling Olerud off the bag at first. The miscue was
Alfonzo's first since June28, snapping a streak of 42 games without
an error.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla followed with a double over third and just out of
Alfonzo's reach, putting two Rockies in scoring position in a 2-0
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter came back to strike out Helton and retire Lansing on
a pop-up to short. After an intentional walk to Kirt Manwaring,
Leiter struck out Astacio to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the whole game,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter said: ``Three years ago, if I had runners on second and
third with nobody out, they're both scoring. Just through lack of
confidence. And that's just the difference between having a good
year and a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Rockies went 0 for 6 in the first four innings with
runners in scoring position. The Mets, meanwhile, scored in the
first on a single by Piazza that scored Tony Phillips from third.
Phillips had led off the inning with a single to center, taken
second when Alfonzo was hit by a pitch, and then taken third on a
force-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' next two runs came on solo homers by Alfonzo (his
ninth, to left, leading off the third) and Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mets' fifth, Olerud blasted a two-run homer (his 17th)
some 419 feet to straightaway center field two batters before McRae
looped his 19th home run, a solo shot, to the opposite field in
left.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Leiter a 6-2 cushion, more than enough, it turned out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels got good news and bad news
Tuesday. First, the bad news:
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle homered and had a two-run double to help the
Chicago White Sox to a 4-3 win over the Angels before 26,162 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Even with a loss, the Angels actually would
increase their lead in the A.L. West from one to 1{ games because
the Texas Rangers were swept in a doubleheader at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Chuck Finley pitched well for six innings, but
appeared to tire in the seventh as the White Sox scored three times
to break a 1-1 tie and go up, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Finley left the game in the seventh with two out and the bases
loaded, trailing 2-1. Mike Fetters entered the game and gave up the
two-run double to Belle, but the runs were charged to Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Angels couldn't put anything together against
White Sox starter John Snyder. Snyder, acquired by the White Sox in
1995 from the Angels in the deal for Jim Abbott, survived
first-inning trouble and went six innings, allowing just one run
and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those hits came from Tim Salmon, who is playing with a
foot ligament that is 70 percent torn.
</P>
<P>
   He continued a torrid August with two doubles and walk Tuesday
in four plate appearances. Salmon has been the Angels' hottest
hitter this month, if not the hottest hitter in the league. In
August, Salmon is hitting .417 (25 for 60) with four homers and 14
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   His leadoff double in the fourth inning led to a 1-0 lead,
Salmon scoring from third on a sacrifice fly by Troy Glaus. Salmon
also doubled with two out in the sixth, and the Angels later loaded
the bases for Chris Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett, who doubled in three runs one night earlier, instead
grounded out to first to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   After the White Sox had taken a 4-1 lead, the Angels tried to
rally against Chicago's bullpen. Matt Walbeck hit a solo homer in
the seventh to cut the White Sox lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the Angels loaded the bases with two out for
Walbeck. Reliever Bill Simas, also acquired in the trade for Abbott
in '95, walked Walbeck on four pitches to force home a run to make
it 4-3. With a chance to be a hero, Gary DiSarcina followed with a
line drive that second baseman Ray Durham snared with a leaping
catch to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finley made things tough on the White Sox early. Chicago didn't
get a hit until Robin Ventura's one-out single in the fourth. That
gave the White Sox runners on first and second with one out, but
Finley got out of it when Wil Cordero grounded into a doubleplay.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got even at 1-1 in the sixth inning on Belle's
two-out homer, his 37th of the season. They went ahead in the
seventh inning and knocked Finley out of the game in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez began the inning with a single and was
sacrificed to second. After No. 9 hitter Mike Cameron walked,
Durham singled up the middle to score Ordonez for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finley struck out Mike Caruso for the second out of the inning,
but after he walked Frank Thomas to load the bases, manager Terry
Collins came out with the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters replaced Finley and faced Belle and allowed a two-run
double, allowing the White Sox to go up, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went into Tuesday's game with an average attendance
of 30,377, up from 23,738 per game at this point last season.
However, pennant fever hasn't exactly taken hold in Anaheim. When a
reporter mentioned it didn't seem to feel like a pennant race at
Edison Field, Collins responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``It does to me, I haven't slept in a week, he said. ``The
coaches know we're in a pennant race, the players know we're in a
pennant race. That's where it has to start.

TIGERS SLAM MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The whole idea for left-handed relievers, the reason
they are coveted so highly and paid so much, is to retire
left-handed hitters. It's one of the basic tenets of the game.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as specialists, frequently asked to defuse a
situation by getting one key out. Greg McCarthy is supposed to
disarm bombs, not allow them.
</P>
<P>
   But in McCarthy's past two outings, Dave Niehaus has been
pulling out the rye bread for the other team.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson walloped a grand slam to propel the Detroit
Tigers to a 7-6 victory over the Mariners on Tuesday night before
24,136 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy also gave up a grand slam to Carlos Delgado in his last
outing last Wednesday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson's blast spoiled an otherwise heroic evening for Alex
Rodriguez. The Mariner shortstop went 5-for-5, scoring two runs and
knocking in two more to give him an even 100 RBIs. He did not hit
his 36th home run, but he stole his 37th base in the continuing
40-40 quest.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez equaled a club record for most hits in a nine-inning
game while raising his average to .311.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez would have preferred a victory over an 11-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I come out is to win,'' he said. ``I'd like to
sneak one hit in there, but I'd go 0-for-5, 0-for-6 as long as we
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from A-Rod's assault, the M's looked at more of the same,
troubling numbers and statistics. They are now 4-20 in one-run
games. They lost to the 49-74 Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Seth Greisinger showed up with a 1-7 record. Seattle's
Bobby Ayala appeared in the fifth with a 1-8 record. Guess who
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala preceded McCarthy in the sixth inning. The right-handed
reliever was greeted indifferently with a smattering of applause.
Five minutes later, customary boos rang out from the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Ayala stressed that he still wasn't talking to
the media. During the game, Ayala showed that he still can't bring
it in clutch situations, his ERA mushrooming to 6.71.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over for starter Paul Spoljaric, Ayala allowed three
straight hits, the final one by Deivi Cruz tying the score 3-3.
Ayala did strike out Paul Bako and Joe Randa but walked Brian
Hunter in between to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That was when McCarthy trotted in, soon to be seen trudging off.
Missing with his first two pitches to Higginson, McCarthy tried to
whistle a fastball across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch sailed high and inside and Higginson launched it off
the facing of the second deck, high above the ``T'' on the National
League scoreboard in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed in front of the Office Depot sign, right fielder Jay
Buhner did not even move his feet. He took a slight turn to his
left and watched the ball sail over his head. Randy Johnson could
not have grabbed that one.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy stood on the mound with the look of a beaten man,
because he was. The 29-year-old from Shelton, Conn., had reduced
his ERA to 2.50 until he showed up in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson said he got the pitch he was anticipating. Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said McCarthy shook off a breaking ball and
decided to bring the heat instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 2-and-0 and I knew he couldn't walk me,'' said
Higginson, who belted his 21st homer of the year on his 28th
birthday. ``I was looking for a fastball. He threw it inside, right
where I was looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginson took his trip around the bases and then pointed to the
bullpen at reliever Doug Bochtler, who had given him a haircut
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lucky haircut,'' said Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two outings, McCarthy has given up four earned runs
in one-third of an inning. That computes to 108.11, or off the
charts. His next appearance might be in Tacoma, although Piniella
did not suggest a demotion afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has given up big home runs,'' Piniella said. ``His job is
to get left-handed hitters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lefty, Spoljaric, started for only the second time this
season and struggled early. Before the first inning ended, Bob
Wells was warming up in the bullpen, prepared to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric found catcher John Marzano's glove but could not
locate the plate. The left-hander walked four batters in the first
inning, three in succession, the final two with the bases loaded,
giving Detroit a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. drove in his 102nd run in the third and added
his 103rd in the sixth. He needs eight more RBIs to become the 14th
player in baseball history to have 400 RBIs in three consecutive
seasons. It has not been accomplished since 1948-50 by Vern
Stephens. Lou Gehrig has the record of 509 from 1930-32 (174, 184,
151).
</P>
<P>
   Griffey failed to deliver in the eighth. With runners on second
and third and Detroit in front 7-5, Tigers manager Buddy Bell chose
to have right-hander Matt Anderson pitch to the Mariner slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I wouldn't have preferred to do that,'' Bell said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey struck out, and Edgar Martinez came through with his
second sacrifice fly, leaving the Mariners a run short.

WORLD LEAGUE SPRINGBOARD FOR SEVERAL SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Riddick Parker went two years ago to prove he
could play football at the next level. Kerry Joseph and Mike Croel
went this year to prove they could play new positions at any level.
</P>
<P>
   Their ultimate destinations are the same: The NFL. But each
decided a side trip to the World League would help them reach their
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to get back into the league, it was something I had to
do and something I wanted to do,'' said Croel, who was NFL
defensive rookie of the year in 1991 as a linebacker with the
Denver Broncos but was out of the league last season after being
released by the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is still in my blood, and (the World League) was
something I wanted to do so I could get on back,'' he said. ``I'm
here, so it was good for me and I enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have been intertwined with the development of the
spring league.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sinclair is a two-time Pro Bowl defensive end who has
collected 25 sacks the past two seasons. But in 1992, he was a
struggling second-year player who needed to prove to himself that
he had the prowess to make it in the NFL. So Sinclair agreed to
play for the Sacramento Surge in the second season of the
developmental league. He had 10 sacks that spring and has since
blossomed into one of the better defensive players in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jon Kitna has the brightest of futures. But last
year, he had yet to display the talents and intangibles that now
are so apparent. Kitna needed to play after spending his rookie
season the practice squad. Play he did, leading the Barcelona
Dragons to the World League title last year. Kitna has since
developed into one of the better stories in the league.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Seahawks have 10 players on their 82-man roster
who have roots in the World League, and as many as seven could
still be around after the final cut to 53 on Aug. 30 _ Sinclair,
Kitna, Parker and linebacker James Logan for sure, and possibly
Croel, Joseph and center Greg Bloedorn.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs (13 each) and Miami
Dolphins (11) went to training camp with more World League
refugees. Most teams have four or five.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few teams that really put a lot into scouting the
World League, and we're one of them,'' said Bill Quinter, Seahawks
pro scouting director. ``It's just another way to find talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinter spends three weeks at the World League's preseason
training camp in Atlanta and then reviews video of every game with
the help of assistant pro scouting director Tag Ribary.
</P>
<P>
   They compile files on players who might be able to help the team
_ now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawks still needed a fourth defensive end the week
before training camp started, they signed Croel. When injuries
decimated their middle linebacking crew in the season opener, they
added Jamie Baisley, a member of the World League champion Rhein
Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The World League, which was called NFL Europe this spring, is
not the NFL. But as Quinter puts it, ``If a player can dominate in
that league, he's going to have a chance to come to this level and
compete for a roster spot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all most of these players are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually went to the World League as a quarterback. I had
the option if I wasn't starting to do other things,'' said Joseph,
who was a quarterback at McNeese State and with the Cincinnati
Bengals in 1996, a running back with the Washington Redskins last
summer and a safety for the Rhein Fire this spring. ``So I decided
to switch to defensive back. I thought that would be a good
position for me to get back into the NFL. I made the switch and it
worked out well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have developed a reputation for being World League
friendly. Coaches and agents will call Quinter with possible
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them become players, of course. But it's worth a
look, and the chance to be looked at.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus when I was over there was getting back in the NFL,''
said Parker, a defensive tackle who sat out the 1995 NFL season and
then spent the 1996 season on the Seahawk practice squad after
playing with the Rhein that spring. ``I always thought I had what
it takes to play in this league. But first I just had to prove it
to myself, and then I had to prove it to the people who would give
me the chance to show it.''

   SEATTLE _ It is tough to gauge exactly how rabid Seahawk fans
will again become in the upcoming season or two.
</P>
<P>
   Will the leather-lunged and stalwart Seahawk supporters _ the
good ol' No. 12's who made the Kingdome one of the loudest stadiums
in the galaxy _ return to their former level of ear-puncturing
zeal?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell, even as the new Paul Allen Seahawks give all
appearances of a team on the road to postseason contention.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it hard to tell? Because Seahawk fans have not been put
to the ultimate test _ not like football fans in Cleveland, where
the beloved Browns have been missing in action for two seasons,
going on three.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Seahawks appeared to be Los Angeles-bound before Allen
bought them, but now they have become one of the most
free-spending, up-and-coming franchises in the league. Meanwhile,
Clevelanders watched in anger as their home team went south, and
east, to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the Browns to get back to business, too, if
only to prove the good fight can be won. Wednesday, the good people
of Cleveland take another step closer toward reclaiming a vital
part of the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   In an Atlanta hotel, National Football League owners will listen
to proposals from seven different groups, all fervently jockeying
to become the new owners of the soon-to-be-revived Browns.
</P>
<P>
   There is a serious group that includes former Browns stars
Calvin Hill and Paul Warfield. Another includes comedian Bill
Cosby, former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula and former Browns
quarterback and Clevelander Bernie Kosar. Still another interested
owner is billionaire banker Alfred Lerner, who has former San
Francisco 49ers president Carmen Policy as his front man.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is no shortage of rich people who believe they
can get even richer just by owning the history-rich Browns. Why
else would the hopeful owners be bidding upwards of $350 million
and more?
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting will be Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt,
</P>
<P>
   representing Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who handed over
$200 million to take the beleaguered home team off Ken Behring's
inept hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Seattle and any other city where the future of the local
NFL team has suffered through shaky times should lend serious moral
support to Clevelanders. Browns fans deserve the richest, most
loyal owners they can get.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks and Browns do not share much NFL history. Or do
they?
</P>
<P>
   On a less-than-memorable Christmas Eve afternoon, they played
the 1994 season finale in Cleveland's old Municipal Stadium. It was
a lousy game played on a miserable day. Cold, gray, rotten _ not
only because of the bone-chilling December weather by Lake Erie,
but because such bad stuff was in the air for both franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Tom Flores would soon be fired, quarterback Rick
Mirer would soon be exposed as a bust, and worst of all, Behring
was getting restless. On Feb. 2, 1996, he announced that he was
hijacking the team to Los Angeles, leaving Seattle's NFL legacy up
for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' team colors, logo and records were meaningless to
Behring. His only objective was to set up shop in Tinseltown, where
he dreamed other money-hungry developer types would build him a
stadium and the NFL would reward him with their blessing to be the
league's sole entity in one of the nation's biggest TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was the matter of that pesky little lawsuit, the
one filed by King County and the state of Washington, demanding
that Behring and the Seahawks honor their Kingdome lease and remain
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   All the publicity and the fear of federal court justice were
just the things to scare off Behring's L.A. suitors. He could make
no deal in L.A. Instead, he was forced to make the one deal in
Seattle with a man for whom $200 million is pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back, it would be fair for Seahawk fans to give some
credit to the good people of Cleveland for the relatively easy
survival of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   When former Browns owner Art Modell made an airport runway deal
to ship his team to Baltimore, Cleveland fought back. It was the
pain and suffering and the good fight led by the fans and
politicians in Cleveland that forced the NFL to put the Browns'
logo, colors and team records in a special trust.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the NFL set to award the Browns' colors, logo and
records to a new owner, the Browns are getting closer to their
revival. Next August, the old Browns will become the new Browns
when the first preseason game is played at the new Municipal
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was the inalienable right of Cleveland to retain
its NFL heritage that set the stage for Behring's inability to
weasel out of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Go, Browns.

HUSKY RECEIVER SHOWCASES SHEAR TALENT IN HIS DORM ROOM BARBER

<P>
   SEATTLE _ For a lot of Washington football players, Tuesday was
a bad hair day. There will be many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some clippers,'' transfer wide receiver Dane Looker
explained innocently. ``I cut my own hair. I learned that from a
roommate at Western Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dormitory housing the Huskies use for two-a-day drills,
Looker's teammates dropped in for haircuts. Several linemen,
including tight end Chris Lang, Chad Ward, Tony Coats opted for a
shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Brad Hutt, the center, who wanted a 'do like the
character Kooch in the movie ``Vision Quest'' _ something like a
cross between a mohawk and a coonskin cap. Linebacker Todd Johnson
chose a longish mohawk. Another linebacker, Jeff Johnson, ordered a
shaved head with a tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bathroom (in the dorm) looks like a big old dog shed his
hair,'' Looker said.
</P>
<P>
   Explained Lang, ``It's just for fun, something to do during
two-a-days to liven it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   COATS CLEARED: Coats, who had been held out of sprinting drills
because of an accelerated heart rate that afflicted him recently,
received clearance and was running hard Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   IFS ANDS MUTTS: Looker hasn't been spending all his time playing
barber. Lambright says he ``catches everything.'' One sideline
reception on a deep ball from Brock Huard Tuesday caused Huard to
break into a shaky rendition of their alma mater's fight song at
Puyallup ... DB Renard Edwards, one of three Walla Walla JC
transfers, is in camp after obtaining his two-year degree ... WR
Patrick Reddick has been out of action with a continuation of a
spring knee problem. Reddick, who showed great promise as a
freshman last year, had a cyst removed months ago and still has a
tender spot ... Lambright says the rest of the week will feature
``real heavy hitting,'' due in part to the importance of the Sept.
5 opener at Arizona State, plus the need to get an early look at
freshmen who might figure in ... RB Maurice Shaw (hamstring) sat
out again and likely won't be full speed by the first scrimmage
Saturday ... PK Nick Lentz has a quadriceps pull, but Lambright
expects him back soon. Also kicking are walk-on Jim Skurski and two
mystery guests, WRs Joe Jarzynka and Jon Minter ... Lambright says
the punting competition is roughly even, with holder Sean
O'Laughlin and Seattle Prep/St. Olaf's transfer Ryan Fleming
battling.

   1. CELEBRITY ENDORSERS CAN BE RISKY BUSINESS What happens when
celebrities are caught in compromising situations while wearing
designer labels with which they have no commercial association? For
example, Hugh Grant wearing a Tommy Hilfiger cap when arrested for
soliciting a prostitute, or Monica Lewinsky wearing a Donna Karan
beret to a November 1996 photo opportunity with President Bill
Clinton? In this report, company executives discuss the impact of
these unplanned product placements. By Eric Wilson. From Women's
Wear Daily. 1,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
LUTHER VANDROSS BROADENS HIS RANGE Perennial Grammy god Luther
Vandross has been called the ``Frank Sinatra of R&AMP;B'' in Billboard
magazine. It's a term of endearment that he cherishes. ``I loved
it. I couldn't have loved anything more, because it implies
longevity,'' Vandross says of the Sinatra comparison. ``It implies
a standard that's hard to keep or measure up to.'' By Steve Morse.
From The Boston Globe. 1,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
VINCE VAUGHN : A 'SWINGER' BRANCHES OUT Vince Vaughn has hit the
extremes in the movie world - his two biggest roles to date have
involved starring in the microbudgeted independent hit
``Swingers,'' and getting eaten by a dinosaur in Steven Spielberg's
extravagant ``The Lost World : Jurassic Park.'' Now he's filling in
the gaps with four upcoming films, including ``Return to
Paradise,'' and the controversial remake of ``Pyscho.'' By Ian
Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
JASON PATRIC, THE ANTI-STAR, REBOUNDS FROM 'SPEED 2:
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE CONTROL' Jason Patric grew up with show business in his
blood, but that doesn't mean he's truly at ease with being a star.
In fact, he would rather someone else get all the attention. Like
it or not, the attention is on him with his new movie ``Your
Friends and Neighbours,'' the most sexually provocative film of
1998 (it's a modern immorality tale about three couples who examine
the intimacy between husband and wives, friends and neighbours.)
Patric discusses his career and his rebound from the unsuccessful
film ``Speed 2.'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
'SCOTTY' PRAISES SPIELBERG FOR 'SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' James Doohan
is best known for playing the role of ``Scotty'' - as in ``beam me
up Scotty'' - on ``Star Trek.'' But he's also a World War II
veteran of Canada's armed forces. In this interview, Doohan talks
about D-Day and praises Steven Spielberg's film ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' He also says the fans got it wrong - it was ``Beam me up,
Mr. Scott.'' By Jerry Tallmer. 1,400 words + photos.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
WESLEY SNIPES Wesley Snipes has had a hit and miss career. In this
article he discusses his next role in the new science fiction movie
``Blade.'' Snipes also talks about his production company, Amen Ra
Films, and his hopes to have more control over his career. By Ian
Spelling. 1,200 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
FACE VALUE : WESLEY SNIPES Vance Lehmkuhl offers a cartoon view of
Wesley Snipes in his new sci-fi film ``Blade.''
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
WHEN AN OLDER WOMAN ROMANCES A YOUNGER MAN It's no big deal when
Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Clint Eastwood or
Harrison Ford romance and win the hearts of their leading ladies
(most of whom are young enough to be their daughters.) But what
happens when the tables are turned, the woman is 40 and the object
of her desire is 20? Add to the mix the fact that the couple are
black and you have a story that is perfect for a Hollywood movie :
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' (based on Terry McMillan's book
about her affair with a much younger man. ) Actress Angela Bassett,
says she grabbed the part because ``the story deals with universal
themes while asking some important questions.'' By Ivor Davis.
1,000 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 9.
DREW CAREY'S NEW GAME IN TOWN Based on a British perennial TV show,
the comedy game show ``Whose Line Is It Anyway'' is hosted by Drew
Carey. It is being touted as one of the funniest shows on the air.
Carey talks about his delight in his first encounters with
improvisational comedy and why he thinks that, laugh for laugh,
this may be television's funniest show (four comics perform
unrehearsed scenes, based on suggestions from a studio audience.)
By Andrew Ryan. From Canadian TV Guide. 1,400 words.

REPUBLICANS TRY TO PASS AS GREEN _ FOR VOTES

<P>
   Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House are sparring about
who is more environmentally friendly. It's a paper tussle _ carried
out with feuding reports during an election season. Their words are
really aimed at voters.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls consistently show that approximately 70
percent of Americans want the environment and wilderness areas
protected.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans began the public relations duel. On July 15, the
House Policy Committee, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
issued a report claiming that Republicans deserve recognition for
an ``historic record of environmental accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report gives the GOP credit for passing what it calls two
major environmental bills: the Tropical Forest Conservation Act
(H.R. 2870) and the Sonny Bono Memorial Salton Sea Reclamation Act
(H.R. 3267). The report states they are ``two new wins for the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   More spin than win. The self-congratulatory GOP report fudges on
both of its key boasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Tropical Forest Conservation Act allows developing countries
to swap portions of their debts to the United States in exchange
for tropical forest conservation. The bill won the endorsement of
the World Wildlife Fund and the Sierra Club and passed both houses
of Congress. On July 29, President Clinton signed the bill into
law.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good piece of environmental legislation _ trouble is,
the GOP can't really accept applause for its passage. Only 161
House Republicans voted for the bill with 60 against, while 194
House Democrats voted for passage with only one nay.
</P>
<P>
   The Salton Sea Reclamation Act, introduced by Duncan Hunter,
R-Calif., passed the House by a mere 21 votes and is stalled in the
Senate. For good reason. No major environmental group supported the
House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hasty bill that short-cuts scientific research, the Clean
Water Act, and judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has its own version of the bill (S. 1716), introduced
by the two Democratic senators from California, Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein. Their bill is scientifically sensitive and gained
the endorsement of the National Audubon Society and other
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were designed to reclaim the Salton Sea which formed
in 1905 when a levee broke and the Colorado River flowed in the
Salton trough about 130 miles east of San Diego. It's a landlocked
body of water that is now threatened by gradually increasing
salinity and industrial pollutants. The briny sea is beginning to
take its toll of fish, birds and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is needed, but not the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the GOP issued its report, Democrats
fired back.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., and the Democratic
staff of the House Committee on Resources issued a response
entitled ``The Great Republican Environmental P.R. Campaign'' which
calls the report a publicity stunt ``designed to `greenwash' the
press and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller condemns the GOP report as a ``decoy for
anti-environmental riders'' that have been attached to recent
appropriations bills: ``Hidden in the VA-HUD, Interior, and
Commerce appropriations bills pending before Congress are riders
that will gut public health and environmental protections _ just
like the highly controversial Republican riders of the 104th
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic parry and thrust has its own false footing. The
Miller report criticizes the GOP for undercutting the National
Parks, but completely ignores ``Vision 2020 National Parks
Restoration Act'' authored by Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. The
national parks bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent and is
now being considered in the House Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This bill would strengthen National Parks and provide means for
protecting these beloved natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Miller report is deadly accurate when it points to
the numerous anti-environmental riders attached to appropriations
bills by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Riders to both the House and the Senate version of the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations Act (VA-HUD) severely limit the number of
toxicological profiles that can be taken at hazardous substance
Superfund sites. These profiles are used to gauge acceptable levels
of exposure to pollutants found at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   The VA-HUD appropriations bills delay cleanup of PCBs in the
Hudson River and other rivers around the nation and cut funding for
cleaning up old, vacated industrial urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   GOP riders to the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act
cut funding to the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land
Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. They subsidize more
logging and logging roads. They end the Interior Columbia Basin
Ecosystem Management Plan that was designed to improve the
management of 72 million acres of BLM and Forest Service lands and
allows projects that could jeopardize the ecosystem to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the Interior appropriations bill mandates a
road to be built through Alaska's Chugach National Forest and
across the Copper River Delta, one of the nation's largest wetlands
and waterfowl feeding areas. The GOP rider waives all environmental
review and public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP rider to the House version also opens 75 acres of
Florida's coastline to development and removes them from the
Coastal Barrier Resources System. These coastal barriers are
nesting areas for sea turtles and other threatened and endangered
species. The area is also prone to hurricane destruction.
Development in these 75 acres would now be eligible for federal
subsidies and taxpayer dollars when buildings and settlements are
destroyed by wind and sea.
</P>
<P>
   When amendments were offered to soften the worst
anti-environmental riders, the tally of votes told a sad tale.
According to the Miller report, of seven key pro-environmental
amendments, on average, only 17 percent of the Republicans in the
House voted for their passage.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party should blush red for pretending to be
green.

   The Austrians are always celebrating somebody's anniversary,
most often that of a musician or composer. But this year, instead
of Mozart or Schubert, it is Empress Elizabeth, fondly known as
Sissi, who was assassinated 100 years ago at age 61 in Geneva after
a disastrous marriage and tormented life.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the slim, handsome young princess with cascades of
brown hair flowing down her back and a demure smile are all over
Vienna. Elizabeth was 16 when she married her cousin, Emperor Franz
Joseph, in 1854. A Bavarian, she quickly came to dislike the
strictures of court life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and she
escaped by writing poetry, riding horses and having a villa built
on Corfu.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the salute to the imperial past, Vienna has become a
livelier, more international city in the last few years. The
effects of the opening up of the former Communist bloc can be
subtly felt in the languages spoken in the cafes and on the trams,
and in glimpses of newly affluent Russians who park money here.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, its neutrality maintained since 1955 after the
withdrawal of the four occupying powers, has decided for the moment
against joining NATO. But for the second half of 1998, Austria has
assumed the presidency of the European Union and is flaunting its
adhesion to Western Europe by showing off its revitalized
industries and exports, including its high-quality wine. Vienna has
become a gateway to Eastern Europe with daily flights by Austrian
Airlines to even some of the most out-of-the way cities that nine
years ago were behind the Iron Curtain.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immortal Sissy is at the heart of a three-part exhibit,
``Elizabeth _ Eternal Beauty,'' that is taking place in three
different parts of the city. At Schonbrunn Palace, her summer
residence, the early period of her marriage comes to life in the
fabulous apartments where she wrote and entertained.

   The Austrians are always celebrating somebody's anniversary,
most often that of a musician or composer. But this year, instead
of Mozart or Schubert, it is Empress Elizabeth, fondly known as
Sissi, who was assassinated 100 years ago at age 61 in Geneva after
a disastrous marriage and tormented life.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the slim, handsome young princess with cascades of
brown hair flowing down her back and a demure smile are all over
Vienna. Elizabeth was 16 when she married her cousin, Emperor Franz
Joseph, in 1854. A Bavarian, she quickly came to dislike the
strictures of court life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and she
escaped by writing poetry, riding horses and having a villa built
on Corfu.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the salute to the imperial past, Vienna has become a
livelier, more international city in the last few years. The
effects of the opening up of the former Communist bloc can be
subtly felt in the languages spoken in the cafes and on the trams,
and in glimpses of newly affluent Russians who park money here.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, its neutrality maintained since 1955 after the
withdrawal of the four occupying powers, has decided for the moment
against joining NATO. But for the second half of 1998, Austria has
assumed the presidency of the European Union and is flaunting its
adhesion to Western Europe by showing off its revitalized
industries and exports, including its high-quality wine. Vienna has
become a gateway to Eastern Europe with daily flights by Austrian
Airlines to even some of the most out-of-the way cities that nine
years ago were behind the Iron Curtain.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;

   The immortal Sissy is at the heart of a three-part exhibit,

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was the pointed, down-turned nose, the sleek profile and the
sheer speed of the Concorde that impressed everyone 21 years ago.
They still do. So British Airways is marking the 21st birthday of
the aircraft that brought supersonic flight to the well-heeled
masses by declaring 1998 ``The Year of the Concorde.''
 &HT;    ``She is a 21st-century airplane,'' says Capt. Mike Bannister,
flight manager for British Airways' Concorde fleet. ``She looks
like she is a very fast and sophisticated airplane. And as they
say, if it looks right, it probably flies right.''
 &HT;    British Airways currently has seven Concordes, and Air France
has five. In honor of the anniversary, British Airways has mounted
a traveling exhibition called ``Ride the Rocket,'' using the
insider's nickname for the plane. The exhibition will visit all 22
cities served by British Airways this summer and fall, including
Denver, Houston, Dallas, Miami and Los Angeles. Naturally, it
includes a genuine Concorde nose.
 &HT;    A ``Ride the Rocket'' contest in conjunction with the exhibition
offers trips to London on the Concorde as prizes. In addition,
anyone purchasing a ticket on British Airways before Aug. 31 and
completing travel by the end of September is eligible to win one of
the 100 grand prizes of a trip for two on the Concorde and three
nights at a London hotel.
 &HT;    For details, contact British Airways Holidays, 7520 Astoria
Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-AIRWAYS.
 &HT;    Why all the fuss about a 21-year-old plane? Because nothing has
ever been built that surpasses it. A typical crossing takes about
three hours and 10 minutes, at an average speed of more than 1,000
mph. The plane's current speed record was set by British Airways in
February 1996, covering the distance from New York to London in two
hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds.
 &HT;    ``Concorde can go at twice the speed of sound for over three
hours with 100 passengers, 10 crew and the best wines and cuisine
in the sky,'' Bannister says. ``You're traveling 23 miles a minute,
yet a coin can be set on edge on the flight deck and won't waver.''
 &HT;    Inside, the Concorde has two-by-two leather bucket seats that
would not be out of place in a sports car, and windows that are
noticeably smaller than those on subsonic aircraft.
 &HT;    Ten to 12 minutes after taking off, the Concorde reaches Mach 1
at about 30,000 feet. Ten minutes later it hits Mach 2, at which
point it is typically above 50,000 feet, eventually reaching a
cruising altitude of about 58,000 feet. It is the closest most
passengers will ever get to seeing what an astronaut sees.
 &HT;    During the flight, the famous Concorde nose heats up to about
250 degrees Fahrenheit. The pilot's view from the cockpit
encompasses a 270-degree arc, which means that Bannister, his
co-pilot and his flight engineer are looking out at a quarter of a
million miles of the Earth's surface.
 &HT;    ``It's a very beautiful aircraft to fly, very responsive and
very powerful,'' Bannister reports. ``It's an agile performer, a
thoroughbred rather than a cart horse, a sports car rather than a
truck. Pilots adore flying it.''
 &HT;    Flying at close to 60,000 feet, the Concorde encounters fewer
problems with weather than a conventional jumbo jet does at 35,000
feet. Bannister explains that ``the weather finishes at around
42,000 feet,'' which means that the Concorde is flying above storms
and turbulence.
 &HT;    Passengers report feeling refreshed when they step off the
plane. It's not just three hours in the air vs. the more
conventional six or seven hours on a trans-Atlantic flight. It's
because Concorde's cabin is pressurized to simulate a more
comfortable altitude of 4,900 to 5,900 feet vs. 7,250 feet on
subsonic long-distance flights.
 &HT;    About 80 percent of the Concorde's passengers are business
travelers _ and about 80 percent of them are repeat travelers.
Speaking of business, Bannister claims that Concorde's numbers
anticipate world business cycles.
 &HT;    ``We have the same shaped curve over the last 10 years as
London's FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) has,'' he says,
``but we go up or down just ahead of it. It's because the folks
we're carrying are the people making major economic decisions.''
 &HT;    They're making money too. The one-way fare on the Concorde is
$5,456, while a round-trip ticket is $9,165. But British Airways
Concorde Vacations offers less-expensive air-hotel packages.
 &HT;    The plane can also be booked in conjunction with a
trans-Atlantic crossing on the Queen Elizabeth II. For passengers
in either Queens Grill or Princess Grill class, an upgrade to
return on the Concorde is $495. For passengers traveling in the
Caronia Grill, it's $795. And for those in the Mauritania Grill,
the upgrade runs $1,295.
 &HT;    For more information, contact Cunard, 6100 Blue Lagoon Drive,
Miami, Fla., 33126; (800) 221-4770.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Getting your shots when preparing for an overseas trip is no
one's idea of fun _ but it's a necessity. Now travelers have a
streamlined way to find out what shots they need, thanks to a
computerized information service that reduces the usual time, cost
and hassle.
 &HT;    That service is Travax, which derives its information from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and other
data bases, refining it and updating it weekly for public use.
 &HT;    About 1,000 outlets subscribe to Travax, including companies
that underwrite major travel, travel clinics, student health
offices, health maintenance organizations and city, county and
state public health offices.
 &HT;    Dr. Bradley Connor, a gastroenterologist who is affiliated with
the International Society of Travel Medicine in New York and on the
board of Travax, became interested in travel medicine about a
decade ago when he noticed more and more travelers returning home
with diseases that could have been prevented.
 &HT;    It was a major quandary in those days, Connor explained, for
travelers to find reliable and noncontradictory health information
about their travel destinations. Travax now digests existing
information and distills it so that it's easy to understand and
use.
 &HT;    We made use of Travax through our county health department,
which subscribes to the service. We visited it in preparation for
travel to Greece and Thailand. Like many county health departments
across America, ours offers an immunization clinic for travelers
headed overseas.
 &HT;    We started out by listing the countries we would visit and
approximate dates. We were quoted a consultation fee of $25 for
two. Any necessary shots would cost extra.
 &HT;    A registered nurse supplied us with information for each
destination, ranging from general health precautions to
drug-violation penalties. For both countries we were provided with
information on risk and prevention for diseases such as hepatitis,
polio, rabies, typhoid, cholera, encephalitis and malaria.
 IMMUNIZATIONS WEAR OFF  
 &HT;    Since our hepatitis B immunizations were current, we
concentrated on hepatitis A, typhoid, malaria and polio. We were
surprised to learn that we, like many other mature travelers, had
neglected to get booster shots for polio, a disease that was so
rampant during our childhood years. As a result, some seniors
contract polio during their travels because their immunizations
have worn off.
 &HT;    Protection against malaria was a bit more complicated in terms
of the types of medicines, areas of the countries we would be
visiting and whether mosquitoes in those areas had built up
resistance to the medicines _ information we would not have been
able to sort out by ourselves. The nurse recommended that we see
our own doctor about the anti-malaria choices, since we were taking
other medications.
 &HT;    Less than half an hour later, we were on our way, our arms
stinging from the shots, and carrying handy yellow cards that fit
into our passports listing our vaccinations.
 &HT;    Our county office averages some 2,000 clients a year, according
to Steve Kutz, supervisor of our county's travel vaccinations
program.
 &HT;    In the wake of Connor's initial concern about travel diseases a
decade ago, there are now more than 1,500 members of the
International Society of Travel Medicine, including 500 clinics,
300 in the United States alone, specializing in travel medicine.
 &HT;    Some Travax subscribers cover large areas. For example, one
subscriber is the South Carolina Health Department, so the
information is available at any of South Carolina's 46 county
offices.

   DRUZHNY, Belarus _ This forlorn town, with its crumbling
apartment blocks and almost treeless landscape, looks more like the
site of a nuclear accident, not a refugee for people who lived
through one.
</P>
<P>
   But here, far from the fallout of the world's worst nuclear
accident, is where Soviet authorities 12 years ago decided to
relocate about 1,000 men, women and children from Chernobyl, in
neighboring Ukraine -- where the world's worst nuclear accident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Druzhny was what passed for a newly built Soviet
development town. About an hour's drive southeast of Minsk, the
capital, it was not a community, merely a collection of hastily
erected apartment buildings and paved roads to accommodate the
proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the buildings are run-down, the roads are Swiss cheese
and the survivors are virtually forgotten. But the problems live
on, especially for the maturing children of Chernobyl, who have
grown up sick and face an adulthood of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The wretched post-Soviet economy of Belarus means that most are
unable to find jobs. Needed medicines are difficult to obtain,
wildly expensive or both as the state-run health care system
sputters. Latent maladies from radiation exposure materialize like
haunting nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who came from Chernobyl just say, 'To hell
with our problems. Let it be. Let's just finishing living this
miserable life,''' says Elena Butkovskaya, 43, who lost her husband
to a brain tumor last year and worries about her 17-year-old son,
Andrei, who has developed an untreatable heart condition and
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Butkovskaya, a woman with close-cropped, thinning hair and
sunken eyes, will not let it be.
</P>
<P>
   She has made it a mission to improve life in Druzhny, primarily
through her work with the non-profit Belarusian Fund for the
Children of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident in 1986 more than 2 million
Belarusians were exposed to high levels of radiation, with only a
belated warning and action from the Soviet government. Thousands
were relocated from an wide evacuation zone around the plant, 2,000
square miles in Ukraine and Belarus tainted by nuclear
contamination and closed to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, cancers, congenital malformations and other medical
problems plagued the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Druzhny have only a small, ill-equipped infirmary
to provide care. Tiles are peeling off the walls. The concrete
floors are bare.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional fallout is difficult, too.
</P>
<P>
   In more than one case in Druzhny, there have been distressing
family squabbles over budding love, a unique type of post-Soviet,
nuclear-age Romeo and Juliet story: He is from Belarus. She is from
Chernobyl. Their families are against the marriage and plagued by
questions of whether she can bear children, whether he will be
happy if she cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants a wife who already has had an operation and cannot
have children and will have to take drugs all her life?'' says
Butkovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   For her son Andrei, the prospects are dim. His health problems
forced him to abandon his studies for now. His job prospects are
dismal even with a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, there were plans to build a nuclear power plant next
to the town. The nuclear power plant never came, but neither did
the jobs it would have provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people had very good jobs and good salaries working at
Chernobyl and they wanted the money no matter what the risks,''
Butkovskaya says. ``But we live for our children and our
grandchildren. From my point of view, it would be better to light
candles and ride a horse than to live with the dangers and
psychological problems of living next to a nuclear power plant.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and why was Burma's name changed to Myanmar? Where does
the name come from? Can you provide some brief history, please?
</P>
<P>
   A: The governing regime adopted the name Union of Myanmar in
1989. Myanmar derives from the Chinese words mian (meaning strong)
and the suffix -ma (meaning honorable). Myanma was the country's
original name. And it also has been called by yet another name,
Pyidaungzu Myanma Naingngandaw.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the ancient Mon and Burman kingdoms, Myanmar was
officially called Burma during the British colonial period,
starting in 1886, at which time it was a province of India. In
1937, the British separated Burma from India. In 1941, during World
War II, the Japanese invaded Burma and occupied it until it was
liberated by Allied forces in 1945. Burma achieved independence
from the British in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian government was overthrown by a military coup in
1962, when a revolutionary council intent on creating a socialist
Burma was established. Long-simmering public dissatisfaction
erupted in 1987-88 into widespread antigovernment rioting that the
military eventually suppressed by force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can one write a letter of support to Kenneth Starr?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Kenneth Starr, Office of Independent Counsel,
1001 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Suite 490 North, Washington, DC 20004.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports continually say that Kenneth Starr's
investigation has cost more than $40 million. What is Starr's
salary?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Starr's Washington office says he is
paid on an hourly basis, based on an annual salary of $118,000. He
cannot make more than $118,000, a spokeswoman said, regardless of
the number of hours he puts in. He and his staff are paid by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Starr
reportedly also receives $1.1 million a year from his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed that there were no black soldiers in the movie
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Didn't black soldiers serve in integrated
units in World War II?
</P>
<P>
   A: Officially there were no integrated combat units in World War
II, although some noncombatant or support troops fought alongside
whites in, for example, the Battle of the Bulge. President Harry
Truman integrated the armed forces in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does devalued currency mean in terms of spending power
and in tourist dollars for a person visiting a country that has
devalued its currency? Has the U.S. ever devalued its currency?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally, if a foreign country's currency is pegged to the
U.S. dollar, you'd get more bang for your buck when it is devalued.
Travelers from the United States should have greater spending power
in that country. In the short term, travelers should realize
savings on most services, such as hotels, restaurants and possibly
air fares _ if the airline ticket is purchased overseas, that is.
And imports from that country also would be generally cheaper. And
no, the United States has never devalued the dollar, chiefly
because it is not pegged to any other country's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't something happen to the dollar during the
administration of President Richard Nixon that reduced its value
against foreign currencies? What was that, if it wasn't
devaluation?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Aug. 15, 1971, Nixon announced without warning an
immediate 90-day freeze on wages, rents and prices; and the end of
the traditional convertibility of the dollar into gold, in effect
freeing the dollar for devaluation against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon conceded that the dollar would float downward in value
against some currencies and that foreign goods and travel would
cost Americans more, but, ``laying to rest the bugaboo of what is
called devaluation . . . if you are among the overwhelming majority
of Americans who buy American-made products in America, your dollar
will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the ending of the dollar's convertibility into
gold was in effect a devaluation, Treasury Secretary John Connally
said, ``No, I would not use the word 'devalue,' simply because I
don't know what's going to happen. . . . For all I know, the dollar
may rise with respect to certain countries, it may go down in
relation to other currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a picture in the newspaper of President Clinton smoking
a cigar. Is the White House smoke-free?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the White House Comment Line: ``It's the
president's house, so he can smoke in his house _ but the White
House is smoke-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the government come forth with an official travel ban to
Kenya or Tanzania?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department has lifted the travel warning dated Aug.
7, when the U.S. embassies in those two African countries were
bombed by terrorists. But American citizens are still advised to
exercise caution while traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I send a manuscript to Steven Spielberg?
</P>
<P>
   A: DreamWorks, the Los Angeles entertainment company founded by
film director Spielberg, producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and music
producer David Geffen _ for copyright and other legal problems _
does not accept unsolicited manuscripts. But you could query
Spielberg's office beforehand. He can be reached at Amblin
Entertainment, 100 Universal City Plaza, 477; Universal City, CA
91608.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are there expiration dates on bottled water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sealed water, says Evian Natural Spring Water spokesman
Michael Neuwirth, is safe to drink indefinitely as long as it is
kept in a dry, cool place. Due to certain state requirements, Evian
elects to place an expiration and production date on its product.
Various state departments of health and other food and beverage
regulatory bodies impose different requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the tradition begin of playing bagpipes at police
memorial services and funerals? It's done all the time, including
last month at the Capitol Rotunda for the two officers who were
shot.
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of using bagpipes at the funerals of
firefighters and police officers began in the 19th century in
Northeast cities _ particularly in New York and Boston, where many
of the members came from the ranks of Irish and Scottish
immigrants. The use of bagpipes at funerals was a tradition in the
Scottish military. In America, the playing of bagpipes spread to
other cities and became standard even when the police officer or
firefighter was of Irish or Scottish descent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a person is elected to the House of Representatives for
one term, which is two years, or to the Senate for one term, which
is six years, and that's the only term they serve, are they
entitled to a pension?
</P>
<P>
   A: Senators and representatives, like other federal employees,
must serve a minimum of five years to become eligible for pension
benefits. For senators, one term would be enough. But
representatives wouldn't accrue five years' service until midway
through their third term.

HACKER STOLE THOUSANDS OF PASSWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HENRY K. LEE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a University of California at Berkeley
graduate student logged onto his computer, he made a startling
discovery: someone had cracked his password and was using his
account to run a program to get even more passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Using a program called ``John the Ripper'' that can be
downloaded from the Internet, the high-tech intruder had broken
into computer accounts not only at UC Berkeley but at universities
and companies around the world. The hacker had decoded nearly
48,000 passwords from a list of 186,000 encrypted ones _ in what
computer experts say is one of the largest known collections of
filched access codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just amazed by the sheer number of passwords he had,''
said Michael Kleber, the system administrator who spent several
weeks investigating the breach at Evans Hall, UC Berkeley's math
building.
</P>
<P>
   The June break-in, which is being investigated by the FBI,
underscores how easy it is for cyber prowlers with just basic
technical skills _ and plenty of time on their hands _ to penetrate
and manipulate computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   While the hacker apparently didn't seek out classified
information or break into government accounts, he or she was
decidedly hungry for more passwords, trotting the globe
electronically in a quest for greater access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology he was using is not sophisticated, but what's
interesting here is the scope,'' said Doug Tygar, a computer expert
at Carnegie Mellon University who will join the UC Berkeley faculty
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by his persistence to keep something running for
that long,'' Tygar said. ``The stamina to collect this number of
passwords is pretty awe-inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the hacker is operating from somewhere in
Europe because the computer systems that were first compromised
belonged to European universities.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the hacker broke into accounts at a noted Silicon
Valley company, an Internet service provider in Indiana, UC
Berkeley, UCLA, the California Institute of Technology, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.
Another 80 percent of the cracked passwords found at UC Berkeley
belong to accounts yet unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber said the intruder gained access to the Internet through
Telenordia, an Internet service provider in Sweden. The cyber
prowler left a computer trail through England, Denmark and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker wasn't detected until June 29 at UC Berkeley, where
Kleber was notified by the graduate student that his account had
been broken into.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber notified the FBI, and the agency's computer crime squad
in San Francisco is investigating, said spokesman George Grotz.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team,
or CERT, which monitors computer security violations nationwide,
publicized the breach on its Web site last month.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder had compiled a list of 186,126 accounts and
encrypted passwords _ most of which were non-UC Berkeley accounts _
and, at the time of Kleb-er's discovery, had decoded 47,642 of
those passwords, according to CERT.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber found that in some cases the intruder had installed
``trojans'' or ``back door'' entrances, allowing immediate re-entry
into the compromised systems.
</P>
<P>
   These were used with ``John the Ripper,'' the password-cracking
program, and ``packet sniffers,'' programs that intercept passwords
typed in by account users.
</P>
<P>
   Password-cracking programs are used legitimately by system
administrators to make sure user passwords can't be easily cracked.
Packet sniffers are key tools in diagnosing problems with slow
networks. But used nefariously by hackers, the programs actually
undermine the systems they were designed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of ways to take care of the vulnerabilities
that exist today,'' said John Vranesevich, founder of AntiOnline, a
computer security group. ``It's not that the hackers are using
methods that aren't known, but system administrators for the most
part haven't been putting a big enough emphasis on security.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts acknowledge that identifying the hacker will be
a difficult, if not impossible, task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without law enforcement help, it's pretty much slim-to-none,''
said UC Berkeley graduate student David Wagner, a founding member
of Internet Security, Applications, Authentication and
Cryptography, or ISAAC, a computer security research group on
campus. ``It's a matter of patience and luck and being able to
trace it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, ISAAC revealed a major security flaw in Netscape's Web
browser that could have allowed scofflaws to intercept bank account
and credit-card information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two other high-profile incidents have also renewed concerns
about computer security. In March, hackers attacked computers
nationwide running Microsoft network software at NASA, the Navy and
colleges including UC Berkeley. Last month, two Cloverdale
teenagers pleaded guilty to hacking into U.S. government computers.

<P>
   ARRAZOLA, Mexico _ He's the father of slithering serpents, giant
crabs, a ram with curled horns and sensual, almost human muscles.
</P>
<P>
   All his animals, says Claudio Ojeda, spring from the corners of
his mind and the chunks of wood his hands whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spontaneous,'' the Mexican wood carver and Zapotec Indian
insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Ojeda also admits he finds inspiration in the hallucinogenic
mushrooms some Indians in this southern Mexican state consume for
spiritual and curative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, friendly man who is proud of his craft and his
heritage, Ojeda is one of this village's most prosperous and
talented wood carvers.
</P>
<P>
   The village is Arrazola, and the state is Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka),
where Zapotec and other Mexican Indians still reign when it comes
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Arrazola
is home to a beloved Mexican craft: the production of
``animalitos,'' figures carved from the local copal tree and
painted in riotous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carving is a centuries' old tradition, but in recent years the
artisans of Arrazola have elevated the art to a globally-desired
commodity. Their figures are sought by buyers from Europe, Asia and
all over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most are small enough to fit on a shelf, but wild enough to
attract instant attention. Horses sprout wings, as if ready to take
flight. Dogs with florid coats throw back their heads and howl.
Rabbits play congas or blow trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The animals carved by Ojeda and painted by his wife, Teresa, are
noted for their large size -- some are two feet tall or wide -- and
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   When he began carving in earnest 10 years ago, Ojeda
experimented by fashioning one large animal instead of many small
ones. The piece sold quickly and fetched a high price. Now Ojeda
can show off a thick wad of business cards from international
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father carved, too,'' Ojeda said. ``But he couldn't even
eat from what he sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda has sold pieces to Disney World in Orlando, galleries in
Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, and diplomatic offices in
Texas. He's been asked to exhibit in Hong Kong and his pieces
decorate homes from New York to Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still raise some corn and beans. But we pretty much
dedicate ourselves to artisan work now,'' said Teresa Ojeda. As she
spoke, she was painstakingly decorating a large tortoise with three
frogs poised on its shell.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach Arrazola, you pass carts driven by oxen and
farmers carrying machetes. You begin to see signs in English and
Spanish inviting you into homes where the animals figures are
carved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a cluster of boys greets you at the edge of town,
offering to accompany you to a favorite carver's house for a few
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Arrazola's prosperity is striking. The roads are paved, the
houses sturdy, satellite dishes are perched on roofs to pick up
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Ojeda drives a pick-up and his home is equipped with a
shower and modern bathroom, startling amenities in an Indian
community.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ojedas' workshop remains a traditional family affair. In
a studio behind sliding glass doors, the couple invite customers in
to browse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smaller animals, which run under $10, the Ojedas' animals
don't come cheap. Most are the equivalent of $40 and up, sometimes
pushing into the hundreds. But that's a fraction of a U.S. gallery
price, and, by visiting, you get to see the full range of the
couple's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, a dragon sports a tail that has metamorphosed
into a snake. A crab with bulging eyes seems to scuttle across the
floor, unaware of the reptile perched on its back. Hippopotamuses,
lobsters, and all sorts of other creatures find their way out of
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Ojeda is from a village where the pre-Hispanic tradition
of hallucinogenic mushrooms is still revered. She and her husband
both say mushrooms have given them visions of animals and colors
leaping and fusing. Neither takes this tradition lightly, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a strong mind,'' Claudio said. ``But it's
something mystical. Scientists can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO VISIT: In Oaxaca city, hire a taxi, take a city bus or a
tour many hotels offer to Arrazola, where you can browse at the
Ojedas' on Emiliano Zapata Street, or, for smaller animals, at
other families' workshops.

<P>
   SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ A special place in the hills
here has been yielding light gray clay for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of San Bartolo Coyotepec, a village in Mexico's
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) state, still harvest it and shape it into bowls
and figurines -- much the same as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1953, the Zapotec Indians here have given their
pottery a different spin. That's when a tiny, wizened local potter
named Dona Rosa discovered that she could give the subdued black
color of her oven-baked pots a lustrous shine -- simply by rubbing
unfinished pieces with a quartz stone before their final firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved it. And today, thanks to Dona Rosa, people can
live from their art,'' says the now famous potter's son, Valente
Nieto Real, 70, whose family is among the top producers of Mexico's
popular ``black pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of black pottery is San Bartolo Coyotepec, and it is
seven miles south of the colonial city of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a well-known tourist destination, but it has
managed to retain its small-town character. The families who make
black pottery welcome visitors into their shops to browse and buy;
at Dona Rosa's workshop, her family also offers demonstrations
showing how they make their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of black pottery are often sold in Mexican art
galleries in the United States. But a visit to San Bartolo
Coyotepec, which is an easy drive down Oaxaca's Highway 175, offers
tourists from all over the world a chance to see and purchase
pieces hard to find abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents showed us where the clay is, and their parents
showed them,'' said Nieto Real, as he eagerly demonstrated how he
shapes clay into large round pots, pitchers, candlesticks and other
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pieces of black pottery are orbs with fluted edges,
and they range from a few inches to nearly two feet tall. Many of
them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

LAWYERS WHO'VE DEPOSED BILL GATES AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM ABATE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not many lawyers have deposed Bill Gates across a conference
table.
</P>
<P>
   I asked two members of this tiny club whether they would have
wanted the press and public watching their every move.
</P>
<P>
   Their split decision may help you decide whether allowing the
public to eavesdrop on the antitrust case against Microsoft will
advance the cause of justice or turn the whole affair into a
carnival.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco attorney Sam Miller, who spent two days
questioning Gates in the Justice Department's 1995 antitrust
investigation, said the presence of a peanut gallery would break
the magic spell that an interrogator seeks to cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this works is that you literally sit across the table
from the witness and look them in the eye,'' Miller said. ``You
want to develop a rapport that gets them to answer your
questions,'' even if that means disregarding the defense attorney
who sits beside witnesses, whispering into their ear.
</P>
<P>
   Of course witnesses like Gates aren't stupid. Interrogators
rarely elicit damaging admissions. But the more people in the room,
says Miller, the harder it is to weave that spell between subject
and interrogator that gets at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Chu, a managing partner at the Los Angeles law firm of
Irell &AMP; Manella, couldn't disagree more. Chu whipped Microsoft in
1994 _ and won a $120 million judgment _ when he convinced a jury
that Microsoft ripped off a patented process for doubling the
density of hard drives from Stac Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have mattered one whit whether or not there were
press present,'' said Chu, who deposed Gates privately before
questioning him on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Chu said his Gates deposition was so dull, he's sure
reporters won't get a whiff of drama _ until and unless the current
antitrust case goes to trial. That's when the trivial questions get
edited out, and Microsoft's powerful chairman will have to face the
issues that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was Gates on the stand?'' Chu said, posing then answering
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is without question very smart, but there were some in the
courtroom who felt he came across as arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is appealing the order to let the media hear the
depositions. Los Angeles media attorney Karen Frederiksen said
federal case law on the issue is so complex, Microsoft may yet keep
the Fourth Estate out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to know what the government attorney who will depose
Gates thinks about the press being there. My sources say that will
probably be Phillip Malone, who works in the antitrust division's
San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone and his San Francisco colleagues _ proteges all of
Marin antitrust lawyer Gary Spratling _ never leak, an ethical
standard that don't seem to inhibit the loose lips on special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's staff.
</P>
<P>
   So the only clue as to Malone's thinking comes from the fact
that the government did not oppose the motion by various media
organizations to let the public hear the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the ex-Justice leaguer now with Folger Levin &AMP; Kahn in
San Francisco, guessed that the government antitrust team may see a
tactical advantage in having the press around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defending lawyers typically do what they can to be disruptive,
and Microsoft's attorneys tend to be very aggressive,'' Miller
said. ``It might reduce the table-pounding if the newspapers were
in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tough guy: &LR;  I visited Lycos CEO Bob Davis in Mountain View
yesterday, where he was taking possession of his newest
acquisition, the WhoWhere Web site run by former Apple executive
Dale Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   In his very Boston accent, Davis argued that the $133 million
WhoWhere deal would propel his East Coast search engine past its
West Coast competitors like Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek and Inktomi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound arrogant but you can use it anyway,'' Davis
said. ``Excite and Infoseek just don't matter to me. I see
ourselves as overtaking Yahoo in a year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   He said WhoWhere would fuel that drive, because Fuller's
Mountain View outfit had signed up 1.3 million users to develop
personal Web pages. Davis thinks personal Web page publishing is
the next killer app on the Web. And Lycos owns not just WhoWhere
but Tripod, the other 800-pound gorilla of personal publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you get a different view from the local search
engines, who say Fuller shopped his property around and couldn't
get anybody to bid over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller joined us in WhoWhere's soundproof black conference room
to extol the virtues of the deal. In the process, he revealed how
the ambitions of former-DMG investment banker Frank Quattrone
indirectly led him to merge into Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said WhoWhere had been queued up for an IPO _ which would
have been handled by Quattrone's factotum, Bill Brady _ when the
DMG gang decided the investment-banking grass was greener over at
Credit Suisse First Boston side.
</P>
<P>
   Their abrupt defection delayed the IPO, and gave Fuller and
Davis a chance to renew some on-again, off-again talks that
resulted in the deal Fuller happily announced Tuesday.

   SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ A special place in the hills
here has been yielding light gray clay for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of San Bartolo Coyotepec, a village in Mexico's
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) state, still harvest it and shape it into bowls
and figurines -- much the same as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1953, the Zapotec Indians here have given their
pottery a different spin. That's when a tiny, wizened local potter
named Dona Rosa discovered that she could give the subdued black
color of her oven-baked pots a lustrous shine -- simply by rubbing
unfinished pieces with a quartz stone before their final firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved it. And today, thanks to Dona Rosa, people can
live from their art,'' says the now famous potter's son, Valente
Nieto Real, 70, whose family is among the top producers of Mexico's
popular ``black pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of black pottery is San Bartolo Coyotepec, and it is
seven miles south of the colonial city of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a well-known tourist destination, but it has
managed to retain its small-town character. The families who make
black pottery welcome visitors into their shops to browse and buy;
at Dona Rosa's workshop, her family also offers demonstrations
showing how they make their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of black pottery are often sold in Mexican art
galleries in the United States. But a visit to San Bartolo
Coyotepec, which is an easy drive down Oaxaca's Highway 175, offers
tourists from all over the world a chance to see and purchase
pieces hard to find abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents showed us where the clay is, and their parents
showed them,'' said Nieto Real, as he eagerly demonstrated how he
shapes clay into large round pots, pitchers, candlesticks and other
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pieces of black pottery are orbs with fluted edges,
and they range from a few inches to nearly two feet tall. Many of
them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

   ARRAZOLA, Mexico _ He's the father of slithering serpents, giant
crabs, a ram with curled horns and sensual, almost human muscles.
</P>
<P>
   All his animals, says Claudio Ojeda, spring from the corners of
his mind and the chunks of wood his hands whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spontaneous,'' the Mexican wood carver and Zapotec Indian
insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Ojeda also admits he finds inspiration in the hallucinogenic
mushrooms some Indians in this southern Mexican state consume for
spiritual and curative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, friendly man who is proud of his craft and his
heritage, Ojeda is one of this village's most prosperous and
talented wood carvers.
</P>
<P>
   The village is Arrazola, and the state is Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka),
where Zapotec and other Mexican Indians still reign when it comes
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Arrazola
is home to a beloved Mexican craft: the production of
``animalitos,'' figures carved from the local copal tree and
painted in riotous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carving is a centuries' old tradition, but in recent years the
artisans of Arrazola have elevated the art to a globally-desired
commodity. Their figures are sought by buyers from Europe, Asia and
all over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most are small enough to fit on a shelf, but wild enough to
attract instant attention. Horses sprout wings, as if ready to take
flight. Dogs with florid coats throw back their heads and howl.
Rabbits play congas or blow trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The animals carved by Ojeda and painted by his wife, Teresa, are
noted for their large size -- some are two feet tall or wide -- and
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   When he began carving in earnest 10 years ago, Ojeda
experimented by fashioning one large animal instead of many small
ones. The piece sold quickly and fetched a high price. Now Ojeda
can show off a thick wad of business cards from international
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father carved, too,'' Ojeda said. ``But he couldn't even
eat from what he sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda has sold pieces to Disney World in Orlando, galleries in
Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, and diplomatic offices in
Texas. He's been asked to exhibit in Hong Kong and his pieces
decorate homes from New York to Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still raise some corn and beans. But we pretty much
dedicate ourselves to artisan work now,'' said Teresa Ojeda. As she
spoke, she was painstakingly decorating a large tortoise with three
frogs poised on its shell.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach Arrazola, you pass carts driven by oxen and
farmers carrying machetes. You begin to see signs in English and
Spanish inviting you into homes where the animals figures are
carved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a cluster of boys greets you at the edge of town,
offering to accompany you to a favorite carver's house for a few
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Arrazola's prosperity is striking. The roads are paved, the
houses sturdy, satellite dishes are perched on roofs to pick up
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Ojeda drives a pick-up and his home is equipped with a
shower and modern bathroom, startling amenities in an Indian
community.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ojedas' workshop remains a traditional family affair. In
a studio behind sliding glass doors, the couple invite customers in
to browse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smaller animals, which run under $10, the Ojedas' animals
don't come cheap. Most are the equivalent of $40 and up, sometimes
pushing into the hundreds. But that's a fraction of a U.S. gallery
price, and, by visiting, you get to see the full range of the
couple's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, a dragon sports a tail that has metamorphosed
into a snake. A crab with bulging eyes seems to scuttle across the
floor, unaware of the reptile perched on its back. Hippopotamuses,
lobsters, and all sorts of other creatures find their way out of
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Ojeda is from a village where the pre-Hispanic tradition
of hallucinogenic mushrooms is still revered. She and her husband
both say mushrooms have given them visions of animals and colors
leaping and fusing. Neither takes this tradition lightly, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a strong mind,'' Claudio said. ``But it's
something mystical. Scientists can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO VISIT: In Oaxaca city, hire a taxi, take a city bus or a
tour many hotels offer to Arrazola, where you can browse at the
Ojedas' on Emiliano Zapata Street, or, for smaller animals, at
other families' workshops.

FOR IMAC USERS, A WAIT FOR THE BUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're one of the thousands planning to buy Apple Computer
Inc.'s new iMac this weekend, try not to be too disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, some of you will go home empty-handed, if the
early buzz is on the level. Apple says it's got 150,000 advance
orders already, and expects to have trouble meeting demand. But
even if you manage to get hold of an iMac, you'll have a problem
buying vital accessories like an external disk drive or a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Apple didn't include a floppy disk drive with the iMac, saying
that customers would buy external drives like the Iomega Zip
instead. But Iomega doesn't plan to have an iMac-compatible Zip
drive available until late this year. Hewlett-Packard Co. was
supposed to have an iMac printer ready to go. Not just yet, the
company told me on Tuesday, though you will be able to buy a $69
adapter that will let the iMac work with traditional printers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my penchant for sniping at Apple, I don't fault the
company for the accessories shortage. I blame the computer industry
for being so slow to take up the banner of USB.
</P>
<P>
   That's Universal Serial Bus to us English speakers. It's the
port and associated circuitry that connects an iMac to ``peripheral
devices'' like mice, printers, scanners and the like. Apple has
made much of its use of USB, but millions of PCs also have USB
ports in back. The technology has existed for years. Still, there
are few USB products for sale.
</P>
<P>
   This will soon change _ and about time too. Apple's iMac will
drive demand for USB devices. More important, Microsoft Corp. has
gotten religion. USB wouldn't work with earlier versions of
Windows. But later versions of Windows 95 include USB support; so
does every copy of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs USB? All of us, and badly. Today's computers are
saddled with outdated ways of linking to external devices. Consider
the serial ports used to hook up modems and mice. They can transmit
data no faster than 115,000 bits every second. That limits the
serial port to fairly low-speed tasks. Parallel ports are about
twice as fast, but still sluggish considering that the computer
flings around millions of bits each second.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got an Iomega Zip drive plugged into your computer's
parallel port, it runs at a fraction of its potential speed. You'd
get much better performance by installing an internal Zip drive,
linked directly to the computer's motherboard. Just rip open your
computer to install it. I bet you can hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   There are other drawbacks with our present ports. You have to
reboot the computer before it'll accept that new mouse or modem
you've plugged in. In addition, each port acceptsjust one device at
a time. You can't plug a mouse and modem into the same serial port,
for instance. And while I can run a printer and a Zip drive on a
single parallel port, I can't use them both at the same time. The
average machine has two serial ports and one parallel port. Use
them up, and you've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   USB is designed to fix all this. You can connect up to 127
devices to a single USB port. You can ``hot-swap'' USB devices,
plugging in new ones without having to reboot. And USB ports can
handle up to 12 million bits of data per second _ plenty fast
enough for external Zip drives.
</P>
<P>
   It's even fast enough for high-speed Internet devices. Order
cable modem service today, and a technician will install an
Ethernet card in your computer to handle the torrent of data. But
installing a next-generation cable modem will take about five
seconds _ you'll just plug it into the USB slot.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that USB appeals to Apple engineers. They've
long offered a less-advanced version of the same thing. The Apple
Desktop Bus lets you plug up to 16 devices into a single port. On
many models, you can plug the monitor into the computer's desktop
bus port. Then you plug the keyboard into a slot on the monitor,
and the mouse into a slot on the keyboard. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   USB will let PC users do the same, if the hardware ever shows
up. So far I've tested two USB devices. Both installed easily and
worked splendidly. Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet 4100C scanner will
sell for $199 when it lands on shelves this autumn. And you can
already buy the Logitech USB Wheel Mouse for around $40.
</P>
<P>
   But what about USB disk drives, monitors, modems? Just you wait.

INTEL PROMOTION STIRS ETHICAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Think the World Wide Web is slow? Intel Corp. is
paying mainstream Web publishers to make it even slower.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to sell more chips with more power, the Santa
Clara, Calif.-based computer chip maker is pumping money into a
program to entice _ some say pressure _ Web site creators to post
large, complicated graphics on their sites. Web content creators
are heeding the call.
</P>
<P>
   The program, dubbed ``Optimized Content,'' encourages Web sites
to use large, complicated graphics that slow down a computer's
processor when they are downloaded from the Internet. An
accompanying message informs a user that a faster, Pentium II
microprocessor would make those pictures run smoother and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Optimized Content is also another ember in the slow-burning
debate over the mixing of advertising and editorial content on Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're asking us to do is turn our sites into a
demonstration of their products,'' said Peter Horan, a senior vice
president of Boston-based IDG, publisher of computer magazines like
Computerworld and PC World, the ``for Dummies'' how-to book series
and their related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to optimize our content for our readers, not for
Intel,'' Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, formally called ``Intel Inside Optimized Content,''
subsidizes advertising on sites that post large, complicated
pictures and special effects. According to Intel, the program is
designed to encourage Web sites to design content that ``on a
faster processor provides a perceivable benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Maat, manager of Intel's ``Intel Inside'' program, said
the company is not interested in controlling a site's content.
``We'd be a lot smoother if we were going to do that,'' she said,
adding that the program is meant to seduce a user into buying a
faster processor.
</P>
<P>
   Intel normally reimburses PC makers 50 percent of their
Web-based advertising costs when they use the ``Intel Inside'' logo
on Web-based ads. Under the Optimized Content program, Intel kicks
in 75 percent of a PC maker's ad costs if the Web site features
complicated graphics. The qualifying sites have to contain wording
that says a Web page is better viewed with Intel's faster Pentium
II-equipped machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of an incentive,'' said one Web editor who asked
not to be named. ``PC companies are going to advertise on sites
where they pay only 25 percent of the costs, as opposed to sites
where they have to pay for half of the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, launched last September, was updated July 15. The
program has been embraced by many of the giant Web publishing
concerns, including Wired Digital, Ziff-Davis, C/Ne, and CMP Media.
Web sites that use the program say it's simply a way to help
introduce cutting-edge technology to Web users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never, absolutely never, compromise our editorial
integrity,'' said Dan Farber, vice president and editor-in-chief of
ZDNet, the on-line presence of Ziff-Davis publications. ``The whole
basis of our success is the quality and respect of our journalistic
ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber said Ziff-Davis joined the Intel program after creating
an elaborate three-dimensional site map for the ZDNet Web site.
Farber points out that there is a simpler site map available for
users and that no other pages in the ZDNet Web site are optimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that that particular site map qualifies us for
the program,'' Farber said. ``No content is being altered for it.
No user is being forced to have their experience of ZDNet slowed
down. This whole thing has been blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Andrew De Vries, spokesman for Wired Digital, said the
Intel program was used briefly last year, but a major Wired Digital
site, fully qualified under the Intel program, is slated to unwrap
soon.
</P>
<P>
   `Generally, we design content that's good for our readers,'' De
Vries said, ``but we also keep advertiser considerations in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Horan said the seduction of ad dollars can cloud editorial
judgment at Web sites.``They don't view it as a conflict,'' he
said, ``but IDG does. How much of a site is inconsequential? Either
you cross that line or you don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the inaugural issue of the media watchdog magazine Brill's
Content, Web sites, especially the giant portal pages of Yahoo and
Excite, were criticized for failing to indicate which advertisers
paid to be designated as recommended links.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has raised eyebrows when it began a smart Web search
feature that automatically recommends sites to users that in some
cases and without notice are financial partners of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things start small,'' Horan said, ``but they grow. We
have to start openly discussing them before it ruins the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a discussion that could happen sooner rather than later.
According to Ad Age magazine, Intel devotes an estimated $7.5
million to subsidized Web site advertising. Maat said 60 percent of
subsidized Web advertising goes to optimized Web sites.

GEOCITIES AGREES TO FTC STRICTURES ON INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to protect the privacy of Internet users, the
Federal Trade Commission has approved a consent decree with the
Internet-hosting company GeoCities. The decree settles an FTC
complaint alleging that GeoCities misused personal information
obtained from the company's two million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``GeoCities misled its customers, both children and adults, by
not telling the truth about how it was using their personal
information,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection. But GeoCities denies any wrongdoing, and
the decree does not constitute an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC action comes two days after GeoCities went public on the
Nasdaq stock exchange. Shares of GeoCities fell $7 to $38 1/2
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities is based in Santa Monica, Calif. The company runs an
Internet ``community'' where members create their own Web sites in
``neighborhoods'' shared by members with similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   CMG Information Services Inc. of Andover, Mass. owns 31 percent
of GeoCities. Guy Bradley, a partner in CMG's Internet investment
unit, said that the company had been caught up in the growing
controversy over the use of personal information gathered from the
Internet. ``Basically, GeoCities wasn't doing anything wrong, but
the FTC was looking around for somebody to make an example of,''
said Bradley. ``It feels a little like a storm in a tea cup.''
</P>
<P>
   CMG invests in several leading Internet companies, such as Lycos
Inc., an Internet search service used daily by millions of people.
Bradley said that CMG's control over these firms' privacy policies
varied by the size of CMG's investment in the companies. But, he
added, ``in all the companies I'm involved with, we try to avoid
doing anything which results in personal information being given
out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not how the FTC saw things. GeoCities collects personal
information about people who sign up for Web sites. According to
the FTC, GeoCities broke a pledge to share the information only
with advertisers selected by the member. In addition, GeoCities
provided outside marketing firms with such information as members'
marital status and education, though the company had promised that
such information would be released only with a customer's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also charged that GeoCities set up a children's Internet
club, which collected personal information about children. The
agency says that GeoCities concealed its ownership of the club, and
the fact that it was compiling information about the children who
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, GeoCities will promise not to engage in
these practices. In addition, the company will post a privacy
policy statement telling how it uses the information it collects.
GeoCities will also have to get parental consent before requesting
information from a child. The company will delete its database of
information about children, and give adults the option of having
their information deleted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, praised the FTC action. But Rotenberg did not
think the agency went far enough, because GeoCities is free to sell
information about users, as long as users are notified.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg favors federal legislation limiting the corporate use
of information gathered at Web sites. Otherwise, said Rotenberg,
``You're going to have to read each privacy policy at each Web site
to decide whether or not it works for you.''

COLD COMFORT FOR COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have heard that computers need to operate in
a rather cool room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cold Front
</P>
<P>
   DEAR COLD: Nonsense. If that were true, then mine would have
refused to operate long ago, what with all the black-light posters,
the beads and the waterbed.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to talk temperature, that's a very different
matter. Generally speaking, if you're comfortable in the room, your
computer will be, too. If you haven't already thrown it out, your
owner's manual should give you the exact temperature range. For
example, my Pentium does best somewhere between 50 and 95 degrees
and can be stored anywhere between 40-below and 149 without any
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me. If you're working in sub-50 conditions, you'll
probably do more damage trying to type with mittens on. Or, as I
said during last winter's cold snap, kkjdwp dm my ownegh thingz,
you know?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Open a Word document and type the sentence
``I'd like to kill Bill Gates.'' Highlight the entire sentence and
start up the thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lots of Time to Kill
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOTS: Yeah, looks like those merry pranksters in the
programming department pulled an all-nighter. Microsoft is
legendary for those sorts of ``Easter eggs,'' little jokes and
surprises tucked away deep in the bowels of otherwise stuffy,
businesslike applications, but they're not the only ones who do it.
It's just a natural way for programmers to rebel against being
chained to their cubicles for weeks before a product launches.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody has other stupid software tricks, send them in and
share them with the rest of the world, or at least the 15 or 16
people who read this column. We could all use a laugh, especially
with this Spice Girls breakup thing still so fresh in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, ``I'd like to see Bill Gates naked'' will produce
exactly the same result as that other sentence, although in the
history of mankind, this is the first time that phrase has ever
been used.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When we start our computer, Windows 95 asks for
a password, which we use to prevent others from using it. If we
click the Cancel button, though, it starts up without any problem.
What is happening?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lock and Key
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOCK: Using a Windows password may make you feel all secure
and James Bond-ish, but it really doesn't do any good unless you
tell your computer it has multiple users with different privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Passwords in the Control Panel, then select the User
Profiles tab. Click on the second radio button, which allows
different users to customize their settings. Make sure you also
check the boxes that include desktop icons, Network Neighborhood
contents, the Start menu and program groups in the settings. Now
restart and log in using your password.
</P>
<P>
   When everything is set up the way you like, go to the Shutdown
menu and restart. This time, hit Cancel instead of entering a
password. You'll get the same desktop as you would with your
password; however, now you can start deleting shortcuts and
Programs menu entries, restricting access to your sensitive stuff.
Any time somebody hits Cancel from now on, they get the
plain-vanilla desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Windows was made to be friendly, not airtight.
Somebody who knows what they're doing can still get in. Your best
bet is to find some shareware that does a better of job of keeping
Windows shut or to use your computer's power-on password, if it has
one. -

AFTER BUYING A COMPUTER, KEEP A 30-DAY PRICE WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you've shopped around for that big-ticket home computer and
paid the money for it, or bought a new toy to hook up to one, or
have finally gotten a laptop with a screen larger than a postcard.
You bought it at the lowest price.
</P>
<P>
   Friend, your shopping trip is not over.
</P>
<P>
   You may still have 30 days left from the day of your purchase to
continue shopping for a lower price. And if you don't keep checking
prices, you could wind up paying more - possibly several hundreds
of dollars more - than you might have.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, my wallet is thicker with more than $300 worth of
20s and 50s, simply because I took the time to keep reading the
advertisements after I made my purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Big chains make the pledge that if the price drops within 30
days of your purchase, you can present the receipt of your
purchase. If you find it advertised at a lower price, bring the
competitor's ad in with the receipt. If it's in stock, you can have
the price difference refunded - and in some cases, 10 percent of
the difference to boot for your time.
</P>
<P>
   When a Toshiba Satellite 335CDS laptop was advertised for $2,000
(minus a penny to make it look less expensive), it was a drop in
the previous $2,200 asked for the machine. It was a good price for
a lot of computer.
</P>
<P>
   A Toshiba 2055CD Satellite laptop had served me well for several
years, but with only 12 megabytes of memory and a smallish hard
drive, it was unable to handle some of the tasks I wanted it to do.
</P>
<P>
   The 335CDS is a great little computer: Pentium 266 megaHertz; a
12.1-inch screen with vivid colors; 4.1 gigabyte hard drive; 56K
modem on a PCMCIA card; and a built-in CD and floppy drive. I've
come to like the feel of the Toshiba keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The 335CDS, like the old laptop, has a cursor control that
sticks up from the middle of the keyboard. It looks something like
an eraser head on a pencil, and it works well enough. I had
expected I would have plugged in a regular mouse to use instead,
but the arrangement worked so well for me that I never bothered.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I finally decided to buy the laptop. Office Depot
had it at the same price as everybody else: $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the purchase, while looking through the computer
ads, there was the 335CDS in a competitor's ad: ``Price break!
$1,700.'' (That wasn't the exact price, but what's another penny
among friends?)
</P>
<P>
   Yep. By the time I got to the store, I didn't need the
advertisement from the competition to prove my point. Office Depot
had received notice from Toshiba of the price reduction and
refunded the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a friend of mine was telling me about a laptop
he'd just purchased. A Toshiba, with a 266-based Pentium processor.
He'd bought it at Circuit City about three or four weeks before and
paid $2,000 for it. I told him he'd better hurry back to Circuit
City and get his $300 back.
</P>
<P>
   He was unaware of the price reduction. He went to the store that
afternoon to ask about it. He got his money, but if he'd waited two
more days, he would have been past the 30-day ``we'll meet any
lower price'' guarantee offered by Computer City.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, this is the third or fourth time that I've
managed to recoup part of the purchase price of a computer or
related item through a price reduction. I've missed getting a
rebate on some items because the price dropped 40 or 50 days after
I made a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   (A friend of mine and I have a theory that manufacturers wait
until they receive our warranty cards in the mail, then at least 31
days later, drop the price of the item we purchased.) The $300
windfall was the biggest yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding money'' like that isn't likely with any other consumer
product outside the computer industry. Everyday appliances like
washers and large refrigerators aren't in a highly competitive
market. Smaller electronic items like scanners and CD-ROM drives
don't have a lot of room to make price drops of hundreds of
dollars, although nobody will turn down getting a $10 or $20 bill
back should the price go lower.
</P>
<P>
   But desktop and laptop computers are becoming the hand-held
calculators of the 1970s: more powerful, smaller, faster and
cheaper. Prices are tumbling, partly because the strong U.S. dollar
affects the cost of products made overseas and partly because of
rapid reductions in the cost of components (random-access memory is
but a fraction of its cost a year or so ago).
</P>
<P>
   So don't stop shopping after the purchase is made. Take the
receipt, put it in a safe place, and mark the date 30 days away
from the date of the purchase on the calendar to return to the
store to check the price. During that period, watch the ads for the
same product.
</P>
<P>
   It's advice that pays off. In this most recent case, let me
count the ways - all 300 of them.
</P>

Honoring the geniuses that got it all started 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us now remember famous men, those stalwarts of old
who made computers what they are, or perhaps what they are not,
today.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is George Morrow. Chairman George, as he was known,
was once the Bill Gates of the computer industry back in the days
when Bill Gates was still filing his teeth into points and getting
MS-DOS ready to take over the world.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Bill didn't have to push Chairman George off
the top of the mountain; George fell off by himself.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose George Morrow is my favorite because I owned one of
his computers, a Morrow Micro Decision. Morrow computers were based
on the CP/M operating system. CP/M stood for Control
Program/Monitor, but it might better have been called Control
Program/From Hell. It made MS-DOS look like Ned in the First
Reader.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drives were in their infancy in those days; almost no one
had one. If I remember right, adding a 10-megabyte hard drive to a
system would kick the cost up by several thousand dollars. Instead,
you had a floppy drive into which you inserted a 200k disk, and
held onto your hat as the 4 (that's right, four) MHz microprocessor
screamed up to full speed. CP/M allowed no graphics, and would look
at no more than 64k of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he cast his fortune with this obviously doomed
operating system, Morrow was considered a great leader and man of
deep insight. If his choice of operating systems is not enough to
give you an idea of his insight, perhaps his final word on Local
Area Networks will be an indication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best LAN,'' Chairman George decided, ``is a guy walking
down the hall with a floppy disk in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a little red book called ``The Sayings of Chairman
George'' became a fairly hot item in the fledgling industry, Morrow
and his computer company faded rapidly from view. The last move I
can recall Morrow making was the dismantling of his customer
support operation on the simple, and probably accurate, theory that
his customers were too expensive to support.
</P>
<P>
   Other great names in computing actually predated the industry,
which may be why they remain great names.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, George Boole. Boole was an English mathematician
150 years ago who invented a kind of algebra that deals in logic
rather than in mathematics, which of course puts him right in the
philosophical lineage of George Morrow _ mathless math.
</P>
<P>
   Boole's concept was based on the simple idea that propositions
are either true or false _ no maybes _ and relationships between
these two variables can be expressed with ``operators'' such as
AND, OR and NOT.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see how Boole was really a programmer in search of a
computer, and his entire system fit perfectly into the demands of
digital computing, which deals in ones and zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   And finally we have another Briton, Alan Turing, inventor of the
Turing machine and the Turing test. The Turing machine, which he
proposed in 1936 (I am unsure whether one was actually made) was a
logical device that would scan a tape, one square at a time. The
square could contain a symbol, or it could be blank, and based on
the contents of each square the machine would make some limited
response.
</P>
<P>
   Turing's test is much more interesting, since we have yet to put
it to practical use. It is intended to reveal the point at which we
have invented an intelligent machine, and it is quite simple. It
involves one person asking a series of questions of two entities
he/she cannot see _ another person and a computer. When the time
comes that the interrogator can no longer tell which is which, we
have an intelligent machine.
</P>
<P>
   I have just one reservation about the Turing test. Who picks the
human respondent?

NetW(at)tch: Online bookstore designed to cater to college crowd 
By Frances Katz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For many students, August is the cruelest month.
There's the fun of enjoying the last remaining days of summer _ but
you know school is looming right around the corner. For students
with PCs and laptops filled with bookmarks for the Lillith Fair,
``The X-Files'' and ``South Park,'' it might be time to add a few
Web sites to your list that might actually help you once you're off
the beach and back at the books.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tuition, textbooks are probably the college student's
biggest course-related expenditure. Seasoned students know the ins
and outs of the used textbook market, but it might be worth paying
an online visit to VarsityBooks.com (http://www.varsitybooks.com),
an online bookstore specializing in textbooks, textbooks and more
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   While VarsityBooks claims to offer discounts of 15 percent to 40
percent off prices at the campus bookstore, that's just a bonus
compared with the real advantage of avoiding the endless lines.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Maryland, the University of
Virginia, Georgetown University, George Washington University and
George Mason University have the extra bonus of being able to
search for textbooks by course and even by professor, but students
in other parts of the country can look up books by title, author,
keyword or ISBN number. The search engine is a little quirky, but
if you know what you want, you can probably find it here. Express
shipping is also offered, and even though the toolbar doesn't list
English or Literature text, a search for titles in both Victorian
and modern literature turned up a wealth of key titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elements of Style'' is a slim grammar handbook written by
William Strunk Jr. with a forward by noted writer E.B. White.
There's hardly an English teacher in the country who doesn't begin
the semester by waving a copy of this book in the air and
encouraging every student to get a copy. And as English language
reference books go, it really is one of the best around, and you
really should have a hard copy sitting on your bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are in the middle of cranking out a history
paper at 1 a.m., you can save some time by checking out Stunk and
White's rules of grammar on the Web at
http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis
</P>
<P>
   /bartleby/strunk. Maintained by Columbia University, this clean,
smooth, easy-to-navigate site explains the English language clearly
to even the most linguistically challenged. As Martha Stewart might
say, it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   While sites like Yahoo! and AltaVista will help you search for
almost anything your heart desires, a more student-oriented portal
is My Virtual Reference Desk (http://www.refdesk.com). The site is
an excellent Web pit stop for students, with links to news wires
(for current events and sports scores), magazines ranging from
Scientific American to Rolling Stone and a reference list that just
boggles the mind. Want an atlas? You'll find one here. Looking for
a law dictionary? Not a problem. Want to send away for some free
software? You can do that here, too. My Virtual Reference Desk is
organized Yahoo! style and is pretty easy to navigate. The
combination of educational and reference links with sites that are
just plain fun make it a worthwhile bookmark for anyone's list.

Windows 98 imperfect, but you can do a few things to make it
better 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's start by agreeing that Windows 98 is not as good
as it could be. But danged little is.
</P>
<P>
   If I insisted on pure excellence in my life, I'd have to stop
eating in the cafeteria here at work, would give my golf clubs away
and would never again sing in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   And Windows 98, despite its quirks and problems, is better than
earlier versions and one heck of a lot better than cafeteria
Salisbury steak. So instead of sulking, let's spend today talking
about some of the ways you can get the most performance out of
Windows 98. The good news is there are simple ways you can improve
the speed and reliability of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The first item is the only one on my list that costs money, but
it's probably the best way to get more out of Windows 98: Add more
RAM. If you now have 16 megabytes or less, you'll get a noticeable
performance increase.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend I upgraded a friend's machine by adding 32
megabytes of RAM. I didn't shop around to get the best price, and
yet I paid just $60 for two 16-megabyte chips. Installing them
amounted to poking the chips into two vacant slots. After five
minutes' work, the computer was noticeably faster.
</P>
<P>
   For most home users, 64 megabytes is about all the RAM needed.
There are some speed increases after that, but if you were graphing
the improvement, the slope would level off dramatically there.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have that much RAM, there's a second adjustment you
should make. Double-click on the System icon in the Control Panel,
select the tab labeled Performance, and then select File System
under Advanced Settings. Take a look at the box that says: Typical
Role of This Computer. Yours probably says ``Desktop Computer.'' If
you have 64 megabytes or more of memory, change that setting to
``Network Server.'' Without going into a long explanation, that
setting will help your PC use that new memory most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Next, let's remove a Windows 98 feature that slows your computer
down. Right-click on a blank space on your computer desktop. Then
take a look at the item called Active Desktop. If there's a check
box by the item labeled View as Web Page, then click to remove the
check mark. Now click on the desktop again and select the tab
called Web. Click on the Folder Options button. You'll be asked if
you want to save the settings and view Folder Options; click on
Yes. Now you'll see three choices for the way folders are
displayed. Select ``Classic Style.''
</P>
<P>
   What you've just accomplished is to remove the much-touted
Windows feature of navigating the program in the same way you
navigate the Web. That feature works just fine but _ when all is
said and done _ isn't all that helpful and slows most computers
down dramatically. Since it's easy to switch back and forth, at
least give both methods a try and decide for yourself. It's my
guess you'll end up deciding you like the speed gain of removing
the Web-like navigation. After all, you probably spent $2,000 or so
for that fast computer. It seems dumb to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   Next make sure you've switched your hard disk to the new FAT32
system. You can check by selecting Drive Converter (FAT32) from the
System Tools group under the Start button. If the disk has already
been converted, you'll get a message that tells you that. If it
hasn't been converted, do so. Once you've done that, make sure to
run the Disk Defragmenter program at least once a week. Unlike
earlier versions of the defrag program, this one has enough
built-in intelligence to arrange your programs on the hard disk so
the ones you use most frequently load faster.
</P>
<P>
   These tune-up steps won't make Windows 98 into a perfect
program. But they will give it the opportunity to run as fast as
possible on your machine.

Skillful use of search engines eases your quest 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The real miracle of the Internet's World Wide Web is
that _ with so much information squirreled away in so many
different Web sites _ we find anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the mission of the search engine. It's the
cyber-equivalent of a research librarian that takes your request to
find _ for instance _ some information on kidney transplants for
cats and then bustles around the Web and comes back with
recommended sites.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines generally work fine when you are looking for the
obvious. No matter how you search, or which engine you use, you
won't have much problem finding Web sites that contain information
about cats or medicine or even transplants. The real trouble starts
when you're looking for something very specific or a topic that is
a bit obscure.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to approach a search like the one we're using
as an example. You can take the shotgun approach and use one of the
excellent services that combine a multitude of search engines. That
way you can simply type in your search and _ in seconds _ see the
results of the search from a variety of search engines. You'll wade
through a lot of Web sites that way, and chances are many of them
will be way off the mark, but some helpful sites are likely to be
found as well.
</P>
<P>
   My two favorites, when it comes to this type of search engine,
are Dogpile at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.dogpile/index.html and the All-in-One Search Page at
http://www.albany.net
</P>
<P>
   /allinone/all1www.html. Let's take a quick look at each service.
</P>
<P>
   Dogpile can be set to search the Web, Usenet newsgroups, FTP
(file transfer protocol) sites that often contain software you can
download, business news sites and news wires. That covers a
staggering amount of cyber-territory. A complete listing of the
sites searched would fill this column with no room for commas, but
it includes Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, AltaVista, WebCrawler, DejaNews,
Agence France, Business Wire, UPI and Infoseek NewsWires.
</P>
<P>
   Since the search is so broad, you're likely to wade through a
lot of material that has nothing obvious to do with your search
topic. However, that can be interesting, too, since you're likely
to find some nifty new Web sites in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-One Search Page works a little differently. Instead
of using all the search engines simultaneously, it simply puts most
of the common ones (and several that aren't so common) all on one
page. This site is an excellent one to bookmark, since almost any
search you can imagine can be accomplished from here.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the page is that there are some
special-purpose search engines here you may never have encountered.
Again, there are way too many to list, but here's a partial
listing: Lowest Price Search, an engine that browses the Web for
the best prices on everything from toys to hardware; 411 Locate,
which helps you find e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and Web
sites; Ahoy!, an engine that finds personal Web pages; eBlast, the
Encyclopaedia Britannica's Internet guide; EuroSeek, which searches
European Web sites; GovBot, a database of government and military
Web sites; and YPN _ Your Personal Network, which searches more
than 30,000 reviews of Internet service providers and Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget the many specialized search engines
devoted to a single topic. Since there seem to be as many of these
search engines as there are hobbies and interests, they can't be
listed here. Finding them is fairly easy, however. Just use one of
the general-purpose search engines and include the name of the
topic along with search words such as ``search'' and ``engine'' and
``online,'' and you're likely to hit pay dirt.

Tech Report: With help from computer, Lego robots leap to life 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many products that had their beginnings in the
low-tech days when vacuum tubes ruled have withstood the test of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most successful have been Lego plastic building
bricks. They've been around in their present form since 1958, and
kids have spent hours having fun with them without realizing they
were learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Group began dabbling with computer-controlled products
in 1986 in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and the latest creation to spring from that fertile
alliance blends old and new into a cutting-edge toy that will usher
children _ and a lot of adults _ into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, which should hit
store shelves in the fall and retail for about $200, lets kids 11
and up design and program real robots that can move, think and act
on their own. Gort, the blank-faced metal man in the 1950s sci-fi
classic ``The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' would approve.
</P>
<P>
   The brain is the RCX, a microcomputer that can be programmed
with a PC. The RCX's sensors gather input from its environment,
processes it and signals small motors to turn on and off.
</P>
<P>
   Users build their robot with the RCX, Constructopedia guide and
700 Lego pieces included. Next, they create a program using RCX
code, a simple but powerful programming language. The program is
downloaded to the RCX with a special infrared transmitter that
comes with the kit. The robot then can interact with the
environment, independent from the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Children can build a working robot in under an hour, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming out in the fall are three expansion sets for the
RCX. The Extreme Creatures set lets kids build virtually any
animal, real or fantasized. Included are fiber-optic strands, a
snapping claw, a working pincer and a tail-wagging mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   With the Robo-Sports set, the robots can shoot hoops, flick
pucks or negotiate an obstacle course. The Exploration Mars set
lets young explorers build a Mars rover and control it from their
own PC.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion sets will retail for $50. Each has its own
Constructopedia building guide and a CD-ROM with 12 challenges.
More challenges can be found at the Mindstorms Web site,
http://www.legomindstorms.com. The CDs are for Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   A little something for your pocket
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. has come out with a new personal
organizer that will store a megabyte of data in a 5-ounce package
small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-sized SE-300 includes software and a docking station
that allows for two-way transfer of information from a desktop
computer. The software is set up to work with Microsoft's Outlook
97, ACT 3.07 and Lotus Organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The device has a backlit LCD display screen and an infrared port
to exchange data with other Sharp products or the infrared port on
a notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   The unit runs for 60 hours on one AA battery. Retail price is
$180.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that!
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. has joined forces with the magicians at
Walt Disney World in Orlando, providing hardware for DisneyQuest,
an interactive entertainment experience that opened in June.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computing power is concentrated in the ``Create
Zone,'' where kids of any age can combine their own imaginations
with Disney characters to create unique images and animation and
even become a part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   While in the ``Create Zone,'' visitors can learn the secrets of
animation, create a toy to take home, get a virtual makeover in the
Magic Mirror or create a painting on a Living Easel.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq provided workstations, PCs, servers and flat-panel
monitors to help fun seekers turn fantasy into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Seek and ye shall find
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a treasure trove of useful and useless
information, but finding the nugget you want in a pile of fool's
gold can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   A search string that isn't specific enough can turn up hundreds
of categories and thousands of Web sites that have irrelevancy in
common.
</P>
<P>
   A new search engine, GoTo.com, aims to streamline the process by
getting back to basics. There are no ad banners on the home page,
letting the page build quicker. Or a user can add the search string
right after the ``www'' in the engine's address and go immediately
on the search results page.
</P>
<P>
   Give the engine a try at http://www.goto.com. Maybe you'll
strike it rich.

BEHIND THE HIGH-TECH PUBLIC RELATIONS GAME AT ORACLE  
 TOM ABATE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind every great tech company stands a public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle Corp. caused quite a stir in local PR circles last week,
when it abruptly replaced a PR firm it had just hired, Avalanche,
with its former agency, Applied Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche was the new kid on the PR block. It had only been
formed in January, when Palo Alto-based Cunningham Communications
teamed up with Hill &AMP; Knowlton and Ogilvy, Adams &AMP; Rinehart to take
on Oracle's multimillion-dollar account.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create one PR firm with global and local
high-tech savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche had stepped into this demanding role after Oracle
forced Applied to compete for the PR contract it had held for the
five previous years _ a period during which Applied helped get
Oracle beaucoup coverage of the Network Computer, which never took
off.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons glossed over in the official release, Oracle
decided last week that Applied, not Avalanche, had the right stuff
to lead its global PR effort.
</P>
<P>
   PR pros weren't surprised that Avalanche fell, because no one in
the biz had ever tried what it set out to do _ fuse three different
companies into one firm. Nor did it help that this novel alliance
would be working for Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were bets on the street how long Avalanche was going to
last,'' said one PR insider. ``Everyone on the street knows Oracle
is the client from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hodskins, the Cunningham exec who led Avalanche, said her
firm resigned the account after Oracle replaced former marketing
chief Karen White _ who signed the Avalanche deal _ with Gary
Bloom, who brought Applied back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management we were working with changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle spokesman Kevin McGuirk demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had nothing to do with management changes,'' he said.
``After six months of trying to make this happen, we had to get a
different agency in there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; PR Postscript: &LR;  There's no such thing as losing in the PR biz
these days. Every PR firm in the region is turning business away,
as the Bay Area's 3,000 to 5,000 PR pros try to keep up with the
demand for hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an unemployed high-tech PR person,''
said Barry Shulman, who runs a recruitment firm in Mill Valley that
bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wanna work at home? No problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two- and three-year`seasoned' people _ and I use the
termadvisedly _ who are billing $100 to $150 an hour for elementary
work,'' like cold-calling reporters in search of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Didja realize? &LR;  In doing a recent column item on IBM, I asked
for a local head count. IBM spokesman Dave Berman said IBM employs
8,600 people in the Bay Area, with the largest chunk at the
disk-drive division in San Jose and two nearby research outposts.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Big Blue a larger local payroll than Intel, Silicon
Graphics, Apple or Chevron, according to The Chronicle 500, a list
of the Bay Area's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Mudfest: &LR;  Berkeley-based Net Studio has found four computer
industry notables to judge its recently announced Mud Brick
contest, which will reward the ugliest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will announce today that ugly is in the eye of these
beholders: New York industry analyst Esther Dyson, San Mateo
newsletter editor David Coursey, Bay Area radio and television
personality John C. Dvorak and humor columnist Lincoln Spector.
There's still time to nominate a site for the Mud Brick award
before losers are announced in September.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ If I were Bill and if the Republicans
want details, I'd give them lots. Sort of like this, ``Well, Monica
was at the bookstore and along with an embossed leather and
parchment copy of the poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she got
a Best Parts Version of the Kama Sutra. We started with `Crane
Walks on Misty Lake,' which begins with the woman putting her left
foot on your forehead and ends with the walking part, which is
pretty tough if you're 52. I really started thinking I was doing
the wrong thing morally at Chapter 72, `Muskrat in Bamboo Grove.'

</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Texas is drawing raves nationally for dealing
with intractable academic deficiencies using a content-linked
measuring device and insisting on accountability. The credit is
deserved. But when content and accountability are affixed so
tightly to the basics, students who already have a handle on those
basics are fixed in place, brain cells frying in the deep fat of
boredom. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ Yes, there's going to be a wedding with all the

the president would be to make him wear a pair of huge barbecue

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and why was Burma's name changed to Myanmar? Where does
the name come from? Can you provide some brief history, please?
</P>
<P>
   A: The governing regime adopted the name Union of Myanmar in
1989. Myanmar derives from the Chinese words mian (meaning strong)
and the suffix -ma (meaning honorable). Myanma was the country's
original name. And it also has been called by yet another name,
Pyidaungzu Myanma Naingngandaw.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the ancient Mon and Burman kingdoms, Myanmar was
officially called Burma during the British colonial period,
starting in 1886, at which time it was a province of India. In
1937, the British separated Burma from India. In 1941, during World
War II, the Japanese invaded Burma and occupied it until it was
liberated by Allied forces in 1945. Burma achieved independence
from the British in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian government was overthrown by a military coup in
1962, when a revolutionary council intent on creating a socialist
Burma was established. Long-simmering public dissatisfaction
erupted in 1987-88 into widespread antigovernment rioting that the
military eventually suppressed by force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can one write a letter of support to Kenneth Starr?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Kenneth Starr, Office of Independent Counsel,
1001 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Suite 490 North, Washington, DC 20004.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports continually say that Kenneth Starr's
investigation has cost more than $40 million. What is Starr's
salary?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Starr's Washington office says he is
paid on an hourly basis, based on an annual salary of $118,000. He
cannot make more than $118,000, a spokeswoman said, regardless of
the number of hours he puts in. He and his staff are paid by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Starr
reportedly also receives $1.1 million a year from his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed that there were no black soldiers in the movie
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Didn't black soldiers serve in integrated
units in World War II?
</P>
<P>
   A: Officially there were no integrated combat units in World War
II, although some noncombatant or support troops fought alongside
whites in, for example, the Battle of the Bulge. President Harry
Truman integrated the armed forces in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does devalued currency mean in terms of spending power
and in tourist dollars for a person visiting a country that has
devalued its currency? Has the U.S. ever devalued its currency?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally, if a foreign country's currency is pegged to the
U.S. dollar, you'd get more bang for your buck when it is devalued.
Travelers from the United States should have greater spending power
in that country. In the short term, travelers should realize
savings on most services, such as hotels, restaurants and possibly
air fares _ if the airline ticket is purchased overseas, that is.
And imports from that country also would be generally cheaper. And
no, the United States has never devalued the dollar, chiefly
because it is not pegged to any other country's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't something happen to the dollar during the
administration of President Richard Nixon that reduced its value
against foreign currencies? What was that, if it wasn't
devaluation?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Aug. 15, 1971, Nixon announced without warning an
immediate 90-day freeze on wages, rents and prices; and the end of
the traditional convertibility of the dollar into gold, in effect
freeing the dollar for devaluation against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon conceded that the dollar would float downward in value
against some currencies and that foreign goods and travel would
cost Americans more, but, ``laying to rest the bugaboo of what is
called devaluation . . . if you are among the overwhelming majority
of Americans who buy American-made products in America, your dollar
will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the ending of the dollar's convertibility into
gold was in effect a devaluation, Treasury Secretary John Connally
said, ``No, I would not use the word 'devalue,' simply because I
don't know what's going to happen. . . . For all I know, the dollar
may rise with respect to certain countries, it may go down in
relation to other currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a picture in the newspaper of President Clinton smoking
a cigar. Is the White House smoke-free?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the White House Comment Line: ``It's the
president's house, so he can smoke in his house _ but the White
House is smoke-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the government come forth with an official travel ban to
Kenya or Tanzania?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department has lifted the travel warning dated Aug.
7, when the U.S. embassies in those two African countries were
bombed by terrorists. But American citizens are still advised to
exercise caution while traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I send a manuscript to Steven Spielberg?
</P>
<P>
   A: DreamWorks, the Los Angeles entertainment company founded by
film director Spielberg, producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and music
producer David Geffen _ for copyright and other legal problems _
does not accept unsolicited manuscripts. But you could query
Spielberg's office beforehand. He can be reached at Amblin
Entertainment, 100 Universal City Plaza, 477; Universal City, CA
91608.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are there expiration dates on bottled water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sealed water, says Evian Natural Spring Water spokesman
Michael Neuwirth, is safe to drink indefinitely as long as it is
kept in a dry, cool place. Due to certain state requirements, Evian
elects to place an expiration and production date on its product.
Various state departments of health and other food and beverage
regulatory bodies impose different requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the tradition begin of playing bagpipes at police
memorial services and funerals? It's done all the time, including
last month at the Capitol Rotunda for the two officers who were
shot.
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of using bagpipes at the funerals of
firefighters and police officers began in the 19th century in
Northeast cities _ particularly in New York and Boston, where many
of the members came from the ranks of Irish and Scottish
immigrants. The use of bagpipes at funerals was a tradition in the
Scottish military. In America, the playing of bagpipes spread to
other cities and became standard even when the police officer or
firefighter was of Irish or Scottish descent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a person is elected to the House of Representatives for
one term, which is two years, or to the Senate for one term, which
is six years, and that's the only term they serve, are they
entitled to a pension?
</P>
<P>
   A: Senators and representatives, like other federal employees,
must serve a minimum of five years to become eligible for pension
benefits. For senators, one term would be enough. But
representatives wouldn't accrue five years' service until midway
through their third term.

   UNDATED: Q: If a person is elected to the House of
Representatives for one term, which is two years, or to the Senate
for one term, which is six years, and that's the only term they
serve, are they entitled to a pension?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``D'' in D-Day stand for? How was the name
chosen?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several explanations, but according to the Web site
of the U.S. Army's Center of Military History _
http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/faq/ddaydef.htm _ the term ``D-day'' is
used for the day which a combat attack or operation is to be
initiated. It designates the day of the operation when the actual
day has not yet been determined or where secrecy is essential. The
letter is derived from the word for which it stands: ``D,'' day of
the invasion. D-day for the invasion of Normandy was set for June
6, 1944, and that date has been popularly referred to ever since by
the short title D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that white welfare recipients are
leaving the rolls faster than blacks or Hispanics. Rather than
listing numbers, can you list percentages of the people in the
various racial categories who are on welfare?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here the most recent figures on welfare clients from the
Department of Health and Human Services. The numbers are from June
1997, the most recent national data: 34.5 percent white, 37.3
percent black, 22.5 percent Hispanic, 3.3 percent Asian, 1.3
percent Native American, 1.1 percent other.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the FBI investigating the embassy bombings in Africa?
Why not the CIA?
</P>
<P>
   A: The FBI has primary jurisdiction for investigating domestic
and international terrorism. Whenever a U.S. citizen is killed as a
result of terrorism, the FBI has the authority to investigate it.
But it would be incorrect to assume that the CIA is not involved.
The CIA and State Department also would take part in the
investigation, said Celestine Armstead, spokeswoman for the Atlanta
division of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton had changed his mind and refused to
testify before Kenneth Starr's grand jury, would he have been
subject to imprisonment like Susan McDougal?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is no. The reason is that to grant indictment
authority to the judicial branch would be to place that arm of
government above the executive branch, which the Constitution
explicity does not do. In fact, it would have been very difficult
for Clinton to back out. Starr, the independent counsel, subpoenaed
Clinton last month to appear before the grand jury. The Supreme
Court has never decided whether a president could be compelled to
respond to a subpoena, leaving that question open.
</P>
<P>
   The point of Clinton's testimony was to avoid a constitutional
clash over precisely that question. In return for Clinton's promise
to testify, Starr withdrew his subpoena. If Clinton had backed out,
Starr certainly could have reissued the subpoena, and Clinton would
then have had the option of responding to it or challenging it
before the Supreme Court. If he lost and still refused, he could
not be jailed for contempt, but he could be impeached. The House
would vote on whether to impeach, and the Senate would try the
impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which presidents appointed the current U.S. Supreme Court
members?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chief Justice William Rehnquist was appointed by Richard
Nixon in 1972. Gerald Ford appointed Justice John Paul Stevens in
1975. Ronald Reagan's appointments to the court are Sandra Day
O'Connor in 1981, Antonin Scalia in 1986 and Anthony Kennedy in
1988. George Bush appointed David Souter 1990 and Clarence Thomas
in 1991. President Clinton has made two appointments to the court:
Ruth Bader Ginsberg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the members of a federal grand jury chosen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Members of a federal grand jury are chosen randomly from the
voter registration lists of the federal judicial district in which
they live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about Judy Smith, Monica Lewinsky's
spokeswoman?
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith was hired as the Lewinsky family spokesperson in May. A
veteran media relations specialist, Smith was President George
Bush's deputy press secretary and runs her own media relations and
public relations firm in New York. Smith also was deputy director
of public information and associate counsel in the office of
Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Portugal involved in talks on the fate of East Timor?
Didn't the Portuguese leave East Timor after a revolt in 1974?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Portuguese colonized East Timor in 1520, and, while there
were subsequent colonization attempts by the Spanish, Dutch and
British, Portuguese rule was affirmed by treaties in 1860 and 1893.
The Japanese occupied the territory in World War II, but it was
returned to Portugal after the war. After Portugal announced its
intention to decolonize East Timor in the 1970s, a civil war broke
out in the territory. Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed East
Timor the following year. That annexation has not been recognized
by the United Nations, which still officially regards Portugal as
the territory's ``administering power.'' The U.N. has sponsored
talks between Lisbon and Jakarta since 1983 aimed at finding an
internationally acceptable solution to East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in the scene where they were on a
bridge at the end of the movie, what did Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks)
say to Ryan (Matt Damon). It was unintelligible, but I'm sure it
was important.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hanks said to Damon: ``Earn this.'' In other words, be a good
person and live a good life so all these people who died trying to
save you won't have died in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems like hurricanes in the Atlantic are getting a late
start this year. What is the latest date that the first hurricane
formed in the Atlantic, and what is the latest date the last one
formed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although hurricane season officially begins June 1 and ends
Nov. 30, storms can form before and after this period. According to
the National Hurricane Center in Miami, the earliest storm ever
recorded in the Atlantic was on March 7, 1908; the latest ever
observed was on Dec. 31, 1954. Neither storm hit the U.S. mainland.
The earliest storm to hit the mainland was Hurricane Allison, which
struck Florida's Panhandle on June 5, 1995. The latest was an
unnamed storm that struck on Nov. 30, 1925. Prior to 1950, storms
were not given names, but were tracked by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Buddy, the golden retriever used in ``Air
Bud''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Buddy developed cancer shortly after the filming of ``Air
Bud'' was completed last year. His right rear leg was amputated,
and he died in February. Six dogs were used in the filming of the
sequel, ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: IF SOFTWARE CODE IS KEPT SECRET, SECURITY IS AT 
RISK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade secrets of commercial software vendors are threatening
the security of the global Internet _ and that threat extends to
the future of electronic commerce as well.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the conclusion that most people would have reached
over the last two weeks as significant security flaws were
disclosed in several popular e-mail packages, including Eudora,
Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most of the focus was on how users could get their
hands on patches, the additional bits of software code that would
spackle over the holes in their vulnerable e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, network security experts are adamant that the roots
of the problem are fundamental and widespread. They think that the
Internet's structure as it exists today _ the open, freely
available Internet protocols, with overly bulky and/or proprietary
software running atop them _ is impossible to secure, because only
the software vendors know what is in their code.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the recently exposed e-mail flaw that would enable an
intruder to send an electronic message containing a program
intended to damage or steal data. How could a company release
software that would allow such a thing to happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is these gigantic, 10-megabyte Web browsers,''
said Mark Seiden, chief network consultant for Veriguard Inc., a
computer-security concern in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Nobody knows what
flaws are in them. Nobody even knows, really, everything that they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, we install them without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or worse,'' Seiden said, ``you have no choice but to install
them because, in the case of Internet Explorer, they're part of the
operating system. Then there are all the things which are part of
Windows which haven't been looked at, with an eye toward security,
by anybody other than the vendor.''
</P>
<P>
   Any software company that develops software for Windows, for
example, has to trust whatever security defaults Microsoft has
chosen to use, yet ``the developers have no idea what's in them,''
Seiden said. ``There's no way to find out the Windows source
code.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, the same was true of Netscape. But
earlier this year, Netscape published its source code to encourage
its use by third-party software developers. Apparently developers
have not had sufficient time to discover all its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   What this means in the end is that the network infrastructure
created by popular Web browsers from Netscape Communications Corp.
and Microsoft Corp. _ and from the scores of other companies that
produce software to work with them _ has not been subjected to the
same rigorous peer review that went into the design of Internet
protocols, the rules that are continually scrutinized by some of
the world's best software engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Seiden said, there is always the possibility,
however remote, that ``any of the stuff that's on your desktop can
be gotten to by hostile programs.''
</P>
<P>
   For today's online consumers, that means exposing bank accounts,
password files _ anything that is in a file on a hard drive
connected to the Internet. But for companies conducting business on
the Internet, that means exposing trade secrets, intellectual
property, product designs, customer databases, marketing strategies
and more.
</P>
<P>
   Seiden recommends encrypting sensitive information on a
vulnerable machine, preferably by using code embedded on a computer
chip, rather than encryption software.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a company follows that recommendation, the incentive
to steal corporate data appears to be increasing at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1997 Global Information Security Survey,
conducted by Ernst &AMP; Young in conjunction with Information Week
magazine, 38 percent of respondents in the United States said their
networks had been compromised for purposes of industrial espionage,
up from 6 percent in 1996. Those reporting malicious acts by
outsiders increased to 42 percent in 1997 from 17 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no known instance of any intruder actually
exploiting the e-mail security flaws disclosed this month, this
increasing vulnerability alarms security experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate espionage is the fastest-growing sector of the
computer crime business,'' said Thomas Noonan, chairman and chief
executive of Internet Security Systems, an Atlanta-based supplier
of security management systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flaws in the infrastructure are inevitable, a fact of life,''
Noonan said. ``But if electronic commerce is about the ability to
trade ubiquitously in all corners of the globe, one of the huge
challenges for business is how to protect the security and
integrity of my information, which is now the basis of my
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan, whose clients include some of the world's largest
companies, says corporate information officers realize that
commercial software is ``the source of their vulnerabilities.'' But
though they spend millions of dollars on software every year,
``they feel their hands are tied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that unless these vendors provide their
customers with a much higher level of comfort for managing security
risks, then a lot less software will be sold, and electronic
commerce will gain a lot less traction than it could have,'' Noonan
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Noonan is right, the industry's very tentative steps toward
open source code _ a la Netscape and the Linux version of the Unix
operating system _ become even more attractive. When a program's
code is open to inspection by everyone, bugs are fixed and quality
improves much more quickly because an entire industry of engineers
is working on them at once.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day the software industry will have to embrace the
truth of the old Psychology 101 adage: You're only as sick as your
secrets.

 &HT;    Lunchbox Letters: Pack sandwich, apple, chips and mug, and one
more thing: a long-distance hug
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From first grade until graduation day, Courtney Garton always
managed to slip in the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Usually somewhere between the sandwich and chips.
</P>
<P>
   His daughters, Adrienne and Cara, got used to finding the notes
that Garton would compose as he got them ready for school.
</P>
<P>
   Half-asleep at 6 a.m., he would put ballpoint pen to napkin as a
small way of reminding them that he cared. As a divorced parent, he
couldn't be with them as much as he hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Cara, now 25, gave her dad a shoebox full of
the lunch-bag notes and said he should make them into a book.
</P>
<P>
   He did _ after 99 rejections from publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But Garton made it big when he got on Oprah. How? By sending her
a blue Mickey Mouse lunchbox with the book, a granola bar and a
napkin poem inside.
</P>
<P>
   It went like this:
</P>
<P>
   My book's enclosed for you to see.
</P>
<P>
   After reading it, I hope you'll agree
</P>
<P>
   That it invokes spirit _ not ennui.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it'll make you jump with glee,
</P>
<P>
   Or laugh out loud _ hee hee.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, the key
</P>
<P>
   Would be
</P>
<P>
   A good on-air review, Ms. Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Now Napkins: Lunch Bag Notes From Dad is in its third printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of giving advice without giving advice,'' Garton
says from his home in Annapolis, Md. ``Face it, kids don't like
lectures.''
</P>
<P>
   So he used a few lines of shaky rhyme to talk about anything:
boys, cars, money, friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his daughters' friends caught on and would make the
girls read the notes aloud at the lunch table. Adrienne and Cara
ended up peeking in their bags beforehand for embarrassing ones.

   ``I'm not a poet by any means,'' author Courtney Garton says.
Here, his recommendations for the rhymingly challenged:
</P>
<P>
   1. Take five to 10 minutes of quiet time to think.
</P>
<P>
   2. Use a scrap piece of paper for brainstorming.
</P>
<P>
   3. Think of something happening in the life of your child, maybe
something that you want to talk about but need to break the ice a
little first _ ``Cars, sex, drugs, rock-and-roll, tattoos, body
piercings, whatever!'' Garton says.
</P>
<P>
   4. Think of key words, then go through the alphabet for words
that would both rhyme and make sense.
</P>
<P>
   5. Scribble down what comes off the top of your head. Chances
are, that will be the best way to say it.

 20-COX &HT;    Love story close enough to perfect
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She fell for him a year ago Thanksgiving. He came to her door,
late, carrying Budweiser and champagne. ``He's got the best
stories,'' she enthuses. ``He's so full of life and I was just in
heaven.'' That was in November.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he met her dad and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he met her sister and her brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he met her mother and her oldest nephew.
</P>
<P>
   In September, they're getting married.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's going to be a wedding with all the trimmings. The
table arrangements. The old railroad lanterns that are being
rewired and used for lights. The tiny bottles of bubbles. The
carefully stenciled terra cotta pots with the pink impatiens
inside. It's all going to come together Labor Day weekend, God
willing. And it appears He is. For this is a match we thought might
never happen.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't there when my friend Peggy met her Harry. Even if I had
been, I doubt they would have noticed. But I think theirs might be
the best love story I've heard in quite a while. She's 41; he's 42.
Neither has been married. There's no ex-wife, no children visiting
just on the weekends, no big alimony payments. All the baggage is
theirs, just theirs.
</P>
<P>
   They fell for each other on the lonely beaches of the U.S.
Virgin Islands. That's where she moved a year ago May. She'd had it
with the busy corporate life in St. Paul, Minn. So she chucked the
nice paycheck and sold the house in the city and the cabin on the
lake. She stared confidently at the 401(k) balance, packed the cat
and the dog and shipped her life to St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The view from her house on the cliff was beautiful, but, my, how
she missed her sister and her mother and her nephews. My, she was
lonely.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Harry met Peggy. ``I really had kind of given up
hope,'' she says now.
</P>
<P>
   But, there he came on Thanksgiving day, cocktails in hand. He
was wearing a grin as big as hers. ``I'll tell you something about
Harry,'' her father's wife said after they'd met him for the first
time. ``He's always going to fish, and he's always going to work
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And that made Peggy smile even more.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, their story isn't perfect. What love story is?
The first time Peggy told Harry she loved him, there was dead
silence. Oh great, she thought. But then, the very next day, Harry
piped up and said he loved her too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sound sad,'' she told him. ``This is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' said Harry, who proposed a few weeks later. Then
he bought his bride-to-be a diamond-studded toe ring, all of which
is wonderful proof positive dreams really can come true. Even when
you're staring at 41 and have pretty much given up hope.
</P>
<P>
   So tonight, when your kids are whining about school and you have
to remind your husband to take the garbage to the curb and your
feet hurt and your back aches and the bills need to be paid, go
ahead and grab a smile off Peggy and Harry's almost-perfect little
love story. They won't mind. And remember, what they don't know
can't hurt them.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and why was Burma's name changed to Myanmar? Where does
the name come from? Can you provide some brief history, please?
</P>
<P>
   A: The governing regime adopted the name Union of Myanmar in
1989. Myanmar derives from the Chinese words mian (meaning strong)
and the suffix -ma (meaning honorable). Myanma was the country's
original name. And it also has been called by yet another name,
Pyidaungzu Myanma Naingngandaw.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the ancient Mon and Burman kingdoms, Myanmar was
officially called Burma during the British colonial period,
starting in 1886, at which time it was a province of India. In
1937, the British separated Burma from India. In 1941, during World
War II, the Japanese invaded Burma and occupied it until it was
liberated by Allied forces in 1945. Burma achieved independence
from the British in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian government was overthrown by a military coup in
1962, when a revolutionary council intent on creating a socialist
Burma was established. Long-simmering public dissatisfaction
erupted in 1987-88 into widespread antigovernment rioting that the
military eventually suppressed by force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can one write a letter of support to Kenneth Starr?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Kenneth Starr, Office of Independent Counsel,
1001 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Suite 490 North, Washington, DC 20004.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports continually say that Kenneth Starr's
investigation has cost more than $40 million. What is Starr's
salary?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported previously, Starr's Washington office says he is
paid on an hourly basis, based on an annual salary of $118,000. He
cannot make more than $118,000, a spokeswoman said, regardless of
the number of hours he puts in. He and his staff are paid by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Starr
reportedly also receives $1.1 million a year from his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed that there were no black soldiers in the movie
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Didn't black soldiers serve in integrated
units in World War II?
</P>
<P>
   A: Officially there were no integrated combat units in World War
II, although some noncombatant or support troops fought alongside
whites in, for example, the Battle of the Bulge. President Harry
Truman integrated the armed forces in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does devalued currency mean in terms of spending power
and in tourist dollars for a person visiting a country that has
devalued its currency? Has the U.S. ever devalued its currency?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally, if a foreign country's currency is pegged to the
U.S. dollar, you'd get more bang for your buck when it is devalued.
Travelers from the United States should have greater spending power
in that country. In the short term, travelers should realize
savings on most services, such as hotels, restaurants and possibly
air fares _ if the airline ticket is purchased overseas, that is.
And imports from that country also would be generally cheaper. And
no, the United States has never devalued the dollar, chiefly
because it is not pegged to any other country's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't something happen to the dollar during the
administration of President Richard Nixon that reduced its value
against foreign currencies? What was that, if it wasn't
devaluation?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Aug. 15, 1971, Nixon announced without warning an
immediate 90-day freeze on wages, rents and prices; and the end of
the traditional convertibility of the dollar into gold, in effect
freeing the dollar for devaluation against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon conceded that the dollar would float downward in value
against some currencies and that foreign goods and travel would
cost Americans more, but, ``laying to rest the bugaboo of what is
called devaluation . . . if you are among the overwhelming majority
of Americans who buy American-made products in America, your dollar
will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the ending of the dollar's convertibility into
gold was in effect a devaluation, Treasury Secretary John Connally
said, ``No, I would not use the word 'devalue,' simply because I
don't know what's going to happen. . . . For all I know, the dollar
may rise with respect to certain countries, it may go down in
relation to other currencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a picture in the newspaper of President Clinton smoking
a cigar. Is the White House smoke-free?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the White House Comment Line: ``It's the
president's house, so he can smoke in his house _ but the White
House is smoke-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the government come forth with an official travel ban to
Kenya or Tanzania?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department has lifted the travel warning dated Aug.
7, when the U.S. embassies in those two African countries were
bombed by terrorists. But American citizens are still advised to
exercise caution while traveling there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I send a manuscript to Steven Spielberg?
</P>
<P>
   A: DreamWorks, the Los Angeles entertainment company founded by
film director Spielberg, producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and music
producer David Geffen _ for copyright and other legal problems _
does not accept unsolicited manuscripts. But you could query
Spielberg's office beforehand. He can be reached at Amblin
Entertainment, 100 Universal City Plaza, 477; Universal City, CA
91608.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are there expiration dates on bottled water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sealed water, says Evian Natural Spring Water spokesman
Michael Neuwirth, is safe to drink indefinitely as long as it is
kept in a dry, cool place. Due to certain state requirements, Evian
elects to place an expiration and production date on its product.
Various state departments of health and other food and beverage
regulatory bodies impose different requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the tradition begin of playing bagpipes at police
memorial services and funerals? It's done all the time, including
last month at the Capitol Rotunda for the two officers who were
shot.
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of using bagpipes at the funerals of
firefighters and police officers began in the 19th century in
Northeast cities _ particularly in New York and Boston, where many
of the members came from the ranks of Irish and Scottish
immigrants. The use of bagpipes at funerals was a tradition in the
Scottish military. In America, the playing of bagpipes spread to
other cities and became standard even when the police officer or
firefighter was of Irish or Scottish descent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a person is elected to the House of Representatives for
one term, which is two years, or to the Senate for one term, which
is six years, and that's the only term they serve, are they
entitled to a pension?
</P>
<P>
   A: Senators and representatives, like other federal employees,
must serve a minimum of five years to become eligible for pension
benefits. For senators, one term would be enough. But
representatives wouldn't accrue five years' service until midway
through their third term.

   UNDATED: Q: If a person is elected to the House of
Representatives for one term, which is two years, or to the Senate
for one term, which is six years, and that's the only term they
serve, are they entitled to a pension?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``D'' in D-Day stand for? How was the name
chosen?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several explanations, but according to the Web site
of the U.S. Army's Center of Military History _
http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/faq/ddaydef.htm _ the term ``D-day'' is
used for the day which a combat attack or operation is to be
initiated. It designates the day of the operation when the actual
day has not yet been determined or where secrecy is essential. The
letter is derived from the word for which it stands: ``D,'' day of
the invasion. D-day for the invasion of Normandy was set for June
6, 1944, and that date has been popularly referred to ever since by
the short title D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that white welfare recipients are
leaving the rolls faster than blacks or Hispanics. Rather than
listing numbers, can you list percentages of the people in the
various racial categories who are on welfare?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here the most recent figures on welfare clients from the
Department of Health and Human Services. The numbers are from June
1997, the most recent national data: 34.5 percent white, 37.3
percent black, 22.5 percent Hispanic, 3.3 percent Asian, 1.3
percent Native American, 1.1 percent other.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the FBI investigating the embassy bombings in Africa?
Why not the CIA?
</P>
<P>
   A: The FBI has primary jurisdiction for investigating domestic
and international terrorism. Whenever a U.S. citizen is killed as a
result of terrorism, the FBI has the authority to investigate it.
But it would be incorrect to assume that the CIA is not involved.
The CIA and State Department also would take part in the
investigation, said Celestine Armstead, spokeswoman for the Atlanta
division of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If President Clinton had changed his mind and refused to
testify before Kenneth Starr's grand jury, would he have been
subject to imprisonment like Susan McDougal?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is no. The reason is that to grant indictment
authority to the judicial branch would be to place that arm of
government above the executive branch, which the Constitution
explicity does not do. In fact, it would have been very difficult
for Clinton to back out. Starr, the independent counsel, subpoenaed
Clinton last month to appear before the grand jury. The Supreme
Court has never decided whether a president could be compelled to
respond to a subpoena, leaving that question open.
</P>
<P>
   The point of Clinton's testimony was to avoid a constitutional
clash over precisely that question. In return for Clinton's promise
to testify, Starr withdrew his subpoena. If Clinton had backed out,
Starr certainly could have reissued the subpoena, and Clinton would
then have had the option of responding to it or challenging it
before the Supreme Court. If he lost and still refused, he could
not be jailed for contempt, but he could be impeached. The House
would vote on whether to impeach, and the Senate would try the
impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which presidents appointed the current U.S. Supreme Court
members?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chief Justice William Rehnquist was appointed by Richard
Nixon in 1972. Gerald Ford appointed Justice John Paul Stevens in
1975. Ronald Reagan's appointments to the court are Sandra Day
O'Connor in 1981, Antonin Scalia in 1986 and Anthony Kennedy in
1988. George Bush appointed David Souter 1990 and Clarence Thomas
in 1991. President Clinton has made two appointments to the court:
Ruth Bader Ginsberg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the members of a federal grand jury chosen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Members of a federal grand jury are chosen randomly from the
voter registration lists of the federal judicial district in which
they live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about Judy Smith, Monica Lewinsky's
spokeswoman?
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith was hired as the Lewinsky family spokesperson in May. A
veteran media relations specialist, Smith was President George
Bush's deputy press secretary and runs her own media relations and
public relations firm in New York. Smith also was deputy director
of public information and associate counsel in the office of
Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Portugal involved in talks on the fate of East Timor?
Didn't the Portuguese leave East Timor after a revolt in 1974?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Portuguese colonized East Timor in 1520, and, while there
were subsequent colonization attempts by the Spanish, Dutch and
British, Portuguese rule was affirmed by treaties in 1860 and 1893.
The Japanese occupied the territory in World War II, but it was
returned to Portugal after the war. After Portugal announced its
intention to decolonize East Timor in the 1970s, a civil war broke
out in the territory. Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed East
Timor the following year. That annexation has not been recognized
by the United Nations, which still officially regards Portugal as
the territory's ``administering power.'' The U.N. has sponsored
talks between Lisbon and Jakarta since 1983 aimed at finding an
internationally acceptable solution to East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in the scene where they were on a
bridge at the end of the movie, what did Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks)
say to Ryan (Matt Damon). It was unintelligible, but I'm sure it
was important.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hanks said to Damon: ``Earn this.'' In other words, be a good
person and live a good life so all these people who died trying to
save you won't have died in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems like hurricanes in the Atlantic are getting a late
start this year. What is the latest date that the first hurricane
formed in the Atlantic, and what is the latest date the last one
formed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although hurricane season officially begins June 1 and ends
Nov. 30, storms can form before and after this period. According to
the National Hurricane Center in Miami, the earliest storm ever
recorded in the Atlantic was on March 7, 1908; the latest ever
observed was on Dec. 31, 1954. Neither storm hit the U.S. mainland.
The earliest storm to hit the mainland was Hurricane Allison, which
struck Florida's Panhandle on June 5, 1995. The latest was an
unnamed storm that struck on Nov. 30, 1925. Prior to 1950, storms
were not given names, but were tracked by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Buddy, the golden retriever used in ``Air
Bud''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Buddy developed cancer shortly after the filming of ``Air
Bud'' was completed last year. His right rear leg was amputated,
and he died in February. Six dogs were used in the filming of the
sequel, ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver.''

 &HT;    Yes, that's Santa at the mall
 &HT;    By Ricardo Ga(accent)ndara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It just doesn't seem right, this
battery-operated, hip-swaying Santa Claus belting out ``Jingle Bell
Rock.'' On a department store shelf. In sweltering August.
</P>
<P>
   He's cute, but Santa already? What's next? A stuffed Cupid on a
heart-shaped box of chocolates?
</P>
<P>
   Foley's $50 ``Jingle Bell Rock Santa'' hits shoppers like a
sackful of toys when they get off the escalator on the third floor
in the Highland Mall store in Austin. There's Santa singing and
singing and singing, juiced on an Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Applegate, 36, couldn't believe it. He walked by, shook his
head and motioned toward Santa as if to slap him. ``No, not you.
You're way too early, Santa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea turned him off, he said, but he stopped anyway to check
the price. ``I was curious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Children, of course, are drawn to the display like ornaments to
a tree. A little girl cooed: ``Santa, Daddy, Santa. Look.'' Dad
rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Elise de Compiegne, Foley's representative, understands the
ambivalence of some customers. ``We're mindful it's 100 degrees and
it's back-to-school. However, there is no denying that Christmas is
the most popular season of the year, and some people do think about
and plan for Christmas year-round,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's employees at the Highland Mall store report the musical
Santa is singing his way into shopping bags. They've restocked the
display. And $12 stuffed elves, reindeer, snowmen, mice and
soldiers are also selling at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   We're not done.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, Foley's trim-a-home department will begin to
look a lot like Christmas, too, starting to sell decorations,
cards, wreaths and garland.

   WEST PALM, Fla. _ The Sun-Sentinel Co. of Fort Lauderdale
recently said it will buy the South Florida Newspaper Network, a
chain of weekly papers that circulate from Miami to Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not reveal the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Sentinel Co. President Bob Gremillion said the purchase
helps speed the company's growth, expands the number of potential
readers and advertisers, and provides a new place to promote its
newspaper and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umbrella company wants to find a way to service as many
readers and advertisers as possible,'' he said. ``This is great.
There's not huge duplication here.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Newspaper Network, based in Deerfield Beach,
publishes 33 free community papers with a total circulation of
700,000. Publications include the Jewish Journal, Boca Thursday,
the Boynton Beach Times, and the Forum papers in Greenacres,
Wellington and the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper network, with revenue of about $30 million, also
publishes magazines including Traditions, which circulates at The
Breakers hotel in Palm Beach, and House &AMP; Condo.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun-Sentinel Co., owned by public company the Tribune Co.
(NYSE: TRB, $66.75), publishes the daily newspaper of the same name
in Fort Lauderdale, with circulation of 260,000 daily and 370,000
on Sunday in June. It also has on-line operations and publications
such as South Florida Parenting magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase extends the reach of the Sun-Sentinel general
audience newspapers into the Treasure Coast from its circulation in
Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally delighted to have the Sun Sentinel Co. as our
parent,'' said Bruce Warshal, chief executive officer of the weekly
chain. ``It's a substantial and well-respected company.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshal and Chief Operating Officer Scott Patterson will
continue to run the chain as a separate business from the Sentinel
Co. Warshal said Sentinel employee benefits will not even be
adopted by the South Florida Newspaper Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep them on board,'' said Gremillion. who is also
publisher of the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. ``This isn't one of those
scenarios where they get bumped off later.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men had minority stakes in the chain with majority owner
Riverside Co., but will have no ownership interest under the
Sentinel deal. They will be employees of the Sentinel Co., Warshal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would reveal how much the deal was worth or whether they
were paid in cash or stock.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Kohl of Riverside, who was chairman of the South Florida
Newspaper Network, was unavailable for comment Tuesday. Riverside
Co. was the majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   No changes are expected for the 350 staffers at the South
Florida Newspaper Network. The chain also will also keep the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our community papers will get a little better,'' Warshal
said, however. ``Our profits were going to interest payments to the
bank. Now we can take that money and invest in better equipment and
be a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, he said, ``we really anticipate running the same
way, lean and mean. We don't intend to bloat our staff, nor do we
intend to lay anyone off.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also said the editorial voice will be independent
from the Sun-Sentinel. ``We will continue our focus and be a very
local source for news and advertising,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which Gremillion expects will be completed by the end
of September, is subject to approval by the Federal Trade
Commission, but no challenges are anticipated by Warshal or
Gremillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Journal includes six newspapers in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Newspaper Network's Palm Beach and Treasure
Coast papers are: the Jewish Journals, the West Boca Times, Boca
Thursday, The Boynton Beach Times, the Vero Beach Forum, The Martin
County Forum, the Port St. Lucie Forums, the Fort Pierce Forum, the
Wellington/Royal Palm Beach Forum, Greenacres/Lake Worth/Lantana
Forum, the Boynton Beach Times, the Boca Raton Business Journal,
and the Delray Beach Times.

 20-COX &HT;    TAAS stunting growth for some
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We post drug-free school zones. We post gun-free
school zones.
</P>
<P>
   I want that: my children free of dangerous influences. That's
why I want this posted where my children study: ``TAAS-FREE SCHOOL
ZONE.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right _ I want zones on school campuses where the mention
of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills will cause federal
marshals to emerge, injunctions in hand, to form a human shield
around any child who has a grasp of basic skills and doesn't need
the TAAS rat-tat-tat.
</P>
<P>
   Expel TAAS from schools? No.
</P>
<P>
   As with smoking sections in restaurants, schools should have
designated areas where it would be legal to factor TAAS into every
task, from breathing to blinking.
</P>
<P>
   But right now just about every grade-schooler is inhaling these
fumes in Texas public schools. It is stunting much growth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is right to feel good about the steadily increasing number
of students passing TAAS. Those numbers are a grapefruit in the
face of those who blast public schools as unable to teach children
who lack basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   But those basic skills are what TAAS is all about, little more.
TAAS is not about excellence. It's about competency. Whether used
to assess schools or students, TAAS measures the stump, not the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is drawing raves nationally for dealing with intractable
academic deficiencies using a content-linked measuring device and
insisting on accountability. The credit is deserved.
</P>
<P>
   But that linkage is also a problem, and it's a serious problem.
When content and accountability are affixed so tightly to the
basics, students who already have a handle on those basics are
fixed in place, brain cells frying in the deep fat of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, in schools' life-or-death struggle to get as many
as possible to pass TAAS, particularly at the elementary level,
classes spend inordinate time on TAAS objectives _ like some
students' sorest subject, math _ to the exclusion of such things as
geography, science, history, all those things children need to
become well-rounded individuals and citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I spoke to a fourth-grader whose family was going to
San Antonio for vacation. Perfunctorily, I asked him if they would
be going to the Alamo. The question drew a blank. Ala-what?
</P>
<P>
   I submit to you: This is a scary symptom of TAAS fixation. It's
TAAS asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   A grade-school teacher, after wrapping up TAAS, was heard
exhaling: ``This means now we can teach some science,'' or social
studies, or . . .
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There were but a few days left in school. And anyway,
said another teacher. ``What this means is we start on next year's
TAAS.''
</P>
<P>
   How to implement my plan for TAAS-free school zones? This is
quite simple. In every school, have a TAAS-testing room, yes, a
designated TAAS zone. There, students individually would log on to
a secure, supervised computer program and demonstrate their mastery
of the skills in question.
</P>
<P>
   If they pass, they test out. No more TAAS. Not one utterance,
with federal marshals at the ready. If they fail, they need a more
intensive basic-skills emphasis, and federal marshals should
guarantee they have it.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, now the whole school year leads up to TAAS, making it
the end-all, the be-all. It shouldn't be. Certainly it shouldn't be
for students who could be benefiting so much more by taking wing
and exploring their world and their creative abilities.
</P>
<P>
   This is education as it should be. Under the metal lid of TAAS,
education becomes a 32-ounce mason jar. That may be filling for
some. For others, it just leaves them thirsty.

 &HT;    Newsletters, cards offer personal touch
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eastside Cafe's ``Garden News'' offers its
customers tips on how to compost and get rid of bugs without
pesticides, while Holland Photo's newsletter sends clients warnings
about new X-ray equipment hurting film.
</P>
<P>
   Both Austin companies are among a growing number of small
businesses that have found newsletters help them create closer
relationships with their clients as they compete against larger
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eastside, a 10-year-old restaurant on Manor Road, began sending
customers a quarterly newsletter six years ago. The four-page
publication features gardening tips, recipes, and news of Eastside
salsas and salad dressings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way for us to directly reach our customers,'' says
Dorsey Barger, co-owner of Eastside.
</P>
<P>
   More and more small businesses are starting to use newsletters
to distinguish themselves and their products and services from
bigger competitors, says Larry Gresham, a professor at the Center
for Retailing Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a part of relationship building,'' he says.
``Anything you can do to make your customer feel like they have an
ownership in the business and are important to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal thank-you notes, cards after a purchase, and follow-up
phone calls to check with the customer are other ways that the
owners of small companies can do this.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newsletter, Eastside Cafe's garden manager, David
Kolosta, writes about exploring nature by gardening with his young
son _ supporting the image the Manor Road restaurant is trying to
build as a family-oriented business that cares about the
environment and uses organically grown produce in its recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Barger says sending tips gleaned from growing herbs and
vegetables in the restaurant's garden is a subtle way to remind
customers to come by if they haven't eaten there lately. As an
extension of its efforts to reach out to its customers, the
restaurant also holds weekend gardening workshops in the spring;
200 children attended last May's sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mailing the free newsletter, the restaurant keeps a
stack of newsletters available for patrons waiting for a table _
often 30 minutes or more at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Holland says his Holland Photo spends about $16,000 a year
to send out newsletters quarterly to 4,000 of its regular
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a blurb about a new camera. New Internet copyright
laws, new X-ray machines that are cooking film that are now a
problem,'' says Holland, who began the newsletters three years ago.
Holland Photo gears its products and services to commercial,
professional and advanced amateur photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Holland says he uses the newsletter to pass along information he
has picked up from the dozens of magazines, newsletters and other
information he receives from manufacturers that also may be helpful
to his customers. Recent issues included information about a new
location it has opened in North Austin with another shop and
Holland's view of how the industry is changing because of digital
photography.
</P>
<P>
   While large companies with branch stores also attempt to have
close relationships with regular customers, Gresham, of Texas A&AMP;M,
says small companies can be in a better position to track their
regular customers, interact with them personally and tailor their
products and services to meet their customers' needs. ``That's
really the advantage small businesss retailers have is the ability
to know their customers,'' he says.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The restless clan of chic geeks and entrepreneurs who
populate New York's new media industry may not be anywhere near as
rich as their West Coast counterparts. But in the pages of Jason
McCabe Calacanis' monthly magazine, Silicon Alley Reporter, they
emerge far more glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry here is driven by people,'' Calacanis, 27,
lectured a magazine job applicant recently over breakfast at
Balthazar's, a trendy downtown restaurant. ``On the West Coast
there are a handful of celebrities _ Bill Gates, Larry Ellison,''
Calacanis said, referring to the chairman of the world's two
largest software companies. ``Those people are boring. They don't
take good pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Calacanis' irreverence is either refreshing or hopelessly
sophomoric, depending on one's point of view. Yet his shameless
boosterism of Silicon Alley _ New York's downtown multimedia hub _
has helped create the aura of community and even home-team spirit
for a disparate group of colleagues and competitors who otherwise
might have little more in common than being located in Manhattan
and trying to find some sort of profitable business on the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Calacanis' application of celebrity journalism to the
world of New York new media has earned him a certain measure of
success. In less than two years the Silicon Alley Reporter has
grown from a few photocopied sheets to 116 glossy pages, on the
strength of advertising sales and revenue from the periodic
industry conferences Calacanis has organized like last month's
``Rising Tide Summit,'' which attracted more than 200 registrants
who paid $500 each to attend.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is a growing sense in some quarters that the
community identity that Silicon Alley Reporter has worked so hard
to sell may no longer be the way many members of that community
want to see themselves _ or be seen by the larger business world.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some holdouts, notably the online magazines
Feed and Word, increasingly, the definition of ``new media'' in New
York seems to be moving away from artsy, underfunded Web sites like
Stim, a Prodigy pop-culture project that fell by the wayside, or
the interactive soap opera The East Village. The new media seem to
be maturing instead into online extensions of the old-line
Manhattan media _ whether in advertising, marketing, publishing or
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   And as venture-capitalized start-ups evolve into IPO-financed
corporations, some industry executives are concerned that
Calacanis' unflagging promotion of an image evoking artists' lofts
and SoHo may be at odds with the businesslike demeanor that will
play well in boardrooms and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hypester in an industry that could do with less
hype,'' said Kyle Shannon, co-founder of Agency.com. The company's
shareholder is the giant advertising holding company Omnicom and
which through a series of acquisitions has become the largest
agency devoted to creating advertising on the Internet. ``There are
two Silicon Alleys _ the one where people go to the parties and the
one where people actually do the work,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the citizens of Silicon Alley are not yet
ready to go completely corporate _ to stop dressing in black or
bleaching their hair blonde or, among the men, raising goatees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work very hard to balance the kind of
accountability we have to have now with the creative risk-taking
that brought us to where we are,'' said Nicholas Butterworth,
president of Sonicnet, an Internet broadcaster acquired last year
by the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move to new office space, and I'm scared,'' said
Butterworth, whose company has been located in a loft. ``One of the
terrible and great things about Sonicnet is we have no walls. What
happens if we put up walls?''
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said he reads the Silicon Alley Reporter because
Calacanis, a former gossip columnist from Brooklyn, manages to tell
it mostly like it is. ``Is it balanced? No. It's partisan. But it
delivers the goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would fault Calacanis for not speaking his mind _ although
he seems to save his rants for subjects beyond the borders of
downtown Manhattan. Born of a new-media column that he was writing
for Paper Magazine, the first issue of Silicon Alley Reporter
carried the headline ``Microsoft Alienates Alley.'' And in his
daily e-mail feed last week, Calacanis critiqued Texas-based
Zapata's Internet acquisition strategy as ``over-simplistic 1995
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Other characteristic fixtures of Calacanis' magazine include a
controversial map that highlights a revolving _ some say random _
bunch of new media firms below 57th Street. Then there's the
monthly feature labeled ``Digital Dim Sum: They Lead the Charmed
Life so You Don't Have To,'' which presents paparazzi-style
photographs of aspiring Silicon Alley business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason's challenge will be to figure out what his focus is as
the industry fragments into its logical genres,'' said Josh Harris,
co-founder of the online research firm Jupiter Communications and
now chief executive of an Internet television venture. ``I look at
my contemporaries and we've all been through the war and we all
know it's never going to be the same. It's like after my freshman
year, it's time to leave the dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   At last month's conference, for instance, some attendees
grumbled at the hour devoted to interviewing the Belgian anarchist
who won notoriety earlier this year by throwing a cream pie in the
face of Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason doesn't represent Silicon Alley,'' said one attendee,
who insisted on anonymity because he didn't want to risk
retribution in print. ``This is someone who is busy being flip and
glib when the industry is really about serious people who are
running serious businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But such criticism may also belie a certain defensiveness about
the industry's lingering immaturity, even as it struggles through
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people try to avoid saying about Jason, and it's not
really about Jason but about the industry in New York, is that it's
small-time,'' said Michael Wolff, the newly appointed media
columnist for New York magazine and author of ``Burn Rate'' (Simon
and Schuster, 1998), a book about the rise and fall of his own New
York new media company. ``The point about New York is we have not
had a defining business here,'' Wolff said.

</P>
<P>
   The Alley's derivative nickname first caught on in 1995, with
the explosion of Web and the conviction that its ``content'' _ the
techie catch-all for magazines, newspapers, music, movies, TV,
advertising and various vaguely defined interactive stuff _ would
be produced in the world's media capital.
</P>
<P>
   But of all of those things, only advertising has shown a
propensity to make money on the Web. Moreover, the truly successful
Web content _ at least this month _ appears to be the information
tools or ``portals'' aggregated by major search engines like Yahoo,
Excite and Snap!, which are all located on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York partisans are quick to point to the initial
public offering of Doubleclick, an advertising services firm, which
went public last winter at $17 a share and closed Friday at $43.
City officials cite a survey conducted by Coopers &AMP; Lybrand that
shows that by mid-1997, the number of new- media jobs and companies
had doubled to 105,771 and 4,881, respectively, in a mere 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, shares of 24/7, another Web advertising firm,
rose 45 percent to close at $20.25 in its first day of trading. Two
more New York companies, The Globe, an online community Web site
and Earthweb, an interactive services firm, also recently announced
their intention to go public.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the disadvantage of being across the continent
from Sand Hill Road where Silicon Valley's venture capitalists hold
court is not as sharp as it once was, as East Coast investors like
Flatiron Partners take up some of the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the insular new media community, the fact that Joanne
Wilson, wife of a Flatiron partner, Fred Wilson, sells advertising
for the Silicon Alley Reporter has raised eyebrows in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   Calacanis denies critics' contention that the companies Wilson
invests in get special editorial consideration.
</P>
<P>
   A black belt in karate who put himself through Fordham
University repairing electronic equipment, Calacanis makes no
pretense to vaunted journalistic objectivity. ``It's no secret I'm
a fan of this industry,'' he said. ``We write about every failure.
We cover it. We don't obsess over it.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a degree in psychology, Calacanis landed a
job in technical support for Sony Corp.'s legal department. A
habitual hustler, he managed to talk his way into a ride on the
corporate jet to chat about the internet with Sony's
then-president, Michael Schulhof.
</P>
<P>
   A project for America Online that he developed after leaving
Sony did not take off, but in the winter of 1996, Calacanis took
the modest sum America Online paid him for his efforts and started
Silicon Alley Reporter, which he initially wrote, produced and
distributed almost entirely himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a staff of eight helping him put out the magazine,
Calacanis is growing up and branching out. Forsaking neighborhood
loyalties for the prospect of a new market, he has been spending a
lot of time in Los Angeles lately and has begun running a ``Digital
Coast Reporter'' insert in the magazine, appropriating the
appellation a group of Southern California new-media entrepreneurs
recently bestowed on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, meanwhile, to compete with a local online news
service, (AT)NY, Calacanis recently started a daily e-mail news
feed.
</P>
<P>
   And he has entered into a partnership with Gordon Gould, 28, who
has put more than $100,000 into the magazine _ its first
investment. On behalf of the magazine, Gould also organized a
conference last month at the New York Historical Society, where
Palm Pilot-toting new-media executives dined on sushi and were
invited to think beyond their business concerns to the social
implications of the Web and related media.
</P>
<P>
   David Bunnell, a West Coast technology publishing veteran who
attended the conference, said he came away bullish on the New York
new-media enclave and on The Silicon Alley Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good magazines do is identify some kind of audience and
provide the members of that audience with a sense of membership and
belonging; and they've done that remarkably well,'' said Bunnell,
who runs the trade publication Upside. ``What they lack in
resources they make up for in enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   And as with the industry Calacanis covers, maturity shows signs
of tempering raw enthusiasm. One evening last week, dressed in
black with sunglasses atop his head, Calcanis made an appearance at
a SoHo courtyard party held by the Web ad-tracking company
I-Traffic. Six months ago he might have been carrying a camera to
snap the faces of his favorite entrepreneurs and their hangers-on.
But this time he said there would be no party report in his
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have other things to do; I have to write an analysis of the
Ticketmaster-City Search deal,'' he said, referring to last week's
announcement of a West Coast new-media merger. ``I have to get the
daily out. I have work to do.''

Cost of fixing millennium bug will be gigantic 
By Cynthia Mitchell  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta's largest companies are starting to firm
up the price tag for fixing the millennium computer bug _ and, more
importantly, they're letting shareholders in on it.
</P>
<P>
   And the price tag will be enormous. With just a relative handful
of Atlanta companies reporting so far, the total cost for fixing
the bug in this area is impossible to estimate. But, the highest
estimates from just those companies reporting is already more than
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven business days after the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued new guidelines on what companies should disclose
about their Year 2000 problems, 10 of the 11 large metro Atlanta
companies reporting quarterly earnings revealed either how much
they expect to spend, how much they've already spent, or both.
(Coca-Cola Enterprises, the only one that didn't include dollar
figures, said it's fixing the problem through an ongoing systems
update and doesn't expect the incremental costs to be
``significant.'')
</P>
<P>
   When told of the response from the Atlanta companies, SEC
spokesman Duncan King said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow. It's amazing they've been that responsive. We didn't
think we were going to see things really improve until
mid-September, because companies have 45 days to put together their
10-Q reports after the close of their business quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem itself is extremely complex. Companies have to
figure out how many of their computer systems will become confused
by dates beginning in the Year 2000 _ a situation that could wreck
havoc on everything from traffic lights to hotel reservation
systems. Besides worrying about their own systems, they have to
reassure themselves that every outside system they deal with won't
mess things up. And then, in what's viewed as the most critical and
expensive part, they have to test and retest to make sure things
will run smoothly when the clock hits midnight on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So assigning a cost to the problem has been akin to nailing down
Jell-O. The most common U.S. total cost estimate has a wide swing _
from $300 billion to $600 billion to fix both corporate and
government systems.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much different locally.
</P>
<P>
   Take BellSouth Corp. The telecommunications giant has an
estimated Y2K cost with a high range that is double its lowest _
$100 million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that swing, which the company started reporting in the
first quarter, is pure safety margin, says spokesman Clay Owen. The
company has 30,000 desktop personal computers, 3,000 mainframe and
midrange computers and 2,500 voice switches instrumental in
carrying phone calls from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be on schedule and on budget throughout the entire
life and then when you get to your critical testing, you've got to
intensify your efforts to make sure everything goes right,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new SEC guidelines officially apply to earnings
reports filed after Aug. 5, the picture should only get clearer.
Moreover, as the weeks go by, companies simply are getting a
clearer fix on where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case at Delta Air Lines. It disclosed in May it
expects to spend $110 million to $125 million to fix its internal
information technology systems, but said it was still assessing its
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way our Year 2000 program is going, we should have a
much better handle on a lot of those details the SEC is looking for
within the time frame they've specified,'' said spokesman Kip
Smith. ``We're aiming to have all of our critical systems
completely analyzed and remediated by the end of this year and
completely tested by the middle of next year. So as we go through
the remediation process, we will know more'' about exact costs.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
500 days and countingBy Rob Chambers 
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today is the 500th day before the millennium monster
begins biting vulnerable computer systems on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Today's milestone is a serious reminder of the approaching
deadline. And it's more of a ceremonial date than a real one, since
Year 2000 problems have and will crop up before then. But it's a
good time to take stock. If your company is running behind, there
are some user groups in the area that can help you get started or
get the process completed.
</P>
<P>
   If your company is big or can benefit from the experience of
large organizations like Ford Motor Company, then the Information
Management Forum may be for you (http://www.infomgmtforum.com).
It's an Atlanta headquartered association of U.S. and Canadian
information technology professionals at Fortune 1000-sized
companies. In the metro area, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Equifax,
Georgia-Pacific, Life of Georgia, Southern Company, and SunTrust
Banks are members.
</P>
<P>
   This organization's Year 2000 group meets each quarter for two
days to share information. Written reports of the proceedings are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Day 500 indicates there's not a whole lot of time
left ... While there's 500 days until Jan. 1, 2000, before that
many systems will be affected by what we call millennium events,''
said James A. Jones, a director of the Information Management Forum
and head of its Year 2000 group.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jan. 1, 2000 many computer systems ``will have to
encounter or process a date in the year 2000 or beyond. So, for
example, business and inventory planning systems that go out 12
months or beyond could have trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones went on to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a very large company and you haven't done anything
yet, you're in trouble. You have systems that are date impacted and
the time you have left isn't enough to make systems compliant.
There is still time, however, to get core systems compliant and to
develop contingency plans for those systems you will not have time
to make compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small companies that use stand-alone PCs or small network
systems in their business still have plenty of time, but they have
to get going. And the issue for them could become the shortage of
people available to do the work and potentially a shortage of
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Atlanta at this time the companies in my group are not
experiencing a skill shortage at this time,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   A broader forum is offered by the Atlanta Year 2000 Users Group
(http://www.bytewise.com/atlyear2000/). It was organized by larger
companies, but it's open to all, said Paul Arne, a partner at the
Morris, Manning &AMP; Martin law firm and a board member of the Atlanta
Users Group.
</P>
<P>
   So where do most companies stand? On Day 500 the news is not
exactly good. Consulting giant Cap Gemini America unveiled a survey
last week showing that half of the interviewed companies plan to do
no Y2K testing. That's disturbing because virtually all the experts
in the field say that testing is the most essential part of the
cleanup process.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week the Gartner Group released the results of its
worldwide survey of 15,000 companies and government organizations
in 83 countries _ 23 percent of those who responded haven't done
anything about Y2K yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about those companies who are not fully aware of the
problem and who are not working hard,'' said Arne.

 &HT;    Part of Edwards Aquifer on rise
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The southern portion of the Edwards Aquifer, a
vast underground water sourcethat provides drinking water to San
Antonio and surrounding cities, is finally starting to refill.
</P>
<P>
   After a summer that was so hot and dry that lawns turned brown
and investigators prowled neighborhoods looking for illegal
sprinklers, the San Antonio area has been getting the soaking it
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent cloudy skies dumped as much as 10 inches of rain on
Uvalde County, west of San Antonio, but left just .17 of an inch at
Robert Mueller Municipal Airport in Austin. Although the San
Antonio International Airport recorded no rain this week, it has
received 2.76 inches of rain in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aquifer has been steadily going up,'' said Jeannie Janes,
a spokeswoman for the Edwards Aquifer Authority, which manages the
southern section of the aquifer. For the first time all summer, the
Edwards Aquifer climbed above drought level, meaning that water
conservation measures in the area may be relaxed in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is different in the Austin area. The Barton
Springs section of the Edwards Aquifer, which is separate from the
section that runs under San Antonio, has received little recharge
from the lighter rains that have fallen here. Only .42 of an inch
has fallen at Robert Mueller Airport this month.
</P>
<P>
   Onion Creek, one of the main creeks that feeds the Barton
Springs section of the aquifer, remained empty Tuesday, said Bill
Couch, general manager of the Barton Springs/Edwards Aquifer
Conservation District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are nice showers and they green things up, but we have
not gotten any recharge,'' Couch said. ``It's just not happening
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Towns throughout the area continue to ask residents to conserve
water. Under Austin's voluntary water conservation program,
residents can water today if their address ends in 0 or 9.
</P>
<P>
   Though rainfall in the Austin area has been light,
today'sforecast calls for a chance of precipitation, and Austin
should eventually get a good soaking, said Larry Peabody, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week it may be Austin that gets all the rain and the
flooding. Like they say, what goes around comes around,'' Peabody
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody said the the weather will get hot again, but not as hot
as it was in earlier this summer and not for as long.
</P>
<P>
   The high today and Thursday should be in the low 90s.

Intranets changing the way some conduct business 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is euphemistically called busy work, but it can
drain a day in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing rep needs an ad display for a trade show. But half a
dozen people are in charge of knowing what's available. Hours can
burn securing the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia hopes to tighten that process, and others, with its
Intranet. An in-house network, Nokia's Intranet will give the
company's 3,500 employees in the Americas desktop-access to
companywide information such as human resources department forms
and company news and site-specific services such as reservation
lists for conference rooms and trade show displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty easy sell,'' said Stephen McClintick, who will
head the eight people developing and maintaining Nokia's Intranet,
the password-protected part of the telecommunication company's
World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that a lot of companies are doing and I
think everybody here saw the need for it,'' McClintick said.
``Improving employee communications was the main selling point.
It's fairly easy to point out to somebody that if you could reserve
a conference room on the Intranet by looking at a map, clicking on
a room and pulling up a schedule, it saves time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Intranets are evolving, like their big brother the Internet, at
Pentium-like speed. Companies posted first versions in 1995. Early
sites were more or less electronic bulletin boards, static
documents electronically tacked for employees to read.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Intranets, like Ketchum Public Relations Worldwide's,
which went online in February, are becoming workday fixtures,
although the term Intranet is still not a common term outside the
online world. Ketchum PR's Intranet is called the Ketchum Global
Network, or KGN _ avoiding the use of the word Intranet altogether
to dilute the technospeak and confusion that comes from the
similarly named Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Ketchum network has an electronic listing of names and
addresses, forms, e-mail addresses, media lists, company news
updated daily, management memos, and an in-house search engine,
which acts as a kind of corporate yellow pages, a way of preserving
institutional knowledge. If a public relations representative is
working on an airline account, he or she can search for others in
the company who have worked on similar accounts as well as read the
text of old presentations to airline accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Intranet is an electronic equivalent of everything we do
at our desk on a daily basis,'' said Paul McKeon, president of
Ketchum PR's Crescent Communications in Atlanta. Ketchum PR has
developed a new media group that will coordinate and develop
Internet and Intranet marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Creating an Intranet site can be expensive and time consuming.
The typical Intranet has a three-month gestation period and costs
about $100,00 for the consulting. And that does not include
hardware costs. Ketchum PR is consulting with Nokia on the
development of its Intranet, which will consolidate 30 networks
used by the Finnish company's American business groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Ketchum PR's full-time employees _ one in New York City,
one in Washington, D.C. _ update the global Web site daily. Any of
Ketchum's 1,000 employees can e-mail information for posting. The
two staffers also listen in on conference calls and write reports
for the company news section of the in-house network.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross-based Etech develops software to make Intranets more
user-friendly. Karla Mock, Etech director of business development,
said most companies use Intranets to improve efficiency in their
human resources, sales and marketing, manufacturing and accounting
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``More tools and technology are available. It's not just
browsing and looking at information,'' she said. ``It allows more
intricate searches, functions like mortgage calculators and links
to related articles and company archives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Benelli of Kinetic Design, a Web-design firm in Midtown
Atlanta, said she hops on her Intranet up to 20 times a day,
looking for client and prospect information and pulling up employee
schedules to track down a telecommuting worker with a call holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intranets got a little bit of a slow start, but they've really
taken off,'' said Andy Roach, director of Ketchum PR's new media
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent a kind of a sea change in the way people do
business. It gives them access to things they didn't have.
Companies are saying more and more that our greatest champions of
who we are as a company are our employees and they need to know
what we're doing from a strategic level and a marketing level,''
Roach said.
</P>
<P>
   For developers, an Intranet is a chance to work with a captive
audience. Intranets have fewer users and more of a built-in sense
of community than the Internet. And developers know the equipment
capabilities of their users.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web, you have to go with the lowest common
denominator,'' Roach said. ``Intranets are actually kind of fun for
developers because we can go to town on them.''

 THE SELLING OF APPLE'S iMAC   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer is putting an extraordinary number of eggs in its
iMac basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino computer-maker's $100 million iMac advertising
budget represents an estimated 15.4 percent of this year's sales of
the chubby, teal-colored desktop. Most companies spend only 2
percent to 2.5 percent of product sales on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' said advertising executive Alan May, when told of
Apple's expected advertising-to-sales ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outlay may make sense for Apple, which is struggling
to boost its 3.1 percent share of the PC market, down from a high
of 9.8 percent in 1988, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's marketing campaign is as important for re-establishing
the company's credibility as it is for selling iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of a make-or-break thing for Apple,'' said
May, media director at Anderson &AMP; Lembke, a San Francisco ad agency
that specializes in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to have a winner, so they're probably not even
worried about the advertising-to-sales ratio.''
</P>
<P>
   About $50 million of the ad budget will be spent in the United
States and Canada, with the other half going to Europe, Japan and
other international markets, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Microsoft spent an estimated $100 million to $200
million worldwide to advertise Windows 95 _ probably the biggest
product launch ever. It spent a paltry $10 million to promote
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Apple won't discuss specifics about its expected return on the
advertising. But Allen Olivo, senior director of worldwide
marketing communications, said ``the upside revenue potential is
absolutely huge'' given the tens of millions of potential customers
around the globe who will be exposed to the ads.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of a return will Apple get?
</P>
<P>
   May estimated that the global campaign will generate about 10
billion ``impressions,'' the number of times consumers are likely
to see the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities in San
Francisco, expects the company to sell 500,000 iMac's this year at
$1,299 each, which will generate close to $650 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million ad campaign would be 15.4 percent of that
revenue total.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler estimates the gross profit margin _ before costs such
as advertising _ at about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apple won't disclose the line's expected net profits, other than
to say it expects a net profit this year on the iMac, even with the
hefty advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   The foremost goal of the campaign ``is to signal that Apple is
back in the consumer marketplace with an absolute vengeance,''
Olivo said. ``We were the first computer marketed to consumers and
... we're coming back to claim that stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivo noted that companies including IBM, Microsoft and Intel
together are spending as much as 10 times more money to promote the
rival ``Wintel'' computer platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yes, this is a very big launch, but on the other hand, I
believe it is a very proportionate response.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's primary targets are the 25 million consumers who already
own an Apple desktop and other people who have never owned a
computer but are looking to buy. Families with children are
expected to buy at least half of the iMacs sold and college
students will be another big segment, said Olivo.
</P>
<P>
   The first TV spots for the new iMac appeared on ABC's
``Wonderful World of Disney'' last Sunday.In the next few months,
advertisements will appear on network and cable television, in
consumer magazines such as Newsweek and People, on the radio and on
billboards, but not in newspapersor on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The primary message of the campaign is that the iMac is simple
and easy to use, particularly for surfing the Web. The look of the
ads reflects the simplicity message, generally showing one item
such as an iMac, a mouse or an outlet against a pure white
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are designed to go hand in hand with the company's Think
Different branding campaign, which launched last fall. Those ads,
which feature black and white portraits of independent thinkers
such as Mahatma Gandhi, John Lennon and Amelia Earhart, will run
concurrently with the iMac spots.
</P>
<P>
   All of the ads were created by TBWA Chiat/Day of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler said it's all well and good if the iMac is a success,
but ``the thing that's important to me is can they sustain the
momentum'' with future product introductions. ``That's not to say
that (the iMac) is a flash in the pan; I'm actually quite
hopeful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lim, a principal analyst with Cybermedia Convergence
Consulting, said the iMac ads should be effective because they
focus on the characteristics of the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fail to see why anybody should be interested in buying a
computer just because they flash a picture of a dead person on the
screen,'' said Lim, a former Apple marketing executive, referring
to the Think Different campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler estimates total 1998 sales for Apple will reach $5.878
billion and net income will be $245.3 million, taking into account
a $10 million extraordinary item. Most of those sales come from the
Power Macintosh G3, a computer used in desktop publishing. Apple is
planning to launch a new portable computer early next year.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ If I were Bill and if the Republicans
want details, I'd give them lots. Sort of like this, ``Well, Monica
was at the bookstore and along with an embossed leather and
parchment copy of the poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she got
a Best Parts Version of the Kama Sutra. We started with `Crane
Walks on Misty Lake,' which begins with the woman putting her left
foot on your forehead and ends with the walking part, which is

basics are fixed in place, brain cells frying in the deep fat of

   MINOR-COLUMN _ Yes, there's going to be a wedding with all the

The carefully stenciled terra cotta pots with the pink impatiens
inside. It's all going to come together Labor Day weekend, God

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Resurrection of the czar
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The last time I'd paid my respects to
Czar Nicholas II was in a vacant lot at the Siberian city of
Sverdlovsk. There was nothing to mark the spot but a tall Orthodox
church cross, listing a bit to the left.
</P>
<P>
   That's the site where the czar and his family were murdered by
Bolsheviks, in the cellar of a farmhouse in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   In later years the house itself was demolished by a local
communist chief, by the name of Yeltsin, for fear the site might
become a shrine. Later he would say Brezhnev made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   I was there in the early 1990s. The status of Nicholas II has
since been elevated, not to mention that of Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The day before I arrived in St. Petersburg, the remains of the
czar had been reinterred in St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral, the
final resting place of all the czars since Peter the Great. Yeltsin
presided.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived a day after the ceremony on purpose. Such is my
journalistic instinct. Better to come along after most everyone
else has gone on their way. You're likely to find something, or
somebody, overlooked in the crush of the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, for example, like Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking to one person and then another as they filed past
the gold-encrusted tomb, tourists and true believers alike.
</P>
<P>
   There was a young guy there from Houston. He said he showed up
because of the event's historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   There was Ivan, 65, a peasant worker, who said Russia would be a
better place if the czars still ruled.
</P>
<P>
   There was an elderly woman who would say next to nothing. ``It
is a very private matter,'' she muttered.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Anastasia, suddenly standing beside me,
appearing as if out of nowhere, tall and blonde, her face framed by
high cheek bones, dark eyes and sculptured lips _ a vision but very
much real.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she assured me, speaking through an interpreter, her name
was really Anastasia, named for the daughter of the czar. Moreover,
her brothers and sisters had been named for other children of the
murdered royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I have special reasons for being here,'' she
explained. ``Because our family has aristocratic blood, we received
an invitation to the burial service.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, she is a teacher of the history of Russian
literature. She spoke freely and openly of her hopes for the future
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I never supported communism,'' she said. ``Neither
am I an ultra-nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe only real Russians, who follow the faith of the
Orthodox Church, can lead our country and restore its greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the church faith can return Russia to its cultural
values, that which comes from the heart _ traditions without
political purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our youth are very wise and independent. They are trying to
find the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their future depends on their parental upbringing, and a
devotion to God. The future of Russia depends on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I am very optimistic. I am a believer. I know that
the mother of Jesus will protect and save Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian culture has survived communism. It does not die.
It is our roots, our tradition. It is our everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful speech by a beautiful young woman. Still, I had to
ask her about her feelings for her namesake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you were a child,'' I said, ``did you ever play that you
were the real Anastasia?''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled a sad smile and shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then,'' she said, ``it was dangerous even to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   An ignorant question by an ignorant man.

must learn to work with a wood bat as much as possible. And the
adjustment from an aluminum to wooden bat can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new experience,'' said North Carolina Wesleyan senior
Andy Jones of his first Coastal Plain League summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is now in his second year with the Rocky Mount Rockfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to hit it on the barrel. I just wanted to try and
make solid contact,'' he said. ``But after the first couple of
weeks, I got used to it. It's just an adjustment to try and hit it
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockfish teammate Jason Dubois seems to have made that
adjustment, having stroked 17 homers and knocked in 51 runs this
summer with the wood bat. Rockfish manager Bob Keller attributes
that to dedication and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is Jason was forced to make a mechanical
adjustment and use his hands more, let the hands, the pitcher and
the ball do the work,'' Keller said. ``He found some success doing
that. One of the biggest mistakes guys get when they get that wood
bat in their hands, they start to over-rotate their upper body and
get a lot of excessive movement, that they have to muscle up a
little more. If you can learn to swing with the hands, you're going
to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If a player can make the adjustment, it can pay off in the long
run, even if he never gets a chance to play professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps a lot, especially for the guys that come out
of this league swinging a wood bat and then go home and continue
it,'' Keller said. ``Swinging that wood bat is going to help them
increase their bat speed. Guys with good bat speed can have more
holes in their swing and get away with it, to a certain amount.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the case for Jones, who started the spring
college season on a hot streak, stroking the ball around the field.
But at the end of the year, his 1998 numbers were slightly lower
than his previous year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a big benefit,'' former Wesleyan coach
Mike Fox said. ``But hitting is such a difficult thing. He started
out real well, but then had some ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed: Using a wood bat helped him early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it really (helped),'' Jones said. ``I felt
like I played in a real solid league. When you come back with the
aluminum, you feel like you can mash. You feel like you've got
unbelievable bat speed. Then after a month or two, it's back to
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bat or the player?
</P>
<P>
   Players today are getting bigger and stronger. Just a generation
ago, a player as tall as 6-9 J.R. Richard was an anomaly. Now, it's
rare to see any major leaguers shorter than 5-11. In addition,
there's no doubt that today's players are often on a strict
strength program. Mark McGwire's forearms have been measured at 17
inches in diameter. That's larger than the average man's neck size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line,'' Keller said. ``You're starting to look at
a lot of players in the big leagues like McGwire, (Jose) Canseco
and some of these guys that have been on serious weight programs
for years. It used to be in the old days, it wasn't acceptable to
be a baseball player and a guy who lifted weights. Now there's been
a strong trend to that. You have a lot of guys taking weight
protein supplements, creatin, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, some of the most important coaches in collegiate
athletics are the strength coaches, in every sport. Whether it's
football, baseball, basketball, the strength coaches are some of
the most influential coaches that you have. I know at Georgia
State, we take that guy real seriously and he has our guys on a
strong weight-conditioning program.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubois knows the combination of stronger athletes and lighter
bats has had an effect on the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to get bigger,'' Dubois said. ``But they're
making the bats lighter, so it's more to the hitter's advantage. So
it gives them the upper edge.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how quickly baseball's hitting records would
fall if McGwire or Tony Gwynn were allowed to use an aluminum bat.
It's conceivable that the single-season home run record could reach
100, or hitters might break the .400 mark on a routine basis.
</P>
<P>
   Fans love homers and high-scoring games, but would the prospect
of five- or six-hour slugfests get old in a hurry?
</P>
<P>
   What can be done?
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, along with other organizations, is taking a close look
at the continued development of bats and is trying to bring
aluminum bats more in line with wood.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee is examining the
issue this week. Fox, named head coach at the University of North
Carolina this spring, recently completed a six-year term on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time was spent on bats, `` Fox said. ``I hadn't
given it much thought, but after seeing some video and statistics,
it got me to thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Breidenthal, staff liaison with the NCAA Baseball Rules
Committee, says the committee is looking at a conflicting issue:
trying to ensure player safety while preserving the integrity of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard decision to make,'' Breidenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the NCAA has tried to develop a measurement of
a bat's performance, called a BPF. It's a measure of the rebound of
a ball off a bat shot from a cannon at a set speed. The BPF has
been measured at speeds as high as 110 mph, although the committee
is trying to set a limit of 93 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the National Federation of State High School
Associations announced new guidelines for bat performance, based on
wood bats. The new standards will be announced by Oct. 31 and take
effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   What 1998 Division I batting leaders would have accomplished
with aluminum bats, based on a 162-game season:

record: .426, Nap Lajoie, 1901)

 &HT;    Do metal bats take the ballance out of baseball?
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1961, Mike Gillespie scored the winning run in the College
World Series as Southern California defeated Oklahoma State 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Gillespie coached the Trojans to their 12th CWS
title, he had a little more breathing room as Southern Cal defeated
Arizona State 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 CWS set 13 offensive records as the eight teams
combined to bat .318 and belt 62 home runs, shattering the previous
records of .303 and 48, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So why the explosion of offense at the college level?
</P>
<P>
   Many are pointing to bats as the culprit. New standards may be
set on aluminum bats, while others would like to see the NCAA bring
wooden bats back to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see all of college baseball go to wood bats,''
Georgia State assistant Bob Keller said. ``I've always felt that
way, but even after being here in Rocky Mount this summer and
watching how much crisper the game is, it's played like it's
supposed to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, the hitting instructor at Georgia State, is the head
coach of the Rocky Mount Rockfish this summer. His experience this
season has strengthened his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With wood bats, you can play percentage baseball and have a
greater chance for success,'' Keller said. ``If we draw the infield
in with a wood bat, and a guy hits a hard ground ball, the chances
aren't as good of it getting through as if it were with an aluminum
bat. That ball is going to come off the bat a lot harder, a lot
faster and might get through the infield. It takes away some of the
strategy from the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, college team batting averages have risen 16 points,
scoring is up 14 percent, and home runs have increased 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, team earned run averages have risen almost a
full run a game in three years.
</P>
<P>
   What's in the bat?
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of differences between aluminum and wooden
bats, besides the sound of the crack or the ping.
</P>
<P>
   The larger the diameter, the bigger the hitting area.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden bat must be solid, and therefore the weight is usually
contained in the barrel. Baseball rules state a bat can not be more
than 2 3/4 inches in diameter at its greatest spot. But most wood
bats never reach that limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are 2 1/2 to 2 5/8 inches,'' Louisville Slugger executive
George Manning said. ``Aluminum bats are 2 3/4 and the weight is
distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most aluminum bats are hollow and extremely light. The NCAA
allows the difference between the bat's weight and length to be no
less than five. For example, a 33-inch bat can weigh just 28
ounces. That limit will be four for the 1999 season and may drop
further if new standards are inacted.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the key, because contrary to popular opinion, it's bat
speed that makes a ball travel farther - the ability to whip the
bat head through the hitting zone with the greatest force.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats also have a greater hitting area, usually called
the sweet spot. Rawlings has developed a metal bat with a 10-inch
sweet spot. Worth is preparing to release a new aluminum bat which
contains piezoelectric dampers to control the amount of vibration
in the bat. The bat is supposed to allow the hitter to hit the ball
harder and extend the sweet spot down into the handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wooden bat has a smaller sweet spot,'' Rawlings wooden bat
marketing director Tom Nailor said. ``But a ball can travel farther
if you hit it just right with a wood bat.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when a batter gets jammed with a wooden bat, he's
more likely to break it, allowing the fielders to react to the
change in the ball's direction. With an aluminum bat, a jammed
batter can still hit the ball hard enough to carry over an
infielder's head.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics don't lie
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston, the NCAA baseball rules
editor, is involved in a study of college hitters and pitchers who
play in wood bat summer leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston followed 90 Division I hitters with at least 70 at-bats
in the Cape Cod Summer League and 60 pitchers who threw at least 25
innings. The ball used in that league is the same one used in many
college leagues, so he could rule that out as a variable.
</P>
<P>
   He then compared the summer wood bat statistics to each player's
college regular-season numbers with aluminum bats, taking into
consideration the number of games played.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston's study showed batting averages fell 107 points when
batters used wood compared to aluminum. Slugging percentages were
down 226 points. And with aluminum bats, batters hit a home run
every 25 at-bats, compared to every 74 with wood.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the batters in the study hit over .400 with aluminum
bats and 31 more hit at least .350. But not one of those same
players hit over .350 in the Cape Cod League, and only five were
able to bat better than .300.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Thurston found pitchers' ERAs decreased an average
of 2.10 runs per pitcher. Two lowered their ERAs over five points
and seven dropped more than four runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve saw their ERA shrink by three runs. In addition, each
pitcher allowed an average of 2 1/2 fewer hits per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   There are always exceptions to the rule. Rocky Mount Rockfish
outfielder Jason Dubois hit 17 home runs with a wood bat this
summer, after just seven round-trippers as a Virginia Commonwealth
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Dubois doesn't have one answer as to why his numbers have
jumped, though he said he tends to swing a wood bat more during
practice and the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swinging a wood bat helps,'' Dubois said. ``I've been swinging
a wood bat for five years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he played in a league in which he was allowed to
use either wood or aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used wood most of the time,'' Dubois said, ``until I found
somebody that was throwing mid-90s and then I broke out my
aluminum, just because it was easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like wood over aluminum, because it feels more natural.
You're actually using more power with wood than you are with
aluminum. Most aluminum bats now are so springy, that you hit a
ball and it goes in about a quarter of an inch and then shoots
right off.''

 &HT;    Getting the best bang for your buck
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the ping that makes cash registers ring.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats were first produced in the 1970s as a cheaper
alternative to wood bats. Batmakers promised unbreakable aluminum
bats would last longer than breakable wood, at a reasonable cost.
At the time, the cost savings of aluminum bats allowed youth
leagues, high schools and colleges to save money by making the
switch.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the case any more.
</P>
<P>
   As any parent of a baseball player knows, the price of aluminum
baseball bats continues to rise. The newest top-of-the-line models
easily cost $300. A new Worth bat, which will include piezoelectric
shock absorbers, will retail in the neighborhood of $280.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the current price of wood bats, which retail for
around $20. Of course, the quality of the bat you can purchase at
your local retailer is far from what Mark McGwire is using. But you
can now buy 15 wood bats for the price of some aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest advantages of aluminum bats is that they
supposedly last longer. But as manufacturers have made the walls of
hollow aluminum bats thinner to make the bat lighter, aluminum bats
are cracking and denting much more easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aluminum bats don't last long at all,'' North Carolina
Wesleyan's Andy Jones said. ``They tell you not to hit under 65
degrees. It's worse than a wood bat (in some cases).''
</P>
<P>
   Most companies will allow you to return an aluminum bat if it
cracks or dents. Jones said that sometimes can be as often as every
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some college programs don't purchase bats at all, because of
contracts with aluminum bat companies. Louisville Slugger sponsored
both Arizona State and Southern California, the two teams that met
in the 1998 Division I College World Series final.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that many college coaches haven't spoken out
about the bat issue. They don't want to bite the hand that feeds
them. But as is the case in most businesses, if somebody's given a
free ride, someone else has to pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston stated in his study on the
difference between wood and aluminum bats: ``If thousands of these
high-performance bats are being given to programs under contract
each year, it is understandable why the price of the bats to
non-contracted programs (college, high school, individuals) has
risen so dramatically in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools with smaller athletic budgets get by because players
often provide their own bats. Former North Carolina Wesleyan coach
Mike Fox said he hadn't bought a large number of aluminum bats for
the Bishops in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is one of the biggest factors for colleges. But is it still
cost effective?
</P>
<P>
   There are now special wood bats which are supposed to be less
breakable. Most are coated with a special fiberglass, or have some
sort of composite material included. The Coastal Plain League has
provided its teams with composite wood bats the past two years, but
most CPL players were still willing to spend $20 on a wood bat of
their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cost is about $100 per bat,'' said Mark Cryan, CPL
director of operations. ``We use about eight to 10 bats per team,
or about $800 per season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cryan said if the league switched to true wood bats, the cost
would be approximately $2,500 per team.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden shift in policy by the NCAA may leave many programs
scrambling to find the funds to purchase wood bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason college favors aluminum bats, like anything else,
money is the big factor, it's the driving force,'' Georgia State
assistant coach Bob Keller said. ``They say money is the reason why
they won't go to wood. There are some ways to get around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are going to break wood bats more, so your turnover ratio
of having to buy bats is obviously going to be more. The problem
you have there is that there are only a handful of programs in the
country that have enough money to go switch over to wood. While
that's nice, there's more programs that are small-time programs
that don't have money to be continually buying wood bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bat manufacturers want the NCAA to fully evaluate the issue
before rushing to any conclusions. Obviously, they don't want to
lose out on the millions of dollars aluminum bats bring in every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston noted that there are several reasons why bat companies
are against reducing the explosive power of metal bats, with
profits coming out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would severely reduce the profitability margin of the
bat,'' Thurston said. ``It allows other bat manufacturers (who
presently don't have the high-tech engineering capacities) to
compete in the market, and reduces sales because the bats would be
more durable and not need to be replaced as often.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   Easton Sports, one of the two major aluminum batmakers, has
filed a $267 million pre-emptive lawsuit against the NCAA, alleging
unlawful restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA this week approved rules changes designed to reduce the
impact speed of aluminum bats by Aug. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let them know that this is a serious change,'' said
Jim Easton, the chairman of Easton Sports, which is one of the two
biggest manufacturers of aluminum bats. The other is Louisville
Slugger, and together the two companies produce about 40 percent of
the 500,000 aluminum bats manufactured annually in the United
States.

 &HT;    Safety issue is paramount
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The silence said it all.
</P>
<P>
   As Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina lay in front of the mound
earlier this spring, blood gushing from a cut over his eye, his
teammates in the dugout were silent, some weeping. More than 48,000
people in Camden Yards were quiet. Mussina had just been hit in the
face by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Houston pitcher Billy Wagner was hit in the
head by a line drive. After the impact, the ball rolled all the way
to the edge of the third-base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, both Mussina and Wagner suffered only minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case for 17-year old pitcher Julius Riofrir of
Glendale, Calif. He was killed last summer after being hit in the
right temple by a ball hit with an aluminum bat. He was warming up
at the time and suffered a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   In a game where pitchers have less than a second to react to a
line drive, the three incidents clearly show how dangerous the game
of baseball can be.
</P>
<P>
   With aluminum bats being used in college, high school and youth
baseball, fielders seem to be coming under fire more often. Is it
safe to play with aluminum bats?
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers contend they are producing safe bats and the game
is still safe, according to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety issue is a big one,'' Louisville Slugger executive
George Manning said. ``Discussion will continue on the safety of
the bats. But the trend has not been upwards. This issue has been
there all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning says in the pros, a player is hit by a batted ball an
average of once every 25 games. At the college level, it happens
once every 75 games.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA's annual injury surveillance system,
college baseball is one of the safest sports in college athletics.
Over the past few years, the NCAA has conducted random surveys to
gather information on defensive players being struck by batted
balls. Yet, only 14 percent of Division I institutions have
completed that survey.
</P>
<P>
   According to Todd Breidenthal, staff liaison with the NCAA
Baseball Rules Committee, this past season, 150 pitchers were hit
by a batted ball. Of those, between 20 and 25 missed at least one
practice or game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State pitcher Ryan Mills suffered a broken jaw several
years ago by a line drive, and a University of Houston pitcher lost
two teeth. But there have been no fatalities, according to
Breidenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we lucky?'' Breidenthal asked, rhetorically. ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just an issue at the college level. As Mussina's
and Wagner's incidents show, it can happen at the highest levels,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it always takes some serious injury for
(something to be done),'' Georgia State assistant coach Bob Keller
said. ``You'd think that (Mills' injury) would have been enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball finally made batting helmets mandatory
after several horrifying incidents, including Boston's Tony
Conigliaro having his cheekbone fractured by a thrown ball in 1967.
In 1920, Cleveland's Ray Chapman was struck in the head by a pitch
and killed, the only on-field fatality in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 percent of Division I schools not responding to the NCAA
survey, no one knows the exact number of players hurt by batted
balls. But everyone knows it's become more of a problem in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think safety is an issue,'' North Carolina baseball coach
Mike Fox said. ``A lot more get hurt than get reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he doesn't remember a player being seriously hurt by a
batted ball during the 15 years he was at North Carolina Wesleyan.
He considers himself, and his program, to be fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Keller has seen his share of players hit, but not necessarily on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anybody get hit in the face,'' Keller said.
``I've seen pitchers go down, and leave the game taking one off the
ankle, getting hit in the chest and whatever. It's pretty
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the aluminum bat injuries that you see are
(pitchers) getting hurt in the (batting) cage. Because they're so
close and those balls are ricocheting off the poles on the side of
the cage. I know some coaches now that are making it mandatory for
their guys throwing down in the cage to be wearing helmets. Those
cages are so tight and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller recalls a third baseman in Georgia who was hit in the
head last year. He's now blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many incidents is it going to take?'' Keller asked.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from 60 feet, 6 inches, a pitcher usually ends up about
55 feet away from the batter after his delivery. It can be a scary
sight seeing a ball coming at your head. Sometimes you don't even
see it. Virginia Commonwealth sophomore Jason Dubois pitched
against both aluminum and wood this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' Dubois said. ``You're the closest (fielder) to
the plate, and you're throwing the ball and moving in all these
awkward positions. You throw the ball 90 miles per hour, and the
guy hits it, it comes back at about 120. That's got to be the most
frightening thing ever when you're on the ballfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston has studied the statistical
differences between aluminum and wood. Because an aluminum bat is
lighter and a batter can generate more force, Thurston came to this
conclusion: ``If a batted ball is hit at a greater velocity, at the
same distance and hit harder more often, the potential for more
injuries, and more severe injury, is certainly increased.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   NCAA baseball officials have approved rules changes designed to
cut the performance of aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I and II championship baseball committees approved
the changes for next season. The Division III committee - concerned
about the financial impact it would have on its schools - asked
that the implementation date be pushed back seven months to August
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said the amended bats would protect pitchers and
preserve the integrity of the game.

 &HT;    JAMAICAN GOVERNMENT LOOKS TO WHIZ KID IN DREADLOCKS TO GET
TOE-HOLD IN CYBERSPACE

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ He swoons over the Spice Girls. He mouths
off to his mother. He signs his name by drawing a smiley face --
flanked by dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this seemingly typical 13-year-old boy -- Makonnen David
Blake Hannah -- holds a lot of sway on this sunny Caribbean island
of 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's new technology consultant, the fidgety
teenager has the ears of Jamaica's most-influential politicos, with
a direct line to the Ministry of Commerce and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to keep me abreast of new technology,'' said
Phillip Paulwell, Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology.
``It is the young people who know about computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulwell, 36, began using computers three years ago. Hannah's
been honing his skills for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appointed Paulwell only last
January to head what was a newly created ministry on a
tourist-dependent island that's still, for the most part, a
technological wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, some 60 percent of all new jobs will require
technology-based skills by century's end, which doesn't bode well
for Jamaica, where only 35,000 to 40,000 people have logged on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hannah, who relishes karate and fast Japanese cars, the
focus of his ever-changing site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He's been charged with advising the government on computer
hardware and software and visiting schools to talk to young people
about the advantages of using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it makes him Jamaica's youngest-ever government
advisor, the one-year appointment doesn't seem to faze the worldly
youngster, who's visited several U.S. cities. His favorite? New
York and Orlando, by far. The best part may be the honorarium that
comes with it: a few dollars a week he'll use to go watch movies.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, self-assured adolescent who collects National
Geographic magazines and reads science textbooks for fun taught
himself how to program computers and clean up viruses. He's also an
accomplished Web page designer. Yet he speaks of these skills with
the nonchalance of someone who's just mastered inline skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can program a little bit, and I'm good at system design,
advanced Windows, DOS usage, stuff like that,'' said Hannah, with
saucer-like eyes and an easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was raised in the nice, solidly middle-class neighborhood
of Mona Heights, where streets have sidewalks, and neighbors might
include journalists and low-level politicians.
</P>
<P>
   An intermittent child actor, Hannah appeared on Nickelodeon a
few years ago in a segment that featured children from around the
world. For his part, Hannah showed viewers how much mildew had
accumulated on a coconut he'd left under his bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah parlayed a handful of acting gigs into an invitation to
attend the Chicago Children's Film Festival in 1995, which is where
he met Paulwell, who came away duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just extremely intelligent and full of energy,'' Paulwell
said. ``He knows more about computers than perhaps anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike another homegrown celebrity, Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, who
won the National Spelling Bee last May, Hannah is not a product of
Jamaica's public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's mother, novelist Barbara Blake, pulled her son out of
school at age five after a teacher scolded him with a smack on the
hand for questioning whether Jesus was really white.
</P>
<P>
   He's been home-schooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taught him what's relevant, and computers are all we have
to save us from a very poor education system,'' said Blake, who was
introduced to computers by an American friend. ``We live in a
global community and the computer is the best way for children to
be able to connect to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is a doting mother with strong opinions. She credits her
son's intelligence to six years of breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother, Hannah comes from a long line of
eccentric -- yet cerebral -- ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Evon Blake, was a famous journalist who decades
ago launched a Newsweek-like magazine in the Caribbean called
Spotlight. He had a penchant for pipes and white, shark-skin suits,
and is credited with breaking the color barrier here in the 1940s
by jumping into a whites-only swimming pool at a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had Life and Ebony magazines around the house, and
my father used a pen as his weapon,'' Barbara Blake said. ``My
father always encouraged me to think, which is what I've always
tried to pass on to my child.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has.
</P>
<P>
   Her son's as preoccupied with computers as other teenage boys
might be with girls.
</P>
<P>
   But he hardly looks the part of government advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A talented soccer player, he wears an Adidas jogging suit and
dreadlocks that stretch the length of his arms -- his matted
tendrils have never been cut.
</P>
<P>
   The rope-like locks draw double-takes, but are actually a tenet
of his family's faith in the Rastafarian religion.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Christianity, Rastafarianism stresses the
back-to-Africa teachings of Jamaican pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey
while advocating black unity. To believers, Ethiopia is like Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Rastafarian was reggae music star Bob Marley,
with whom Hannah shares a birthday on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unconventional appearance, Hannah says he mixes
easily with government types.
</P>
<P>
   He e-mails Paulwell almost every day and meets with him once a
week face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know what is on the Internet,'' Hannah said.
``He's real cool so he's easy to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in the daily newspaper here showed Paulwell
and Hannah in front of a computer playing Pac Man and sucking on
lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Paulwell, Hannah's job is nothing to snicker
at.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has yet to gain a toe-hold in Jamaica, some 550 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The island's future, Paulwell contends, rides on the knowledge
of the young. And that knowledge must be more technology-based.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious prodigy has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, like other less-developed islands, has been locked for
years out of the technology market because of high costs. A
computer with a 200 megahertz Intel Pentium processor that sells
for $520 in the United States would cost at least $1,200 in
Jamaica. With a per-capita income of about $1,500 a year, most
people here can't afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's in the midst of an economic recession that's left one
in three people living in poverty and nearly half of all young men
aged 16 to 25 unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's goal to put a computer in all of Jamaica's 997
public schools by the year 2000 is deceptively simple: many have
yet to install a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our teachers have never even used computers before,''
said Jean Beaumont, who provides computer training to teachers.
``Some find them complicated, and others are just very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, government officials warned that
date-recognition software -- a problem known as the ``millennium
bug'' -- won't be corrected before Jan. 1, 2000, and probably not
until the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But while his country struggles to gain some ground
technologically, working for Microsoft Inc. someday is what's
mostly on the mind of Hannah, who seems hungry for the trappings of
American mogulism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream would be to meet Bill Gates,'' Hannah said, turning
suddenly serious. ``The man has revolutionized the world.''

VIEWS OF AUTUMN SPLENDOR BLOSSOM FROM A BUS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's a long line at the Sheraton's breakfast buffet
the first Sunday in October. A really long line. But then I
remember: There are a number of tour buses hitting the road this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Autumn Highlights of New England'' _ Globus bus tour's AB
1004 _ is just one group of 45 among this throng of people piling
breakfast meats, potatoes, eggs and sweet rolls onto their plates.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more to a fall foliage tour than leaves and
lobster.
</P>
<P>
   The week is one Kodak moment after another:
</P>
<P>
   _ At Quechee Gorge in Vermont, hordes of tourists gather to
stare at what the brochure calls ``Vermont's Little Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The water rushes up through Thunder Hole at Acadia National
Park along Maine's rocky coast.
</P>
<P>
   _ The gondola ride at Wildcat Mountain is a 360-degree view of
the Presidential Range and Mount Washington Valley in New
Hampshire. Winds of 230 mph have been recorded here _ luckily, not
the day I share a gondola to the top with one of my bus mates.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Bar Harbor, Maine, the owner of The Song of the Sea takes
down a set of bagpipes and plays a tune. The shop, which stands on
the waterfront, sells Celtic instruments.
</P>
<P>
   _ The General Store in Bath, Maine, opened in 1790, has a
celebrity saleswoman on duty. Patti Page (the ``Singing Rage'') has
a home here and she poses for pictures, sells her own brand of
maple syrup and tapes of her music.
</P>
<P>
   A light rain is falling as the bus leaves Boston at 8 a.m. _ the
quest for fall foliage has begun. Globus tour guide Jim Ayres, a
native of Canada, introduces bus driver Jerry Torp of Green Bay,
Wis. Ayres met most of the group the night before over wine and
cheese at a hotel reception. Both guide and driver are consummate
professionals, always sporting jackets, ties and smiles for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers are quiet; perhaps it is the rain, or the
near-empty Boston streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres gives a warning for diabetics _ ``Don't forget to eat!'' _
and explains the rotation of seats once a day. Then he provides a
general idea of how things work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an emergency washroom in the back _ the less we use it,
the better off everybody is,'' he says good humoredly. (There is
nothing wrong with this toilet, but luggage is piled in front of
the door. It does beat waiting in line at the rest stops.)
</P>
<P>
   My seatmate is Betty Reardon, a chipper woman who lives at a
Missouri retirement community. Betty is traveling with her
sister-in-law and her friend, who sit behind us and never exchange
a word with Betty on the bus. Betty's on her second bus tour but
she doesn't even pack a camera; she explains that her late husband
was the photographer in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Claproth and Shawn Golden, in their 40s, are probably the
youngest couple on the bus. The Southern Californians are also
taking their second bus tour. Golden says that Claproth, a computer
designer for Xerox, needs to let go and relax _ ``and let someone
else drive.'' Claproth keeps his video camera always at the ready
and pans through the window. But it's evident that he is relaxing
later when he sleeps through Wiscasset, whose sign proclaims it
``the prettiest village in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayres gives fair warning that this first day is going to be a
tight schedule. We make some rest stops and photo stops in the
first few hours before arriving at Kennebunkport _ summer/fall home
of George and Barbara Bush. The closest we get is a drive by the
Bush family home (wave and watch for Secret Service agents).
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have a beautiful home right on the water, but we have
only 40 minutes off the bus to discover Kennebunkport. (The next
day I meet a man from another bus tour who ran into Bush at the
Kennebunkport pharmacy. He says the former president shook hands
with all the tourists there.)
</P>
<P>
   The colors of Maine are the golds, reds, browns and oranges of
autumn. The canopy of leaves is like a bridge of color.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun finally makes an appearance at 11:30, we barely
notice. The colorful leaves have painted the gray day.
</P>
<P>
   Freeport is a one-hour and 15-minute stop. This is an outlet
store town, the biggest and most famous of which is the L.L. Bean
Store. Open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, the store is packed
on this Sunday. Down the street is the outlet store where
discontinued and overstocked items are slightly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's in Maine sometimes offers lobster rolls for $5. I
find a delicious lunch with the help of a Freeport store clerk. She
directs me to the Chowder Express, a casual lunch counter where I
get a cup of seafood chowder ($4.50) and a vegetarian Syrian
roll-up ($3.95).
</P>
<P>
   Fortified, I do a little window shopping at the Bean store
before stepping back on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   That first day there are a lot of missed photo opportunities _
roadside fruit stands with pumpkins and local flea markets, signs
that proclaim ``Fresh Lobsters _ Packed to Travel.''
</P>

 &HT;    NRA OPENS NEW 'NATIONAL FIREARMS MUSEUM'
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyles
categories.
 &HT;    Advance for use the weekend of August 22-24
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ From a musket that came over on the Mayflower to
an M-16 from the Vietnam War, from Annie Oakley's rifle to the
pearl-handled pistol Teddy Roosevelt kept by his White House bed,
from a buffalo hunter's Sharps carbine to a Baby Boomer's Daisy
``Red Ryder'' BB gun, the new museum recalls a nation's history
through its guns.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association's $3.1 million National Firearms
Museum provides an array of dramatic displays illustrating the
notion that guns are as all-American as baseball or Old Glory _ a
controversial concept in an era when schoolchildren shoot
classmates and politicians bemoan the availability of assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   An ``objective gun museum'' would have a display on the
assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., said
Naomi Paiff, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control, Inc., a political
opponent of the National Rifle Association (NRA). ``America's guns
have, at best, a very mixed tradition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, curator Doug Wicklund said the museum is educational
and historical rather than political and simply ``tells the story
of Americans and their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum _ it has nearly 2,000 guns displayed in 15 high-tech
galleries _ is located in the NRA headquarters beside Interstate-66
in this suburb of the nation's capital and is free to the public.
Since opening in early summer, the attraction has averaged about
100 visitors a day, said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   What they see is an arsenal of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   There's the wheel-lock carbine that Pilgrim John Alden brought
to Massachusetts from England and a display of weapons from
Colonial Jamestown and muskets of the sort that fired ``the shot
heard round the world'' at the start of the Revolutionary War.
There are biographical displays on America's great gunsmiths _
Samuel Colt and Eliphalet Remington and Eli Whitney (who invented
interchangeable gun parts as well as the cotton gin), Horace Smith
and Daniel Wesson. Also included are John M. Browning, who
developed an automatic rifle for GIs, and John T. Thompson, whose
submachine guns were popular with gangsters, at least in the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   There are weapons of America's wars from the Revolution to the
Persian Gulf conflict, with displays showing Doughboys in the
trenches of World War I and GIs in World War II's European theater.
There are guns of famous people: Lyndon Baines Johnson's revolver,
as well as other presidential guns owned by Ronald Reagan, George
Bush, Dwight Eisenhower and Grover Cleveland. There's Napoleon's
ornate rifle and a whole room devoted to the guns of Teddy
Roosevelt, including one with the presidential seal and another
used on safaris and one that was carried by a comrade on the Rough
Riders' charge up San Juan Hill.
</P>
<P>
   There are displays that target the cultural nostalgia of guns.
</P>
<P>
   A restored 1903 Coney Island shooting gallery harkens back to
the boardwalk, for example. And a boy's bedroom from the 1950s
offers a bonanza of Baby Boomer memories: Hopalong Cassidy linoleum
floor, ranch-style wallpaper and bedspread, Davy Crockett coonskin
cap, Hardy Boys mysteries, Daisy air rifle, booklet on Boy Scout
marksmanship merit badges and dozens of other reminders of
childhoods where Roy Rogers capshooters and cowboy hats were
essential.
</P>
<P>
   There are real guns from the Wild West, too, including Buffalo
Bill Cody's revolver and a shotgun and rifle used by Annie Oakley.
There's a whole wall of Winchesters. A model of an 1849 San
Francisco store shows guns of the Gold Rush. Moving a century
ahead, a display of the guns of law enforcement includes the FBI
Most Wanted posters for John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde,
``Babyface'' Nelson and bank robber Willie Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   The new museum replaces an earlier NRA facility, which closed
its doors five years ago to facilitate the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the NRA views it as a marketing tool'' in its
campaigns against gun control legislation, said Josh Sugarman,
executive director of the non-profit Violence Policy Center,
another political opponent. He said the museum provides ``a wistful
look back to a time when 'guns were good','' and reassurances for
the NRA membership. But he doubted that there will be much impact
with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   However, in dedicating the new museum three months ago, outgoing
NRA president Marion Hammer called it ``a crucial link to our
nation's future, and to the survival of Second Amendment freedom in
the hearts and minds of future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has an introductory video on the NRA and a display on
the historical development of the U.S. Constitution's Second
Amendment, which protects the right to ``keep and bear arms.'' NRA
materials are for sale in an adjoining gift shop. Otherwise, there
is no overt political message expressed in the displays.
</P>
<P>
   The new museum will be a mecca for gun collectors, predicted
curator Wicklund. He recalled one enthusiast who drove for six
hours to see the museum's Wall of Winchesters and spent two days
examining it.
</P>
<P>
   Wicklund _ who described himself as ``the only fourth generation
life member of the NRA'' _ is a walking encyclopedia of American
gun lore. With degrees in history and museum studies and a personal
collection of historical rifles that he enjoys shooting, he
concedes this is his ideal job. ``My vocation and personal
interests are 100 percent in harmony,'' he said, after spending
over an hour pointing out details of scores of guns.
</P>
<P>
   The National Firearms Museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. and is located at 11250 Waples Mill Road in Fairfax, Va.

<P>
   The former woolen mill town of Camden is a 30-minute stop and
there is an arts and crafts fair going on and a picturesque harbor.
Some of the passengers are grousing about the pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the bus reaches the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake at
Hull's Cove, all is forgiven as we dig into plates of fresh steamed
lobster, steamed mussels, corn on the cob and blueberry cake. The
placemats have instructions, and the dining staff is very helpful.
There's also steak and halibut for the non-lobster eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Keep eating like this, and I will be forced to jog behind the
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Bus tours are definitely not for those who don't like people,
all kinds of people. It is a land cruise. Two meals a day are
included, breakfast and dinner. Lunch is on your own and that's
usually when it is time for a little exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, N.H., home of Dartmouth College, tests my theory that
the best pizza is found in college towns. On a warm (high 60s),
sunny day as the students loll around the green campus, I stumble
upon The Brick 'n' Brew, where a single slice of veggie pizza is
$2.25 and a meal by itself.
</P>
<P>
   But lunchtime isn't the only time for exploring. On my own,
there is a chance to discover the walking path at Lake Placid. On a
stop at Lake George, I find the re-creation of Fort William Henry
(``Last of the Mohicans'') and watch the boats Mohican and
Minne-Ha-Ha depart for the lake excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny public libraries in Lake Placid, N.Y., and Camden, Maine,
put out used books for sale, perfect for a bus traveler to browse.
</P>
<P>
   While some points of the tour are rushed, there is plenty of
time to explore the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass.,
and the Billings Farm near Woodstock, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell, the beloved artist whose work graced Saturday
Evening Post covers, is a favorite of many Americans regardless of
age. But the familiar images seem especially poignant to senior
citizens who best remember his photolike, detailed paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The museum houses the world's largest collection of original
works by Rockwell, along with changing exhibits of other
illustrators. There also is a film, the Rockwell studio from his
home and a museum store with prints, books, cards and gift items.
</P>
<P>
   At the Billings Farm &AMP; Museum, visitors discover what life was
like in an old-fashioned dairy farm. It was established in 1871 by
Frederick Billings, a Vermonter known for his work as a
conservationist and a pioneer in scientific farm management.
</P>
<P>
   At the working dairy farm you can tour the 1890 farm house,
watch workers milk the jerseys, pet the massive shire horses or
pick out a pumpkin. Sample some homemade ice cream, learn about
farm life in the 19th century or watch a docent bake a pie in a
cast-iron stove.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Ticonderoga in New York, history buffs watch the
colorfully garbed historical re-enactors recall pre-Revolutionary
America and life in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   While no one can dare predict when the fall colors will peak,
early October is bursting with color.

   Bus driver Torp, who has spent weeks driving leaf peepers around
New England, says he has seen fall tours from green leaves to no
leaves. His favorite tour, says this seven-year veteran of driving,
is the Canadian Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are drawn to New England for more than leaves. There
are fall festivals, special events, end-of-year sales and outlet
stores. A bus tour seems to be good way to ensure a room at the inn
at the end of a day of sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   A leaf peeper's guide from New Hampshire's White Mountains
explains the many varieties of trees, from the quaking aspen that
turn yellow to the red of the Tupelos, the bright red of the
American Mountain ash to the purple of the sumacs.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a horticulturist to enjoy the changing
vistas.

 &HT;    NRA OPENS NEW 'NATIONAL FIREARMS MUSEUM'
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyles

   FAIRFAX, Va. _ From a musket that came over on the Mayflower to
an M-16 from the Vietnam War, from Annie Oakley's rifle to the
pearl-handled pistol Teddy Roosevelt kept by his White House bed,
from a buffalo hunter's Sharps carbine to a Baby Boomer's Daisy
``Red Ryder'' BB gun, the new museum recalls a nation's history
through its guns.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association's $3.1 million National Firearms
Museum provides an array of dramatic displays illustrating the
notion that guns are as all-American as baseball or Old Glory _ a
controversial concept in an era when schoolchildren shoot
classmates and politicians bemoan the availability of assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   An ``objective gun museum'' would have a display on the
assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., said
Naomi Paiff, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control, Inc., a political
opponent of the National Rifle Association (NRA). ``America's guns
have, at best, a very mixed tradition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, curator Doug Wicklund said the museum is educational
and historical rather than political and simply ``tells the story
of Americans and their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum _ it has nearly 2,000 guns displayed in 15 high-tech
galleries _ is located in the NRA headquarters beside Interstate-66
in this suburb of the nation's capital and is free to the public.
Since opening in early summer, the attraction has averaged about
100 visitors a day, said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   What they see is an arsenal of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   There's the wheel-lock carbine that Pilgrim John Alden brought
to Massachusetts from England and a display of weapons from
Colonial Jamestown and muskets of the sort that fired ``the shot
heard round the world'' at the start of the Revolutionary War.
There are biographical displays on America's great gunsmiths _
Samuel Colt and Eliphalet Remington and Eli Whitney (who invented
interchangeable gun parts as well as the cotton gin), Horace Smith
and Daniel Wesson. Also included are John M. Browning, who
developed an automatic rifle for GIs, and John T. Thompson, whose
submachine guns were popular with gangsters, at least in the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   There are weapons of America's wars from the Revolution to the
Persian Gulf conflict, with displays showing Doughboys in the
trenches of World War I and GIs in World War II's European theater.
There are guns of famous people: Lyndon Baines Johnson's revolver,
as well as other presidential guns owned by Ronald Reagan, George
Bush, Dwight Eisenhower and Grover Cleveland. There's Napoleon's
ornate rifle and a whole room devoted to the guns of Teddy
Roosevelt, including one with the presidential seal and another
used on safaris and one that was carried by a comrade on the Rough
Riders' charge up San Juan Hill.
</P>
<P>
   There are displays that target the cultural nostalgia of guns.
</P>
<P>
   A restored 1903 Coney Island shooting gallery harkens back to
the boardwalk, for example. And a boy's bedroom from the 1950s
offers a bonanza of Baby Boomer memories: Hopalong Cassidy linoleum
floor, ranch-style wallpaper and bedspread, Davy Crockett coonskin
cap, Hardy Boys mysteries, Daisy air rifle, booklet on Boy Scout
marksmanship merit badges and dozens of other reminders of
childhoods where Roy Rogers capshooters and cowboy hats were
essential.
</P>
<P>
   There are real guns from the Wild West, too, including Buffalo
Bill Cody's revolver and a shotgun and rifle used by Annie Oakley.
There's a whole wall of Winchesters. A model of an 1849 San
Francisco store shows guns of the Gold Rush. Moving a century
ahead, a display of the guns of law enforcement includes the FBI
Most Wanted posters for John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde,
``Babyface'' Nelson and bank robber Willie Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   The new museum replaces an earlier NRA facility, which closed
its doors five years ago to facilitate the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the NRA views it as a marketing tool'' in its
campaigns against gun control legislation, said Josh Sugarman,
executive director of the non-profit Violence Policy Center,
another political opponent. He said the museum provides ``a wistful
look back to a time when 'guns were good','' and reassurances for
the NRA membership. But he doubted that there will be much impact
with the general public.
</P>
<P>
   However, in dedicating the new museum three months ago, outgoing
NRA president Marion Hammer called it ``a crucial link to our
nation's future, and to the survival of Second Amendment freedom in
the hearts and minds of future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has an introductory video on the NRA and a display on
the historical development of the U.S. Constitution's Second
Amendment, which protects the right to ``keep and bear arms.'' NRA
materials are for sale in an adjoining gift shop. Otherwise, there
is no overt political message expressed in the displays.
</P>
<P>
   The new museum will be a mecca for gun collectors, predicted
curator Wicklund. He recalled one enthusiast who drove for six
hours to see the museum's Wall of Winchesters and spent two days
examining it.
</P>
<P>
   Wicklund _ who described himself as ``the only fourth generation
life member of the NRA'' _ is a walking encyclopedia of American
gun lore. With degrees in history and museum studies and a personal
collection of historical rifles that he enjoys shooting, he
concedes this is his ideal job. ``My vocation and personal
interests are 100 percent in harmony,'' he said, after spending
over an hour pointing out details of scores of guns.
</P>
<P>
   The National Firearms Museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. and is located at 11250 Waples Mill Road in Fairfax, Va.

DOCTORS TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS' GUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The next time you open up and say ``aaaaaah''
during a physical exam, don't be surprised if your doctor takes a
closer look at your gums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are becoming aware that (their patients) can't
really be healthy unless their mouth is healthy,'' said Dr. Reed
Ference, an Albany periodontist, a dentist who specializes in gum
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that the health of our mouths can have an impact
our overall health, and several new studies point to a link between
gum disease and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still trying to figure out the details of that
connection. But they believe the same bacteria that causes gum
disease may also trigger formation of the plaque that blocks or
hardens arteries.
</P>
<P>
   One study reported that people with periodontitis had a 25
percent greater risk of coronary heart disease than others.
</P>
<P>
   Gum disease has also been linked to bacterial pneumonia. And
another study shows that gum disease may increase a woman's risk of
having a low-weight baby because bacterial toxins released into the
bloodstream interfere with fetal development.
</P>
<P>
   If you're surprised that gum disease can have such far-reaching
consequences, you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and dentists are also coming to terms with the fact that
their two professions are more closely linked than traditionally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taught at the time that infections in the mouth don't
infect other areas of the body,'' Ference said.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth, however, has long had the reputation for harboring
hundreds of nasty bacteria. ``A human mouth is incredibly dirty,''
Ference said. ``You've probably heard that a human bite is worse
than a dog bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Gum disease is caused by plaque or bacteria that naturally
accumulate on the surface of teeth and gums. If we don't remove the
plaque with regular brushing and flossing, it will eventually
harden into tartar, and will, in time, erode healthy gum tissue and
lead to tooth and bone loss.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms may include red, swollen or bleeding gums, loose teeth
and chronic bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   Though brushing and flossing is the best defense against plaque,
they don't guarantee protection against gum disease. There are
other risks, including smoking, a poor diet, chronic health
problems like diabetes, stress, and intimate contact with somebody
who has gum disease.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Radler, a Conrail conductor, doesn't know why or how he
got it, especially since he was always brushing his teeth, even at
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disease,'' he said. ``You can drink orange juice and
still get a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames a former dentist for not diagnosing the problem when
he first started getting minor infections in his mouth two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and sons used to kid me, you spend so much time
brushing and cleaning your teeth,'' said Radler, who lives in
Westerlo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, he ended up in the emergency room with an abscess
in his cheek. Radler, 48, decided to switch dentists and is today
undergoing periodontal treatment for the affected teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Radler isn't surprised by the research indicating a connection
between dental and overall health. When he first started getting
infections, he didn't feel well. ``Most of the time I felt like I
had no energy, headaches, sick to my stomach. You'd never think of
connecting it to your teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, after gum surgery and bone grafts, ``I feel a lot
better,'' he said. His heart, by the way, is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing research should tell reveal more about how the
body-mouth connection works, especially as it relates to heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ference hopes word will get out that regular
dental care is just as important as seeing a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just treating mouths, we're treating patients,'' he
said.

 Includes a 350-word sidebar on other long-term studies 
 By RICHARD A. MARINI 
 c.1998 
 World rights

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Antonioli says he wasn't just happy when, in the early
1970s, he was asked to become a guinea pig in the Framingham Heart
Study. He was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, like, an honor to be asked,'' says the boyish high
school math teacher. He's sitting in the living room of the home he
shares with his ``significant other,'' Leah Heffron, in Framingham,
Mass., a town of 65,000 southwest of Boston. ``My parents were two
of the original participants in the study and I hope someday that
my three sons will be able to participate, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonioli's wish that his kids be poked and prodded, X-rayed and
ultrasounded once every four years says a lot about the
groundbreaking health study.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Heart Study, a part of the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute, is the longest ongoing epidemiological study
in medical history, and perhaps the single most important. It's
certainly the most famous. Indeed, there's a good chance that even
someone who doesn't know his, er, aorta from his elbow may have
heard of it. Framingham, for example, was among the first studies
to confirm that high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking
all cause heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because this granddaddy of all epidemiological trials is
celebrating its 50th anniversary in September, we decided to visit
Framingham to see if the study that has taught us so much about
hardening of the arteries, hasn't, after half a century, developed
a bit of atherosclerosis itself.
</P>
<P>
   Antonioli was especially excited on the day we met. That's
because he was scheduled to undergo his quadrennial medical exam in
the Framingham clinic the following day. You see, Antonioli
recently turned 50. It was a sobering milestone for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was only 53 when he had his first stroke,'' Antonioli
explains. ``So I said to myself, 'Hey, I'd better do something.''
And so, for the first time in his life, he's eschewing hamburgers
and Twinkies for turkey sandwiches and apples. ``I'm almost to the
point where broccoli isn't so bad,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Framingham has prompted such drastic
lifestyle changes. Prior to the study, many medical experts
believed that atherosclerosis was simply an inevitable side effect
of aging. ``The concept that you could modify your behavior to
avoid or even reverse this hardening certainly wasn't widely
accepted, and in some quarters was actually disparaged,'' says Dr.
William Kannel, former director of the study and professor of
medicine and public health at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Framingham dispelled these and other myths. And while it's still
called the Framingham Heart Study, investigators today also study
the causes of such illnesses as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis,
arthritis, eye disorders, kidney disease, even hearing defects.
</P>
<P>
   The study developed out of the fact that, following World War
II, cardiovascular disease was the nation's No. 1 killer,
accounting for half of all deaths. While small studies and
anecdotal evidence had suggested that some people _ cigarette
smokers, for example _ were more prone to developing the disease,
the U.S. Public Health Service decided to launch a large-scale
study to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   The initial participants (or ``cohort'') included 5,209 healthy
residents between 30 and 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure compliance, both husbands and wives were
enrolled. ``We figured the wives would nag their husbands to come
in to be tested,'' laughs Kannel, who joined the study in 1949.
That bit of New England pragmatism made Framingham one of the first
studies to include data on both men and women, and led to the
discovery that women tend to lag about 20 years behind men in
developing heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1971, the study enrolled Antonioli and 5,123 other
children of the original cohort (and their spouses) in a second
study. This ``offspring study'' gives Framingham two generations of
data _ an almost unprecedented achievement.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, a half dozen or so of the cohort and offspring
are in the study's first-floor clinic, wearing hospital gowns and
shuttling from room to room filling out questionnaires and
undergoing medical tests. Offspring visits last about four hours,
twice as long as the original exams. Many of the original cohort
are too frail for the tests introduced in recent years, such as a
lung-function test that requires blowing hard into a thin tube for
10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the investigators go to great lengths to accommodate
their elderly charges. ``If they can't make it in, we'll go to
their homes, or to those living in nursing homes,'' says clinic
director Dr. Joanne Murabito.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these and other outreach efforts, about 85 percent
make it in for their regular appointments. And those who miss one
are likely to show up the next time around. Most drug-company
studies figure on the same dropout rate after only two years.
</P>
<P>
   For both cohort and offspring, the benefits of participation are
obvious. Although they're not paid, every two to four years they
receive a medical checkup that consists of a complete blood workup,
bone scan, eye exam and other high-tech tests. It's all free and,
as part of the study's contract with the town, results are
forwarded to the participants' family doctors with their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been on the cutting edge,'' says Edward F.
Clinton, 46, an architect and, along with eight other siblings (two
of whom have since died in accidents), is a member of the offspring
study. ``The first time I ever heard the term 'ultrasound' was at
Framingham.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps the study's most curious finding is the lack of
effect that being in the study has had on the health of the
individual participants _if you look at statistics, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than two-thirds of the original cohort, who
spent much of their lives as research subjects in a trial looking
at the causes of cardiovascular disease, have since died. The most
common cause of death? Cardiovascular disease, still the No. 1
cause of death overall in the entire U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And while the second generation of participants, like their
peers, have lower cholesterol rates, lower blood pressure and are
less likely to smoke, they're also fatter, on average, than their
parents _ just like their peers. In other words, having the study
here hasn't made Framingham a hotbed of healthy living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unrealistic to expect people to swim upstream
against their culture,'' Kannel says. ``Not only are people eating
more, we've also engineered physical activity out of our daily
lives. Today, people have to join a health club to get the kind of
exercise their grandparents used to get working on farms or doing
some other form of manual labor.''
</P>
<P>
   So is there another 50 years in Framingham's future? Study
director Dr. Daniel Levy, doesn't look quite that far down the
road. He does, however, have a 30-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent our first 50 years looking at environmental factors
such as diet and smoking and their effects on disease,'' he says.
``Now we're using molecular genetics to explore how genes are
responsible for high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol,
Alzheimer's, and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy is also spearheading the Omni Study, in which 500 members
of Framingham's minority communities have been enrolled. It is
designed to see if established risk factors affect minorities
differently than the original cohort and offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But the most far-reaching of Levy's plans is recruitment of a
third generation of participants _ the grandchildren of the
original cohort. This study _ the one Antonioli hopes his three
sons will be asked to join _ would put Framingham in the unique
position among studies of having three generations of data to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As for Joe Antonioli, we phoned him after his checkup. His
numbers weren't perfect, but things are headed in the right
direction. And a scan of his neck revealed a suspicious speck,
perhaps the first sign of some narrowing of the carotid artery.
While troubling, it was spotted early so his doctor can keep a
close eye on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm on the right track,'' Antonioli says. ``Today was
the last day of school. Last year I'd have celebrated with a big
steak, or maybe some hamburgers. This year, we're having chicken
stir-fry.''

   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   Here are snapshots of some other important, large-scale clinical
trials:
</P>
<P>
   Nurses' Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1976
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 121,700 female registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Examine the link in women between hormones, diet,
exercise, and other life-style factors and a wide range of chronic
illnesses, including breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Postmenopausal hormone replacement
appears to decrease the risk of heart disease and all-cause
mortality, but may increase breast-cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Physicians' Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 22,071 male physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Study the effects of low-dose aspirin on heart attack
and of beta carotene supplements on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Low-dose aspirin reduces risk of heart
attack; beta carotene supplements neither reduce nor increase risks
of cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 5,888 men and women 65 years of age and older.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Investigate the similarities and differences in risk
factors for cardiovascular disease between older individuals and
those in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Many older adults have unrecognized
cardiovascular disease, which may not cause obvious symptoms but
does affect life span.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 40,000 post-menopausal female nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Examine the effects of low-dose aspirin and vitamin E
supplementation on heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): None to date.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Health Initiative
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 164,500 post-menopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Study the causes and prevention of cardiovascular
disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis based on
such variables as diet, hormone replacement, calcium/vitamin D
intake and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): None to date.

   Ask someone for a frank assessment of his fitness and you're
likely to hear something like: ``I may not look like I did in high
school but I'm certainly not as fat as Joe Dorf down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you're diligent about exercise, working out
regularly with great gusto, you may not be as fit as you think.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I sat in the office of Dr. Larry Golding while he
explained science's concept of fitness. An exercise physiologist,
the 72-year-old Golding is one of the most respected names in the
fitness field, holder of just about every honorarium imaginable,
including a distinguished professorship at the University of Nevada
Las Vegas where he teaches and does research.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that there are really three different
kinds of fitness _ flexibility, aerobic conditioning and
strength,'' said Golding. ``A lot of people lift weights and they
say, `Well I'm fit'. They're not fit. They're very fit in a limited
way. So you play tennis? Well that's better than not doing
anything. But there are studies that show that sports don't give
you much fitness and sometimes no fitness at all. Which is why
there isn't a serious athlete in the world that plays his sport to
get fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding paused for his conclusion: ``There are plenty of people
out there who think they are pretty fit. But I do think there is
some delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Voy was more blunt. Voy now has a family and sports
medicine practice just down the road from Golding's office. But for
years he has been involved with some the world's greatest athletes,
including a stint as chief medical officer for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, which is how he came to oversee world class athletes in
40 sports.
</P>
<P>
   The white-smocked Voy folded his hands on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes in various sports think they're in great shape. It's
interesting to note that they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   How fit are you really? At first glance the question might seem
strictly an exercise in vanity. It's not. Certainly your health,
genes and good fortune factor into how long and how well you will
live; no amount of pushups will stave off certain cancers or an
onrushing Peterbilt. But fitness is critical to your daily well
being and longevity too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the surgeon general issued a report that, possibly
because of its complexity and size (275 pages), was largely ignored
by the public. But the report's conclusions _ based on proven
research by the country's most respected fitness minds _ were
understandable enough. Inactivity, concluded the report, kills
about 250,000 American each year.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're reading this, this statistic obviously doesn't
include you. And since you are still conscious, your brain is
already unrolling a worn carpet of thought. I'm alive and kicking.
Why, I may even be young. Fitness testing is for middle-aged lardos
like Joe Dorf.
</P>
<P>
   Golding, of course, has heard this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had a professor who would say in lectures that we start
to dodder at about 26,'' he said. ``People would sit up and say,
`I'm 30. You mean I'm middle-aged?' Well, yes. Physiologically you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should you test your fitness? Well it just might provide a
wake up call.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I came to Las Vegas. I had received a call from
someone at Fashn Inc. The company, she claimed, had developed a
fitness test that was clear and simple. It would be packaged as a
CD Rom. You popped the disk into your home computer, performed a
few fitness tests, then punched in the results of your tests. The
program mulled them over, and, presto, in a matter of seconds you
received your true fitness age. The CD Rom was dubbed FitnessAge,
and the company would soon be selling it to the public for $70.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I was skeptical. Fitness has its legitimate
practitioners, but it also is home to more quacks than a duck
flyway. But the idea of a simple, objective fitness measure was
appealing. Better still, Golding and Voy had lent their names and
their expertise to the product, nit picking the fitness details to
make sure the FAShN folks got it right. (Both consulted on the
CD-Rom, receiving only expenses).
</P>
<P>
   And so I sat in FAShN's tidy offices listening to Steve Brazell,
the company's creative and marketing director, explain what
FitnessAge would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program tells you simply how old you are,'' explained
Steve Brazell, Fashn's creative and marketing director. ``Your
chronological age doesn't matter. It's how old your body is.''
</P>
<P>
   The software behind these calculations was complex, said
Brazell. But what the user ended up with was brutally clear. You
might be 38 by the calendar, but your fitness age might allow you
to collect social security.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in front of a computer, Brazell marched me through a
sample, a 57-year-old man who had performed the 3-minute step test,
pushups, sit-ups and waist and hip measurements the program
required to calculate one's age. Along with the ability to crunch
these facts, FitnessAge also contained some other innovative aids,
among them a library that explained fitness terms, outlined the
risk factors of inactivity (``Not exercising is worse for your
health than smoking'') and offered exercise prescriptions to
implement a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Brazell clicked the mouse and the anonymous guinea pig's results
flashed up on the screen. At 57, he had the cardiovascular fitness
of a 79-year-old, the strength of a 49-year-old, the flexibility of
a 35-year-old and the body composition of a 56-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   We may have been looking at one of Golding's delusional souls;
someone who went to the gym three days a week to lift weights and
stretch, and so considered himself in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' said Brazell, eyeballing the gent's heart and lung
tally. ``This guy's in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   I might have made light of his failings, but I was up next.
Brazell punched in my particulars, height, weight, resting heart
rate and age. Then while Brazell and some coworkers watched, I
marched through the FitnessAge tests. The procedure took 30
minutes, and it might have taken less time, had the three of them
not had such a jolly good time mocking my weaknesses, specifically
my flexibility which fell somewhere between stone and tungsten.
This made sense since, though I workout regularly, I never stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished Brazell entered the numbers and clicked the
mouse. At 38, my fitness age was 26, which will be a source of some
pride as soon as I can bend over to tie my shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Having an objective measure of your fitness, said Golding, is
certainly important as both a stick and a carrot. It can let you
know how far you've fallen and, assuming that lights a fire under
you, follow-up fitness tests at regular intervals can provide
wonderful incentive by showcasing your tremendous improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But owning up to delusion is just a step, said Golding, and it's
certainly not the most important one.
</P>
<P>
   Golding smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the desire to begin with.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids don't come into the world with good judgment, good manners
or even good sense. A large part of your job as a parent is finding
ways to get your kids to want to do what they should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   You could easily spend every waking moment engaged in a battle
to get your child to do the right thing. That's why it's so
important to learn to pick your battles.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you decide when an issue is worth fighting over? Or
when you need to take hold of something or not?
</P>
<P>
   To preserve good times, try to organize the behavioral traffic
in your family before you act. Is your child's behavior (digging in
the garden) acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   In this green-light area, no battle is needed. Or is your
child's behavior (running into the street) unacceptable? Then
you're in a red-light area, and it's important.
</P>
<P>
   But most parent-child problems occur in the yellow-light area,
where you're not sure whether the behavior (such as jumping on the
bed) is worth fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   What battles are you most likely to encounter? What
developmental issues are revealed by them? And how can you manage
the fights you choose? Let's examine each age by age:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 1/2 to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers seem willing to engage endlessly in struggles over the
smallest things (``I don't want a broken pretzel; I want a whole
one''). But your toddler is not just contrary. She's trying to
develop an independent sense, and one way she does this testing her
strength against yours.
</P>
<P>
   You're still the boss, and she's at your mercy; by challenging
your authority she builds her own (``Mommy gave me a different
pretzel!'').
</P>
<P>
   Also, your child's recent mastery of mobility can lead her to do
things that may be out-of-bounds, like floating her rubber duckie
in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This means that your no is constantly being challenged by her
wish to go. Because judgment has not caught up with her desire, her
behavior can be unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to communicate red-light areas clearly. If you
take things as they come, you'll battle all day long. Instead, take
every opportunity to help your child internalize rules by
verbalizing them as you go along (``We always hold hands when we
cross the street.'')
</P>
<P>
   The most worthwhile battles involve safety and security
(``Two-year-olds can't cut their apples with knives.'')
</P>
<P>
   Try to sidestep other issues, particularly on food or clothing.
These can provoke a toddler because they're ones in which you still
exercise much control.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick battles, you want to be able to resolve them, and
a stubborn toddler can defeat all your efforts (force-feeding is a
setup for disaster).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that your toddler's mischief is often motivated
by curiosity. You may feel she is impossible when you find your
pantyhose on the floor, but to her, it's just exploring.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3 to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your pre-schooler is gaining control over his own body. His
insistence on self-reliance can cause many battles, since a child
this age is often trying to push you away - yet still needs help
(``I can tie my shoes, Daddy'').
</P>
<P>
   As your pre-schooler goes into the world, he also becomes more
aware of vulnerability. This realization causes his behavior to
alternate between clinging and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Battles at this age are most likely to be over bedtime
(pre-schoolers hate exclusion from grownup activities) and bodily
care (when he was younger, his body was under your control; now
he's struggling to bring it under his).
</P>
<P>
   Because children this age alternate between progressive and
regressive, one moment your child may want to sleep outside in a
tent, and the next may want you to wipe his tushy!
</P>
<P>
   To help your child integrate his wishes with his growing skills,
be sure to praise his accomplishments and try to avoid battles that
deflate his pride (criticizing the mess he made in the kitchen
instead of the good job he did mixing cookie dough).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6 to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By this age, your child has a firm sense of an independent self
and has learned many skills that will help her take care of
herself. Now she must leave the purely ``play days'' of early
childhood and move into the world.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is reflected in battles over homework, TV, and
chores, all characteristic of grade-schoolers. Since these are
years when your child will be learning habits for a lifetime,
battles are worthwhile, but you'll need to find a way to help your
child cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to encourage your grade-schooler to create a
study and chore routine (working at her desk with a comfortable
chair before dinner, then set the table).
</P>
<P>
   Children this age may still need you to remind them that it's
time for homework, but this doesn't mean yelling about
irresponsibility (``I can't believe it's 8 o'clock and you haven't
even begun to study your spelling words!'').
</P>
<P>
   By age 9 or 10, if she forgets to study for a test she'll need
to suffer the consequences and learn from them. Engaging in battles
with a school-age child or rescuing her at the last minute
interferes with her ability to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, try to avoid battles about friends, interests, or TV
choices (unless unsuitable). Kids this age are beginning to define
their own tastes, and your criticism can interfere with their
burgeoning self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10 to 12 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your pre-teen may seem to be revisiting his toddler years,
provoking the same kind of encounters that you remember from when
he was 2! But pre-teens bring a new level of risk and danger to the
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   When a 2-year-old refuses to eat, his favorite strawberries can
tempt him, but when an 11-year-old does so, a possible eating
disorder looms.
</P>
<P>
   When a 3-year-old ``runs away'' after an argument, he may hide
under the bed, but with a 12-year-old, he could be out all night.
This means that, more than ever, it's important to pick battles
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are apt to be about your pre-teen's wish for more
freedom (``Why can't I ride my bike to Joe's house?''). You need to
engage in these battles because they offer a chance to emphasize
that with freedom comes responsibility (``It's five miles away. If
I let you ride alone, you'll have to call me when you get there'').
</P>
<P>
   While reasoned discussion is always better than arguing, when
reason doesn't work you'll need to stand firm. Pre-teens may ask
for a lot of liberties, but they still need restraints. Even if
they protest, limits help them feel cared for. Blaming you for
curfews lets them remain ``cool'' with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid picking battles over his friends (criticism increases his
loyalty), clothing, or music he listens to. Save energy for things
that really matter, like smoking and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   By picking battles carefully and matching them to your child's
developmental needs, you'll be able to keep your connection to him
as he grows.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Antonioli says he wasn't just happy when, in the early
1970s, he was asked to become a guinea pig in the Framingham Heart
Study. He was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, like, an honor to be asked,'' says the boyish high
school math teacher. He's sitting in the living room of the home he
shares with his ``significant other,'' Leah Heffron, in Framingham,
Mass., a town of 65,000 southwest of Boston. ``My parents were two
of the original participants in the study and I hope someday that
my three sons will be able to participate, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonioli's wish that his kids be poked and prodded, X-rayed and
ultrasounded once every four years says a lot about the
groundbreaking health study.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Heart Study, a part of the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute, is the longest ongoing epidemiological study
in medical history, and perhaps the single most important. It's
certainly the most famous. Indeed, there's a good chance that even
someone who doesn't know his, er, aorta from his elbow may have
heard of it. Framingham, for example, was among the first studies
to confirm that high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking
all cause heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because this granddaddy of all epidemiological trials is
celebrating its 50th anniversary in September, we decided to visit
Framingham to see if the study that has taught us so much about
hardening of the arteries, hasn't, after half a century, developed
a bit of atherosclerosis itself.
</P>
<P>
   Antonioli was especially excited on the day we met. That's
because he was scheduled to undergo his quadrennial medical exam in
the Framingham clinic the following day. You see, Antonioli
recently turned 50. It was a sobering milestone for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was only 53 when he had his first stroke,'' Antonioli
explains. ``So I said to myself, 'Hey, I'd better do something.''
And so, for the first time in his life, he's eschewing hamburgers
and Twinkies for turkey sandwiches and apples. ``I'm almost to the
point where broccoli isn't so bad,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Framingham has prompted such drastic
lifestyle changes. Prior to the study, many medical experts
believed that atherosclerosis was simply an inevitable side effect
of aging. ``The concept that you could modify your behavior to
avoid or even reverse this hardening certainly wasn't widely
accepted, and in some quarters was actually disparaged,'' says Dr.
William Kannel, former director of the study and professor of
medicine and public health at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Framingham dispelled these and other myths. And while it's still
called the Framingham Heart Study, investigators today also study
the causes of such illnesses as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis,
arthritis, eye disorders, kidney disease, even hearing defects.
</P>
<P>
   The study developed out of the fact that, following World War
II, cardiovascular disease was the nation's No. 1 killer,
accounting for half of all deaths. While small studies and
anecdotal evidence had suggested that some people _ cigarette
smokers, for example _ were more prone to developing the disease,
the U.S. Public Health Service decided to launch a large-scale
study to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   The initial participants (or ``cohort'') included 5,209 healthy
residents between 30 and 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure compliance, both husbands and wives were
enrolled. ``We figured the wives would nag their husbands to come
in to be tested,'' laughs Kannel, who joined the study in 1949.
That bit of New England pragmatism made Framingham one of the first
studies to include data on both men and women, and led to the
discovery that women tend to lag about 20 years behind men in
developing heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1971, the study enrolled Antonioli and 5,123 other
children of the original cohort (and their spouses) in a second
study. This ``offspring study'' gives Framingham two generations of
data _ an almost unprecedented achievement.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, a half dozen or so of the cohort and offspring
are in the study's first-floor clinic, wearing hospital gowns and
shuttling from room to room filling out questionnaires and
undergoing medical tests. Offspring visits last about four hours,
twice as long as the original exams. Many of the original cohort
are too frail for the tests introduced in recent years, such as a
lung-function test that requires blowing hard into a thin tube for
10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the investigators go to great lengths to accommodate
their elderly charges. ``If they can't make it in, we'll go to
their homes, or to those living in nursing homes,'' says clinic
director Dr. Joanne Murabito.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these and other outreach efforts, about 85 percent
make it in for their regular appointments. And those who miss one
are likely to show up the next time around. Most drug-company
studies figure on the same dropout rate after only two years.
</P>
<P>
   For both cohort and offspring, the benefits of participation are
obvious. Although they're not paid, every two to four years they
receive a medical checkup that consists of a complete blood workup,
bone scan, eye exam and other high-tech tests. It's all free and,
as part of the study's contract with the town, results are
forwarded to the participants' family doctors with their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been on the cutting edge,'' says Edward F.
Clinton, 46, an architect and, along with eight other siblings (two
of whom have since died in accidents), is a member of the offspring
study. ``The first time I ever heard the term 'ultrasound' was at
Framingham.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps the study's most curious finding is the lack of
effect that being in the study has had on the health of the
individual participants _if you look at statistics, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than two-thirds of the original cohort, who
spent much of their lives as research subjects in a trial looking
at the causes of cardiovascular disease, have since died. The most
common cause of death? Cardiovascular disease, still the No. 1
cause of death overall in the entire U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And while the second generation of participants, like their
peers, have lower cholesterol rates, lower blood pressure and are
less likely to smoke, they're also fatter, on average, than their
parents _ just like their peers. In other words, having the study
here hasn't made Framingham a hotbed of healthy living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unrealistic to expect people to swim upstream
against their culture,'' Kannel says. ``Not only are people eating
more, we've also engineered physical activity out of our daily
lives. Today, people have to join a health club to get the kind of
exercise their grandparents used to get working on farms or doing
some other form of manual labor.''
</P>
<P>
   So is there another 50 years in Framingham's future? Study
director Dr. Daniel Levy, doesn't look quite that far down the
road. He does, however, have a 30-year plan.

   ``We spent our first 50 years looking at environmental factors
such as diet and smoking and their effects on disease,'' he says.
``Now we're using molecular genetics to explore how genes are
responsible for high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol,
Alzheimer's, and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy is also spearheading the Omni Study, in which 500 members
of Framingham's minority communities have been enrolled. It is
designed to see if established risk factors affect minorities
differently than the original cohort and offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But the most far-reaching of Levy's plans is recruitment of a
third generation of participants _ the grandchildren of the
original cohort. This study _ the one Antonioli hopes his three
sons will be asked to join _ would put Framingham in the unique
position among studies of having three generations of data to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As for Joe Antonioli, we phoned him after his checkup. His
numbers weren't perfect, but things are headed in the right
direction. And a scan of his neck revealed a suspicious speck,
perhaps the first sign of some narrowing of the carotid artery.
While troubling, it was spotted early so his doctor can keep a
close eye on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm on the right track,'' Antonioli says. ``Today was
the last day of school. Last year I'd have celebrated with a big
steak, or maybe some hamburgers. This year, we're having chicken
stir-fry.''

   Here are snapshots of some other important, large-scale clinical
trials:
</P>
<P>
   Nurses' Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1976
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 121,700 female registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Examine the link in women between hormones, diet,
exercise, and other life-style factors and a wide range of chronic
illnesses, including breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Postmenopausal hormone replacement
appears to decrease the risk of heart disease and all-cause
mortality, but may increase breast-cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Physicians' Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 22,071 male physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Study the effects of low-dose aspirin on heart attack
and of beta carotene supplements on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Low-dose aspirin reduces risk of heart
attack; beta carotene supplements neither reduce nor increase risks
of cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 5,888 men and women 65 years of age and older.
</P>
<P>
   Purpose: Investigate the similarities and differences in risk
factors for cardiovascular disease between older individuals and
those in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Major findings (so far): Many older adults have unrecognized
cardiovascular disease, which may not cause obvious symptoms but
does affect life span.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Health Study
</P>
<P>
   Year started: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Study subjects: 40,000 post-menopausal female nurses.

   Ask someone for a frank assessment of his fitness and you're
likely to hear something like: ``I may not look like I did in high
school but I'm certainly not as fat as Joe Dorf down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you're diligent about exercise, working out
regularly with great gusto, you may not be as fit as you think.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I sat in the office of Dr. Larry Golding while he
explained science's concept of fitness. An exercise physiologist,
the 72-year-old Golding is one of the most respected names in the
fitness field, holder of just about every honorarium imaginable,
including a distinguished professorship at the University of Nevada
Las Vegas where he teaches and does research.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that there are really three different
kinds of fitness _ flexibility, aerobic conditioning and
strength,'' said Golding. ``A lot of people lift weights and they
say, `Well I'm fit'. They're not fit. They're very fit in a limited
way. So you play tennis? Well that's better than not doing
anything. But there are studies that show that sports don't give
you much fitness and sometimes no fitness at all. Which is why
there isn't a serious athlete in the world that plays his sport to
get fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding paused for his conclusion: ``There are plenty of people
out there who think they are pretty fit. But I do think there is
some delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Voy was more blunt. Voy now has a family and sports
medicine practice just down the road from Golding's office. But for
years he has been involved with some the world's greatest athletes,
including a stint as chief medical officer for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, which is how he came to oversee world class athletes in
40 sports.
</P>
<P>
   The white-smocked Voy folded his hands on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes in various sports think they're in great shape. It's
interesting to note that they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   How fit are you really? At first glance the question might seem
strictly an exercise in vanity. It's not. Certainly your health,
genes and good fortune factor into how long and how well you will
live; no amount of pushups will stave off certain cancers or an
onrushing Peterbilt. But fitness is critical to your daily well
being and longevity too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the surgeon general issued a report that, possibly
because of its complexity and size (275 pages), was largely ignored
by the public. But the report's conclusions _ based on proven
research by the country's most respected fitness minds _ were
understandable enough. Inactivity, concluded the report, kills
about 250,000 American each year.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're reading this, this statistic obviously doesn't
include you. And since you are still conscious, your brain is
already unrolling a worn carpet of thought. I'm alive and kicking.
Why, I may even be young. Fitness testing is for middle-aged lardos
like Joe Dorf.
</P>
<P>
   Golding, of course, has heard this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had a professor who would say in lectures that we start
to dodder at about 26,'' he said. ``People would sit up and say,
`I'm 30. You mean I'm middle-aged?' Well, yes. Physiologically you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should you test your fitness? Well it just might provide a
wake up call.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I came to Las Vegas. I had received a call from
someone at Fashn Inc. The company, she claimed, had developed a
fitness test that was clear and simple. It would be packaged as a
CD Rom. You popped the disk into your home computer, performed a
few fitness tests, then punched in the results of your tests. The
program mulled them over, and, presto, in a matter of seconds you
received your true fitness age. The CD Rom was dubbed FitnessAge,
and the company would soon be selling it to the public for $70.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I was skeptical. Fitness has its legitimate
practitioners, but it also is home to more quacks than a duck
flyway. But the idea of a simple, objective fitness measure was
appealing. Better still, Golding and Voy had lent their names and
their expertise to the product, nit picking the fitness details to
make sure the FAShN folks got it right. (Both consulted on the
CD-Rom, receiving only expenses).
</P>
<P>
   And so I sat in FAShN's tidy offices listening to Steve Brazell,
the company's creative and marketing director, explain what
FitnessAge would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program tells you simply how old you are,'' explained
Steve Brazell, Fashn's creative and marketing director. ``Your
chronological age doesn't matter. It's how old your body is.''
</P>
<P>
   The software behind these calculations was complex, said
Brazell. But what the user ended up with was brutally clear. You
might be 38 by the calendar, but your fitness age might allow you
to collect social security.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in front of a computer, Brazell marched me through a
sample, a 57-year-old man who had performed the 3-minute step test,
pushups, sit-ups and waist and hip measurements the program
required to calculate one's age. Along with the ability to crunch
these facts, FitnessAge also contained some other innovative aids,
among them a library that explained fitness terms, outlined the
risk factors of inactivity (``Not exercising is worse for your
health than smoking'') and offered exercise prescriptions to
implement a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Brazell clicked the mouse and the anonymous guinea pig's results
flashed up on the screen. At 57, he had the cardiovascular fitness
of a 79-year-old, the strength of a 49-year-old, the flexibility of
a 35-year-old and the body composition of a 56-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   We may have been looking at one of Golding's delusional souls;
someone who went to the gym three days a week to lift weights and
stretch, and so considered himself in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' said Brazell, eyeballing the gent's heart and lung
tally. ``This guy's in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   I might have made light of his failings, but I was up next.
Brazell punched in my particulars, height, weight, resting heart
rate and age. Then while Brazell and some coworkers watched, I
marched through the FitnessAge tests. The procedure took 30
minutes, and it might have taken less time, had the three of them
not had such a jolly good time mocking my weaknesses, specifically
my flexibility which fell somewhere between stone and tungsten.
This made sense since, though I workout regularly, I never stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished Brazell entered the numbers and clicked the
mouse. At 38, my fitness age was 26, which will be a source of some
pride as soon as I can bend over to tie my shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Having an objective measure of your fitness, said Golding, is
certainly important as both a stick and a carrot. It can let you
know how far you've fallen and, assuming that lights a fire under
you, follow-up fitness tests at regular intervals can provide
wonderful incentive by showcasing your tremendous improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But owning up to delusion is just a step, said Golding, and it's
certainly not the most important one.
</P>
<P>
   Golding smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the desire to begin with.''

WHICH PARENT-KID BATTLES ARE WORTH FIGHTING?

 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids don't come into the world with good judgment, good manners
or even good sense. A large part of your job as a parent is finding
ways to get your kids to want to do what they should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   You could easily spend every waking moment engaged in a battle
to get your child to do the right thing. That's why it's so
important to learn to pick your battles.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you decide when an issue is worth fighting over? Or
when you need to take hold of something or not?
</P>
<P>
   To preserve good times, try to organize the behavioral traffic
in your family before you act. Is your child's behavior (digging in
the garden) acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   In this green-light area, no battle is needed. Or is your
child's behavior (running into the street) unacceptable? Then
you're in a red-light area, and it's important.
</P>
<P>
   But most parent-child problems occur in the yellow-light area,
where you're not sure whether the behavior (such as jumping on the
bed) is worth fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   What battles are you most likely to encounter? What
developmental issues are revealed by them? And how can you manage
the fights you choose? Let's examine each age by age:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 1/2 to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers seem willing to engage endlessly in struggles over the
smallest things (``I don't want a broken pretzel; I want a whole
one''). But your toddler is not just contrary. She's trying to
develop an independent sense, and one way she does this testing her
strength against yours.
</P>
<P>
   You're still the boss, and she's at your mercy; by challenging
your authority she builds her own (``Mommy gave me a different
pretzel!'').
</P>
<P>
   Also, your child's recent mastery of mobility can lead her to do
things that may be out-of-bounds, like floating her rubber duckie
in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This means that your no is constantly being challenged by her
wish to go. Because judgment has not caught up with her desire, her
behavior can be unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to communicate red-light areas clearly. If you
take things as they come, you'll battle all day long. Instead, take
every opportunity to help your child internalize rules by
verbalizing them as you go along (``We always hold hands when we
cross the street.'')
</P>
<P>
   The most worthwhile battles involve safety and security
(``Two-year-olds can't cut their apples with knives.'')
</P>
<P>
   Try to sidestep other issues, particularly on food or clothing.
These can provoke a toddler because they're ones in which you still
exercise much control.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick battles, you want to be able to resolve them, and
a stubborn toddler can defeat all your efforts (force-feeding is a
setup for disaster).
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that your toddler's mischief is often motivated
by curiosity. You may feel she is impossible when you find your
pantyhose on the floor, but to her, it's just exploring.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3 to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your pre-schooler is gaining control over his own body. His
insistence on self-reliance can cause many battles, since a child
this age is often trying to push you away - yet still needs help
(``I can tie my shoes, Daddy'').
</P>
<P>
   As your pre-schooler goes into the world, he also becomes more
aware of vulnerability. This realization causes his behavior to
alternate between clinging and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Battles at this age are most likely to be over bedtime
(pre-schoolers hate exclusion from grownup activities) and bodily
care (when he was younger, his body was under your control; now
he's struggling to bring it under his).
</P>
<P>
   Because children this age alternate between progressive and
regressive, one moment your child may want to sleep outside in a
tent, and the next may want you to wipe his tushy!
</P>
<P>
   To help your child integrate his wishes with his growing skills,
be sure to praise his accomplishments and try to avoid battles that
deflate his pride (criticizing the mess he made in the kitchen
instead of the good job he did mixing cookie dough).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6 to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By this age, your child has a firm sense of an independent self
and has learned many skills that will help her take care of
herself. Now she must leave the purely ``play days'' of early
childhood and move into the world.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is reflected in battles over homework, TV, and
chores, all characteristic of grade-schoolers. Since these are
years when your child will be learning habits for a lifetime,
battles are worthwhile, but you'll need to find a way to help your
child cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to encourage your grade-schooler to create a
study and chore routine (working at her desk with a comfortable
chair before dinner, then set the table).
</P>
<P>
   Children this age may still need you to remind them that it's
time for homework, but this doesn't mean yelling about
irresponsibility (``I can't believe it's 8 o'clock and you haven't
even begun to study your spelling words!'').
</P>
<P>
   By age 9 or 10, if she forgets to study for a test she'll need
to suffer the consequences and learn from them. Engaging in battles
with a school-age child or rescuing her at the last minute
interferes with her ability to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, try to avoid battles about friends, interests, or TV
choices (unless unsuitable). Kids this age are beginning to define
their own tastes, and your criticism can interfere with their
burgeoning self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10 to 12 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your pre-teen may seem to be revisiting his toddler years,
provoking the same kind of encounters that you remember from when
he was 2! But pre-teens bring a new level of risk and danger to the
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   When a 2-year-old refuses to eat, his favorite strawberries can
tempt him, but when an 11-year-old does so, a possible eating
disorder looms.
</P>
<P>
   When a 3-year-old ``runs away'' after an argument, he may hide
under the bed, but with a 12-year-old, he could be out all night.
This means that, more than ever, it's important to pick battles
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are apt to be about your pre-teen's wish for more
freedom (``Why can't I ride my bike to Joe's house?''). You need to
engage in these battles because they offer a chance to emphasize
that with freedom comes responsibility (``It's five miles away. If
I let you ride alone, you'll have to call me when you get there'').
</P>
<P>
   While reasoned discussion is always better than arguing, when
reason doesn't work you'll need to stand firm. Pre-teens may ask
for a lot of liberties, but they still need restraints. Even if
they protest, limits help them feel cared for. Blaming you for
curfews lets them remain ``cool'' with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid picking battles over his friends (criticism increases his
loyalty), clothing, or music he listens to. Save energy for things
that really matter, like smoking and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   By picking battles carefully and matching them to your child's
developmental needs, you'll be able to keep your connection to him
as he grows.

``Just because all the kids do it, that doesn't make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. Maybe I'm angry at Clinton because my family is
from New England, and we have a higher standard of hypocrisy. (As
such, I admit that I resent Clinton for contributing further to the
ruination of Martha's Vineyard, which was a peaceful place in the
'50s and '60s, with discreet summer people who kept their adultery
and celebrity low profile.)
</P>
<P>
   Back to the point: Clinton is the only president I know who has
confessed to doing ``it,'' as in ``It was wrong,'' with a young
woman, one who isn't his wife, in the Oval Office. What's
irritating is that he didn't really confess. He said he ``had a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't really apologize either, except to say ``I must
take complete responsibility for all my actions,'' something he has
been avoiding for years. Still, he played word games like the
semantic grandmaster of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even confess that he lied to the American people. He
spoke in fudge words, saying he ``misled'' people and left a
``false impression.'' He said his answers about his affair with
Monica Lewinsky were ``legally accurate'' but he did not
``volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if George Washington had been caught, ax in hand,
saying, ``I cannot leave a false impression, I had a relationship
with the cherry tree that was not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and if the tree had fallen without Ken Starr in the
forest, it wouldn't have made a sound.
</P>
<P>
   What a faker, this Clinton. Monday night he didn't even fake
groveling. His was the angry face of a spoiled child caught doing
what he'd always gotten away with. He didn't bite his lip in fake
contrition, as usual, but spent more than half of the speech
snapping at special prosecutor Ken Starr for ruining his life, his
family's life and, I suppose, his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Never trust a president who worries about his place in history.
Never trust a man who can't think of the consequences when he's
attracted to an employee almost as young as his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. Truman, the master of plain speaking, said, ``The only
thing new in the world is the history you don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman had to deal with the death of FDR, the atom bomb, the
Marshall plan, the need to integrate the armed forces, the blockade
of Berlin and the airlift, the Korean War and a Douglas MacArthur
who wanted to invade China.
</P>
<P>
   Truman had history thrust upon him and he had to act without
regret. He said he made decisions and never looked back. He did the
right things as he saw them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been a passive partner to history. He avoids
decisions. He does the right things according to polls. It's his
bad luck to live in uninteresting times for a chief executive, and
all-too interesting times for the Internet and the news media. It's
our bad luck to be inundated by horrible jokes and one-liners about
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The sign on Truman's desk famously said, ``The buck stops
here.'' Clinton should have had a sign on his desk in his own
language: ``The critical lapses in judgment and personal failures
for which I am solely and completely responsible stop here.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't stop, though. Too bad they started. The randy old
buck's place in history stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   Barring major world crises in the next two years, Clinton's
place in history definitely won't be with Truman, who didn't care
about his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the three recent presidents who were consumed by
visions of their place in history, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B.
Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. So far, Clinton's place seems to be
with Kennedy's libido, Johnson's paranoia and Nixon's Checkers
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should have named his dog Spot and brought it on TV. We
could have called the strange national event ``the out damned Spot
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Damn, I'm tired of jokes and outrage about this, even my own. I
just feel so let down by this bum I voted for six years ago and
welcomed as the young Elvis who would lead us.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether this graying Elvis has another comeback in
him, or whether he's doomed to be a mall-walking joke.
</P>
<P>
   We're not mad at Clinton because he committed adultery. We're
mad because he lied to us, conned decent aides and supporters into
backing up his lies, and continues to play games about whether he
lied.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists argue about whether there is such a thing as sex
addiction, but that's irrelevant. We know there are compulsive
liars.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm being too hard on this man, who is a modern
politician, after all. Perhaps I should use Clinton's language, and
substitute ``misled'' for ``lied.''
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a case of astoundingly arrogant
misleadership.

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the
cross-border institutions that unionists fear because nationalists
see them as embryos of an all-Irish government.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic fear may be well-founded: that the nationalists in
Northern Ireland will use the newly created assembly to advance a
nationalist and sectarian-Catholic agenda, rather than using it to
govern a divided province within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the world, recent settlements and
negotiations have included some form of renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South African whites renounced their right to rule.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, at least in negotiations,
recognized Israel's right to exist. Mikhail Gorbachev let communism
die.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, on the other hand, has agreed to take part in the
parliament of a province whose right to exist as part of the United
Kingdom it does not recognize. The IRA has neither formally nor
informally renounced its absolute opposition to British rule in any
part of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP),
which has always argued for peaceful politics, continues to press
for a united Ireland _ especially in the statements and speeches of
its leader, John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   It is, then, no mystery why unionists do not all gladly embrace
peace. They see the enemy against which they have fought for three
decades brought inside the pale of democratic politics and rewarded
with seats, ministerial posts and salaries _ without changing
position, apologizing for past murders or giving up any of its
large stock of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The largest uncertainty in the unionist mind is Irish
nationalism. For all of this century, Irish nationalism has been
variegated and has spoken with different accents, but in the end
saw itself as a family that, when challenged, would always put
unity before agreement with opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, no nationalist, no matter how reasonable,
peacefully inclined or constitutionally minded, would betray the
cause of a united Ireland, even if he might tut-tut at the methods
used by the IRA. The British were never a friendly neighboring
state or fellow member of the European Union. Where not the enemy
(as they were to the IRA), they were at least an obstacle to the
historic mission to unify.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein sold the agreement to their
followers on the understanding that it would lead to a united
Ireland sooner or later. Gerry Adams won assent from his doubting
organization by persuading it that peaceful means could advance the
republican agenda better than war.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the IRA has not handed in any weapons and has
consistently refused to countenance doing so. Weapons surrender has
been the great failure of the talks. They were supposed to be
surrendered before the talks began, while they were taking place,
and before Sinn Fein takes the seats it won in the June assembly
elections and before Adams gets the ministerial position to which
Sinn Fein's vote entitles him. The lack of any progress on this
front fuels unionist fears.
</P>
<P>
   The only issue that aggravates the unionists even more than
weapons is the release of terrorist prisoners. Although both
republican and loyalist terrorists are to be released, the former
greatly outnumber the latter, and their release causes much more
outrage in unionist areas than loyalist releases do in nationalist
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men to be released killed policemen; others gunned
down part-time members of the army reserve. Some were enforcers
within the nationalist community, where punishment for crimes such
as drug dealing is a bullet through one or both kneecaps, or for
suspected betrayal, death. Their release causes revulsion,
especially among members of the police force (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary) and former members of the army reserve.
</P>
<P>
   There is also fear as Sinn Fein continues to strive to overtake
the SDLP as the largest nationalist party by stressing the
discrimination and exclusion many Catholics still say they feel.
</P>
<P>
   The rarely voiced but always present factor in Northern
Ireland's politics is the ticking clock of demographics. Catholics
were little more than 30 percent of the population in the 1920s, at
the time of partition; they now account for well over 40 percent
and are still growing relative to the Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   While a significant minority of Catholics probably vote for a
unionist party, the overwhelming majority votes nationalist and can
be expected to continue to do so. When the number of Catholics
approaches a majority, Protestants who cannot bear the thought of
becoming part of a united Ireland may turn to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among unionists, loyalty to God, conscience, or both is more
highly esteemed than loyalty to a party leader. Further, the
messianism of republicanism is countered by a view that Ulster's
status as part of the United Kingdom is quasi-religious and
includes for many unionists a passionately felt loyalty to a
monarchy which remains Protestant (no Catholic can succeed to the
throne of Great Britain).
</P>
<P>
   These issues are large _ and the mood is delicate, especially in
the unionist camp. Indeed, the strains of mistrust and violence may
sink the peace process and produce a situation as dangerous as any
of the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it cannot be denied that, thus far, the changes are vast,
and the situation is more hopeful than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs used to go off nightly; the cities of Belfast,
Londonderry, and most towns and villages were saturated by police
and army troops, with endless roadblocks, body searches and random
questioning by patrols. The British and Irish governments were
coldly formal with each other; the old provincial parliament was
abolished and direct rule put in its place; much of the Catholic
working class was slipping toward the IRA, and Protestant
paramilitary groups were massing across the province.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though Belfast is not a showcase among British cities, it
has recovered something of its tranquillity and lost some of its
grimy, slummy industrial look _ rather like Glasgow, which it
resembles and whose industrial development was similar to its own.
</P>
<P>
   So much public money has been pumped into the province that its
infrastructure is better than most other parts of the United
Kingdom. The two great engineering plants in Belfast _ the
shipbuilders Harland and Wolff and the Shorts aircraft
manufacturers _ have been kept in existence through adroit placing
of state contracts. An erstwhile culinary desert and possessor of
thousands of smoky, men-only bars divided on sectarian lines now
has a rash of bistros, trendy restaurants, and comfortable hotels.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate nationalist has become mayor of Belfast, reflecting
both unionist division and a growing Catholic inner-city
population, and has won cautious assent from the moderate
unionists. The second main city, Londonderry, has been
nationalist-controlled for years. Apart from some flashpoints
around marching season, trouble has been relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   In all this visible improvement, ``relatively'' is the key word.
In all but the most solidly Protestant enclaves, which have been
largely untouched by the troubles, both communities are
distrustful, sometimes vengeful, with collective memories of
grievance that will last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Time is needed in which the main political figures have _ or
should have _ some space in which to create, rather than merely
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the 21st century, peace is a tall order, but the
agreement still gives hope it might be done, at last.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Boris Khodursky had just arrived in San
Francisco from Russia when he got the news: Russian President Boris
Yeltsin had devalued the ruble, slashing its value by one-third.
</P>
<P>
   The information was relayed by his son, Arkagy Khodursky, as the
men stopped in at a Russian bakery Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Khodursky was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have the least amount of money will be hurt the
most,'' he said through his son, who has lived in the United States
for six years.
</P>
<P>
   He had no comment about Yeltsin, who devalued the ruble on
Monday, but the younger Khodursky was bluntly critical of the
Russian president, who insisted last week that he had no intention
of devaluing the currency to shore up the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin is not very clever. He does things through trial and
error, and he makes many errors,'' Arkagy Khodursky said. ``He is a
typical Russian leader. Back through the time of the czars, they
are not well-educated, except for Lenin. They make decisions
emotionally. I hope this latest move on his part will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The news about the ruble was just beginning to hit home in the
Outer Richmond District, where San Francisco's prominent Russian
community is clustered around Russian churches, delicatessens,
bakeries and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   At Russian Books, proprietor Nina Sapelkin said her customers
were talking generally about tough times in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   One of her customers, translator Irina Dyatlovskaya, said she
regularly shipped goods back to Russia to help relatives. Often,
she said, she sends books published in the United States that are
unavailable back home or that are cheaper for her to buy here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the latest troubles could spark a new influx of
Russian immigration to the United States, Dyatlovskaya said
Washington wouldn't allow it. ``It's hard for Russian people to get
a visa to even travel here,'' she said. ``Not over there, but here.
The U.S. is afraid they will not go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired engineering consultant Alex Sapelkin said, ``I send
money. We all send money in U.S. dollars so they (relatives) can
open dollar accounts in banks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, he said, ``There is barely enough to live. Right now,
there will be less. Everything is going up. Your salary of $200 a
month will now buy only $150.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will affect the government,'' he said.
``Russia doesn't have anybody to substitute for Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Jewish Community Center, where many former Soviet Jews
congregate, there is little talk about the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Howitt, a language coordinator at the center, said most of
the clients ``are too poor to care or know anything about the
ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   Howitt said his clients spoke ``about the disoriented way that
Yeltsin is leading the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when Russia launched its free-market reforms, many
Russians have kept their savings in dollars to protect themselves
against inflation and fluctuations in the ruble. Russians keep the
brunt of their savings hidden at home.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, devaluation did not appear to portend a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Russian devaluation doesn't matter a heck of a lot
for the U.S.,'' said economist Jacob S. Dreyer, a Russian
specialist and head of JDA International, a consulting firm in
Alexandria, Va. ``I don't want to be too coy about that, but it
doesn't amount to much more than a big traffic jam.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. companies exported $689 billion in goods and raw
materials. Of that, $3.4 billion went to Russia, according to the
Commerce Department. Only $4.3 billion of the $871 billion in
imported goods came from Russia.

 &HT;    JAMAICAN GOVERNMENT LOOKS TO WHIZ KID IN DREADLOCKS TO GET
TOE-HOLD IN CYBERSPACE

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ He swoons over the Spice Girls. He mouths
off to his mother. He signs his name by drawing a smiley face --
flanked by dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this seemingly typical 13-year-old boy -- Makonnen David
Blake Hannah -- holds a lot of sway on this sunny Caribbean island
of 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's new technology consultant, the fidgety
teenager has the ears of Jamaica's most-influential politicos, with
a direct line to the Ministry of Commerce and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to keep me abreast of new technology,'' said
Phillip Paulwell, Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology.
``It is the young people who know about computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulwell, 36, began using computers three years ago. Hannah's
been honing his skills for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appointed Paulwell only last
January to head what was a newly created ministry on a
tourist-dependent island that's still, for the most part, a
technological wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, some 60 percent of all new jobs will require
technology-based skills by century's end, which doesn't bode well
for Jamaica, where only 35,000 to 40,000 people have logged on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hannah, who relishes karate and fast Japanese cars, the
focus of his ever-changing site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He's been charged with advising the government on computer
hardware and software and visiting schools to talk to young people
about the advantages of using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it makes him Jamaica's youngest-ever government
advisor, the one-year appointment doesn't seem to faze the worldly
youngster, who's visited several U.S. cities. His favorite? New
York and Orlando, by far. The best part may be the honorarium that
comes with it: a few dollars a week he'll use to go watch movies.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, self-assured adolescent who collects National
Geographic magazines and reads science textbooks for fun taught
himself how to program computers and clean up viruses. He's also an
accomplished Web page designer. Yet he speaks of these skills with
the nonchalance of someone who's just mastered inline skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can program a little bit, and I'm good at system design,
advanced Windows, DOS usage, stuff like that,'' said Hannah, with
saucer-like eyes and an easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was raised in the nice, solidly middle-class neighborhood
of Mona Heights, where streets have sidewalks, and neighbors might
include journalists and low-level politicians.
</P>
<P>
   An intermittent child actor, Hannah appeared on Nickelodeon a
few years ago in a segment that featured children from around the
world. For his part, Hannah showed viewers how much mildew had
accumulated on a coconut he'd left under his bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah parlayed a handful of acting gigs into an invitation to
attend the Chicago Children's Film Festival in 1995, which is where
he met Paulwell, who came away duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just extremely intelligent and full of energy,'' Paulwell
said. ``He knows more about computers than perhaps anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike another homegrown celebrity, Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, who
won the National Spelling Bee last May, Hannah is not a product of
Jamaica's public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's mother, novelist Barbara Blake, pulled her son out of
school at age five after a teacher scolded him with a smack on the
hand for questioning whether Jesus was really white.
</P>
<P>
   He's been home-schooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taught him what's relevant, and computers are all we have
to save us from a very poor education system,'' said Blake, who was
introduced to computers by an American friend. ``We live in a
global community and the computer is the best way for children to
be able to connect to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is a doting mother with strong opinions. She credits her
son's intelligence to six years of breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother, Hannah comes from a long line of
eccentric -- yet cerebral -- ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Evon Blake, was a famous journalist who decades
ago launched a Newsweek-like magazine in the Caribbean called
Spotlight. He had a penchant for pipes and white, shark-skin suits,
and is credited with breaking the color barrier here in the 1940s
by jumping into a whites-only swimming pool at a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had Life and Ebony magazines around the house, and
my father used a pen as his weapon,'' Barbara Blake said. ``My
father always encouraged me to think, which is what I've always
tried to pass on to my child.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has.
</P>
<P>
   Her son's as preoccupied with computers as other teenage boys
might be with girls.
</P>
<P>
   But he hardly looks the part of government advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A talented soccer player, he wears an Adidas jogging suit and
dreadlocks that stretch the length of his arms -- his matted
tendrils have never been cut.
</P>
<P>
   The rope-like locks draw double-takes, but are actually a tenet
of his family's faith in the Rastafarian religion.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Christianity, Rastafarianism stresses the
back-to-Africa teachings of Jamaican pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey
while advocating black unity. To believers, Ethiopia is like Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Rastafarian was reggae music star Bob Marley,
with whom Hannah shares a birthday on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unconventional appearance, Hannah says he mixes
easily with government types.
</P>
<P>
   He e-mails Paulwell almost every day and meets with him once a
week face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know what is on the Internet,'' Hannah said.
``He's real cool so he's easy to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in the daily newspaper here showed Paulwell
and Hannah in front of a computer playing Pac Man and sucking on
lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Paulwell, Hannah's job is nothing to snicker
at.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has yet to gain a toe-hold in Jamaica, some 550 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The island's future, Paulwell contends, rides on the knowledge
of the young. And that knowledge must be more technology-based.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious prodigy has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, like other less-developed islands, has been locked for
years out of the technology market because of high costs. A
computer with a 200 megahertz Intel Pentium processor that sells
for $520 in the United States would cost at least $1,200 in
Jamaica. With a per-capita income of about $1,500 a year, most
people here can't afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's in the midst of an economic recession that's left one
in three people living in poverty and nearly half of all young men
aged 16 to 25 unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's goal to put a computer in all of Jamaica's 997
public schools by the year 2000 is deceptively simple: many have
yet to install a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our teachers have never even used computers before,''
said Jean Beaumont, who provides computer training to teachers.
``Some find them complicated, and others are just very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, government officials warned that
date-recognition software -- a problem known as the ``millennium
bug'' -- won't be corrected before Jan. 1, 2000, and probably not
until the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But while his country struggles to gain some ground
technologically, working for Microsoft Inc. someday is what's
mostly on the mind of Hannah, who seems hungry for the trappings of
American mogulism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream would be to meet Bill Gates,'' Hannah said, turning
suddenly serious. ``The man has revolutionized the world.''

 FOR THE 21st CENTURY, A BEIGE AND BLACK AMERICA

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Just when you think you're ready for 21st-century America, it
changes on you yet again.
 &HT;    A few years ago, predictions that whites would eventually become
a minority group in the United States galvanized the multicultural
left _ and horrified the nativist right. More recently, news of the
growing number of mixed-race Americans has inspired the political
center with a vision of a true racial melting pot, one in which
white and black alike will blend into a universal brown.
 &HT;    But a closer look at demographic trends suggests that neither of
these futures _ a nonwhite majority, a uniformly ``beige'' society
_ will very likely come to pass. Instead, shifting patterns of
racial intermarriage suggest that the next century may see the
replacement of the historic white-black dichotomy in America with a
troubling new division, one between beige and black.
 &HT;    Racial intermarriage has long been a source of anxiety in
America. After World War II, Sen. Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi
defended white supremacy in a book titled ``Take Your Choice:
Separation or Mongrelization.''
 &HT;    Like other racists of his era, Bilbo believed that an inevitable
result of dismantling segregation would be the amalgamation of the
races through intermarriage. He was right: since the U.S. Supreme
Court, in Loving vs. Virginia (1967), struck down the last
antimiscegenation laws of the states, marriage across racial lines
has grown at a remarkable rate.
 &HT;    Between 1960 and 1990, interracial marriages in this country
skyrocketed by more than 800 percent. Roughly 1 in 25 American
married couples today are interracial.
 &HT;    In fact, there are at least 3 million children of mixed-race
parentage in the United States _ and this figure doesn't even
include the millions of Hispanic mestizos and black Americans who
have European and Indian ancestors. Perhaps the best-known
multiracial American is Tiger Woods, who has described himself as
``Cablinasian'': a mix of Caucasian, black, Native American and
Asian.
 &HT;    Oddly, the U.S. Census Bureau has yet to account properly for
the presence of mixed-race Americans. As a result, many of its
projections are off target. For example, the bureau has famously
predicted that in 2050, whites will make up 52.7 percent of the
U.S. population. (In 1990, it was 75.7 percent.) Hispanics will
account for 21.1 percent of the population; blacks, 15 percent, and
Asians, 10.1 percent.
 &HT;    Presumably, 2050 will be white America's last stand. But this
projection is dubious, because it assumes that for the next
half-century there will be absolutely no intermarriage among the
four major conventionally defined racial groups in the United
States: whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Each group is
supposed to somehow expand _ or decline _ in hermetic isolation.
 &HT;    But according to an analysis of the 1990 U.S. Census data for
persons ages 25-34 by Reynolds Farley, a demographer with the
Russell Sage Foundation, 31.6 percent of native-born Hispanic
husbands and 31.4 percent of native-born Hispanic wives had white
spouses.
 &HT;    The figures were even higher for Asians: 36 percent for
native-born Asian husbands and 45.2 percent for native-born Asian
wives. (In fact, Asian wives were as likely to marry white
Americans as they were to marry Asian-Americans.) The highest
intermarriage rates are those of American Indians. Majorities of
American Indian men (52.9 percent) and American Indian women (53.9
percent) married whites rather than American Indians (40.3 percent
and 37.2 percent, respectively).
 &HT;    And these figures, which themselves document the creolization of
America, undoubtedly understate the extent of racial intermarriage
that the 2000 Census will reveal.
 &HT;    Of course intermarriage rates vary by region. White men in
California in 1990 were more than six times as likely as Midwestern
white men to marry outside their race. Overall, interracial
marriages are more than twice as common in California (1 in 10 new
couples) as in the rest of the country (1 in 25).
 &HT;    According to the magazine Interrace, San Jose, San Diego and
Oakland are among the Top 10 cities for interracial couples.
America's racial complexion, then, will change more quickly on the
coasts than in the heartland.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the overall increase in intermarriage means that
both multicultural liberals and nativist conservatives have
misunderstood the major demographic trends in this country. There
is not going to be a nonwhite majority in the 21st century. Rather,
there is going to be a mostly white mixed-race majority.
 &HT;    The only way to stop this is to force all Hispanic and
Asian-Americans from now on to marry within their officially
defined groups. And that is not going to happen.
 &HT;    Thus, the old duality between whites and nonwhites is finally
breaking down. But don't cheer just yet. For what seems to be
emerging in the United States is a new dichotomy between blacks and
nonblacks. Increasingly, whites, Asians and Hispanics are creating
a broad community from which black Americans may be excluded.
 &HT;    Disparities in interracial marriages underline this problem.
Black-white marriages have risen from a reported 51,000 in 1960
(when they were still illegal in many states) to 311,000 in 1997.
Marriages between white men and black women, though still uncommon,
rose from 27,000 in 1980 to 122,000 in 1995.
 &HT;    Although black out-marriage rates have risen, they remain much
lower than out-marriage rates for Hispanics, Asians and American
Indians. For the 25-34 age group, only 8 percent of black men marry
outside their race. Less than 4 percent of black women do so.
 &HT;    While many blacks frown upon marriage by blacks to members of
other groups _ such relationships are viewed by some as disloyal _
it seems very unlikely that such conservative attitudes are more
pronounced among black Americans than among whites or Hispanic or
Asian immigrants.
 &HT;    The major cause of low black out-marriage rates may well be
anti-black prejudice _ the most enduring feature of the eroding
American caste system. Furthermore, antiblack prejudice is often
picked up by immigrants, when it is not brought with them from
their countries of origin.
 &HT;    In the past, the existence of an ``untouchable'' caste of blacks
may have made it easier for Anglo-Americans to fuse with more
recent European immigrants in an all-encompassing ``white''
community. Without blacks as a common ``other,'' the differences
between Anglo-Americans, German-Americans, Irish-Americans and
Italian-Americans might have seemed much more important.
 &HT;    Could this be occurring again? A Knight-Ridder poll taken in May
1997 showed that while respondents were generally comfortable with
intermarriage, a full 3 in 10 respondents opposed marriage between
blacks and whites.
 &HT;    In the 21st century, then, the U.S. population is not likely to
be crisply divided among whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and
American Indians. Nor is it likely to be split two ways, between
whites and nonwhites. Rather, we are most likely to see something
more complicated: a white-Asian-Hispanic melting-pot majority _ a
hard-to-differentiate group of beige Americans _ offset by a
minority consisting of blacks who have been left out of the melting
pot once again.
 &HT;    The political implications of this new racial landscape have not
yet been considered. On the positive side, the melting away of
racial barriers between Asians, Latinos and whites will prevent a
complete Balkanization of American society into tiny ethnic groups.
 &HT;    On the negative side, the division between an enormous,
mixed-race majority and a black minority might be equally
unhealthy. The new mixed-race majority, even if it were
predominantly European in ancestry, probably would not be moved by
appeals to white guilt.
 &HT;    Some of the new multiracial Americans might disingenuously
invoke an Asian or Hispanic grandparent to include themselves among
the victims rather than the victimizers. Nor would black Americans
find many partners for a ``rainbow coalition'' politics, except
perhaps among recent immigrants.
 &HT;    One political response to a beige-and-black America might be a
movement to institutionalize binationalism. In Canada, Anglophones
and Francophones have been declared the country's two ``founding
nations.''
 &HT;    Blacks, as a quasi-permanent minority, might insist upon a
status different from that of voluntary immigrants who merge with
the majority in a few generations. Such compromises, however, are
difficult to maintain. If most immigrants blend into one of the two
founding nations _ the Anglophone majority in Canada, the
mixed-race majority in the United States _ then working out a
stable modus vivendi between the expanding community and the
shrinking community becomes almost impossible.
 &HT;    The other possibility is that black Americans will, in time,
participate in the melting pot at rates comparable with other
groups. Such a result cannot and should not be the aim of public
policy _ how can you legislate romance? _ but it may be an
incidental result of greater social mobility and economic equality.
The evidence suggests that the association of people as equals
erodes even the oldest and deepest prejudice in American life.
 &HT;    According to the 1990 census, white men 25-34 in the U.S.
military were 2.3 times as likely to marry nonwhite women as
civilians. And white women in the same age group who served in the
military in the 1980s were seven times as likely as their civilian
counterparts to have black husbands.
 &HT;    Indeed, for all groups except for Asian men, military service
makes out-marriage much more likely. The reason for this is clear:
The U.S. military is the most integrated institution in American
society because it is the most egalitarian and meritocratic. It is
also _ not coincidentally _ the least libertarian and least
tolerant of subcultural diversity. It may be that in the nation as
a whole, as in the military, the integration of individuals can be
achieved only at the price of the sacrifice of lesser differences
to a powerful common identity.
 &HT;    In the end, racial intermarriage is a result, not a cause, of
racial integration. Racial integration, in turn, is a result of
social equality. The civil-rights revolution abolished racial
segregation by law, but not racial segregation by class. Ending
racial segregation by class might _ just might _ bring about an end
to race itself in America. It is certainly worth a try.

racial intermarriage suggest that the next century may see the
replacement of the historic white-black dichotomy in America with a
troubling new division, one between beige and black.
 &HT;    Racial intermarriage has long been a source of anxiety in
America. After World War II, Sen. Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi
defended white supremacy in a book titled ``Take Your Choice:
Separation or Mongrelization.''
 &HT;    Like other racists of his era, Bilbo believed that an inevitable
result of dismantling segregation would be the amalgamation of the
races through intermarriage. He was right: since the U.S. Supreme
Court, in Loving vs. Virginia (1967), struck down the last
antimiscegenation laws of the states, marriage across racial lines
has grown at a remarkable rate.
 &HT;    Between 1960 and 1990, interracial marriages in this country
skyrocketed by more than 800 percent. Roughly 1 in 25 American
married couples today are interracial.
 &HT;    In fact, there are at least 3 million children of mixed-race
parentage in the United States _ and this figure doesn't even
include the millions of Hispanic mestizos and black Americans who
have European and Indian ancestors. Perhaps the best-known
multiracial American is Tiger Woods, who has described himself as
``Cablinasian'': a mix of Caucasian, black, Native American and
Asian.
 &HT;    Oddly, the U.S. Census Bureau has yet to account properly for
the presence of mixed-race Americans. As a result, many of its
projections are off target. For example, the bureau has famously
predicted that in 2050, whites will make up 52.7 percent of the
U.S. population. (In 1990, it was 75.7 percent.) Hispanics will
account for 21.1 percent of the population; blacks, 15 percent, and
Asians, 10.1 percent.
 &HT;    Presumably, 2050 will be white America's last stand. But this
projection is dubious, because it assumes that for the next
half-century there will be absolutely no intermarriage among the
four major conventionally defined racial groups in the United
States: whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Each group is
supposed to somehow expand _ or decline _ in hermetic isolation.
 &HT;    But according to an analysis of the 1990 U.S. Census data for
persons ages 25-34 by Reynolds Farley, a demographer with the
Russell Sage Foundation, 31.6 percent of native-born Hispanic
husbands and 31.4 percent of native-born Hispanic wives had white
spouses.
 &HT;    The figures were even higher for Asians: 36 percent for
native-born Asian husbands and 45.2 percent for native-born Asian
wives. (In fact, Asian wives were as likely to marry white
Americans as they were to marry Asian-Americans.) The highest
intermarriage rates are those of American Indians. Majorities of
American Indian men (52.9 percent) and American Indian women (53.9
percent) married whites rather than American Indians (40.3 percent
and 37.2 percent, respectively).
 &HT;    And these figures, which themselves document the creolization of
America, undoubtedly understate the extent of racial intermarriage
that the 2000 Census will reveal.
 &HT;    Of course intermarriage rates vary by region. White men in
California in 1990 were more than six times as likely as Midwestern
white men to marry outside their race. Overall, interracial
marriages are more than twice as common in California (1 in 10 new
couples) as in the rest of the country (1 in 25).
 &HT;    According to the magazine Interrace, San Jose, San Diego and
Oakland are among the Top 10 cities for interracial couples.
America's racial complexion, then, will change more quickly on the
coasts than in the heartland.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the overall increase in intermarriage means that
both multicultural liberals and nativist conservatives have
misunderstood the major demographic trends in this country. There
is not going to be a nonwhite majority in the 21st century. Rather,
there is going to be a mostly white mixed-race majority.
 &HT;    The only way to stop this is to force all Hispanic and
Asian-Americans from now on to marry within their officially
defined groups. And that is not going to happen.
 &HT;    Thus, the old duality between whites and nonwhites is finally
breaking down. But don't cheer just yet. For what seems to be
emerging in the United States is a new dichotomy between blacks and
nonblacks. Increasingly, whites, Asians and Hispanics are creating
a broad community from which black Americans may be excluded.
 &HT;    Disparities in interracial marriages underline this problem.
Black-white marriages have risen from a reported 51,000 in 1960
(when they were still illegal in many states) to 311,000 in 1997.
Marriages between white men and black women, though still uncommon,
rose from 27,000 in 1980 to 122,000 in 1995.
 &HT;    Although black out-marriage rates have risen, they remain much
lower than out-marriage rates for Hispanics, Asians and American
Indians. For the 25-34 age group, only 8 percent of black men marry
outside their race. Less than 4 percent of black women do so.
 &HT;    While many blacks frown upon marriage by blacks to members of
other groups _ such relationships are viewed by some as disloyal _
it seems very unlikely that such conservative attitudes are more
pronounced among black Americans than among whites or Hispanic or
Asian immigrants.
 &HT;    The major cause of low black out-marriage rates may well be
anti-black prejudice _ the most enduring feature of the eroding
American caste system. Furthermore, antiblack prejudice is often
picked up by immigrants, when it is not brought with them from
their countries of origin.
 &HT;    In the past, the existence of an ``untouchable'' caste of blacks
may have made it easier for Anglo-Americans to fuse with more
recent European immigrants in an all-encompassing ``white''
community. Without blacks as a common ``other,'' the differences
between Anglo-Americans, German-Americans, Irish-Americans and
Italian-Americans might have seemed much more important.
 &HT;    Could this be occurring again? A Knight-Ridder poll taken in May
1997 showed that while respondents were generally comfortable with
intermarriage, a full 3 in 10 respondents opposed marriage between
blacks and whites.
 &HT;    In the 21st century, then, the U.S. population is not likely to
be crisply divided among whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and
American Indians. Nor is it likely to be split two ways, between
whites and nonwhites. Rather, we are most likely to see something
more complicated: a white-Asian-Hispanic melting-pot majority _ a
hard-to-differentiate group of beige Americans _ offset by a
minority consisting of blacks who have been left out of the melting
pot once again.
 &HT;    The political implications of this new racial landscape have not
yet been considered. On the positive side, the melting away of
racial barriers between Asians, Latinos and whites will prevent a
complete Balkanization of American society into tiny ethnic groups.
 &HT;    On the negative side, the division between an enormous,
mixed-race majority and a black minority might be equally
unhealthy. The new mixed-race majority, even if it were
predominantly European in ancestry, probably would not be moved by
appeals to white guilt.
 &HT;    Some of the new multiracial Americans might disingenuously
invoke an Asian or Hispanic grandparent to include themselves among
the victims rather than the victimizers. Nor would black Americans
find many partners for a ``rainbow coalition'' politics, except
perhaps among recent immigrants.
 &HT;    One political response to a beige-and-black America might be a
movement to institutionalize binationalism. In Canada, Anglophones
and Francophones have been declared the country's two ``founding
nations.''
 &HT;    Blacks, as a quasi-permanent minority, might insist upon a
status different from that of voluntary immigrants who merge with
the majority in a few generations. Such compromises, however, are
difficult to maintain. If most immigrants blend into one of the two
founding nations _ the Anglophone majority in Canada, the
mixed-race majority in the United States _ then working out a
stable modus vivendi between the expanding community and the
shrinking community becomes almost impossible.
 &HT;    The other possibility is that black Americans will, in time,
participate in the melting pot at rates comparable with other
groups. Such a result cannot and should not be the aim of public
policy _ how can you legislate romance? _ but it may be an
incidental result of greater social mobility and economic equality.
The evidence suggests that the association of people as equals
erodes even the oldest and deepest prejudice in American life.
 &HT;    According to the 1990 census, white men 25-34 in the U.S.
military were 2.3 times as likely to marry nonwhite women as
civilians. And white women in the same age group who served in the
military in the 1980s were seven times as likely as their civilian
counterparts to have black husbands.
 &HT;    Indeed, for all groups except for Asian men, military service
makes out-marriage much more likely. The reason for this is clear:
The U.S. military is the most integrated institution in American
society because it is the most egalitarian and meritocratic. It is
also _ not coincidentally _ the least libertarian and least
tolerant of subcultural diversity. It may be that in the nation as
a whole, as in the military, the integration of individuals can be
achieved only at the price of the sacrifice of lesser differences
to a powerful common identity.
 &HT;    In the end, racial intermarriage is a result, not a cause, of
racial integration. Racial integration, in turn, is a result of
social equality. The civil-rights revolution abolished racial
segregation by law, but not racial segregation by class. Ending
racial segregation by class might _ just might _ bring about an end
to race itself in America. It is certainly worth a try.

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ He swoons over the Spice Girls. He mouths
off to his mother. He signs his name by drawing a smiley face --
flanked by dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this seemingly typical 13-year-old boy -- Makonnen David
Blake Hannah -- holds a lot of sway on this sunny Caribbean island
of 2.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's new technology consultant, the fidgety
teenager has the ears of Jamaica's most-influential politicos, with
a direct line to the Ministry of Commerce and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to keep me abreast of new technology,'' said
Phillip Paulwell, Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology.
``It is the young people who know about computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulwell, 36, began using computers three years ago. Hannah's
been honing his skills for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister P.J. Patterson appointed Paulwell only last
January to head what was a newly created ministry on a
tourist-dependent island that's still, for the most part, a
technological wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, some 60 percent of all new jobs will require
technology-based skills by century's end, which doesn't bode well
for Jamaica, where only 35,000 to 40,000 people have logged on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hannah, who relishes karate and fast Japanese cars, the
focus of his ever-changing site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He's been charged with advising the government on computer
hardware and software and visiting schools to talk to young people
about the advantages of using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it makes him Jamaica's youngest-ever government
advisor, the one-year appointment doesn't seem to faze the worldly
youngster, who's visited several U.S. cities. His favorite? New
York and Orlando, by far. The best part may be the honorarium that
comes with it: a few dollars a week he'll use to go watch movies.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, self-assured adolescent who collects National
Geographic magazines and reads science textbooks for fun taught
himself how to program computers and clean up viruses. He's also an
accomplished Web page designer. Yet he speaks of these skills with
the nonchalance of someone who's just mastered inline skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can program a little bit, and I'm good at system design,
advanced Windows, DOS usage, stuff like that,'' said Hannah, with
saucer-like eyes and an easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah was raised in the nice, solidly middle-class neighborhood
of Mona Heights, where streets have sidewalks, and neighbors might
include journalists and low-level politicians.
</P>
<P>
   An intermittent child actor, Hannah appeared on Nickelodeon a
few years ago in a segment that featured children from around the
world. For his part, Hannah showed viewers how much mildew had
accumulated on a coconut he'd left under his bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah parlayed a handful of acting gigs into an invitation to
attend the Chicago Children's Film Festival in 1995, which is where
he met Paulwell, who came away duly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just extremely intelligent and full of energy,'' Paulwell
said. ``He knows more about computers than perhaps anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike another homegrown celebrity, Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, who
won the National Spelling Bee last May, Hannah is not a product of
Jamaica's public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's mother, novelist Barbara Blake, pulled her son out of
school at age five after a teacher scolded him with a smack on the
hand for questioning whether Jesus was really white.
</P>
<P>
   He's been home-schooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taught him what's relevant, and computers are all we have
to save us from a very poor education system,'' said Blake, who was
introduced to computers by an American friend. ``We live in a
global community and the computer is the best way for children to
be able to connect to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is a doting mother with strong opinions. She credits her
son's intelligence to six years of breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his mother, Hannah comes from a long line of
eccentric -- yet cerebral -- ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Evon Blake, was a famous journalist who decades
ago launched a Newsweek-like magazine in the Caribbean called
Spotlight. He had a penchant for pipes and white, shark-skin suits,
and is credited with breaking the color barrier here in the 1940s
by jumping into a whites-only swimming pool at a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had Life and Ebony magazines around the house, and
my father used a pen as his weapon,'' Barbara Blake said. ``My
father always encouraged me to think, which is what I've always
tried to pass on to my child.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has.
</P>
<P>
   Her son's as preoccupied with computers as other teenage boys
might be with girls.
</P>
<P>
   But he hardly looks the part of government advisor.
</P>
<P>
   A talented soccer player, he wears an Adidas jogging suit and
dreadlocks that stretch the length of his arms -- his matted
tendrils have never been cut.
</P>
<P>
   The rope-like locks draw double-takes, but are actually a tenet
of his family's faith in the Rastafarian religion.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Christianity, Rastafarianism stresses the
back-to-Africa teachings of Jamaican pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey
while advocating black unity. To believers, Ethiopia is like Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Rastafarian was reggae music star Bob Marley,
with whom Hannah shares a birthday on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unconventional appearance, Hannah says he mixes
easily with government types.
</P>
<P>
   He e-mails Paulwell almost every day and meets with him once a
week face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know what is on the Internet,'' Hannah said.
``He's real cool so he's easy to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in the daily newspaper here showed Paulwell
and Hannah in front of a computer playing Pac Man and sucking on
lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Paulwell, Hannah's job is nothing to snicker
at.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has yet to gain a toe-hold in Jamaica, some 550 miles
south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The island's future, Paulwell contends, rides on the knowledge
of the young. And that knowledge must be more technology-based.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious prodigy has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, like other less-developed islands, has been locked for
years out of the technology market because of high costs. A
computer with a 200 megahertz Intel Pentium processor that sells
for $520 in the United States would cost at least $1,200 in
Jamaica. With a per-capita income of about $1,500 a year, most
people here can't afford a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's in the midst of an economic recession that's left one
in three people living in poverty and nearly half of all young men
aged 16 to 25 unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's goal to put a computer in all of Jamaica's 997
public schools by the year 2000 is deceptively simple: many have
yet to install a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our teachers have never even used computers before,''
said Jean Beaumont, who provides computer training to teachers.
``Some find them complicated, and others are just very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, government officials warned that
date-recognition software -- a problem known as the ``millennium
bug'' -- won't be corrected before Jan. 1, 2000, and probably not
until the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But while his country struggles to gain some ground
technologically, working for Microsoft Inc. someday is what's
mostly on the mind of Hannah, who seems hungry for the trappings of
American mogulism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream would be to meet Bill Gates,'' Hannah said, turning
suddenly serious. ``The man has revolutionized the world.''

   CLINTON-COLUMN (Undated) It's heartening to learn that Bill
Clinton is capable of embarrassment. At least, he says he is _ for
what little that's worth. He told us Monday night that he
``misled'' us and his family about his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky out of ``a desire to protect myself from the
embarrassment of my own conduct.'' Was he embarrassed as well about
having persisted in a lie for seven months? He didn't say. It also
should put our minds at rest to learn Clinton never pressured
anyone to lie under oath. Of course, he's hardly a credible source
of information on that question. Or on any other question, for that
matter. How can we ever again believe anything this man says?Let's
face it: Bill Clinton is finished.

ARSENIC AND OLD EVERETT _ QUESTIONS OF SCIENCE AND LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February 1912, two months before the sinking of the Titanic,
the American Smelting and Refining Co. closed its arsenic mill at
Everett. Today the same company, Asarco, is faced with an
incriminating stain in the city soil.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are both science and law, both of them uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The science is the question of how much arsenic it takes to make
people sick. Since the 19th century, arsenic has been associated
with cancers of the testicles, skin and lung among smelter workers
who inhaled arsenic dust. But would children at play be at risk
from arsenic in the soil?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists don't know. ``There are no good studies that are
directly looking at harm from soils at these levels of exposure,''
says Jim W. White, toxicologist for the state's Department of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   White's department released a study in 1993 of people who grew
up near Asarco's Tacoma smelter. As kids they had inhaled the air
had played in the dirt. The study found no increase in cancers
decades later.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett site was covered with houses from the 1940s to the
1990s. There was no surge in cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But safety is more complicated than that. It depends on what
level of confidence you want. (The state would like the risk to be
one in a million). It depends on how much dirt you assume a child
eats per day. (The state assumes 200 milligrams.) It depends on
whether you assume arsenic is dangerous at trace amounts. (The
state assumes it is.)
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency, which had jurisdiction over
Asarco's Tacoma site, set the cleanup standard at 230 parts per
million or ppm. The state Department of Ecology's standard for an
industrial site is 200 ppm; for a residential site, 20 ppm. Its
model actually says 2 ppm, but natural dirt often has 20. Mary
Burg, Ecology's manager for toxics cleanup, says, ``We don't make
people clean up cleaner than nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Asarco first offered a cleanup to 230 ppm, then 100. The state
is holding out for 20. Which is appropriate? White, the state's
toxicologist, says his review of hundreds of articles on arsenic
suggests that ``20 is an appropriately protective level.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a statewide standard applied to many other sites,
Burg says. ``What Asarco is asking us to do is to throw that out
the window, and go back to arguing every site.''
</P>
<P>
   Asarco hired consulting toxicologist Mary Beck, formerly of the
EPA. She says 20 ppm is based on a linear model that assumes any
amount above zero is bad. Humans need a bit of arsenic, she writes,
and that we get more of it from food than we'll ever get by licking
dirty fingers.
</P>
<P>
   I consulted a third toxicologist, Prof. David Eaton, director of
the University of Washington's Center for Ecogentics and
Environmental Health. He has ``substantial concern'' about arsenic
in soil at more than 1,000 ppm, and little concern at less than
200.
</P>
<P>
   Would he accept the company's offer of 100?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would,'' he said. ``I don't think the difference in the risk
between 20 and 100 is measurable.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in cost is considerable. Asarco has spent $10
million in Everett and has done little more than buy 37 houses. On
the wall of its office there is a map of that arsenic stain. It is
brightly colored, with concentrations of above 1,000 ppm at the
plant site, then fades in concentric rings. ``To chase 20 parts per
million, you could keep going and going,'' says site manager Tom
Aldrich.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the legal issue. The 20-parts standard was set
under the Model Toxics Control Act, an initiative written by
environmentalists and passed by Washington voters in 1988. On July
30, Asarco challenged the law in Thurston County Superior Court. It
argues that to impose the standards of 1988 on actions taken in
1912 is ``fundamentally unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That argument has been tried and lost. But that was before
Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, which the U.S. Supreme Court handed
down June 15. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the high court struck down a law
that forced coal companies to pay health premiums for former
workers. The law, wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, ``is unrelated
to any commitment that the employers made or to any injury they
caused,'' and ``operates retroactively, reaching back 30 to 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Justices Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas called that a
taking of private property; Justice Kennedy saw it as a violation
of due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the case in ``Toxics Law Reporter,'' law professor
Alfred Light called the ruling ``an implicit invitation'' to
challenge clean-up laws with retroactive liability.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco is offering Everett as a test case, arguing both the
science and the law. Its case, says Ecology's Burg, ``strikes at
the heart of the Model Toxics Act.''

WHY SHOULD WE EVER BELIEVE ANYTHING BILL CLINTON TELLS US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SOLVEIG TORVIK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's heartening to learn that Bill Clinton is capable of
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   At least, he says he is _ for what little that's worth.
</P>
<P>
   He told us Monday night that he ``misled'' us and his family
about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky out of ``a
desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he embarrassed as well about having persisted in a lie for
seven months? He didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   It also should put our minds at rest to learn Clinton never
pressured anyone to lie under oath. Of course, he's hardly a
credible source of information on that question. Or on any other
question, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   How can we ever again believe anything this man says?
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Bill Clinton is finished.
</P>
<P>
   He's demeaned the presidency and himself. He may hang on by his
fingernails and manage to complete his term, but he will not be
attending to the business we hired him to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   He's an exceedingly troublesome, high-maintenance,
low-productivity employee whose ongoing legal difficulties will
cost us, his employers, even more millions. Meanwhile, the
controversy over his behavior will further paralyze the government.
</P>
<P>
   Not once during his short, forced mea culpa Monday night did the
``s'' word ever cross Clinton' lips. The ``s'' word being shame.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no other word than shame to describe what Clinton's
base behavior has brought to the presidency and to the nation. It
has further lowered the public's respect for politicians and for
the country's political system. This is dangerous for our democracy
and harmful to the republic.
</P>
<P>
   In the past when Clinton has had to confess his transgressions
in public, he's been a perfect picture of contrition and humility.
He's a master manipulator, and he's had lots of experience in
manipulating people into giving him yet another chance.
</P>
<P>
   We should have seen what was coming: This was a man who smoked
marijuana but didn't inhale; one who avoided the draft but who
didn't really try to dodge it.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents telegraphed a pattern of convenient
compartmentalizing of bad behavior, of the hair-splitting and
evasion that has become the hallmark of his disappointing
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has all the earmarks of a man without a moral center.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night there was none of that calculated humility that has
served him so well in the past. There were excuses, however: He
didn't tell the truth about his behavior because he was trying to
protect his family. But the time to think of protecting his family
was before indulging himself with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the din of legalistic and political parsing of
the scandal are certain fundamental elements of this sordid chapter
of American history that need to stay front and center:
</P>
<P>
   First, we didn't elect Clinton to turn the Oval Office and its
precincts into a pornographic playroom.
</P>
<P>
   We have no right to expect perfection in presidents; Jesus
Christ is not standing for office. But where much is given, much is
expected. So we do have every right to expect a certain standard of
decent behavior from those we honor with leadership of the nation.
If presidents cannot be expected to comport themselves within the
basic bounds of decency and propriety, of whom can we ask it?
</P>
<P>
   Nor did we elect Clinton to gratify his sexual appetites with
the hired help _ however compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky may fit the archaic, pre-Sexual Revolution
definition of a loose woman, but there's no escaping the fact that
Clinton was the most powerful man on the planet and she was a
powerless intern as young as his own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The country is littered with hapless ex-bosses who lost their
jobs over much less appalling sexual impropriety with subordinates.
Feminist blather about consensual sex to the contrary, Clinton had
the classic advantage of power in this calamitous conjugation of
two needy people. Even if Lewinsky threw herself at him, he,
supposedly, is the grown-up here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a grown-up, however, what we have in the White House
is an admitted liar, a world-class hypocrite who pays lip service
to ``family values'' and a man of incredibly flawed judgment in
whom we have vested the awesome responsibility of commander in
chief of the world's sole superpower.
</P>
<P>
   But if this man cannot control himself, how can he be entrusted
with the immense power of the presidency?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly has asked for our trust but repeatedly has
shown that he is to be neither trusted nor believed. His political
legacy is a long list of broken promises. In short, he is not a man
of his word.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to take him seriously? He's become a smutty joke.
</P>
<P>
   How can a man thus crippled govern?
</P>
<P>
   The personal tragedy of Bill Clinton is that he's uniquely
gifted with talent for leadership but has shown himself unfit to
lead. His was a presidency of great promise, but he's thrown it
away.
</P>
<P>
   If he truly cares about his family, Clinton should seek
professional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And if he truly cares about the nation, there's still one
honorable, redeeming thing left for Bill Clinton to do: resign.

SUBDUED HILLARY CLINTON SIGNALS A STEADY LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is a politician who said, ``I
feel your pain.'' Tuesday, it was Hillary Rodham Clinton's pain
that was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   The usually ebullient first lady walked silently _ no waves or
smiles or small talk with her husband _ across the White House
South Lawn to a waiting helicopter. She clutched the left hand of
daughter Chelsea, who held onto the president with her right.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clintons left for a vacation on Martha's Vineyard, Marsha
Berry, the first lady's spokeswoman, stated the obvious when she
said, ``This is certainly not one of the best days of her life.''
President Clinton admitted to the nation Monday night that he had
an extramarital affair with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky and had not told his wife the truth about it until last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord knows what that conversation must have been like,'' said
Jane Moss, a professor of women's studies at Colby College and a
Wellesley College classmate of Mrs. Clinton's. ``She's got to be
hurt. &UR;  &LR; She has to be in great pain to have the entire universe know
her husband was fooling around with a 21-year-old in the White
House, right under her nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admire Hillary's grace in these extraordinarily
hard times,'' Moss said. ``She's a woman of dignity in a Jerry
Springer world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the country does admire Mrs. Clinton. Her approval
ratings in opinion polls have never been higher. She is somewhat
more popular among women than men, and recent polls have shown her
support growing among older, Republican women who initially were
cool to a feminist first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Some note that it took a very traditional role _ that of the
long-suffering spouse _ to get the public to embrace Mrs. Clinton,
who came to the White House in 1993 as a career woman and policy
wonk. Others recognize that the first lady has never been more
powerful than she is right now, with her husband's future
depending, in part, on whether his family can forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton called Berry to offer some reassuring
words, which were relayed to the staff and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is committed to her marriage, and she loves her husband
and her daughter very much,'' Berry said. ``She believes in her
husband, and her love for him is compassionate and steadfast. She
is clearly uncomfortable with how her personal life has been made
so public.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said Mrs. Clinton, a Methodist, also was relying on ``a
strong religious faith.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited the White
House Sunday night, reportedly at the request of 18-year-old
Chelsea Clinton, to pray with Mrs. Clinton and her daughter for two
hours. Jackson later praised Mrs. Clinton for her strength and love
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it seemed far-fetched that the savvy Mrs. Clinton was
the last to know what the majority of Americans, according to the
polls, already believed: that the president had committed adultery
with Lewinsky and was lying about it. ``She certainly was misled,''
Berry said. ``She learned the nature of his testimony over the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is, after all, history: In his January deposition in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, the president admitted
he had sexual relations ``once'' with Gennifer Flowers, the woman
whose allegations about a 12-year affair nearly ended Clinton's
1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find Mrs. Clinton to be kind of an enabler in all of this,''
said Michael Cromartie, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public
Policy Center, a private group. ``How many times will it take until
she says, `My status and career aren't as important as this man who
abuses my covenant relationship with him?' She's made a calculated
career bargain, and it doesn't square with the principles of her
feminism.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven months, Mrs. Clinton's calculations have been
focused mainly on deflecting allegations against her husband about
the Lewinsky investigation. In January, she emerged as the
president's staunchest defender, firmly denying that he had had an
affair and accusing independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and a
``right-wing conspiracy'' of hounding her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ``Today'' show, Mrs. Clinton was asked
hypothetically if a president should resign if he committed
adultery and lied about it. ``If all that were proven true, I think
that would be a very serious offense,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``That
is not going to be proven true.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and political strategist, Mrs. Clinton was intimately
involved in preparations for her husband's testimony before Starr's
grand jury Monday, and White House aides say she had a hand in
making the president's televised confession as defiant as it was
contrite. Few doubt that she will continue to play a critical role
as the drama unfolds in the weeks and months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is politically ambitious, she is personally ambitious, she
has values she wants to advocate, and she has a continuing stake in
being seen positively,'' said Richard Winters, a professor of
government at Dartmouth College. ``I don't see these interests
being advanced by sinking back, being silent, and not standing by
her man.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mrs. Clinton believe she has the political skills to
keep a stiff upper lip through what promises to be a difficult
period. But they also say they expect considerable private pain for
her while the president tries to ``reclaim my family life,'' as he
pledged Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Chambers, a former Democratic leader in the New Hampshire
Legislature, remembers when the Gennifer Flowers story broke during
the primary campaign in the state. Publicly, Mrs. Clinton was
poised; in private, she cried, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not cynical enough to think she does what she does to save
her career or his,'' Chambers said. ``I think she decided a long
time ago that sticking it out, for the sake of her husband and
daughter, was the wisest thing. It's what a lot of women do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Grunwald, a political consultant and old friend of the
Clintons, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the people who actually took the `for better or
worse' vow seriously, and boy, has she gotten both,'' Grunwald
said. ``I'm sure it's tough. It's corny, but she loves the guy. I'm
sure she was furious, but that doesn't mean she gives up on her
marriage.''

EMPLOYEE STRENGTHS CAN TURN INTO WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The best skill you can ever have in any job is
the ability to read the handwriting on the wall. Unfortunately for
a lot of workers _ particularly seasoned ones _ the messages seem
to be written in invisible ink.
</P>
<P>
   We all know our strengths, or at least we think we do. But
sometimes the very things that helped us get to one level are
stopping us from moving ahead _ or even staying employed.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the main themes behind ``Jump-Start Your Career,''
a thought-provoking book by Lois Frankel, a Southern California
psychotherapist and consultant. The book, which used to be called
``Overcoming Your Strengths,'' offers several quizzes and case
studies that might open your eyes about why you have problems in
your current job or why you aren't moving up or getting hired the
way you should.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the book is that it doesn't get into
psychobabble and the ``find the work you love'' theme, which have
been hammered to death, but instead brings up points that are easy
to overlook: things women tend to do more than men that weaken
their communication skills, how being a perfectionist can get you
in trouble, even that sometimes people can be too good looking for
their own good.
</P>
<P>
   My two cents: One big career mistake people often make is being
too comfortable. They find a job they're ready to hold for the rest
of their career in a seemingly stable company, so they stop doing
things like networking and paying attention to what's happening in
their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does that make them less effective as employees, it
leaves them in a tough position if they get fired or the company
goes out of business. They are no longer up to date on industry
trends and they have a weak network, two huge obstacles to landing
another job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that once you need a relationship,
it's too late to build it,'' Frankel writes. ``This is what makes
building relationships on an ongoing basis so important. It can't
be done simply for the purpose of knowing that you might have to
call on it at some time. It must be done because you value people
and your relationships with them.''
</P>
<P>
   She says workers need to understand the quid pro quo, offering a
favor in exchange for another favor. Business usually isn't done as
bluntly as that, she adds, but people are more likely to do favors
for those who have done favors for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without realizing it, we are exchanging things with people all
the time,'' she writes. ``Many relationships fail when the quid pro
quo isn't recognized or when it changes without the consent or
acknowledgment of one or both of the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   People often underestimate the importance of ``doorway
conversations'' in career success, Frankel says. They are so
concerned with doing their job to perfection that they don't
realize that a crucial part of it is working well with others,
gaining respect and support from colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   People often are misled about this, she adds, because employers
might hire them based on technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once on the job, however, when the playing field is level with
equally qualified employees, it is the more subtle behaviors that
differentiate the fast-trackers from those who remain stagnant.
Those with superior interpersonal skills, combined with technical
capability, are perceived as a more valuable asset than those who
exhibit only technical competence.''
</P>
<P>
   People who are particularly good looking can run into the same
kind of plateau, Frankel warns. In the book, she describes how she
told one salesman to tone down his looks because they were blocking
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't take him seriously,'' she writes. ``They
couldn't get past his looks. His colleagues tended to feel somewhat
inferior in his presence and sabotaged his efforts by withholding
essential information and upstaging him at sales conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   The way other people perceive you is crucial to your career,
Frankel says, and people often sabotage themselves through their
behavior. She says many women weaken their communication skills by
asking questions instead of making statements, or apologizing when
a misunderstanding has occurred even though it wasn't their fault.
</P>
<P>
   She gave the example of employees who want a day off. Many women
ask if they can have the day off, Frankel says, while men often
simply say they are taking the day off and expect the boss to speak
up if there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, we expect children to ask permission, not
adults,'' she writes. ``When women ask permission, they set
themselves up to hear `no.'''

US `ARMS PROLIFERATION' IS BUSINESS AS USUAL IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In her tiny office at the end of a maze-like corridor
in a sprawling Moscow research institute, Ludmila Khromova hardly
resembles a threat to America's national security.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Clinton administration, Khromova, in her 40s, a
bespectacled physicist in a denim dress, personifies one of the
biggest dangers the United States faces: the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Washington considers INOR, the company of which Khromova is
president, to be the mother of all proliferation nightmares - a
financially strapped Russian defense enterprise that is selling its
technology to buyers with ready cash, no matter who those clients
are or what they plan to build.
</P>
<P>
   INOR was one of seven Russian enterprises hit with US sanctions
last month for allegedly selling sensitive weapons technology to
Iran, which is trying to develop ballistic missiles that can carry
nuclear warheads. INOR agreed last fall to supply Iran with special
metal alloys that the U.S. alleges could be used to make long-range
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, just days after Iran tested a medium-range missile
capable of hitting Israel and US military installations in the
Middle East, President Clinton signed an executive order barring
INOR and six other entities from trading with American companies or
receiving US government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that halting the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction is ``one of the toughest security challenges we face''
and vowed to punish any other firms that spread sensitive weapons
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Khromova denies that her company did anything wrong. In an
interview at INOR's rented two-room office at the Chermet Research
Institute, Khromova acknowledged that she made a deal with an
Iranian partner. Although she refused to give details, Khromova
insisted that what she sold could not be used to make rockets. She
claimed that she had no idea why Iranians needed the alloys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't tell me what they were making, and I didn't ask,''
Khromova said. She pointed to a stack of Russian newspapers on her
desk, opening one to a story about the US sanctions. ``I found out
more from these newspapers about what we are supposedly building in
Iran than I ever knew. To them I say, thanks for the
advertisement.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, private company formed amid the ruins of the old Soviet
defense industry after the breakup of the USSR, INOR is mired in a
deep financial crisis caused by clients who cannot pay for their
orders. Khromova said the biggest culprit is the Russian
government, which accounts for between 30 and 40 percent of INOR's
orders but never pays its debts. As a result, INOR, like many
Russian companies, has trouble paying its employees, most of whom
work at two production facilities located outside of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Khromova says that she does not troll for buyers. ``They usually
find us,'' she said. This was the case with her Iranian contacts.
</P>
<P>
   According to her, the deal did not violate Russia's existing
export laws. ``Under the law, these alloys are not forbidden,'' she
said. ``But if they say we cannot sell them, we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Khromova is not sure what the US sanctions will mean to her
company. ``We don't have any contracts with Americans, we never
have, and we never will,'' she said. ``They'll probably forbid me
from going to the States. But that doesn't bother me. Our country
is no worse than yours.''
</P>
<P>
   A far more immediate problem for Khromova is the authorities in
her own country. Russian law enforcement agencies notified her
recently that INOR and eight other companies are under
investigation for possible violations of Russian export laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government announced last month, prior to the US
sanctions against seven of the enterprises, and on the eve of a
visit to Moscow by Vice President Gore, that it would press
criminal charges against any company found to have illegally sold
sensitive weapons technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to INOR, the enteprises hit with sanctions include
two research institutes, Grafit and Polyus; Glavkosmos, a
state-owned company that sells space industry equipment abroad; the
Baltic State Technical University in St. Petersburg; and two
private companies, Europalace 2000 and MOSO, which allegedly tried
to ship Iran 22 tons of special steel that could be used to build
the body of a long-range rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Israel have accused Russia of helping Iran develop
its nuclear weapons program by training students, providing missile
technology and building a nuclear power plant in southern Iran.
Russia and Iran deny the accusations and say the plant is for
civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has denied helping Iran, and for a while
denied that any Russian companies were involved. That line changed
after Russian officials stopped the 22 tons of special steel at
Russia's border with Azerbaijan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, President Boris Yeltsin has on several occasions
promised to crack down on exports of sensitive weaponry and
military known-how that violate non-proliferation agreements Russia
has signed. Last month, Yeltsin ordered his Cabinet to draft strict
new rules on exports of technologies which could be use for
military, as well as civilian, purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, U.S. officials and Russian analysts have criticized
Russian laws and export procedures as ineffective in preventing
transactions of sensitive technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sanctions, and the Russian government's moves to crack
down on illicit exports, may have taken some pressure off the White
House and removed one of the nagging issues of US-Russian relations
on the eve of Clinton's planned visit to Moscow in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Moscow suggest that the Clinton administration has
decided to focus on individual companies, rather than the Russian
government as a whole, in exchange for Russian promises to work
more effectively to stop the sale of lethal technologies in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, which in recent years has tended to be more suspicious
of Moscow's intentions than the White House, has pushed for broader
sanctions against Russia, which some on Capitol Hill believe is
actively involved in arming Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials privately express consternation with this
view. They say that official Moscow has no interest in arming its
traditional competitor in the Caucasus region with missiles that
could reach a large swath of southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Khromova and other representatives of enterprises hit with
US sanctions said that their deals with Iran were made with the
full knowledge and acquiescence of the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leaders are setting us up,'' said Nikolai Semyonov, head
of the foreign trade relations department of Glavkosmos. ``We
worked with the government, and got all our permission from them.

ANGLICAN DECLARATION INCREASES PRESSURE ON GAYS, LESBIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edouard Fontenot abandoned the religion of his birth _ the
Southern Baptist Convention _ for the Episcopal Church because he
believed it gave a warmer welcome to gay men like himself.
</P>
<P>
   So when news came out of England that the world's Anglican
bishops had voted to declare homosexuality ``incompatible with
Scripture,'' Fontenot felt slapped. The Episcopal Church is the
American branch of Anglicanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's incredibly hurtful to get these vicious
missives,'' said Fontenot, who lives in Boston with his partner,
Christopher Bellonci. Fontenot and Bellonci were ``united'' in a
blessing ceremony last year at St. John the Evangelist Episcopal
Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican resolution, which also opposed ordaining
homosexuals or performing same-sex commitment services, was passed
by the bishops last week at their once-a-decade conclave. It is not
binding, because each of Anglicanism's 37 provinces are run
autonomously. But people like Fontenot, a doctoral candidate in
theology and psychology at Boston University, and other advocates
of gay rights, say the bishops' proclamation sends out an ugly
message.
</P>
<P>
   These are difficult days for gays and lesbians and their
supporters. They are coming under increasing pressure from
religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the highest court of the United Methodist
Church, the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination, ruled
that Methodists who bless the union of same-sex couples could face
discipline as harsh as removal from ministry and expulsion from the
church.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal Methodist caucus supporting gay rights, the
Reconciling Congregation Program, immediately issued an angry
statement lashing out against the church's ``deplorable and
theologically unsound'' declaration.
</P>
<P>
   And several conservative groups allied with the Christian right
have run advertisements denouncing homosexuailty and declaring that
gays and lesbians can be ``converted'' to heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians say they are reacting to what they
describe as a aggressive gay rights movement that is undermining
family values and threatening fundamental Biblical tenets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side liberals respond that conservative believers
are hiding behind the Bible to justify homophobia in the same way
Scripture was used _ and still is _ in some Christian denominations
to prevent women from becoming ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambeth Conference, as the gathering of Anglican bishops is
called, also highlighted a geographical divide on controversial
moral issues. That divide will likely become wider as Christianity
spreads across the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bishops supporting a strict response to gay concerns
were from Africa and Asia, places where Anglicanism is growing
rapidly, in contrast to England and North America, where the number
of members has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal bishops and gay advocates complained that prelates
from the developing world were lobbied hard by conservative
American and English bishops working to gain ideological allies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has become increasingly clear that not just within
Angicanism but within many Christian denominations there is
widespread resistance to what many in Latin America, Asia and
Africa perceive to be a left-leaning American Protestant Christian
establishment. And, it is apparent that neither side on the
homosexual issue or on the wider issue of Biblical authority, plans
on yielding its position.
</P>
<P>
   After the Anglican leaders voted on the resolution on
homosexuality, 146 of the 750 bishops at Lambeth signed an open
letter to gay and lesbian Angicans apologizing ``for any sense of
rejection.'' The letter was signed by Bishop M. Thomas Shaw, leader
of the Diocese of Massachusetts, the Right Rev. Barbara C. Harris,
suffragan bishop for the diocese, and five other Epsicopal bishops
from New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our deep concern that you not feel abandoned by your
church and that you know of our continued respect and support,''
the letter read.
</P>
<P>
   For his part Fontenot, like many gay and lesbian Episcopalians
in the area, say he feels largely welcomed in this diocese. ``I was
forced out of my family's religion and I've made a stand not to be
forced out again,'' he said. ``I'm going to continue to take a
stand and make sure my understanding of the Gospel is
articulated.''

<P>
   _Pope John Paul II is taking the Roman Catholic message to space
_ cyberspace that is. Starting Aug. 15, which Catholics celebrate
as the Feast of the Assumption, World Wide Web surfers began
hearing his teachings live via a new website: http://www.vatica.va.
</P>
<P>
   There people will be able to hear and see John Paul recite his
Angelus prayers on Sundays, conduct his general audience on
Wednesday and follow his pilgrimages across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   _Is there a link between being religious and blood pressure?
That's what some researchers at Duke University believe.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people who study the Bible, attend religious services or
pray on a weekly basis were 40 percent less likely to have high
blood pressure than those who did not take part in similar
religious activites, researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   While not entirely sure why active religious participation
lowers blood pressure, some researchers believe faith and religious
involvement provides a support system that helps people deal with
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of meaning and kind of comfort that religious
beliefs provide make them more resistant to stresses both physical
and social,'' Linda George, another co-author of the Duke Study,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   _Reader Feedback: Several readers took issue with a column
featuring a new book by Roger LeBlanc, ``Relativism as Religion:
Tracing Its Historical Roots to the Modern Day Crisis,'' which
addresses the question of papal authority. ``Mr. LeBlanc's views
must disturb not only the very Roman Catholics he excoriates,''
writes the Rev. Robert A. Mackie, interim pastor of Mystic Side
Congregational Church in Everett, Mass., ``but most certainly must
and does offend non-Roman Catholics, both of whom, of late, have
had to put their tolerance and patience with the extravagances of
the current Pope into overdrive.''

WOMEN GET STELLA'S GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The whoops in the movie theater audience first broke out when a
tank-topped Winston Shakespeare, a man with sculpted body and
disarming eyes, appeared on screen. At a first-weekend showing of
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' the 20-year-old Jamaican
character created a buzz among women of all ages, not excluding the
motherly and grandmotherly.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the shower scene, in which 40-year-old Stella couldn't
resist joining her young paramour after seeing him lather up alone.
Still later, female roars virtually erupted during a love scene in
which Stella, played by the striking Angela Bassett, 40 herself,
wore a speechless face of painful exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a sensitive beau half her age, Stella got her groove
back, again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with it,'' Cambridge moviegoer Mary
Washington, 45, said of the film's pairing of an older woman and
younger man. ``It's great _ I'm looking for one. Can you print
that? Mary Washington ...''
</P>
<P>
   Much to audience delight, the movie, released Friday, reverses
Hollywood's trend of matching older men with younger women. In a
time when Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, and Jack Nicholson _
nearly senior citizens _ can play strapping men who win the hearts
of attractive women in their 20s and 30s, this film may be the
first to seriously buck outdated social mores concerning age and
gender. According to the movie patrons hollering their approval,
it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, there's been plenty of the opposite phenomenon. In
``Bulworth,'' there was Warren Beatty, 61, playing leading love to
Halle Berry, 31; in ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' it was Harrison
Ford, 56, and Anne Heche, 29; in ``The Horse Whisperer,'' Robert
Redford, 61, and Kristen Scott Thomas, 38; and in ``As Good as It
Gets,'' Jack Nicholson, 61, and Helen Hunt, 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' Gail Hardenbergh, a couples therapist from
Sudbury, said of the bias. ``That's a male producer's fantasy,
there's no doubt in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Terry McMillan book-turned-movie, the struggle between
Stella and Winston, played by newcomer Taye Diggs, is central to
the story line. How do two people, bonded by love yet disparate in
age, reconcile their differences in maturity and experiences? And
how do they face the double standard employed by friends who
wouldn't even flinch if the ages were reversed?
</P>
<P>
   It may be just a movie, but ``Stella'' touches on a stigma many
older women face in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all breaks down to a discrimination of women _ more
importantly, the discrimination of women's sexuality,'' said Dishon
Mills, 22, whose wife, Afrika, is 2 years older. ``When a young man
engages in a lot of sexual activity, he's seen as someone who's
sowing his wild oats. When a woman does it, she's seen as a
whore.''
</P>
<P>
   But that stereotype is slowly fading as baby boomers age, said
Francesca Antognini, a psychologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Mass. Baby boomers, often considered a well-educated generation,
are beginning to understand that women reach their sexual peak
later than men do _ around 35, compared with men, who hit their
peak in their late teens or early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you match a younger man with an older women, sexually it
can work quite well,'' Antognini said. ``There's more of a pairing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, older men pursued younger women because of a
``biological imperative,'' Antognini explained. Whereas men can
remain sexually reproductive past their 70s, women can no longer
bear children after menopause. Middle-aged women thus fared
unfavorably when compared with younger women.
</P>
<P>
   But now, older women are countering that image, as they put a
greater emphasis on fitness, and more people acknowledge that women
can be sexually active as they grow older. In addition, women can
more easily establish their own identities through growing career
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Stella, for instance, is a career woman of corporate success,
not to mention a woman blessed with radiant beauty. That the
awestruck Winston should remark to Stella upon first meeting,
``I've never seen a 40-year-old woman that looks like you,'' shows
how a stereotype of middle-aged women can be turned on its head.
</P>
<P>
   But Stella also lapses into frustration with Winston, whose idea
of a good time includes a bowl of Cocoa Puffs and renting the
lowbrow ``Booty Call.'' Real-life Stellas and Winstons must grapple
with differences in both culture and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a huge gap in experience, growth, and needs,'' said
Kathryn Ford, 30, of Lexington. ``I think it would be hard for me
to cope with. If the man is 20, he's just out of the young adult
period, maybe graduating from college. At 40, you're done with your
first marriage, and maybe even have children. How are you going to
accommodate those differences in your relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Williams, 27, who saw the movie Saturday night, didn't
mention any glitches she has encountered in dating a 21-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got no problem with it, because I'm doing it myself,''
Williams said with a secretive smile.
</P>
<P>
   Care to share what it's like?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmmm. You got to try it.''

AFTER MEXICO, PATRIOTS ARE IN HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memories have faded. Some have been lost altogether. Call it
selective amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   It has been several months since the Patriots were eliminated
from the playoffs by the Pittsburgh Steelers. When those around the
team are asked now about the finger-pointing that went on between
offense and defense after that 7-6 loss, the subject is treated as
a fabrication of the media or at least as something blown far out
of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Things were said in the emotion of the moment, you are told.
They were gone from the players' minds shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Moot.
</P>
<P>
   Lost memories.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was such a rift, then the Patriots' 21-3 exhibition
victory over Dallas in Mexico City Monday night before more than
106,000 screaming fans would have gone far in repairing it.
</P>
<P>
   All the defense ever has wanted is for the offense to take
advantage of its hard work. If the defense makes a strong stand,
pinning the opponent in its own territory, the message to the
offense is: Take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And so that happened Monday night. There was a bonding, you
might say.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' first-unit defense, which allowed Dallas into New
England territory only once in the first half, had its finest
moment when it stuffed a fourth-and-inches from the Cowboy 39 in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman handed off to Darryl ``Moose'' Johnston, who did his
darnedest to get through the line. Instead, he was thrown back for
a 2-yard loss when the front wall of the defense _ Chad Eaton and
Willie McGinest, in particular _ refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   The expressions on the faces of the Patriots as they walked off
the field were exuberant, triumphant. It was almost as if they were
telling the offense: ``We've done our part, now you do yours.''
</P>
<P>
   One good deed inspired another, as the offense responded in
kind. Drew Bledsoe, who has struggled with the timing of the new
offense, was not about to let this defensive stand go unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe directed the Patriots to a touchdown in six plays,
completing two passes and letting Sedrick Shaw do the rest. Shaw
gained 15 of the 39 yards, including a 9-yard touchdown run around
left end, getting sprung loose by a nice block from rookie tight
end Rod Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just great to be able to make something of the great
play of the defense,'' said Bledsoe, who was 9 of 14 for 69 yards.
``The defense has played great in camp and all of last year and
it's time the offense start to live up to what we feel we can do.
When the offense puts up points after a great defensive stand, that
just gets everybody going. It means you're executing on both sides
of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Eaton's brute strength in a tremendous rush up the middle
that made the play and allowed McGinest to make the last hit on
Johnston. And Eaton was the first defensive player to rush onto the
field after the score to congratulate the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton was immense in the middle of the line, while McGinest got
constant pressure on the quarterback and Ferric Collons was tough
against the run. Dallas didn't get into Patriots territory until 13
seconds remained in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys up front did a tremendous job,'' said Ty Law, who
intercepted a Jason Garrett pass just before halftime and sprinted
26 yards for a touchdown. ``When they're getting that kind of rush
on, it makes it easier for everyone behind them. And when the
offense takes advantage like that, it provides us with a comfort
zone that we can make plays and the offense will put points on the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Law spoke of past frustrations, how respect for the defense as a
unit still eludes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the Patriots as Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, and
Curtis Martin,'' he said. ``We're playing in their shadows right
now. We're not getting the respect we deserve, but as long as we
get the respect of teammates and coaches, that's fine. Though we
would like to get the respect nationally as a great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   While good karma between the offense and defense has taken a
while to develop, Law said fingers never were pointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't point fingers because we're a team,'' said Law. ``We
know the offense is going through yet another system and that takes
time. I was talking to Michael Irvin before the game and he said it
took two years to get it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, of course, was a prime part of the Ernie Zampese offense
in Dallas. Now Irvin is learning a new system while Zampese is
teaching the old Dallas system in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense made progress tonight and that's what we wanted to
see,'' said Law.
</P>
<P>
   It was progress, but not midseason form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing was much better,'' said Bledsoe, who did
miss a wide-open Shawn Jefferson and later Glenn for what would
have been touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to the point where we're as good as we're going to be
in the regular season, but it's getting there slowly but surely.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, the Patriots would use Saturday's game
against Washington to get their act together and then treat the
Philadelphia game at Foxborough the following week as a dress
rehearsal for the season opener. But they still need to show
progress offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, meanwhile, is just trying to perfect what it is
doing and slowly introduce blitz packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just picking up the offense until they get it
together,'' said Law, ``but when they score like that, that just
makes us want to play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Law doesn't seem overly concerned about the right cornerback
position, which is being manned by Chris Canty, but warns,
``Regardless of who it is, we want to get it solidified. There's no
guarantee I can stay out there healthy for 16 games, so we need to
be strong there.''
</P>
<P>
   Law says the biggest difference he sees in the defense from last
year is McGinest, who is healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a No. 1 draft pick,'' sais Law. ``He has that type of
talent and he's just playing so well right now. It's incredible
what he does for us.''

HE'S DIMINISHED, BUT NOT DESTROYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At no time did I ask anyone to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but he asked us to believe. Him.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``I never had sexual relations with that woman'' becomes
``while my answer was legally accurate'' that something sexual did
transpire, and ``it was not appropriate ... it was wrong ... a
lapse in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornered at last before the grand jury by the four-year, $40
million posse whipped up by Kenneth Starr, President Clinton
finally owned up to ``a false impression'' he wove about his
involvement with Monica Lewinsky, and acknowledged he ``misled
people _ even my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's many enemies rejoice. He is unmasked, yet again, in
the most embarrassing of postures, the presidential pantaloons down
around his ankles. Our No. 1 Citizen got caught with his drawers
down; authority embarrassed is authority diminished. His enemies
crow. His friends? They too are diminished. Only 30 percent of
Americans, by the time Clinton began his excruciating grand jury
testimony Tuesday, still believed his tortured claims of innocence.
Staffers and friends who tried to rally are let down as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, alas, is a trimmer. Has been from the word go. But his
shading of unpleasant truths, the wash-and-polish jobs, the spin,
the well-on-the-other-hand-you-could-look-at-it-this-way, the
lexicographical legerdemain with which he so adroitly carved his
path up from asphalt-sided shack in Hope to 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, had never landed him in the sheepdip as this one did.
</P>
<P>
   His evading the draft, his denial of the Gennifer Flowers
affair, the gyrations of Whitewater, all the petty scandals that
stuck to Bill and his train like the Golden Goose of nursery rhyme,
added to the legend of Slick Willie, the boy who got away with it.
He is a hoper and a groper, always was, and we knew it, certainly
by the time of his second election, though he never struck me as
being crooked about money, or the type to harass a woman who'd say
no.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton understood early that politics was a game won by
addition, not subtraction. As long as he could find a wider
audience to succumb to his eyelid-fluttering appeals, to be your
pal, your protector, your strong right arm, he could outweigh the
enemies with the new friends. But he eventually just ran out of new
audiences to conquer. He had to come back to the same old crowd on
this one. Like the Music Man in River City, the old salesman
couldn't hop on the train and ride to the next town; he was stuck
in this one.
</P>
<P>
   He may be a trimmer, some allies muttered, but he's our trimmer.
His enemies are our enemies. The people who oppose him are the same
people who oppose us; ergo, he's our guy. Who are you with in the
daily battles? Bill? Compared to whom? To Bush? Bob Dole, Newt
Gingrich, Trent Lott, Jesse Helms? Pat Buchanan, Orrin Hatch?
</P>
<P>
   Diminished but not destroyed is Clinton today. Impugned, but not
impeached. He'd be awfully hard to reelect, but he's not eligible
for reelection. He's got a year and a half to go, and not even
those nitwits in Congress think they can dump him out before his
lease expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nobody's business but ours,'' he says of his efforts to
win back the confidence of his wife and daughter after this ghastly
event. But the lying is everyone's business. ``Even presidents have
private lives,'' he shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were true. But in the modern media environment,
nothing is private, sacred, or beyond traducing. The collateral
damage from the Clinton scandals will include future presidents,
and the Americans who will be less adequately led, because of the
culture of scandal the media cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents will be less safe and secure, because a Secret
Service guard can be blackmailed or intimidated or co-opted by an
aggressive prosecutor-on-the-make. There will be capable candidates
who will not risk the exposure of a campaign, because they, or
their spouse, or kids, or their brother-in-law, did something weak
or fallible or craven.
</P>
<P>
   The concentric circles prescribing just what is acceptable and
what is controversial in a politician's private life just got a lot
smaller, and the smaller those circles get, the more people they
rule out from consideration for leadership. Our presidents pick
thousands of job-holders. No president appointed women, blacks and
other minorities as much as Clinton did. That should be weighed in
the assessment of his untruths.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed but not surprised by Clinton's priapic
predilections, I remain unconvinced by his enemies' arguments. This
was not a firing offense. One of the senators loudest in
threatening impeachment hails from a state where the Washington
Post counts 30,000 polygamists. Kenneth Starr's tactics and
political alliances put him squarely in the category of rogue
prosecutor. Starr gave a speech two years ago in Detroit raising
public questions about Clinton's ``spousal integrity.'' To me, that
was a fatal giveaway to the Whitewater prosecutor's intention to
get personal on the president.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, what Clinton did with Monica and afterword was, to go
alphabetically: asinine, bathetic, clumsy, deplorable, empty,
fatuous, gross, humiliating, injudicious, jerky, knuckleheaded,
lame, mendacious, naive, oleaginous, piggish, queasy, ridiculous,
stupid, tacky, unsalubrious, vexatious, weasely, xanthic-tinted
(yellow), yahoo-ish, and, ultimately, zany.

A NEW LOOK FOR JADED UNION SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO It is the boutique capital of the Pacific Rim, the
shopping destination of millions. Yet the retail district of San
Francisco surrounds one of the least lovely parks in America.
</P>
<P>
   Union Square, faded and jaded, is about to be rehabilitated. To
attract shoppers and visitors again, planners aim to discourage two
other urban groups: street people and skateboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Older than its Boston counterpart, Copley Square, the space has
been redesigned several times. Cities have discovered that market
rules of economics also apply to aesthetics: when most people avoid
urban spaces, others fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s version of Copley Square, praised by critics but
quickly deserted, became a hangout for the homeless and for
skateboard nation. In the 1990s, grass and trees replaced pavement,
making the space popular again.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the reverse is under way. Trees and shrubs are gone from
the site and soon, ``it will be 75 percent plaza and 25 percent
grass. It's 50-50 now,'' says Michael Fotheringham, one of two
landscape architects redesigning Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Bounded by Powell, Post, Stockton and Geary Streets, the
2.6-acre square was a generous gift from Mayor John White Geary in
1850. Although the city plan of surveyor Jasper O'Farrell was only
three years old, San Francisco real estate was as hot in the Gold
Rush as it is now. The park was baptized in the Civil War when
orators railed against the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Towering above the square is a Spanish-American War monument to
Admiral George Dewey, hero of the battle of Manila Bay in 1898.
Celebrating an American military victory may offend this city's
politics, but because the column survived the earthquake and fire
of 1906, it has totemic status. Its venerability is noted in solemn
inscriptions: ground broken by William McKinley on May 20, 1901,
and dedicated by Theodore Roosevelt on May 14, 1903, when
presidential visits to California were rare.
</P>
<P>
   No one in San Francisco has an answer to the homeless problem,
but, Fotheringham says, ``The impact won't be what it is today. Our
office overlooks the square and we're watching the social dynamics
of that space. This is why benches will be a last resort in
providing seating. What happens is the daily users, the ones who
basically live in the square, will claim the bench and then they
line the walkways. Or they're lying on the lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors now recoil at bodies sprawled at the four corner
entrances to the hilly park. The redesign will quadruple the size
of each opening, making it more visible to the street. Although his
partner, April Philips, says ``This space is for all people,'' new
midblock pedestrian entrances will also crowd out the euphemistic
`daily users.''
</P>
<P>
   Temporary seating is one solution, but, Fotheringham asks,
``Where do you store 500 chairs when you're not using them?''
There's little room in the garage underneath, built in 1942, when
California had fallen in love with the automobile. The 1,200 cars
must remain, the city says.
</P>
<P>
   Skateboarders pose another problem. ``We want to have
flexibility for fashion shows, arts festivals, flea markets, and
jazz festivals. This plaza has to look great when its empty and
when it's full,'' Philips says, as she also insists, ``This park is
not meant for skateboarders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been studies on how you detail something,'' she
says, ``whether it has a curve or an angle, how high it is, how
slanted it is, where a board can go up or not, and breaking up long
surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   With the St. Francis Hotel rising majestically over Powell
Street, cable cars clanging up the hill, theaters nearby, and
shoppers zooming in and out of stores, Union Square should be an
ideal oasis at any hour.
</P>
<P>
   When a park is empty, it is not ideal. At 10 p.m. on a recent
night, adolescent skateboarders were twirling around the monument
as artfully as Admiral Dewey navigated Manila Bay.

THE GREAT DEBATE IN MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maine already is a national park. This is not a preemptive
judgment against bringing in rangers, visitor centers, the brown
road signs, and entry fees. It is just that since Maine is already
The Way Life Should Be, it can be thoughtful about the way the
future ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   New debate over the future of the forests and wilderness of
Maine was sparked this summer when South African Pulp and Paper
Industries Ltd. put 911,000 acres of land up for sale. Another
company, Bowater, is considering selling about 2 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the state could be seeing the sale of 5 to 15 percent of
its land in the near future. Timber companies own almost all of the
northern half of Maine. Of the 17.7 million acres of forest charted
by the federal government in Maine, between 7.3 million and 10.4
million acres are owned by forest industry interests.
</P>
<P>
   For decades this was not much of an issue. Outside of periodic
concerns over clear-cutting, timber companies made far more friends
than enemies by providing jobs and allowing free access to their
lands for hunting, fishing, boating, snowmobiling, cycling, and
trapping.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of forest industry jobs has fallen by half since
1960, from one in 11 Mainers to one in 23 today. Global timber
companies have become more fickle. South African Pulp and Paper had
purchased its 911,000 acres from another company only four years
ago. Now it says it wants to sell its land as one unit to a firm
that will still log the land and send the wood to its mills in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But since some of its land is on beautiful Moosehead Lake in the
center of the state, Governor Angus King has made a bid to purchase
reportedly up to 200,000 of the most valuable acres, including the
lands around the lake, to protect it from commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line activists say that is a good start but a pittance. One
organization, Restore the North Woods, wants 3.2 million acres of
Maine forest, including Moosehead, the Allagash Wilderness
Waterway, and lands around Baxter State Park to be turned into a
Maine Woods National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Its director, Jym St. Pierre, has called the land ``the most
important 3 million acres for sale in the United States today, in
terms of wildlands.''
</P>
<P>
   Having camped in Baxter and having moose and deer come right up
to your cabin, I offer no disagreement there. The idea of a vast
national park offers a reflexive appeal of knowing the woods would
have the highest level of protection.
</P>
<P>
   The political problem for St. Pierre is that the woods _ in
fact, most of the state _ exude bountiful, easily accessible
natural beauty amid the familiar paternalism of the paper
companies. Moose are seen in bogs and off dirt roadways _ some of
them paved by Big Timber _ almost as easily in Maine as bison and
elk are sighted in Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   The vistas from Katahdin and other mountains are as grand as any
in the nation. Away from the cacophony of political rhetoric, Maine
is a place where snowmobilers and cross-country skiers, seemingly
polar opposites, share trails and a place where bird-watchers and
hikers enjoy lands in spring that become prime deer hunting grounds
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Even outside of the 3.2 million acres targeted for a national
park, Maine is a place where bald eagles can be seen along the
coast and on some inland lakes. Puffins have been restored to rocky
ocean islands. Despite their timid nature, I have seen bears both
this summer and last in Maine's White Mountains. The Way Life Has
Been has easily been good enough to lull the visitor into a bliss
frankly felt far easier here than in the Manhattanish mania that
Yosemite Valley, the rim of the Grand Canyon, and the roads of
Yellowstone have become in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lulled too has been Governor King, who has thus far gone with
the timber companies to reject any notion of a national park.
</P>
<P>
   Most newspapers in the state approve of King's attempt to
acquire the small acreage around Moosehead, but the park proposal
has yet to be taken seriously. Though Percival Baxter is one of the
state's greatest heroes for purchasing the lands that became Baxter
State Park, no one with wealth or political muscle feels any
immediate need to claim Baxter's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   A national park would preserve the woods in a way no timber
company would. But the concerns of locals _ who are used to timber
jobs and activities on timber lands with virtually no restrictions
and virtually no people _ will dampen any proposal that smacks of
elitism.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a creative solution is found, a national park will easily
be seen as the enemy. By the single act of imposing an entry fee, a
national park means the Way Life Shouldn't Be.

WELCOME TO THE FARCE PHASE OF US HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
 
  (itals)``Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic
facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add:
the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.''(unitals)

</P>
<P>
   For those of us of a certain age, it is as if we are living our
lives all over again. Waiting up in the evening to hear a dramatic
presidential address. Wondering if Congress will consider articles
of impeachment. Curiosity about the family _ how are they taking
it?
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this movie before. Back before John Dean's hair
turned white. In a time when Dan Rather actually reported and broke
news rather than looking bored and haggard while reading it. As
Yogi Berra correctly remarked: It's deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy: Having exhausted all possible avenues, Richard Nixon
and Henry Kissinger, according to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's
bestseller ``The Final Days,'' drop to their knees in the White
House and pray for the future of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Farce: The Rev. Jesse Jackson, grooming himself to be the Rabbi
Baruch Korff of the Clinton administration, provides spiritual
guidance to the first family in its time of trial _ and then blabs
about it on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy: Kept in the dark by the Kennedy administration, UN
ambassador Adlai Stevenson denies US complicity in the Bay of Pigs
invasion in an emotional address to the General Assembly in 1961.
The unsuccessful invasion of Cuba turns out to have been a CIA-run
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Farce: Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and two Cabinet
colleagues, William Daley and Donna Shalala, rush in front of
television cameras in January to denounce the ``false allegations''
of the Monica Lewinsky case. Ooooooops.
</P>
<P>
   Then: Edward Bennett Williams, top lawyer at the powerhouse
Washington law firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly, counsels Washington
Post editor Ben Bradlee to print the Pentagon Papers.
</P>
<P>
   Now: David Kendall, Williams &AMP; Connolly's top lawyer and the man
standing between Bill Clinton and some serious trouble, also has a
major media win to his credit. Representing the National Enquirer,
Kendall green-lighted one of his client's greatest scoops ever _
that the flamboyant Las Vegas pianist Liberace was dying of AIDS.
Another red-letter day for the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Then: On Monday night, the ever-chatty Dick Morris let slip that
he had worked on Clinton's ``1982 apology.'' Huh? This was a ploy
that Morris and the Clintons dreamed up to get their boy back into
Arkansas politics after he had become the youngest defeated
governor in American history. According to Clinton biographer David
Maraniss, Morris counseled the young ex-governor ``to recognize
your sins, confess to them, promise to sin no more, and then sin no
more.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Arkansas voters reelected Clinton to four consecutive
terms as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now: Will 1998's carefully crafted non-apology work? Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Then: As the second-youngest man to be elected president,
Clinton initially reveled in comparisons with John F. Kennedy and
Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Now: Clinton is quoted as saying that Ulysses S. Grant, one of
our magnificently failed presidents, ``got a bum rap.'' Grant the
man has been ably rehabilitated by a brilliant and sensitive
biographer, William McFeeley. (Grant, of course, had a
distinguished military career, material unavailable to any putative
Clinton chroniclers.) Will Clinton be so lucky, and have to wait a
hundred years?
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, during the previous nadir in her husband's
fortunes _ his embarrassing washout at the 1988 Democratic National
Convention _ Hillary Rodham Clinton remarked, ``Political history
remakes itself every 24 hours. Every day is an opportunity to make
a new speech.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet no one wants to hear a president deliver a speech on
this subject, ever again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tenille Roberts and Amanda Williams are privates in a formidable
army.
</P>
<P>
   Their uniform is a pressed white shirt, ankle-length skirt, and
sensible walking shoes. Their weapon is a Spanish version of The
Book of Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   Their battlefield is the streets of Boston's Dorchester,
Mattapan, and Jamaica Plain neighborhoods, and anywhere else in the
city where souls need saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here because the Lord wants us here,'' said Williams,
riding a bus through the Roslindale section and cheerfully asking
strangers if they had read the Mormon gospel. ``We're here to offer
people the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And the number of people across the country, and around the
world willing to embrace that truth has been, in the view of many
religious scholars, nothing short of phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   During the last quarter-century, the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints has been among the nation's fastest-growing
religious communities.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New England, a region where the church has not always
been active, Mormons are becoming more visible, with an increase in
members from 37,700 in 1988 to 53,500 today. The increase has led
to the building of a soaring and controversial temple in Belmont,
Mass. to serve the burgeoning Mormon population. The temple, which
some neighbors complain will be too big and cause traffic problems,
is one of 16 planned or being built worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Mormons number 5 million, a million more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a church that knows what it's doing and does it
incredibly well,'' said Rodney Stark, a sociologist at the
University of Washington. ``In a span of a short time they have
become a major religious force, and there are no signs that their
growth is going to slow down anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A key factor in the church's impressive track record has been
the zeal and work of young Mormons like Roberts, 21, and Williams,
22. The ``sisters,'' as they are called, are two of 58,000
missionaries worldwide spreading the Mormon message.
</P>
<P>
   It is a massive army of true _ and unpaid _ believers that no
other Christian faith comes close to matching. The Roman Catholic
Church, by comparison, has about 6,000 missionaries worldwide,
according to church officials.
</P>
<P>
   Going on a mission is a rite of passage for young Mormons. And
even though male missionaries outnumber female ones by about four
to one, a growing number of women are taking up the call to
evangelize.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon church also has begun training its missionary
spotlight on urban areas and communities with large concentrations
of blacks and Hispanics. Roberts and Williams learned Spanish
during their missionary training in Utah primarily so they could
focus on Hispanic women. Women missionaries in the church tend to
evangelize to other women.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes missionaries like Williams and Roberts from
those in other Christian faiths, religious scholars say, is the
intense attention they pay to ``investigators,'' as potential
converts are called. Roberts and Williams typically work the Boston
streets from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. six days a week. They will talk
to anyone who will listen _ on buses, on the subway, or on the
sidewalk. They will visit and revisit those people who hint that
they want to learn more about the church.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent rainy afternoon, Roberts and Williams sat inside
Rosemery Szymanski's kitchen in Roslindale, &UR;  &LR; reading from a Spanish
translation of the Book of Mormon. It is the second visit Mormon
missionaries have made to her apartment in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff in here that I don't understand, but
I'm very curious to learn,'' Szymanski said. Williams and Roberts
nodded. ``There's stuff in here that I remember reading in the
Bible, but a lot of new stuff too. I didn't know about Jesus coming
to America,'' she told them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Roberts told Szymanski: ``I promise you that when you read the
book the spirit is going to shake you up and tell you that this is
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Williams made an appointment to visit Szymanski in a
few days for more readings and study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that the missionaries take the time to talk to you
about God; that's important to me,'' Szymanski said.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Mormon, the key church scripture and what separates
Mormons from other churches tracing their roots to Jesus, is
believed to have been translated by Joseph Smith, the founder of
Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was born in 1805 in Sharon, Vt., and who moved to New
York as a teenager, claimed that Jesus appeared to him and told him
to start the Church of Latter-day Saints, which Mormons believe to
be the only true Christian church.
</P>
<P>
   Smith translated the Book of Mormon from gold tablets he is said
to have found in New York. The tablets, Mormons believe, tell the
story of how Jesus appeared in North America shortly after he was
crucified, to an ancient people related to the inhabitants of
biblical Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Szymanski, &UR;  &LR; Roberts and Williams next called on
Kathy Burgos, 29, who was baptized into the Mormon church last
month. Burgos is still learning about the faith, and Roberts and
Williams had made an appointment with her to continue her studies.
A former Roman Catholic, she said Masses left her uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Catholic church I didn't feel like I was getting
anything, but when I went to the Mormon church you could just feel
the warmth,'' said Burgos, a single mother of two young boys,
sitting inside her dimly-lit, cramped kitchen &UR;  &LR; in Dorchester's
Ashmont neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are always people visiting here to study the Bible
or just to talk. That's really nice. They have become people I can
trust and discuss things with.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating a support system for members or prospective members is
a crucial aspect of the Church of Latter-day Saints, which promotes
the idea that strong families are divinely ordained.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jan Shipps, a noted scholar of Mormonism, the faith
does especially well in urban neighborhoods _ like the ones where
Williams and Roberts spend much of their time _ filled with broken
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is able to provide a kind of surrogate family to a
lot of alienated people,'' said Shipps, a retired professor of
history and religious studies at Indiana University in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   When Burgos mentions that she is thinking of painting her
apartment, Roberts and Williams eagerly volunteer to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't comprehend until I got here how much work this was
going to be,'' Williams said. ``This is all we do, this is all we
think about, this is all we dream about.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to be a missionary since I was little girl. There
are a lot of people out here who need to hear the gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits to getting discouraged at times when people she tries
to talk to have no interest in hearing about Mormonism. But she
persists, she says, because her belief in her faith is unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got the truth, a lot of people sense it and they
are at least willing to listen,'' Williams said, riding yet another
bus and carrying a knapsack filled with several copies of The Book
of Mormon and other church tracts. ``When you have the true gospel
in your life, you want to share it with others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Latter-day Saints gains converts at a pace of
318,000 every year. At this rate, Stark estimates, the number of
Mormons worldwide will climb from 10 million today to 267 million
by 2080, placing the church among the world's major religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have these polite, well-dressed, earnest young people
walking into some really tough neighborhoods and willing to talk to
people and convince people about the rightness of their faith,''
said Shipps, the scholar of Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go knocking on doors and reach out to folks on the
margins of society that not a lot of other religious communities
are paying attention to.''

WHAT TO SAY? MRS. CLINTON AND LAWYERS WON THE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dusky gray light spread through the expansive
windows of the White House solarium as President Clinton, his wife,
his lawyers, and his political advisers gathered stone-faced Monday
night to plot the most pivotal speech of his presidency: his public
confession to lies and adultery.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was at times melancholy and at times testy. Clinton
had just finished four hours of exhaustive grand jury testimony.
Hillary Rodham Clinton had recently learned that her husband had
again violated their marital vows. Some political aides had been
told only that day that Clinton had lied to them in denying his
sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And together, on an excruciating deadline, with the television
networks already blaring word of a 10 p.m. address, they gathered
once again to try to make wine from old grapes in the political
career of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, according to those present, the president took the
side of his wife and lawyers rather than that of his political
advisers in deciding to lash back at independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr for the four-year investigation that lurched from the
Whitewater real estate dealings to the Lewinsky affair. From that
meeting, and from Clinton's own hand, came the pointed five-minute
speech that has been criticized in many quarters for being long on
defiance and short on contrition.
</P>
<P>
   The session served as the climactic behind-the-scenes episode
during what was the most extraordinary day of the Clinton
presidency. It began with a lengthy morning meeting with lawyers
and ended with a solemn gathering of advisers late at night. In
between, Clinton twice appeared before a camera in the historic Map
Room, the first time to speak to a grand jury in the US District
Courthouse, the second time to address the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Clinton privately labored over his speech in
the confines of his upstairs study. Sometime Sunday night or Monday
morning, it was typed up by one of his lawyers and hand-delivered
to White House counselor Paul Begala later on Monday with orders to
refine and clarify it, according to those familiar with the
process.
</P>
<P>
   What Begala and other speechwriters and aides were given was a
hard-line text bordering on a constant rant, according to
officials. Quickly, they redrew not only the words, but the tone,
injecting contrition and even apology where Clinton had placed
attack.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton testified, and the rest of the White House seemed
frozen, waiting, a small battery of aides pounded on a computer
keyboard trying to strike the right note.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton concluded his testimony at 6:25 p.m., he
met with his lawyers, then summoned his political aides to the
solarium, where, in somewhat happier times, Mrs. Clinton used to
cknduct imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Present were White House hands such as senior strategist Rahm
Emanuel, chief of staff Erskine Bowles, presidential advisers Doug
Sosnik and Begala, and deputy chief of staff John Podesta. Each of
them pleaded the case with Clinton to take a softer line, to offer
an explicit apology, to soft-pedal his remarks on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Clinton's lawyers, particularly David E.
Kendall, saw no need for an apology, according to those familiar
with the discussion. Mrs. Clinton wanted to vent her anger at
Starr, whose investigation had led to her public humiliation.
Clinton, fresh from hours of contentious questioning, and
frustrated over months and years of investigation, was himself
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three positions: a hard, hard line, a much softer
line by the political people, and a middle position, which was the
speech he made,'' said an involved official. ``People might say,
`Really, that was the middle position?'''
</P>
<P>
   Added the official: ``Everyone was polite. He was going to do
what he wanted to do anyways.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., the group had wrapped up the speech, more by
necessity than by agreement. Clinton rushed to the Map Room to
conduct a pair of rehearsals, the aides around him grim and without
the jocularity that often precedes major speeches. At 9:30, Clinton
walked upstairs for a final makeup session.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:02, his voice unusually tight, and the bags under his eyes
heavy, Clinton delivered the speech. Afterward, some friends and
family called on the telephone. A few aides gathered around in the
residence, but the mood was heavy, not congratulatory.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Clinton met privately with some of those aides,
according to press secretary Michael McCurry. But by their own
statements, many have yet to come to terms with the events of the
week and the year.

A BREACH OF TRUST TAKEN PERSONALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, ordinary questions of everyday life are grave
questions of state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than ever, everyday Americans believe the problems the
president faces are the very same problems they face. Now, more
than ever, everybody has an opinion on the leading questions of the
day. Now, more than ever, everybody is an expert. Now, more than
ever, your view and your neighbor's are just as important as the
president's, and maybe more dispassionate _ or sound.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the principal White House issues are trust and
betrayal, affecting the president's family and his friends, and
not, for example, fast-track authority to permit the president to
negoatiate trade agreements on an accellerated schedule, everybody
is involved in the national debate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons this period has been so jarring to Americans
is the unusual tension between the personal issues that face the
nation, like lying and fidelity, and the more traditional political
issues that confront the country, like the expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and ways to combat the Year 2000
problem that threatens vital computer systems. Now the personal
seems ready to supplant the traditional.
</P>
<P>
   One set of issues is accessible to everyone; the other is the
purview only of specialists. One applies on the playground and in
the workplace and at the dinner table; the other is confined to the
Council on Foreign Relations, congressional committee chambers and
university seminar rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weeks and months ahead will clarify Americans'
views of Bill Clinton, they may be even more important for the way
they clarify Americans' views on a series of issues that define the
nation's social character as much as its political character: the
difference between truth and falsehood, the nature of trust, the
sanctity of the marriage bond, the meaning of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Almost never has the nation's political life prompted such
searching social questions, a national inquiry with the potential
of shaping the personal lives and outlook of the very people the
nation's leaders are supposed to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most American political crises have involved
political questions, critical but theoretical. This political
crisis involves personal questions, all the more critical because
of their practical application in the lives of millions.
</P>
<P>
   During the American Revolution, Americans were forced to examine
the relationship between individualism and authority, perhaps the
fundamental question of civic life. During the Civil War, Americans
were forced to examine the relationship between property and
liberty, perhaps the basic question of social life.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clinton presidency is forcing Americans to examine the
deepest and most difficult questions of their intimate lives,
questions that are at the root of our assumptions about family and
fidelity. The president is forcing us to face hard questions: Does
the truth have shadings? Is it permissible to deceive a loved one
to protect a loved one? Is it permissible to deceive a nation to
protect that nation's sensibilities? Are there some questions that
are so personal that they do not deserve an honest answer?
</P>
<P>
   The president's late-hour acknowledgement that he did have a
sexual affair with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky was not
surprising _ but it was nonetheless startling. For months the
affair was a suspicion. Now it is an admission. And that change _ a
jolt to the nation _ may change the level and nature of support for
the president.
</P>
<P>
   But first Americans will have to come to grips with the broader
questions surrounding the president, his character, and his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The most important question for the future of the Clinton
presidency is clearly: What is the relationship between a leader's
private conduct and his public performance? The most pressing
question for the nation may be even more sweeping: What is the
nature of forgiveness, and what transgressions are unforgivable?
</P>
<P>
   It is clear now that Clinton hid behind legalisms when he
claimed he never had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, much as
he hid behind convoluted language when he claimed, six years ago,
that he never broke the laws of the nation, an artful dodge to
conceal that he was abroad when he experimented with marijuana.
Confronted with his deception, he then claimed he did not inhale.
</P>
<P>
   Public-opinion polls have been showing for the past seven months
that few people care about Clinton's private life. The polls have
shown, moreover, a growing suspicion that Clinton did have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. The Pew Research Center survey showed that
52 percent of Americans believed that was ``definitely'' or
``probably'' true in February, compared with 70 percent who felt
the same way last month. At the same time, two Americans out of
three believe that it was likely Clinton lied about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of but 24 hours, it now is clear that the sexual
relationship that Bill Clinton denied ever conducting did, in fact,
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The president's acknowledgement that he had a narrowly defined
physical relationship with Lewinsky is one of the most dramatic
presidential reversals ever. When Franklin Roosevelt turned from
his vow to balance the budget and when Dwight Eisenhower retreated
from his denials that Americans were conducting airborne
reconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union, they were motivated
by forces of national survival and security. President Clinton's
acknowledgement was motivated by the impulse for political
survival.
</P>
<P>
   This is a humiliating turn for him, and a potentially
devastating one.
</P>
<P>
   The currency of leadership is trust. Americans give it freely
but reclaim it frequently. Twice the people handed their trust to
Bill Clinton, and repeatedly during the past seven months they
reaffirmed it. In the American system, however, the leader is
beholden to those he leads. The future of his presidency is now in
the hands of those who put him in the White House in the first
place _ and will be determined by the answers to the perplexing
questions that, unwittingly and unwillingly, he has placed before
all of us.

THE BANE OF NORMAL; VIBE'S FIRST FIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before Marilyn Manson stripped down, slapped on fright
make-up, and ticked off Wal-Mart, there was Wendy O. Williams. In
the late 1970s-early 1980s, she was the maniacal leader of the
Plasmatics, a New York-based punk-metal outfit so visceral they
made the Sex Pistols look like the Captain and Tennille. They sang
rude songs like ``Butcher Baby,'' chain sawed electric guitars, and
blew up a Chevy Nova on Tom Snyder's old late-night show,
``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, she was little more than a rock 'n' roll footnote. Then
she became news again when she put a bag over her head and killed
herself with a .38 handgun in April. In the current  &UR; Spin &LR; , Joy
Williams crafts a stunning coda to a punk maverick who checked out
when her life simply became too normal. At the time of her death,
Williams was 48, and living in Storrs, Conn., which Joy Williams
(no relation to her subject) describes as ``green in the way only
the northeast Connecticut landscape can be green, a thick,
stultifying, clogged, limp, breathless green.'' She had just lost
her job in a health store, and thought herself pathetic for suing
for unemployment benefits. This was hardly the life for a woman
once roughed up by cops after she was arrested for simulating
fellatio on a sledgehammer during a Milwaukee show. The simple life
was no good life, and to reclaim herself, Williams had to erase
herself. ``Her self was gone,'' Joy Williams writes. ``She had
always wanted only to be herself, and she wasn't anymore, she was
with out a self.'' Joy Williams writes with the pungent wail of a
Plasmatics song, but finds a way to speak with compassion, even
reason, about an unspeakable act.

   It's been five years since  &UR; Vibe &LR;  crashed the party as an urban
version of Rolling Stone for the hip-hop nation. The mag founded by
Quincy Jones toasts its half-decade with its ``Juice'' issue which,
at a hefty 312 pages, is heavy enough to cause injury.
Appropriately, Vibe slaps Hollywood heavyweight Will Smith on its
cover, and sends writer Mike Sager to unveil how Smith went from a
jug-eared wiseacre Philly rapper to a &UR;  &LR; movie star who routinely
commands an eight-figure salary. Over a game of golf _ on his own
course _ Smith considers his appeal, which Sager explains as this:
``White people see him as lovable and nonthreatening; most brothers
and sisters see him as being down ... at least as down as he ever
was.'' Smith, who turned down his acceptance into the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1987, says he's in an enviable position
since in some circles since the notion of a black movie star is
still considered an oxymoron. ``... I'm not supposed to be here in
the first place. And there's an entire country of black people _
who whether my movie is good or not _ want me to win. Black people
aren't going to let me go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, there's a fascinating time line that recalls
all that has gone down on Vibe's watch _ the ascension of Quentin
Tarantino and Sean ``Puffy'' Combs; remarkably prescient
predictions of success for Usher, Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott,
Erykah Badu, and the Spice Girls; and death, too much meaningless
death _ Eric ``Eazy-E'' Wright, Selena, Tupac Shakur, and the
Notorious B.I.G.

   Out of London, there's  &UR; Frank &LR; , not to be confused with the
lesbian folk singer Phranc. It's a magazine for women, and yes,
there's an awful lot of space given to fashion, fashionable people,
famous people, and what famous, fashionable people wear while
attending fashion shows _ Vogue's Anna Wintour is wrapped in a
``never PC, but ever immaculate'' fur, as is Allure's Polly Mellen,
while Harper's Baazar's classy Liz Tilberis opts for timeless
cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   But in the middle of those yummy Hermes sweaters and leather
Louis Vuitton mules, there's Jane Bussmann's provocative, biting
essay, ``Death Becomes Us.'' She argues that ``suffering is the new
currency,'' that nothing these days is more transforming than
death, disease, and disaster _ for the living as well as the dead.
Christopher Reeve was a lightly regarded actor until his paralysis
in a riding accident earned him a bestseller and a standing ovation
at the Academy Awards. Last summer's overwhelming mourning of
Princess Diana put a permanent quiver in the British stiff upper
lip, and remade their classic reserve as boundless pathos. Nothing
succeeds, says Bussmann, like sudden death. ``In life, the media
may dismiss you, but when that biopsy report comes in bad, you
become its special-needs baby,'' she writes. ``It's a telling
reflection on the newsmakers that only cancer had the power to
transform Linda McCartney in their eyes from the Beatles-stealing
veggie food vendor into a front-page saint.'' Ouch. And while the
piece is presented from a distinctly British point of view, make no
mistake that such post-mortem revisionism is just as popular on
this side of the Atlantic.

   &UR; Cigar Aficionado &LR; , the magazine for those convinced they are
hipper and sexier with a big, smelly, smoking thing in their
mouths, has lippy actress Gina Gershon on its cover, but the real
worthwhile read is Marc Wortman's feature on amateur baseball
leagues for men over 30. Some &UR;  &LR; of the players are former big
leaguers like one-time Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee. But most are
regular guys _ stockbrokers, factory workers, teachers. They're the
guys who've gotten thin on top, thick in the middle, and leg out a
triple on balky knees. Some of the participants first played the
game on sandlots back when Babe Ruth was parking balls in the upper
decks of stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   It's a poignant story, a tribute to all who still love baseball
for the pure, splendid, and beautiful game it is. ``In an era when
the game of baseball has taken some hard knocks at its top
levels,'' Wortman writes, ``old guys playing a boy's game just for
the love of it make it easy to believe that summer will never
end.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Everyone, it seems, knew the secret
except the little girl. The family in Japan knew. The family in
Mississippi knew. Even the family in Puerto Rico knew. In fact, so
many people knew that it really wasn't a secret at all. Except to
the little girl.
</P>
<P>
   But the little girl grew up, eventually becoming a highly
regarded feminist and theologian who now, at age 48, runs the
Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College. She's been a high school
cheerleader and prom queen, earned a PhD, been a college
instructor, gotten married and divorced, and landed here as the
director of a prestigious think tank for women. But probably
nothing Rita Nakashima Brock has done has changed her self-image as
much as the document she found in a small metal box in a small
bedroom of a small house in Barstow, Calif., 15 years ago. ``Oh, my
God!'' Brock remembers saying loudly as she stared at the paper
that contained the secret everyone else knew. ``I'm adopted!'' Even
now, as Brock struggles to write her memoir of that day and what
she calls the ``massive mystery'' that it revealed, she still seems
startled by the discovery that her mother's husband, the man who
had taught her how to tune the engine of a car and had taken her
fishing and camping so many times, was not her biological father.
When former US Army enlisted man Roy Grady Brock had passed away
seven years earlier, not even Rita Brock's Japanese mother, Ayako,
had whispered the secret. ``I thought my father had died that
day,'' Rita Brock recalls. ``No one at his funeral said anything to
me that would have led me to believe he wasn't my father.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she was dying of cancer in 1983, Ayako Brock clearly
had a change of heart. Inside the metal box of documents she knew
that her three children would open shortly after her death, she
placed an official document headed FAMILY REGISTER. And indeed, on
the day before her mother's funeral, the 33-year-old Rita Brock
found herself staring at the typewritten piece of paper. Translated
into English from Japanese and dated July 3, 1954, it named her as
the person ``to become an adopted child of an American citizen
named Roy Grady Brock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're what?'' Rita's younger sister, Jo Ann, asked her on
that day in Barstow as they sat on their mother's bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm adopted!'' Rita Brock repeated.
</P>
<P>
   When Brock sits in her large corner office at Radcliffe on an
early summer afternoon today, there is still a tremor of
astonishment in her voice. In a heartbeat, she recalls of that late
summer's day in 1983, she had been redefined. But as whom? There
were the practical implications of the discovery, of course,
matters such as her medical history. ``But mostly I was just very
curious,'' she recalls. ``Did my mother not know she was pregnant
when my father left her? And then maybe she couldn't find him? Or
did he know about me and disown me? Had he been disgraced? Had
there been a falling out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it was like my mother wasn't who I'd thought she was. I
mean, my image of my mother was as a rather conventional Japanese
housewife. It turns out she had this whole other life she didn't
tell us about.''
</P>
<P>
   And what to think about Roy Brock? True, father and daughter had
had a parting of the ways when she was in college, even coming to
blows at one point. (``I won,'' Rita Brock points out impassively.)
But the fight was a typical coming-of-age confrontation, inflamed
by the times: Offspring of a World War II POW and Vietnam veteran
becomes involved in antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brock clearly has a great deal of respect for her
adoptive father's accomplishments and for what he gave her. ``He
invested a lot in me,'' she says. ``He grew up in rural Mississippi
and had an eighth-grade formal education. He joined the Army,
fought in World War II, was in a Nazi POW camp, joined the Army
again, went to Japan, married my mother, and did a good job raising
me.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, she still refers to Roy Brock as ``my father.''
</P>
<P>
   But now there was another father to be found. Adopted kids often
search years for their biological parents, chasing down false leads
and wandering through mazes that lead to dead ends. But a few hours
after her mother's funeral, Brock not only got her first clue to
her father's identity, but also an indication that she was among
the last to know the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a picnic table in her mother's back yard, chatting
with an ex-GI and his Japanese wife who were old family friends,
Brock mentioned her discovery. Almost as casually, the couple
explained that they'd always known she was adopted. They told her
that her father was Puerto Rican, but that they didn't know much
more. The only thing that seemed to surprise them was that Rita
Brock herself hadn't known about her father.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 (Reating for all needing; moved originally July 30.)  
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... her father.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You mean your mother didn't tell you?'' they asked
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Now she had a new nationality -- ``I always knew I wasn't half
white,'' she muses today -- but not a name to go with it. That came
within weeks, when her sister found among their mother's belongings
what appeared to be a Japanese birth certificate on which three
words were written in English: Clemente Morales Torres. More
digging produced an address book with an entry for a Maria and
Miguel Torres in Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico. Brock wrote to the
address, but her letter was returned unopened. ``I thought my
father had died or didn't want to see me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't know was that an entire family had been waiting
-- praying -- for her arrival for decades. She didn't know that the
grandmother she'd never met had pasted a halo of Brock's baby
pictures on her bedroom mirror, or that an aunt carried a faded
photograph of her in her wallet. (More people who knew the secret.)
``It was really strange, like being famous and not knowing you're
famous,'' Brock says.
</P>
<P>
   She knew none of this, of course, when she arrived by chance at
a convention in Dorado Beach four months after her mother's death.
Or when she asked a hotel desk clerk how she might track down
someone in the area and he suggested she try any number of old
restaurants where locals hang out. Or when, in the first restaurant
she entered, the cook announced that he knew the brother of one
Clemente Morales Torres. Or when the cook fetched a young man named
Rafi, who said he was related to Clemente Morales Torres and that
Torres had indeed been in Japan after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Brock got a pretty good idea what was coming when she told
Rafi that Torres might be her father and he nonchalantly replied:
``Yeah, I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few hours were chaos. She was taken to meet her uncle,
the proprietor of a nearby store. She was whisked to an elegant
home where she met her two aunts, one of them weeping as she pulled
Brock's baby picture from her wallet. She was hurried to another,
more modest, home where her elderly paternal grandparents -- Miguel
and Maria, no longer living at the address to which Brock had sent
her letter -- were waiting. ``My grandfather embraced me and cried
and mumbled things in Spanish,'' Brock says. ``Then I sat between
the two of them on a couch while they held my hand and talked in
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing was, they all knew. They all knew of the young man who
had joined the Army, gone to Japan, fallen in love, fathered a
child, and come home alone. They had prayed for the child's arrival
in their midst, and the prayers had finally been answered. Even as
the father of the little girl had gone away to live on the US
mainland, even as he was now working as a cab driver in New York,
they had waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing thing,'' says Brock, ``that they had loved
me dearly but had never known me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Brock talked to her father for the first time on the
telephone from Puerto Rico the next morning. He told her that he'd
met her mother in a US hospital in Japan where he'd been an orderly
and she'd been a nurse. He explained that he and Ayako had lived
together for six months after Rita was born, and that he'd been
shipped to Korea. He told her she'd been named after actress Rita
Hayworth, who is part Hispanic. And he conceded he hadn't kept in
touch with Ayako, finally receiving a letter from her announcing
that she'd married and that he should never try to contact her or
their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cried a lot,'' Brock says of that first conversation. ``He
said several times that he had wanted to find me but had wanted to
respect my mother's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brock did not, she recalls, have any strong feelings about
this voice at the other end of the line. To her, it seemed she was
simply having a polite conversation with a stranger. ``He just
seemed like some guy that I was supposed to know but didn't feel
any connection to,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Later they would meet face to face in New York. Torres would cry
again, but Brock still didn't know what to feel. ``It was a numbing
experience in some ways,'' she recalls. ``Many of my assumptions
around the experience had been shattered. I'd thought it would be
hard to find him. I thought people might be unhappy to see me. So I
couldn't connect to the intense euphoria in Puerto Rico. More than
anything, it was bewildering.''
</P>
<P>
   It still is. Four times divorced, Torres, now in his early 70s,
lives in Chattanooga, Tenn., where he is a part-time security
guard. Brock, herself divorced with no children, sees him only
about once a year. He signs his cards, ``Dad.'' She calls him
``Clemente.'' ``He really doesn't know me in the way a father would
know me,'' says Brock. ``We don't have those shared experiences.
He's not someone I would go to for help. . . . It's hard to imagine
him as my father. Mostly he's this person who connects me to this
very interesting family in Puerto Rico.'' Describing herself as
``half Puerto Rican but not culturally Puerto Rican,'' Brock says
she'd eventually like to live on the island, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she still wonders why her mother never told her the
secret. And she wishes she had. She muses aloud about the
difficulties her mother must have faced in raising a mixed-race
child within a xenophobic culture. And hadn't Ayako Brock written
in longhand to Clemente Torres in March 1953, when she told him not
to contact her, ``If necessary to tell (Rita) I will tell her about
you?'' But she never did tell her, except by leaving a document in
a metal box as she was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably had some intent to tell me, but the longer she
waited the harder it got,'' Brock theorizes.
</P>
<P>
   After she had learned the secret and found her birth father,
Rita Brock visited her adoptive father's family in rural
Mississippi. When she told her Aunt Pearl Gilmore that she'd
discovered she wasn't Roy Brock's daughter and that her father was
really Puerto Rican, the older woman didn't blink. Yes: she knew,
too. Heck, Aunt Pearl allowed as how just about everyone knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way to do it,'' Aunt Pearl declared, laughing.
``You tell people something but don't tell them it's a secret. That
way they won't talk about it.''

HIGH YIELDS MAKE FUNDS WORTH A WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the stock market flirts with a correction, the venture
capital market appears to be headed for a banner year, and venture
capitalists say investors are flocking to their funds with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason is because the returns to date have been
phenomenal,'' said Arthur J. Marks, a general partner in the
Reston, Va.-based venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates.
``That's what attracts the money.''
</P>
<P>
   From an outsider's perspective, venture capital funds are a
risky investment. Fully one-third of venture-backed start-ups fail,
Marks says, and businesses that do survive may not yield the
returns that investors want.
</P>
<P>
   But to a venture capitalist _ and to increasing numbers of
institutional investors, including pension funds and university
endowments with stock-market winnings to invest _ the venture
market looks like the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright people with creative ideas who can create valuable
companies will always be an opportunity that we will be investing
in,'' said Barry J. Fidelman, an Atlas Ventures general partner.
</P>
<P>
   Part of venture capitalists' optimism can be traced to their
patience for their investments. While stock market investors may
envision selling shares quickly, venture capital funds typically
invest for the long term, expecting to wait three to five years, or
longer, before a venture company makes money for the fund through a
sale or initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   This longer perspective means venture funds seek out tomorrow's
hot investments, not the bestsellers of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're looking for is market segments that are going to
experience rapid market growth over the next few years,'' said
Stephen J. Gaal, who has worked for venture capital funds for 20
years, and who now runs Gaal &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the investments appear to be paying off for fund
investors. Paul J. Ferri, a general partner with Matrix Partners in
Waltham, says the high-tech start-up companies in which Matrix
venture capital funds invest can yield 10 percent to 100 percent
returns annually, a figure he calls ``off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Howard Anderson,president of the Yankee Group and a
partner in Wellesley's Battery Ventures, says about 20 percent of
the companies his funds back are successful, yielding about a 40
percent annual &UR;  &LR; return.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, venture capitalists say they expect a downturn in
the venture market over the next several years, an inevitability,
they say, in a cyclical process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the venture community is going to face the same
kinds of corrections the stock market seems to be confronting right
now,'' said Katherine C. Ives, senior vice president of Atlantic
Capital Corp. in Boston. But venture capitalists remained
optimistic about the venture market's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the amount of capital that's now available to venture
firms, given that we've been in a basically strong economy, it's
unlikely that over the next decade the returns are going to be as
good as they were in the last decade,'' Gaal said. ``On the other
hand, my guess is that venture capital investing will be the best
asset class to be investing in over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side of the venture capital boom, Gaal said, are the
venture business owners themselves, who benefit directly from
venture capital investments in the companies they start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is this is a great time to be an
entrepreneur,'' he said. ``Technological change is at an all-time
high, and availability of capital is at an all-time high.''

FOR N.E. FIRMS, LURE OF START-UPS REMAINS HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reaffirming their confidence in Yankee ingenuity, venture
capital funds pumped $379.5 million during the second three months
of 1998 into 86 New England companies preparing to launch products
and services, ranging from automation to auto repair.
</P>
<P>
   Software developers and Internet-based companies dominated the
firms tallied by The Boston Globe/PricewaterhouseCoopers Money Tree
Survey, as they have in almost every quarter since the survey began
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The regional list also encompassed medical pioneers, retail
stores, two companies with ideas about selling coffee, and 16
communications start-ups, including the maker of voice-actuated
office phone systems and a cellular-phone rental firm.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 10 percent of the funding went to a single firm,
Praecis Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge, which is on the home
stretch in developing a drug to control prostate cancer and
received $37.8 million to carry out final clinical trials and begin
pilot production.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter total investment was down markedly from the
$534.2 million put into start-up New England companies in the first
quarter by venture firms, which use cash pooled by pension and
endowment funds and from wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick M. Gray, partner in the global technology industry group
at PricewaterhouseCoopers, called this a statistical fluke,
accentuated by the fact that New England's most prominent
entrepreneurial sector, &UR;  &LR; software, typically needs less money than
other industries to bring products to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England always seems to lack in the really large deals,''
Gray said _ such as the $50 million venture funds advanced to a
Texas company to explore for oil in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Gray noted that the combined investment total for the first half
of this year, $913.8 million, is the highest in the survey's
history. He predicted that activity should pick up because demand
for investment opportunities is high. If the second-quarter decline
``is the start of a trend,'' he said, ``we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The PricewaterhouseCoopers survey is the successor to The Boston
Globe/Price Waterhouse Venture Capital Survey. Its new name results
from the July merger of two of the nation's largest accounting
firms, Price Waterhouse and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, &UR;  &LR; each of which
previously conducted its own quarterly venture capital survey.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the survey found venture investment during the
period at a 3 1/2-year high of $3.7 billion, up nearly 12 percent
from the first quarter of 1998 and 26 percent more than the second
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   California's high-technology region, Silicon Valley, again was
the leading venture money magnet, with 224 companies sharing almost
$1.25 billion in funding, one-third of the US total. Nearly 48
percent of that Silicon Valley investment was in software and
information services companies.
</P>
<P>
   New England held on to second in national rankings with 10.1
percent of investment, up almost 15 percent from the period in
1997. Massachusetts accounted for 87 percent of that investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast placed third, with $348.2 million, half of that
going to communications and health care companies. Texas was fourth
with $290.4 million in venture investment.
</P>
<P>
   Although less strong than in the past, communications was an
important sector in New England, with support going to products and
services ranging from network management software to the low-power
radio transmitters being developed by PinPoint Corp. of Bedford to
help hospitals keep track of wheelchairs and other movable
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A New York hospital is testing the system now. PinPoint plans to
use the $8 million it got from APV Technology Partners, Prism
Venture Partners, and others to begin marketing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Praecis Pharmaceuticals plans to use its $37.8 million financing
for final-round human clinical trials of its peptide-based
pharmaceutical and to begin pilot production operations to satisfy
federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Praecis's president and chief executive, Malcolm Gefter, said
those final human tests will begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   Venture fund managers said their interest in entrepreneurial
investment is undiminished by uncertainties in broader markets.
Although these firms commonly expect annual returns of 50 to 60
percent on high-risk investments, they do so knowing ideas can take
years to create a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time horizon is much different than an investor who is
trying to make good money this year,'' said Howard Anderson, a
partner at Battery Ventures, in Wellesley, and president of the
Yankee Group, a technology information and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Strong stock market gains and a long string of successful
start-ups have fueled the supply of venture capital. Additionally,
endowment funds have joined pension funds in placing up to 5
percent of their investment portfolio into venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a pretty flush environment,'' said James
Iuliano, president and chief executive of E Ink Corp. of Cambridge,
recounting how he solicited the $15.8 million the company won in
first-round financing to develop a way to print electronically on
paper. ``It is fairly easy to get immediate interest for a
high-quality deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a one-time shortage of managers to guide new companies is
evaporating, said Arthur J. Marks, partner at New Enterprise
Associates, a Reston, Va., venture fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be hard to recruit experienced CEOs to run a
venture,'' Marks said. ``Now it is, `I want to work for a small
company. Corporate America has limited careers.'''
</P>
<P>
   One start-up seizing on this shift in corporate perspective is
Lexington Software Associates. It now manages a global network of
consultants offering technical support for a software tool,
ClearCase, widely used by software developers but no longer
supported by the company that makes it.
</P>
<P>
   Cam Collins, vice president for sales and marketing, said
Lexington is using $1,050,000 from Brook Venture Fund and Private
Equity Funds LLC to build an engineering and training center in
Westford and add employees. He said sales will approach $3.5
million this year and $7 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at development from another angle, VentureCom Inc. of
Cambridge got $9 million to hire more people to perfect and market
programs that drive factory machinery from a central computer,
using Microsoft's NT and CE operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dexter-Smith, VentureCom's chief executive, said the
product is meant to make computer-controlled systems
multifunctional &UR;  &LR; and as compatible with each other as parallel
office desktop systems are now.
</P>
<P>
   In Acton, Indus River Networks Inc. will deploy its $8.7 million
funding from One-Liberty Associates, Canaan Partners, New
Enterprise Associates, and Pioneer Capital Partners to begin
marketing its Internet-based communications system, designed to
link corporate field personnel with the home office without risk to
security or privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to save users 50 to 80 percent on corporate phone
bills, the system attracted broad investor interest, Indus River
chief executive Per Suneby said. ``We were oversubscribed,'' and
turned away some proposed contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Another major funding round, $16 million, went to Silknet
Software Inc. of Manchester, N.H., to increase marketing and sales
of its system that lets telephone call centers answer customer
inquries via the Internet. Silknet estimates that 50 to 70 percent
of all questions now answered by voice are asked frequently. Its
system steers customers to find the answers via the World Wide Web
on their own, and if that fails, to communicate with technical
experts via e-mail _ at less cost per call.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a trend, Silknet's financing included investors with
an inherent understanding of the product _ among them,
computer-chip maker Intel Corp. and an arm of CMG Information Group
Inc., which specializes in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several start-up company executives said tapping sources that
already understand the product saves time. N-Able Corp. of Danvers,
which is developing credit-card sized devices to ensure security in
automated bank transactions, got much of its $6.5 million
second-round funding from an affiliate of Chase Manhattan Bank and
from Cambridge Samsung Partners, affiliated with Samsung, the South
Korea computer-chip company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always find money, but you really want to find
strategic money,'' said N-Able's chief executive, Jeff Grammer.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Sterling Collision Centers Inc. of Natick, which is
building a national chain of auto body repair shops, got its
$25 &UR;  &LR; million of second-round funding from Conning Insurance Capital
Funds of Hartford and Berkshire Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Conning, which gets its cash from insurance companies and
specializes in supporting start-ups with with industry ties, was a
logical source because Sterling proposes to cut repair costs by
improving relations between shops and insurers, said Jonathan
McNeill, cofounder and copresident of Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire, in turn, has a history of funding companies whose
primary strategy is consolidation in fragmented industries. ``We
knew they would immediately grasp the potential of our business
plan,'' McNeill said.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling owns 30 auto body shops in and around eight US cities
and expects to have 50 by next year. It proposes to cut costs as
much as 20 percent by reducing time in negotiations among insurers
and shop operators. ``The goal for the consumer is, `Give me my car
back,''' McNeill said. ``Right now that takes 13 days, although the
work takes only two days. The rest of that time is spent
haggling.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Lotus Development Corp.'s chief executive, Jeffrey
Papows, strode to the front of a Senate hearing room last month to
join a parade of executives blasting Microsoft Corp.'s business
practices, he was doing an about-face.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Papows had tried to duck the controversy over
whether the software giant uses its dominance in computer operating
systems to unfairly stifle competition in other parts of the
software market. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lotus, a Cambridge, Mass. unit of International
Business Machines Corp., has a complex relationship with Microsoft.
It is both a technology partner and a competitor. For that reason,
Papows preferred not to toss rocks at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   So why the change of heart?
</P>
<P>
   One reason, it would seem, is that Microsoft _ which a few years
back walloped Lotus in the spreadsheet market it virtually invented
and once dominated _ is again breathing down Lotus's neck in the
emerging market for messaging and groupware _ software that lets
distant employees collaborate on a single project or document.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus also pioneered that market in late 1989 with the
introduction of Lotus Notes, following it up with an Internet-based
product called Domino. Today, Notes has more than 25 million users
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft introduced a
competing product called Exchange _ and it is gaining fast, with
about 16 million copies installed in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, Exchange outsold Notes for
the first time, 3 million copies to 2.7 million, according to
figures supplied by Lotus. Although it was Lotus' third-best
quarter ever, it was a milestone that clearly has Lotus worried. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The company is reorganizing its North American sales division
and bringing in new management in hopes of holding off Microsoft's
charge. And IBM &UR;  &LR; is stepping forward to promote Notes as an
integral part of its electronic commerce business strategy,
something it didn't do initially after buying the company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is more intense,'' Papows acknowledged in a
recent interview. But he insisted that the heat was being generated
internally and was not coming from IBM, which paid $3.2 billion for
the company, largely to get its hands on Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Papows rejected the notion that his decision to testify against
Microsoft, after resisting for so long, was a desperate attempt to
place blame for his company's shrinking market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair question,'' conceded Papows, who had been pestered
to testify for months by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the
Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is
investigating allegations that the world's largest software company
engages inmonopolistic business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch finally wore him down, Papows said, with a personal
appeal. ``He said, `I've talked to a lot of people in the industry,
and not only are you not helping me protect your industry, the fact
that you are not visible on this issue is a deterrent to getting
other CEOs to testify.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was a responsibility I was shirking. Frankly, that
cut pretty deep,'' Papows said.
</P>
<P>
   Papows said that he testified reluctantly, that he was careful
to emphasize that the companies have a good relationship overall,
and that he is not among the legions of ``Bill-bashers,'' people
who love to hate Bill Gates, Microsoft's billionaire chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He told the committee he was concerned that by bundling its
Exchange messaging software, at little or no cost, with other
popular office software, Microsoft was driving prices on groupware
down to zero, effectively locking out other competitors, including
Lotus Notes.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that Microsoft was using its dominance of
operating systems, which control a computer's basic functions, to
force computer makers to pre-load Exchange onto their machines,
again locking out competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you own the bridge &UR;  &LR; and control the toll gate, pretty
soon you get to decide what kind of cars get across the bridge,''
Papows testified.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials declined to comment on Papows' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But even Papows admits that some of Lotus's problems are of its
own making.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while IBM and Lotus officials maintain that the 1995
buyout was good for both companies, they admit that they probably
goofed by not trying to leverage IBM's enormous market presence to
help Lotus fend off Microsoft Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mutual mistake by not more prominently and visibly
linking the companies strategically,'' Papows said. ``We were so
manic about maintaining Lotus as a separate brand identity, that we
didn't do a lot to run Domino and Notes as part of IBM's e-business
ads.''

   IBM officials agree. ``Perhaps if we had positioned Domino as
the crown jewel of our e-business offering sooner, it would have
blunted their success, but it probably would not have resulted in a
major forestalling of the Microsoft juggernaut, given some of their
business tactics,'' said Mark Elliot, general manager of worldwide
sales and marketing for IBM's $13 billion software business.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales of Lotus Notes are still growing dramatically,
the inroads that Microsoft Exchange has made, especially in North
America, are worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources say US sales last quarter of Lotus Notes were
$90 million behind the company's plan, but Papows called the number
``grossly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that Lotus's North American business has
not performed as well as in other regions of the world, where
Microsoft is barely a factor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company is overhauling its North American
operations, bringing in a new manager with increased
responsibilities. Mike Laginski is a Papows protege who joined
Lotus five years ago, but left shortly after IBM bought the
company.
</P>
<P>
   He returned recently to take control of North American
operations and helps fill a void created by the departure of a
Deborah Besemer, a highly regarded Lotus executive who left last
November to become chief executive of SystemSoft, a Natick software
company.
</P>
<P>
   While reorganizing its internal operations, Lotus officials have
also mounted a public campaign to counter a damaging article that
appeared recently in Forbes magazine entitled &UR;  &LR;  ``The Decline and
Fall of Lotus.''
</P>
<P>
   The article said that IBM's purchase of Lotus had turned sour,
and that many large Lotus customers were ripping out their Notes
systems in favor of Microsoft Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated Lotus officials are demanding a retraction, and,
meanwhile, are moving to try to calm anxious employees and
customers who have spent millions installing Notes systems. Forbes
says it is standing by the story.
</P>
<P>
   Papows says it is true that some of Ltus's large customers are
installing Microsoft Exchange for corporate e-mail purposes, but
says they are retaining Notes for its advanced collaborative
features, many of which Exchange does not have.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees, but says its Exchange customers eventually
plan to replace Notes because they don't want to maintain two
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Baan Co. in Reston, Va., a major producer of business management
software for large companies, is one highly visible defector from
the Lotus camp.
</P>
<P>
   John Douglas, director of information technology, said that Baan
took a critical look last year at its Lotus Notes installation,
which served about 5,000 users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Notes implementation here was pretty abysmal,'' said
Douglas. ``There were a lot of hardware issues, and the cost of
administration was high.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas grants that the advanced groupware features of Notes are
superior to those of Exchange, but added that Baan was mainly
interested in a straightforward messaging system. In that
department, Douglas said, Exchange gets top grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely shocked at the amount of hardware it takes to
run Exchange _ or the lack thereof,'' Douglas said, adding that he
needed 40 server computers to run the Notes system. Today, Baan
runs an Exchange system that supports 10,000 users _ twice as many
as the Notes system it replaced. But Exchange requires just three
servers, powerful machines that link PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Baan is a major business ally of Microsoft in the development of
high-end business software. But Douglas said that this played no
part in the decision to switch to Exchange. ``We didn't even
contact IBM or Microsoft,'' said Douglas. ``We made the decision
internally.'' And Baan turned a deaf ear to Lotus's efforts to
reverse the decision. ``Notes is a good platform,'' said Douglas.
``It's just not for us.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, M&AMP;I Data Services, the data processing
division of Milwaukee-based Marshall &AMP; Ilsley Corp., left
Microsoft's older e-mail program, Microsoft Mail, to jump on the
Notes bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wallace, director of technical infrastructure, said his
company wanted to create an Intranet, a private network based on
Internet standards, with the ability to route forms around the
company, and other collaborative features, and found Exchange
couldn't do the job without a lot of expensive add-on software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the Domino-based solution was one third of the cost of
the Exchange-based solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who track the groupware market say the Forbes article
was way off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lotus is not declining, it is not falling,'' wrote Dan Rasmus,
an analyst with Giga Inforamtion Group Inc. of Norwell, shortly
after the Forbes story was published. ``Lotus is in fact holding
its own against Microsoft where other companies have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent research firm, Gartner Group of Stamford,
Conn., says it'll be mid-2001 before Microsoft catches Lotus in
sales of groupware, and points out that Exchange still dramatically
lags behind Notes's collaborative features.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is far from over, and Lotus is in a very good spot, a
very defensible spot'' said Ian Campbell, an analyst with
International Data Corp. of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two horse race and we're neck and neck,'' said Papows.

HBO OFFERS A COMPELLING LOOK AT SINATRA AND THE RAT PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Listen up, women. I'm probably breaking some
secret guy code by telling you this, but I have a job to do _ and,
besides, it is only fair:
</P>
<P>
   If your man watches ``The Rat Pack,'' the new HBO movie on
Frank, Dean, Sammy and the boys, and he doesn't admit afterward to
being a tad jealous, he's lying.
</P>
<P>
   Don't argue, guys. You are.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra's crew gets to party all they want, where they want,
when they want, another bourbon and cigarette and finger-snap away.
Movies _ as in acting in them _ are a pleasant diversion, something
to do for a gas. They look equally cool in tuxes or sweaters. To
top it off, nobody, nobody, can sing like them.
</P>
<P>
   And women? You want to talk women? They are always on the
fringes, waiting to be selected for a night of whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rat Pack,'' a 118-minute movie that premieres Saturday at
9 p.m. EDT (check local listings), covers a sliver of Sinatra's
days and nights in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It doesn't tell
the whole story of arguably America's greatest entertainer, but the
movie is a compelling glimpse of a man much more complex than his
dem-dese-dose persona.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a historical movie like this is, we are at
first jolted when we see performers playing performers. Ray Liotta?
That's not Sinatra. Don Cheadle? He's not Sammy Davis Jr. Joe
Mantegna as Dean Martin? Well, forget that one. You buy into that
you are watching Martin from the moment Mantegna appears on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rat Pack'' does not strive for imitation (the songs are
dubbed in from the actual singers). The biggest compliment you
could pay to a movie like this is that after 20 minutes or so, you
forget you're watching Liotta and Cheadle and Mantegna and find
yourself lost in this glitzy world that included actor Peter
Lawford (Angus Macfadyen), comedian Joey Bishop (Bobby Slayton) and
other assorted players.
</P>
<P>
   As 1960 dawns, Sinatra and Co. are the kings of Las Vegas and
California. Women flock to them, as well as their friends like John
F. Kennedy (William Petersen) and mobster Sam ``Momo'' Giancana. In
fact, one woman, Judith Campbell (in real life Judith Exner)
eventually beds both Kennedy and later Giancana.
</P>
<P>
   He has friends, power and women, but Sinatra wants to be a
bigger player in a bigger game: presidential politics. Sinatra
decides JFK is the man to lead the country. Just to make sure that
happens, Frank enlists the help of his close friend Momo to secure
the results of the West Virginia primary and in Illinois in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it, Dino, we did it,'' Sinatra tells Martin on election
night. ``We're going to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. While JFK liked Frank _ and the women who came with
that friendship _ Bobby Kennedy was leery of the crooner's
associations with mobsters. Bobby ends up nixing a planned visit by
the president to Frank's Palm Springs spread _ which he expanded
solely for the president. It is the ultimate treason, one that
forever turns Sinatra against Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Liotta brings Sinatra's intensity, while Mantegna exudes the
aloofness of Martin. But the standout of the movie is Cheadle
(``Bulworth,'' ``Out of Sight''), who captures the complexity of
Davis in his role as friend/mascot of Frank.
</P>
<P>
   All these guys bust on each other, both behind the scenes and on
stage. No ethnic or racial slur is out of bounds because there is
no malice intended. But the barbs still sting, as evidenced when
Davis, zinged with a watermelon joke, doubles over in laughter and
turns his back to the audience _ to hide a restrained grimace.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is quick to remind his angered fiancee, who is white,
that it was Sinatra who first discovered him, and who was a kindly
friend after a car accident cost him an eye. Sinatra would serve as
Davis' best man _ even though criticism and, in some quarters,
hatred ran high over an interracial marriage. Friends do that sort
of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The party doesn't last forever, and members of the Pack soon
fray and fade into irrelevance after the landing of the Beatles.
``The whole world is drunk and we are just the cocktail of the
moment, pal,'' Martin said at a party, foreseeing the
not-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Over time the boys did get back together occasionally, but it's
more of a nostalgia act. Eventually they died off. ``I miss my
guys,'' an aged Frank says in the movie backstage before one of his
later shows. ``I miss my guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra died May 15 at 82, after production began on the film
(the Sinatra family did not cooperate with movie). But, man, did he
live a party we'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, it's enough to make a guy just a little bit jealous.

MGI PROPERTIES PLANNING LIQUIDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later this week, big real estate investors will start getting
packages in the mail meant to tickle their interest in eight rare
portfolios of property.
</P>
<P>
   The 64 buildings themselves are nothing out of the ordinary:
suburban commercial space, some city office buildings that won't be
mistaken for trophy towers, and a group of industrial properties.
Ballpark value: up to $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the property special is that it will all be
liquidated out of MGI Properties Inc. of Boston, a real estate
investment trust that decided shareholders would be better off if
it stopped trying to buck the market and simply cashed out.
</P>
<P>
   Liquidations are not unprecedented, but they are rare in the
world of real estate investment trusts. One other Boston-based
trust, Property Capital Trust, has nearly completed a liquidation
under a plan adopted at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   MGI first floated its plan in June and directors formally
approved the idea last week. Shareholders will get proxy material
within weeks and vote in October. MGI shares were trading at about
23 when the liquidation idea was first announced, and trust
executives have since estimated they could raise $30 to $33 per
share in a liqudiation. The stock finished Tuesday at 27 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate investment trusts, investing in all types of
properties, have taken a pounding all year. The Bloomberg REIT
index, which tracks the performance of 161 public trusts, is down
11.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the liquidation of MGI has as much to do with the
development of real estate stock investing than the sector's
current lack of popularity. Big real estate investment trusts have
become dramatically bigger, winning most of Wall Street's interest
and important financial advantages at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   MGI was unlikely to succeed in a world where bigger was better
and getting bigger all the time. Always a medium-sized trust, MGI
has struggled to interest investors in its smaller properties and
faces a future of relatively high capital costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably looks to people like a result of the fact that
REIT stocks are in the dumper right now,'' said Barry Vinocur,
editor of Realty Stock Review. ``But this is the end of what has
been a long-standing frustration on the part'' of MGI chief
executive Pearce Coues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very responsible move by management to
basically say, we don't see a way to maximize shareholder value,''
said Vinocur. He thinks other smaller and midsized trusts will have
to face up to the same problem soon.
</P>
<P>
   Coues declined to be interviewed and other MGI executives said
they were unable to discuss the decision until proxy materials had
been mailed.
</P>
<P>
   By public real estate trust standards, MGI is an old-timer.
Formed in 1971, it survived the financial disasters of the
mortgage-REIT era as a hybrid trust that made loans and invested in
real estate. MGI executives saw great values in New England
commercial real estate by 1992 and started to reposition its
portfolio, once heavy with apartment building investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a screaming buy to us,'' said Phillip Vitali,
MGI's treasurer. The timing turned out to be impeccable, but MGI
never put the kind of money others would spend behind the call.
</P>
<P>
   But MGI took small bites from the beginning. It has bought about
$50 million of real estate a year, mostly within Route 495. Many of
the properties are worth $3 million to $12 million, far less than
the values of downtown showcase buildings big real estate
investment trusts prefer today.
</P>
<P>
   MGI financed its purchases in part by going to the stock market
twice, raising about $27 million in 1993 and another $44 million
early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to Beacon Properties Corp., which went public in
1994 with a collection of high-profile Boston buildings and sold
out to Equity Office Properties Trust last year.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon went to the stock market seven times in three years to
fuel its aggressive buying plans, raising nearly $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, MGI seems to believe it can't get people to appreciate
the value of a smaller scale. Or perhaps its managers just see a
market top too high to resist. Whatever the reason, some REIT
analysts don't want to see MGI go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped they would keep at it because I'm very happy to
see companies with different approaches in the market,'' said Fred
Carr of the Penobscot Group, which tracks public real estate
trusts. ``Somebody with that kind of buy low, sell high sense, you
don't want them to disappear from the market.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The director of the State Rating Bureau, which helps set
insurance rates on everything from autos to health to workers'
compensation, resigned Tuesday on his 12th anniversary with the
Massachusetts Division of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Steven D'Amato, who has headed the rating bureau for nearly
seven years, said ``a lot of factors'' went into his decision to
leave, but declined to elaborate. ``I can tell you I'm not leaving
because the auto industry is asking for a 15 percent increase in
rates. I would have looked forward to fighting that.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, 40, did not outline any specific job plans, but said he
expects to continue working on insurance issues. ``I want to prove
you can leave the division of insurance without working for an
insurance company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation is effective Sept. 8. A spokesman said the
division expects to name an interim replacement soon.

HMOS HIT UNLIMITED PRESCRIPTION COVERAGE FOR SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For years, seniors in Massachusetts have enjoyed a
unique benefit under state law _ unlimited prescription drug
coverage for those who join Medicare health maintainance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   That benefit, the most generous in America, could soon
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs, backed by federal regulators, are arguing that a 1997
federal law exempts them from Massachusetts regulations &UR;  &LR;  requiring
unlimited drug coverage, and other benefits called for by state
law.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the only state that requires unlimited
prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of curtailed drug benefits has alarmed senior
advocates, and incensed state regulators who insist that HMOs
comply with Massachusetts law. More than 211,500 seniors in the
state belong to HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply will not stand by and let these benefits be cut,''
said Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, who fired off a strongly worded
letter Tuesday to Donna E. Shalala, US secretary of health and
human services, urging her to require HMOs to comply with
Massachusetts standards. Shalala's office declined to comment, as
did the US Health Care Financing Administration, an agency under
HHS that regulates Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials say they have tried for months to clear
up the apparent conflict by approaching HCFA, but the agency hasn't
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some HMOs are proceeding with plans to scale back
drug benefits, beginning January 1999. The move in Massachusetts
comes amid similar measures by HMOs across the country to cope with
soaring drug costs and reduced Medicare reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Massachusetts proposals awaiting federal approval: &UR;  &LR; 
_Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts said it has applied
to &UR;  &LR;  the federal government for permission to cap prescription drug
coverage at $1,200 a year and charge $60 in monthly premiums for
its BlueCare 65 HMO. Medex Gold, a ``Medigap'' product seniors buy
to supplement their traditional Medicare coverage, will continue to
offer unlimited drug benefits, as required by state law.
</P>
<P>
   _Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, which has about 60,000 seniors in
its First Seniority HMO, has proposed to offer a maximum of $800 in
prescription drug benefits per calendar year at no charge to
seniors in Eastern Massachusetts, sources familiar with the filings
said. In Western Massachusetts, seniors would pay a $25 monthly
premium.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Health Plan, which operates Secure Horizons, the largest
Medicare HMO in the state, said it had filed a request with HCFA to
sell a plan with limited drug benefits, but declined to reveal its
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon Community Health Plan in Worcester is still planning to
continue offering an unlimited drug plan in 1999, according to Jay
Egan, co-executive director of Fallon. But Egan said that could
change.
</P>
<P>
   HMO executives say they are caught in a dilemma. The Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 frees Medicare HMOs from state benefit mandates.
Health plans say they would like to offer unlimited drug benefits.
But if any single plan becomes the only one in the market with full
drug benefits while others limit benefits, only the sickest seniors
needing the most medications _ who are the most expensive seniors
to insure &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; would flock to the plan with unlimited benefits, HMO
officials say. That would make the plan's &UR;  &LR;  potential losses
staggering, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard Pilgrim believes that the best public policy would be
for every Medicare HMO in Massachusetts to offer full drug
coverage,'' said Patti &UR;  &LR; Embry-Tautenhan,  &UR;  &LR; a spokeswoman for
Harvard. ``However, unless all Medicare HMOs offer full drug
coverage, it would be financially irresponsible for us to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   While all HMOs can theoretically agree to offer only unlimited
drug benefits, such an agreement could violate state antitrust
laws, &UR;  &LR; according to Alan Raymond, a spokesman for Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond one way to assure all HMOs comply with state law is for
the state Division of Insurance to secure a court ruling requiring
health plans to adhere to state law.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Klein, a spokesman for the Division of Insurance Tuesday
said court action ``is definitely an option, if we feel companies
are in violation of state law.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Klein said the division is working with the state attorney
general's office on the issue. Barbara Anthony, chief of the
attorney general's public protection bureau, said, ``It's our
position that state law applies in this matter.'' She declined to
say whether her office would be pressing the case in court.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates in Massachusetts are stewed over what they see as a
retreat by HMOs. ``It's outrageous,'' said Geoff Wilkinson,
executive director of Massachusetts Senior Action Council. ``This
is the kind of greed and self interest that leads consumers to
demand HMO reform.''

   CLINTON-COLUMN (Undated) It's heartening to learn that Bill
Clinton is capable of embarrassment. At least, he says he is _ for
what little that's worth. He told us Monday night that he
``misled'' us and his family about his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky out of ``a desire to protect myself from the
embarrassment of my own conduct.'' Was he embarrassed as well about
having persisted in a lie for seven months? He didn't say. It also
should put our minds at rest to learn Clinton never pressured
anyone to lie under oath. Of course, he's hardly a credible source
of information on that question. Or on any other question, for that
matter. How can we ever again believe anything this man says?Let's
face it: Bill Clinton is finished.

WHY SHOULD WE EVER BELIEVE ANYTHING BILL CLINTON TELLS US 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's heartening to learn that Bill Clinton is capable of
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   At least, he says he is _ for what little that's worth.
</P>
<P>
   He told us Monday night that he ``misled'' us and his family
about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky out of ``a
desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he embarrassed as well about having persisted in a lie for
seven months? He didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   It also should put our minds at rest to learn Clinton never
pressured anyone to lie under oath. Of course, he's hardly a
credible source of information on that question. Or on any other
question, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   How can we ever again believe anything this man says?
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Bill Clinton is finished.
</P>
<P>
   He's demeaned the presidency and himself. He may hang on by his
fingernails and manage to complete his term, but he will not be
attending to the business we hired him to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   He's an exceedingly troublesome, high-maintenance,
low-productivity employee whose ongoing legal difficulties will
cost us, his employers, even more millions. Meanwhile, the
controversy over his behavior will further paralyze the government.
</P>
<P>
   Not once during his short, forced mea culpa Monday night did the
``s'' word ever cross Clinton' lips. The ``s'' word being shame.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no other word than shame to describe what Clinton's
base behavior has brought to the presidency and to the nation. It
has further lowered the public's respect for politicians and for
the country's political system. This is dangerous for our democracy
and harmful to the republic.
</P>
<P>
   In the past when Clinton has had to confess his transgressions
in public, he's been a perfect picture of contrition and humility.
He's a master manipulator, and he's had lots of experience in
manipulating people into giving him yet another chance.
</P>
<P>
   We should have seen what was coming: This was a man who smoked
marijuana but didn't inhale; one who avoided the draft but who
didn't really try to dodge it.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents telegraphed a pattern of convenient
compartmentalizing of bad behavior, of the hair-splitting and
evasion that has become the hallmark of his disappointing
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has all the earmarks of a man without a moral center.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night there was none of that calculated humility that has
served him so well in the past. There were excuses, however: He
didn't tell the truth about his behavior because he was trying to
protect his family. But the time to think of protecting his family
was before indulging himself with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the din of legalistic and political parsing of
the scandal are certain fundamental elements of this sordid chapter
of American history that need to stay front and center:
</P>
<P>
   First, we didn't elect Clinton to turn the Oval Office and its
precincts into a pornographic playroom.
</P>
<P>
   We have no right to expect perfection in presidents; Jesus
Christ is not standing for office. But where much is given, much is
expected. So we do have every right to expect a certain standard of
decent behavior from those we honor with leadership of the nation.
If presidents cannot be expected to comport themselves within the
basic bounds of decency and propriety, of whom can we ask it?
</P>
<P>
   Nor did we elect Clinton to gratify his sexual appetites with
the hired help _ however compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky may fit the archaic, pre-Sexual Revolution
definition of a loose woman, but there's no escaping the fact that
Clinton was the most powerful man on the planet and she was a
powerless intern as young as his own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The country is littered with hapless ex-bosses who lost their
jobs over much less appalling sexual impropriety with subordinates.
Feminist blather about consensual sex to the contrary, Clinton had
the classic advantage of power in this calamitous conjugation of
two needy people. Even if Lewinsky threw herself at him, he,
supposedly, is the grown-up here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a grown-up, however, what we have in the White House
is an admitted liar, a world-class hypocrite who pays lip service
to ``family values'' and a man of incredibly flawed judgment in
whom we have vested the awesome responsibility of commander in
chief of the world's sole superpower.
</P>
<P>
   But if this man cannot control himself, how can he be entrusted
with the immense power of the presidency?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly has asked for our trust but repeatedly has
shown that he is to be neither trusted nor believed. His political
legacy is a long list of broken promises. In short, he is not a man
of his word.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to take him seriously? He's become a smutty joke.
</P>
<P>
   How can a man thus crippled govern?
</P>
<P>
   The personal tragedy of Bill Clinton is that he's uniquely
gifted with talent for leadership but has shown himself unfit to
lead. His was a presidency of great promise, but he's thrown it
away.
</P>
<P>
   If he truly cares about his family, Clinton should seek
professional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And if he truly cares about the nation, there's still one
honorable, redeeming thing left for Bill Clinton to do: resign.

 &HT;    
 By ROBERT SULLIVAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the fall, the Makah Nation, a Native American tribe of 2,000
people that makes its home at the very northwest tip of the
continental United States, plans to send a crew of eight men out
into the Pacific Ocean in a canoe to harpoon a whale.
 &HT;    It will be the first time a Makah crew has hunted a whale since
the late 1920s, when a tradition of thousands of years was ended
because of overhunting.
 &HT;    So it is an event of great significance to the Makah people, who
consider the whale hunt to be a sacramental act. It is turning out
to be an event of great significance to people who aren't Makah
too.
 &HT;    In the Northwest, a little tribe that no one had heard of is
suddenly front-page news, with environmentalists' protests and
anti-Makah Web sites springing up like the late-summer wildflowers
that drape Washington State's Olympic Peninsula, site of the Makah
reservation.
 &HT;    On a sunny day last winter, as the newly chosen whaling crew was
making its first practice run in Neah Bay, John McCarty, one of the
Makah who were organizing the hunt, stood on the beach and watched
the canoe put into the white-haired waves. ``The whole world,'' he
announced, ``is watching the Makah.''
 &HT;    For the most part, the world is not too happy. In 1996, with the
support of the federal government, the Makah applied to the
International Whaling Commission to hunt whales, citing an 1855
treaty that they say allows them to do so.
 &HT;    But by the time they received permission, in October 1997, to
take up to five California gray whales a year for five years for
ceremonial purposes, everyone from an Australian animal-rights
group to an international whale-watching association had begun
complaining.
 &HT;    This spring, just as a $310,000 grant from the Commerce
Department was winding down, preparations for the hunt nearly came
to an end. At an anti-Makah rally in downtown Seattle in June, Rep.
Jack Metcalf, a Washington state Republican who has spoken of the
American people's ``special relationship with whales,'' vowed to
stop the whale hunt.
 &HT;    As the time for the hunt approaches and protests become
increasingly belligerent _ an anonymous letter threatened that one
Makah would be killed for every whale _ the tribe has taken to
meeting regularly with a law-enforcement task force, partly to
protect the Makah, partly to protect the protesters who are
expected to show up in Neah Bay in late August at the tribe's
annual Makah Days celebration.
 &HT;    The protest operations are being led by the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society, the marine-conservation group based in Marina
del Rey, Calif., that prides itself on having sunk nine whaling
ships during 20 years of whale-hunt protests.
 &HT;    In the past, Sea Shepherd has been a champion of Native American
rights, but in this case it insists that a Makah hunt will be used
by worldwide commercial whaling interests to break the world's
moratorium on hunting whales. (Whale hunting is generally banned
internationally, though a few nations ignore the ban and several
aboriginal groups are allowed special privileges to hunt.)
 &HT;    Paul Watson, the president of Sea Shepherd, plans to block the
Makah whaling crew with his command ship, a flotilla of private
boats and a small decommissioned Norwegian navy submarine armed
with killer-whale sounds intended to frighten away gray whales.
``This is possibly the most important whale hunt in the past 25
years,'' Watson says.
 &HT;    All this is not exactly what the Makah imagined when they
dreamed of one day having a chance to hunt a whale again, back when
it looked as if just getting permission to hunt was the big hurdle.
And yet the Makah _ despite the protests, the political pressure
and a nasty bout of internal squabbling _ are moving ahead with the
hunt.
 -0- 
 &HT;    ``It's a war out there, and we know it,'' George Bowechop, a
village elder and a member of the tribe's whaling commission, told
me one night at a celebration for the return of the hunt. The
protesters' scorn, he said, has made the Makah only more
determined.
 &HT;    ``They want us in the museum. They'd rather we just said, `Oh,
the Makah were great whalers,' and leave it at that. They want us
to have a dead culture. But it's been our way of life. We look at
the ocean and we feel we not only have a legal right but a moral
right to whale.''
 &HT;    On the day last winter when the whaling crew was making its very
first practice run, a few Makah village elders surveyed the action
alongside local kids and a small team of aboriginal and commercial
whalers who had flown in on a kind of whalers' field trip. They
came from Iceland, Tonga, Japan and a few of the other
whale-hunt-friendly places around the world.
 &HT;    One Icelandic whaler _ blond-haired and blue-eyed and wearing a
parka, in contrast to the shirtless, dark-haired Makah crew members
who were shedding their basketball shoes and preparing to paddle
off in gym shorts _ reminded another visitor that the actual
whale-hunting portion of a whale hunt can be difficult too.
 &HT;    ``In Iceland,'' he said, sizing up the Makah's 34-foot canoe,
``we hunt for whales much smaller than the gray whale and we use a
boat that is much bigger than this one. I hope they are careful,
because with a whale, you know, it's not a game.''
 &HT;    Micah McCarty was at the front of the Makah canoe as it set out
that day. Micah is the son of John McCarty and great-grandson of
Hishka, one of the last of the great Makah hunters, and for a long
time Micah has been talked about as the Makah expected to harpoon
the whale.
 &HT;    As he paddled out toward the mouth of the bay, out toward the
snow-covered mountains of British Columbia, all was quiet except
the paddles as they sliced through the gray surf. When you closed
your eyes you could imagine a hunt that was free of protests,
politics and bureaucracy _ a hunt like his great-grandfather might
have led.
 &HT;    Micah talked about how the canoes of his ancestors were equipped
with food and water for several days, in case the whale fought and
ran and dragged the boat through the ocean. ``We could get one
right away or we might have to go for a while,'' he said.
 &HT;    With that, Micah rose up in the canoe, and, though there was no
great hump of barnacled whale rising up from the flat surface of
the sea, he drew back his arm and stood as if he were about to
launch his harpoon.
 -0- 
 &HT;    For the Makah, the idea behind the whale hunt was simple. By
resurrecting this cultural and spiritual centerpiece of the tribe,
the community would blossom again and the local economy might even
be revived.
 &HT;    Unlike most tribes in the United States, the Makah live on their
ancestral land, on the very peninsula of cedar trees and rocky,
volcanic cliffs from which their great-grandparents set off in
search of gray whales. As it is now, Neah Bay, the reservation's
main village, is a small fleet of ramshackle houses on streets
lined with old furniture and rusty appliances. About 50 percent of
the villagers are unemployed. The hunt has in some ways created a
canoe-based empowerment zone.
 &HT;    Though the Makah no longer crave the taste of whale meat, the
gray whale has historically been considered life sustaining.
Traditional tribal stories tell of the time when the Makah could
not leave the land for food because of great storms and
Thunderbird, a flying wolflike god, delivered a whale to their
shores.
 &HT;    But for the last two generations, this life-sustaining
relationship has become a parody. Even when dead whales have washed
ashore on the Makah's beaches, armed federal guards have been
posted to keep the tribe from carving them up.
 &HT;    Some opponents of the Makah's hunt have argued that it was
actually dreamed up by commercial whalers in Iceland or Norway or
Japan. But as some Makah remember it, the tribe's
fisheries-management people were down by the docks when they read
in the local newspaper that the gray whale would soon be coming off
the endangered-species list.
 &HT;    John McCarty, who at 63 is too young to have witnessed his
grandfather's last whale hunt, recalls walking up from his fishing
boat at about that time and hearing someone say: ``Hey, John! How'd
you like to go hunt a whale?'' It wasn't long before the idea
became a hit with the tribal council, and the simple idea began its
accrual of modern complications.
 &HT;    The complications began last fall, with the choosing of an
eight-man crew. In the old days, each family had its whalers, but
now the council had to jump-start the dead tradition. A whaling
commission was formed to select the crew and to draw up some
physical and spiritual guidelines _ paddling-endurance standards,
for example, and instruction in methods of personal prayer, all of
which had to be culled from old stories and archival sources,
because no living Makah had been on a whale hunt.
 &HT;    Everything had to be cleared by the tribe's Seattle-based
lawyers, and a whale-management plan was written in cooperation
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
 &HT;    The tribal whaling commission came up with a budget, hired a
staff and tried to set up its computer, such that over the winter
the sacred act of whaling became a kind of bureaucracy in itself.
Aside from being the great-grandsons and -nephews of Hishka, aside
from being connected by tradition to the spirits of the sea, the
crew would also have on-the-job insurance.
 &HT;    At the core of the crew were the first four men named. Wayne
Johnson ended up being the leader of the squad, in charge of
getting everyone together for physical and spiritual training,
though he tended to emphasize the physical. He is tall and thin; he
looks like a semiretired stuntman. At 45, he is by far the oldest
crew member _ and is likely, when the hunt comes, to follow
alongside the whaling canoe in some kind of a chase boat.
 &HT;    Darrell Markishtum, in his mid-30s, is the crew's unofficial
chaplain, its spiritual center. He works for the tribal fisheries
office but in his spare time collects traditional Makah stories.
 &HT;    Donnie Swan, in his early 20s, is a fisherman and hunter who
rides a motorcycle and wears Oakley sunglasses and camouflage. ``My
oldest daughter's always saying, `My daddy's gonna catch the
whale!''' Donnie says.
 &HT;    Micah McCarty, 27, is the crew's bohemian, a kind of Save the
Whales whaler who sees environmentalism and whaling as compatible
if conducted on ancient Native American terms. He generally wears
black jeans, a black shirt, black hiking boots and a black beret;
he ties back his long, dark brown hair in a ponytail.
 &HT;    He carves traditional masks and totems from cedar and exhibits
his work in galleries in Seattle and Victoria. He is smart and
sharp-tongued. ``Our sacred tradition is all wrapped up in red
tape,'' he often says.
 &HT;    Micah lives amid carving tools and paperbacks in an old military
barracks, a few dozen yards from the ancient Makah whaling village.
``I grew up as a minority kid and I knew I was the descendant of
these people who were like kings, and I was like, Why? To me, I'm
living the last will and testament of my ancestors, as opposed to
dying on the job in some industrial reality.''
 &HT;    The members of the Makah Whaling Commission had envisioned a
kind of colonial Williamsburg-style hunt, one that would resemble
the hunt of their ancestors, with at least one exception: In
addition to the harpoon, the Makah crew would take along a gun.
 &HT;    That gun is a .50-caliber rifle with an infrared sight. It's
light green-gray and heavy and looks to the untrained eye like a
bazooka. It was modified with the help of a ballistics expert (who
is also a veterinarian) to quickly kill a gray whale without
knocking the hunter out of the canoe.
 &HT;    The people protesting the hunt have called the Makah's rifle
inhumane. ``There isn't a trace of `ceremonial whaling' in this
plan,'' Sea Shepherd has written. ``It's blatant, undeniable whale
warfare!''
 &HT;    But to the crew, the rifle is a safety precaution, and they
don't see why a modern traditional whale hunter shouldn't have one.
Even with a rifle, however, a whale hunt is something to be anxious
about. In the old days, there were periods of quiet and prayer and
deprivation before the hunt. Men would purify themselves by living
alone in the woods and bathing in mountain ponds and streams; they
would abstain from sex.
 &HT;    ``If they hunted a whale,'' Wayne was telling the crew early one
morning last winter, ``and the whale got away, the first thing they
would do is look around the canoe and say, `OK, who slept with
their wife?'''
 &HT;    The crew also shared some modern whale stories, such as the one
about the Russian whalers who were tossed from their canoe and
dangled in the freezing water while the whale came back and studied
them as if it were pricing a cheap jewel.
 &HT;    ``When we met the Russian chief, he said that not everyone's
going to come home all the time,'' Wayne said. ``The gray whale, if
he gets mad, he'll attack you.''
 &HT;    They all nodded their heads and were quiet for a while, and then
they compared the length of a 50-foot gray whale with the length of
their canoe.
 &HT;    March was to be the month that the crew's rigorous training
started, but things didn't go as planned. The month began all
right, and the crew flew to Alaska. But the whalers returned to
discover that the protesters were gaining strength and that their
own momentum had stalled.
 &HT;    The men were reduced to sitting around _ this was the week,
coincidentally, that ``Moby-Dick'' was playing on cable TV. They
went out in the canoe a few times, and trained a little on their
own. But for the most part, they were frustrated; they weren't
getting out in the canoe enough.
 &HT;    By the end of June, training was back on track. Wayne had the
crew out paddling after work almost every night. The carving of a
traditional 36-foot whaling canoe was almost done.
 &HT;    Keith Johnson, the president of the Makah's whaling commission,
announced that, barring any legal challenges, the hunt would go on
sometime in October _ which is when the whales arrive and also the
time when the ocean normally begins to turn dangerously rough.
 &HT;    Yet Johnson was trying to keep expectations down. ``We're going
to learn a lot,'' he said. ``There are a lot of unknowns. We could
have a great, great hunt and not get a whale.''
 &HT;    Although momentum had been recaptured, the tone of the hunt had
somehow changed. The crew seemed more interested in using modern
technology to get the first whale and traditional methods later,
after it had established _ to protesters, to the world _ the
tribe's ancient right to whale hunt.
 &HT;    No one seemed to lament this more than Micah. He was still
planning to go on the hunt, though it wasn't clear who would throw
the harpoon. ``Whoever throws that harpoon is going to go down in
history,'' Wayne said.
 &HT;    For his part, Micah said he would give up his place in the canoe
only if he felt the hunt was somehow sacrilegious, if it was not
respectful of the whale. He continued training, not for the sake of
body-fat reduction but to make himself worthy of a sort of
nobility, an apostolic succession.
 &HT;    ``There's an old saying that the whale chooses the whaler,''
Micah said, ``and I want to be honorable enough to be chosen by the
whale.''

   JOURNAL-CHERNOBYL _ DRUZNY, Belarus _ Fear continues to haunt
these Chernobyl survivors, who fled their contaminated town
following the world's worst nuclear accident 12 years ago. About
1,000 men, women and children of Chernobyl were relocated to
Druzny, a grim Belarussian town built amid a swamp. Here, living in
dilapidated apartment blocs, they have largely been forgotten by
the authorities, left to struggle with the legacy of the accident.
The children of Chernobyl are growing up -- sick, unable to find
jobs, scared to bear their own children, and short of necessary
medicines. And the cruelest irony of all: For years following
Chernobyl, the government of Belarus planned to build a new nuclear
power plant beside them in their new town of Druzny. Finally, two

`DR. COSMO' PRESCRIBES NEW MEANING FOR REGGAE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cosmo Fraser can get the same fire in his eyes
talking about the way kidney failure can negatively affect the
brain as he can discussing the merits of the current crop of reggae
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Which may seem strange until you understand that Dr. Cosmo
Fraser, chief of geriatric nephrology at the Veterans
Administration Hospital in San Francisco, has just released his
second reggae album. And he maintains his double life so well that
many of those he works with are not aware of his non-medical
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they do find out, they get a funny look on their face to
see if I am serious, but then they love it,'' Fraser says. ``And I
love it when I play a concert and look into the audience and there
are all these doctors and scientists swaying to the beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser is sitting in his cramped office in one of the maze of
buildings on the sprawling hospital campus. Among the piles of
paper on his desk are some of the scads of articles he has had
published in medical journals, including the classic ``Fatal
Central Diabetes Mellitus and Insipidus Resulting from Untreated
Hyponatremia: A New Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll talk your ear off about kidneys if you're interested, but
for the moment, it's music that's on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think reggae used to be more creative than it is today,'' he
says contemplatively. ``Nowadays, the emphasis is so much on the
beat, getting the strong beat, that many of the other elements have
become secondary _ things like the melody, or the message. I
strongly believe that of all music, reggae should have some kind of
message, whether about love or social activism _ something that
speaks to people beyond the hypnotic beat.''
</P>
<P>
   That commitment comes through on Fraser's new record, ``Fire
This Time,'' released on Ginger Girl Records and distributed by
Ruff Stuff Records. He records under the name Cosmo, and his songs
are loaded with tales of love and justice and struggle. Make no
mistake about it, Fraser has some reggae heavyweights on the
record, musicians who have recorded with Bob Marley and Toots and
the Maytals. They provide a solid, melodic background to Fraser's
smooth, firm vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a doctor who plays music,'' Fraser says easily. ``This
isn't just some little hobby with me. This is a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, in his early 40s, came to the United States from Jamaica
with his family when he was 19. He always sang, winning contests on
the island as well as in his adopted homeland. Growing up, music
was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jamaica, when you are riding your bike, there is a
different song coming out of every house,'' he says. ``There is
music in the birds chirping, in almost every sound. It was a great
place if you were interested in music _ the love of music was
encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, so was the love of learning. Fraser studied computer
science and electrical engineering before becoming interested in
medicine. Whatever he does, he does full force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I am on stage that the audience has no idea about
my second career,'' he says. ``And that's how it should be. Music
feeds the creative part of my soul, it helps make me a more
complete person.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser is serious enough about his music that he is kicking
around the idea of taking some time off from his medical work to
devote to his reggae career. He talks about the possibility of
hooking up with a major tour soon, although nothing is set and he
is hesitant to jinx things by talking too much about what might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have accomplished quite a lot in the medical field,'' he
says simply _ and modestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel most strongly about my music,'' he smiles,
putting a large hand over his heart. ``It is what calls to me right
now, what gives me the most satisfaction. I'd like to find out
where it might take me.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    HOLETOWN, Barbados _ Cuba's President Fidel Castro was here
recently as part of his courtship swing through the Caribbean.
Apart from a few grumbling letters to the editor in the local
paper, he was warmly welcomed.
 &HT;    Prime Minister Owen Arthus even compared Cuba's regional role
with China's global role, much too important a market to try to
isolate and therefore well worth cultivating.
 &HT;    A decade ago this reaction was scarcely imaginable. Barbados was
one of the Caribbean countries that applauded the U.S. invasion of
Grenade, not because of President Ronald Reagan's flimsy pretext of
protecting American students but because of real fears of Cuban
attempts to export revolution backed by military force.
 &HT;    Like most of the island states in the region, Barbados was
defenseless. A few hundred Cuban troops could have easily
overwhelmed it, so the clear warning of American landings in
Grenada _ that the U.S. wouldn't allow such Cuban expansion _ came
as a relief to people here.
 &HT;    Castro has not made such dramatic changes in domestic policy as
the late Deng Hsiao-Ping and his successor did in China. He is
still a determined communist revolutionary. But nobody is afraid of
Cuba any more. Even the Pentagon has ruled that Cuba no longer
poses any kind of threat.
 &HT;    This is because of the collapse of the Soviet Union, not only as
the military and economic guarantor of Castro's regime, but also as
an ideological model, now a complete failure. There are still some
Marxists around the region, but there is no chance of their coming
to power.
 &HT;    So Castro's effort to end his country's isolation and become a
full member of the economic, political and cultural neighborhood is
receiving an eager response. The Caribbean comprises mostly very
small countries, proudly independent but quite aware of the need to
combine their negotiating strength if they are to have any weight
in the world.
 &HT;    There is already strong support for getting Cuba accepted as a
member of the Lome agreement, which provides preferential tariffs
in the European Union for what are called ACP countries. These are
former European colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific
whose trade patterns would have been devastated by independence
without some special treatment. Cuba has not been a colony in this
century, but it seems natural for it to have equal status and full
regional ties.
 &HT;    The problem, of course, is the United States and its rigid
anti-Castro policy which it attempts to impose on third countries.
Nobody, outside of some but not all Cuban exiles headquartered in
Miami and die-hards in Washington, sees any point to the continued
embargo on Cuba.
 &HT;    After nearly 40 years, the aim of provoking Castro's downfall
has obviously failed. It has only inflicted serious hardship on the
Cuban people and prevented any Cuban contribution to regional
development.
 &HT;    Now the American policy brings resentment and ridicule from the
rest of the area. It is widely understood that the policy has
become almost entirely a matter of domestic politics, fear of the
rabidly anti-Castro Cuban lobby particularly in the electorally
influential states of Florida and New Jersey.
 &HT;    It is easy to compare it sarcastically to the U.S. policy for
``constructive engagement'' with huge communist China, and to
suggest that America's inconsistency is the disdain of a big power
for a such smaller one.
 &HT;    There is no longer much question about whether Castro, just
turned 72, will disappear fairly soon and, most observers believe,
his regime with him. The question is when and how.
 &HT;    In a normal course of events, internal evolutionary pressures
would produce some kind of ``velvet revolution'' as happened in
Eastern Europe, and the successor regime would be drawn from
critical groups inside Cuba. This kind of peaceful, home-grown
transition would clearly be in the best interests of the Cubans and
of the United States as well.
 &HT;    But there are grounds to suspect this is just what the exile
lobby does not want, since it would almost surely preclude their
return to power on the island. A change involving violence, drawing
in the United States possibly with military support, would better
suit their ambitions.
 &HT;    That is all the more reason why the United States should change
its policy now, cancel the embargo and encourage contacts with the
Cuban population. That would have a lot more influence in helping
Cuba find its way to democracy and regional integration.
 &HT;    Further, there is considerable evidence that the U.S. electorate
including quite a lot of the Cuban immigrants would greet the
change with relief, as Americans did when President Nixon finally
reopened exchanges with communist China. The Cuban lobby still has
a lot of bark, but not much political bite left.
 &HT;    Then why doesn't Washington do it? Two reasons. One is inertia,
the awful time lag it takes for political myth to catch up with
reality. The other can be called Monica Lewinsky, a beleaguered
president feeling unable to take a bold initiative. But the sooner
the policy is changed, the better.

   BLIND-GARDENER (Shelter Island, N.Y.) _ Gardening has few
heroes, but William Price, 84, is surely one of them. Blind for
more than 50 years, he does all his gardening by himself, once
someone else turns the soil with a rototiller in the spring.
``Nobody else has set foot in this garden to work in it except
me,'' Price said fiercely, standing in his 45 by 50 foot plot,
which is filled with vegetables and flowers. By Mac Griswold.

   MAINE-SUMMER (Undated) _ Vacationers with a puritanical streak
are drawn to Maine, where stark blue skies and towering evergreens
meet jagged gray rocks and the endless high-low seething of ocean
tides. Here, even leisure activities have an edge, whether it's
knuckling down to sail in a stiff wind or charging up graveled
hills on a bike. Writers like E.B. White and Robert McCloskey have
found Maine rich in material for moral tales of innocence unsettled
by nature's unpredictability. Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart can

simplicity. By Julie Iovine.

   BARD-ARTS-CENTER (Annandale on Hudson, N.Y.) _ Bard College, a

music, drama and dance. Designed by Frank O. Gehry, an architect
who is basking in the triumph of his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain, the $28-million Bard Performing Arts Center would have some
of the same sweeping, fluttering silvery roofs, some of the same
draftsmen-defying curves as its Spanish sister-under-the-skin _ and
some crinkles thrown in. There is only one problem. A lot of people

   UPS-DESIGN (Undated) _ Recently, Michael Beirut, a graphic
designer and partner at Pentagram, a firm known for nurturing the

corporate identity of the United Parcel Service. His first instinct
was to introduce a little drama into the life of this nearly
century-old shipping company by changing the color of its trucks.
Maybe UPS trucks could be a lot of different colors, he suggested,
like M&AMP;M candies, with some of the trucks remaining the familiar
deep, chocolate brown. By Karrie Jacobs.

   NANTUCKET-DUMP (Undated) _ Nantucket Island, off the coast of
Massachusetts, harbor to generations of 19th-century whaling
captains and haven to 20th-century summer residents, rich with

shingled cottages weathered the gray of a widow's hair, has a local

   WHOLE ROASTED GARLIC WITH ASADERO OR BRIE CHEESE AND
TOMATILLO-CILANTRO SALSA
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   4 whole bulbs garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   For the tomatillo-cilantro salsa:
</P>
<P>
   1/3 pound tomatillos, husks removed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 small white onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh serrano chile, stemmed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley, stemmed
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces asadero or brie cheese, cut into 4 equal pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf French bread
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare garlic bulbs for roasting, remove excess papery skin
but leave bulbs whole. Cut off top 1/2 inch of each bulb, exposing
tops of individual cloves. If some clove tops remain uncut, take a
little slice off each with a paring knife to expose the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Place garlic bulbs, cut sides up, in a deep-sided casserole or
loaf pan and add water to reach halfway up sides of bulbs. Drizzle
olive oil evenly over tops of bulbs. Cover tightly with aluminum
foil and place in oven. Bake until cloves feel soft, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare salsa. Place tomatillos, onion, garlic, chile
and water in a blender or food processor fitted with the metal
blade. Add cilantro or parsley and whirl until smooth. If preparing
salsa ahead of time, do not add cilantro or parsley until just
before serving, because it will lose its flavor and bright green
color. Makes about 3/4 cup salsa.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, preheat broiler. Place 1 piece of cheese on each of 4
flameproof serving plates. Run plates under broiler until cheese
just begins to melt, 3 to 5 minutes. Be careful not to allow cheese
to melt into a puddle. Place a garlic bulb next to cheese and flood
plate with salsa. Accompany with French bread. Give each diner an
oyster fork to lift garlic cloves whole from their skins for
spreading onto bread.

HEMLINES COMING DOWN FOR THE FALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Thursday, Aug. 20) 
(Eds.: Photo available on NYT photo service) 
 
By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall marks a defining moment in the century's fashion
history, as women make the shift from short to long hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   While some will cry foul, that they will not be the pawns of
fashion designers, longer hemlines are merely a trend whose time
has come _ again.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1986 when the miniskirt burst on the fashion scene for
the second time, following its first blush of success in the '60s
and '70s. It took awhile for women to warm up to the mini again,
but it was not long before all hemlines adjusted upward. Now they
are headed south again.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors make this fall's longer skirts feel right.
First, women have embraced the long, body-skimming slip and tank
dresses for several seasons. This summer, they have become almost a
uniform, especially in the superheated Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Women like the ease and comfort of the long dresses that swish
around their legs, allowing them to wear knee-highs or no stockings
and still show their ankles to best advantage. They'll want more of
these styles come fall.
</P>
<P>
   Second, women admire the costumes from the romantic movie
``Titanic,'' as well as the clothing they see cinema stars wearing
for the Academy Awards ceremony and in magazine style stories.
Female movie stars have supplanted supermodels as style heroines.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason longer skirts may be slated for success this fall
is because of accompanying trends _ sweaters, thick wools and
tweeds, fur trims and luxury goods and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these trends looks better _ looks ``right'' _ when worn
with a long skirt, whether just below the knee, at midcalf or at
the ankle. Most designers agree that it is difficult to make a
miniskirt look luxurious _ or elicit women's investment clothing
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The final, perhaps overwhelming reason women may embrace longer
hemlines is that the key piece of clothing for fall _ the
``uniform,'' if you wish _ is the long, black, A-line skirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a fluid fabric, usually slit up one side, this skirt can tie
together many pieces already in most closets _ sweaters, jackets,
white or colored cotton or silk shirts _ and it allows women a
transition from their comfy summer dresses. And this long skirt
looks as good with boots as it does with flat shoes or high heels.
</P>
<P>
   But long is not confined to skirts. This fall's styles seem to
revolve around longer jackets. Even if they're of normal length,
the waists are nipped in a bit so the jacket appears longer.
</P>
<P>
   Other manifestations of long include longer sleeves on sweaters
and jackets, some that run on past the fingertips and demand to be
pushed up the arm. Sweaters and knit tops extend to tunic length,
offering women the benefit of a long, lean look. And overcoats are
seven-eighths length for casual wear or swashbuckler long and full
for dress.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to thinking long, women always turn their
attention to their hemlines. Chances are that most will find that
the longer suits and dresses in stores this fall look more ladylike
and feminine. Simply put, they go hand in hand with today's more
serious outlook.
</P>
<P>
   A good gray suit with a slim skirt that falls below the knee is
an investment in career dressing. A good black wool dress that
falls straight to midcalf with only a tiny slit at the back hem is
another long-term choice.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a long knit or jersey dress with long sleeves that could be
worn day or evening. With flats or short boots and a leather bag,
it goes to work, lunch, shopping or carpooling. With pearls or
glittering accessories and strappy sandals, it goes out after dark.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual aspect of several New York designer collections was
the longer, elliptically shaped skirt. Slim at the hips, it flares
out to a sort of squashed balloon shape over the knees, then rounds
back in at midcalf or at the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Sound strange? It also looked otherworldly and made walking
difficult for the models. Chances are that few of these will show
up on store racks for fall.
</P>
<P>
   One trend for winter that could cause women angst is that of
wearing coats shorter than skirts. Most New York runways featured
coats slightly below the knee over dresses that fell to midcalf or
near the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   This trend makes for a ``poor'' look, as in ``she's so poor, she
can't afford a new coat to cover her dress.'' Nevertheless, we are
destined to see it, because it has already been adopted by those
who dote on Prada, Gucci and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana styles.
</P>
<P>
   A few aberrations aside, this fall's new lengths will probably
be popular with most women who seem ready for a change in fashion.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP RAPS CALIFORNIA OVER PESTICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DIANA WALSH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 4 million Californians live within a
half-mile of places where large volumes of potentially toxic
pesticides have been used, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   In a report titled ``Poisoning the Air,'' the California Public
Interest Research Group also says 1 million of the state's
residents live next to areas where cancer-causing pesticides are
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often think about pesticides on their food or maybe in
their water, but this report shows that a good portion of our
population may be breathing airborne poisons and this problem must
be addressed now,'' said Zev Ross, a California Public Interest
Research Group toxic policy advocate and author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Pesticides used in one area are often found to have migrated
several hundred feet and sometimes hundreds of miles away,
according to the environmental organization. California accounts
for approximately 25 percent of all pesticides used in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Interest Research Group used the report to
blast the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the state agency that
regulates the use of dangerous pesticides. The group claims the
agency has done little to implement a 15-year-old law designed to
regulate pesticides in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the potential increased risk of both short-term and
long-term illness posed by airborne pesticides, the state agency
charged with regulating these chemicals ... has virtually ignored
legislation to protect Californians from pesticides in the air,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Veda Federighi, a representative of the agency, denounced the
report's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is a presence of something doesn't mean you are
at risk from it ... I'm sure there are 4 million Californians who
live within a half-mile from a freeway. Does that mean they are at
risk from auto exhaust?'' Federighi said. ``They are making a lot
of unsupportable conclusions. It's certainly not science.''
</P>
<P>
   By focusing strictly on how the agency implemented the Toxic Air
Contaminants Program, which was enacted in 1983, the report
completely ignored all of the agency's other monitoring programs,
most of which bring about quicker crackdowns on potentially
dangerous and carcinogenic pesticides, Federighi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking a very narrow look at things and are ignoring
everything else we do,'' said Federighi, rattling off a list of
several pesticides that have undergone testing and then were
subjected to restrictions. ``They're saying we didn't do it the way
they wanted us to do it so it's wrong, and we're saying we did the
best and fastest assessment.''

SOUTHWESTERN CRAB CAKES FROM DEAN FEARING'S FILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anna Capriotti of Arlington, Texas, would like the recipe for
crab cakes served at The Mansion on Turtle Creek. Here's Dean
Fearing recipe from ``Southwest Cuisine'' (Grove Weidenfeld, $30).
</P>
<P>
   PAN-FRIED CRAB CAKES
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1 extra-large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon celery salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 drops Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound fresh jumbo lump crab meat, picked clean of shell and
cartilage
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup corn oil
</P>
<P>
   In mixing bowl, combine egg, mayonnaise and seasoning. Add crab
and enough bread crumbs to absorb excess moisture. Toss to blend
well, but don't overmix. Mixture should be just firm enough to hold
together. Adjust seasonings as desired. Form into 12 patties and
place on waxed paper in cold place for 20 minutes to dry slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Pour oil into skillet to depth of 1/2 inch. Place over high heat
and heat to 350 degrees. When temperature is right, gently add crab
cakes and fry for about 3 minutes per side or until golden brown on
both sides. Don't crowd pan; fry in several batches if necessary.
Drain on paper towel and serve immediately.

IT'S `PAST TIME' IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You call that an apology? You call that closure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mea culpa,'' my eye.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to President Clinton to insist on having it both ways:
to claim that he is taking ``complete responsibility'' for his
actions and in the next breath to blame somebody else for the mess
he's in.
</P>
<P>
   That's Slick Willie for you. He smoked marijuana but didn't
inhale. He caused pain in his marriage but didn't have an affair.
And now he admits that he ``misled'' people but can't bring himself
to say that he lied.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was on television for just over four minutes Monday
night, delivering a speech that had been touted as his ``mea
culpa'' for having an affair with Monica Lewinsky and trying to
cover it up. He spent much of the time complaining about
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   If this was an apology, it was an odd one. The words ``I'm
sorry'' never crossed Clinton's lips.
</P>
<P>
   If the president's speech was a confession of previous lies and
illicit sex, it was odder still. He acknowledged only that his
relationship with Lewinsky was ``not appropriate.'' His earlier
statements and nonstatements, he said, ``gave a false impression.''
</P>
<P>
   A false impression?
</P>
<P>
   A false impression is conveyed by ``Honey, I got in a little
late last night'' when in fact you got home two minutes before the
alarm went off this morning. You give a false impression when you
say, ``I had a rough day at work,'' when in fact you had a bad
morning but you spent the afternoon playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton looked us in the eye and said, ``I did not have
sexual relations with that woman,'' he was doing a lot more than
giving a false impression. He was lying through his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most of us knew he was lying, which means that this
half-baked confession he tried to palm off the other night was no
big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most naive and hopelessly devoted Clintonite could have
believed him when he denied the affair with Lewinsky. Sure, plenty
of Americans ``hoped'' he was telling the truth, but just about
every public-opinion poll indicated that most people were aware
that he was lying.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also indicated that most people didn't care. Even as
Clinton's ratings for honesty and integrity revealed that his
constituents didn't trust him as far as they could throw him, his
job approval marks zipped along in the 60-plus range. As Clinton
sat down to testify before Starr's grand jury on Monday, one poll
gave him a job approval score of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton testified and offered up his so-called apology, a
``USA Today''/CNN/Gallup poll suggested that the number of
Americans who held a favorable opinion of him plunged 20 points to
40 percent. But his job approval rating stayed high: 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the deal: Most citizens of the world's lone remaining
superpower know that our nation's commander in chief is a
dishonest, untrustworthy creep _ but they don't care because he's
doing a good job as president.
</P>
<P>
   Makes you proud to be an American, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are saying that we'll have to wait a few days or
weeks before we draw any conclusions about the impact _ or
nonimpact _ of Clinton's grand jury testimony and post-testimony
remarks. But early polls say that most Americans have had it up to
here with Starr's investigation and with the media's inexhaustible
fixation on Clinton's sexual proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   They want the ordeal to end.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't they? It isn't news to most Americans that
Clinton is a compulsive philanderer and a pathological liar. His
reputation along these lines was well-established and
well-publicized long before he lapsed into inappropriateness with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr has proof that Clinton broke the law, he needs to hand
it over to Congress as soon as possible so that the House of
Representatives can decide whether the president ought to be
impeached. Clinton's ``mea culpa'' may have been a flop, but one
line rang true:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is time _ in fact, it is past time _ to move on.''
</P>

<P>
   It's like making a deal with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is no better product placement than having an
``it'' starlet wearing a designer's drop-dead gown. On the other,
what happens when celebrities are caught in compromising positions
while wearing designer labels with which they have no commercial
association?
</P>
<P>
   Slap a logo on anything and find out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, paying Demi and Bruce to star in an ad campaign is
one thing, but who'd have thought Monica Lewinsky would become an
unwitting Donna Karan spokesmodel when she wore a DKNY beret to a
November 1996 photo op with the president?
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant shilling for Tommy Hilfiger? In 1995, the actor
donned a Hilfiger cap for the most unglamorous of occasions _ his
arrest for soliciting a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Coco have thought if she knew socialite Jocelyne
Wildenstein _ whose history of cosmetic surgery borders on the
bizarre _ was the sort of person who would create international
headlines as she battled her ex-husband for custody of, among other
things, a $350,000 Chanel couture dress?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the world's most notorious unpaid product pitchman
these days is O.J. Simpson, the man who sent sales of white Ford
Broncos soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handedly, Simpson pumped up sales of Aris Isotoner gloves
and established Bruno Magli's brand name in the United States by
denying he wore the company's shoes and calling them ``ugly-ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, unsolicited, has now taken to wearing a Nike cap to
public appearances. Most notably, he was televised wearing the hat
as he discussed an appeal of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment
against him in the deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Is Nike grateful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't react in any way,'' said Robert Mitchell, Nike senior
manager of corporate communications. ``The main thing here is that
we did not place that product with him. He just went out and bought
it like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's reaction _ distant, indifferent, but not damning _
illustrates how companies view these random product appearances.
Whether they can really damage brand equity is a tricky issue, even
if the consequences are only comical.
</P>
<P>
   There is one school of public relations that maintains ``any
press is good press.'' Even if the product is associated visually
with an infamous person, the thinking goes, its image is still
subliminally ingrained in the consumer consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, image can be everything. Since there are more
and more media covering more famous and more notorious faces, the
number of random associations of designer labels linked to news
images is proportionately on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   While many are absurd and probably have negligible impact on the
label, there are much more serious cases when a product repeatedly
is linked to a negative news story or figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect varies according to the brand and the brand's
personality,'' said Erik Gordon, director of the Center for
Retailing Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
``Some brands are so tiny that anywhere they are noticed can have a
deep impact,'' he said. ``But for a more established brand, it's
not so simple because the power of a brand extends from so many
things, especially the effects of association.''
</P>
<P>
   Being linked to the wrong person can be a serious problem for a
brand, he said. And while brand managers can pay to have their
products placed in movies, on television or on celebrities,
``there's no way you can pay to keep the wrong people from wearing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands are pretty fragile,'' Gordon said. ``The way to tank a
brand like Diesel would be to have Bill Clinton or David Brinkley
wear it, because that kills the effectiveness of the image that the
brand is young and hip. It doesn't have to be someone like Mike
Tyson or the obvious shock of seeing a mass murderer wearing your
sweatshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan got a shock in January when Time magazine ran an
up-close image of Monica Lewinsky wearing a DKNY beret in the
well-worn video clip in which she's embraced by President Clinton.
The hat turned out to be part of a 1992 collection; it sold for
$38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmed is the word,'' said Patti Cohen, senior vice
president of public relations, describing her reaction to the
ensuing media requests for information about the hat. ``I got a fax
from the Washington Post asking all these questions about a hat on
the cover of Time,'' she said. ``I couldn't quite get why such a
serious publication would be asking such questions about a hat. I
thought it was an April Fool's Day joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Fisher, senior vice president of global communication
at Tommy Hilfiger, said companies naturally want to see their
products shown in the best possible light. But, she said, when
products appear in a negative situation, consumers are smart enough
to realize these images are not a reflection on the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's label is geared to images of diversity,
multiculturalism and a broad range of ages, which in some ways
buffers the company from the side effects of unexpected
associations. Whether the label appears on a rhythm and blues
singer like Aaliyah or on President Clinton, who was photographed
in China last month wearing a polo shirt with a Hilfiger crest,
Hilfiger sees these as positive images.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hugh Grant situation, Fisher said, ``I don't think
customers would in any way associate Tommy with, uh, the deed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems an obvious conclusion that in an age when
cultural media often is driven by paid product placements, when
sharp-eyed moviegoers and television watchers have become
accustomed to stop-frame images of Kodak cameras and Calvin
Klein-wardrobed sets, consumers notice when these products appear
in other, unexpected places.

<P>
   It's like making a deal with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is no better product placement than having an
``it'' starlet wearing a designer's drop-dead gown. On the other,
what happens when celebrities are caught in compromising positions
while wearing designer labels with which they have no commercial
association?
</P>
<P>
   Slap a logo on anything and find out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, paying Demi and Bruce to star in an ad campaign is
one thing, but who'd have thought Monica Lewinsky would become an
unwitting Donna Karan spokesmodel when she wore a DKNY beret to a
November 1996 photo op with the president?
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant shilling for Tommy Hilfiger? In 1995, the actor
donned a Hilfiger cap for the most unglamorous of occasions _ his
arrest for soliciting a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Coco have thought if she knew socialite Jocelyne
Wildenstein _ whose history of cosmetic surgery borders on the
bizarre _ was the sort of person who would create international
headlines as she battled her ex-husband for custody of, among other
things, a $350,000 Chanel couture dress?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the world's most notorious unpaid product pitchman
these days is O.J. Simpson, the man who sent sales of white Ford
Broncos soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handedly, Simpson pumped up sales of Aris Isotoner gloves
and established Bruno Magli's brand name in the United States by
denying he wore the company's shoes and calling them ``ugly-ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, unsolicited, has now taken to wearing a Nike cap to
public appearances. Most notably, he was televised wearing the hat
as he discussed an appeal of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment
against him in the deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Is Nike grateful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't react in any way,'' said Robert Mitchell, Nike senior
manager of corporate communications. ``The main thing here is that
we did not place that product with him. He just went out and bought
it like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's reaction _ distant, indifferent, but not damning _
illustrates how companies view these random product appearances.
Whether they can really damage brand equity is a tricky issue, even
if the consequences are only comical.
</P>
<P>
   There is one school of public relations that maintains ``any
press is good press.'' Even if the product is associated visually
with an infamous person, the thinking goes, its image is still
subliminally ingrained in the consumer consciousness.
</P>
<P>

   CARROLL-CENTENARY (London) _ This year, with the centenary of
the death of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who wrote under the name
Lewis Carroll, being celebrated here with exhibitions, conferences,
walking tours, ballets, musicals, television documentaries and new
publications, the personality and obsessions of the man behind the
pseudonym are again being put to scrutiny. But now, viewed through
contemporary eyes, his image is no longer unblemished. At the very
least, his fascination for little girls is today considered
dubious. By Alan Riding.

   BLIND-GARDENER (Shelter Island, N.Y.) _ Gardening has few
heroes, but William Price, 84, is surely one of them. Blind for
more than 50 years, he does all his gardening by himself, once
someone else turns the soil with a rototiller in the spring.
``Nobody else has set foot in this garden to work in it except
me,'' Price said fiercely, standing in his 45 by 50 foot plot,

<P>
   MAINE-SUMMER (Undated) _ Vacationers with a puritanical streak
are drawn to Maine, where stark blue skies and towering evergreens
meet jagged gray rocks and the endless high-low seething of ocean
tides. Here, even leisure activities have an edge, whether it's
knuckling down to sail in a stiff wind or charging up graveled
hills on a bike. Writers like E.B. White and Robert McCloskey have
found Maine rich in material for moral tales of innocence unsettled
by nature's unpredictability. Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart can
only dream of bottling this essence of virtuous American
simplicity. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   BARD-ARTS-CENTER (Annandale on Hudson, N.Y.) _ Bard College, a
small liberal arts college on 550 acres here, wants to build a
knock-your-socks-off building, a sculptural shell to show off
music, drama and dance. Designed by Frank O. Gehry, an architect
who is basking in the triumph of his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
Spain, the $28-million Bard Performing Arts Center would have some
of the same sweeping, fluttering silvery roofs, some of the same
draftsmen-defying curves as its Spanish sister-under-the-skin _ and
some crinkles thrown in. There is only one problem. A lot of people
think it's in the wrong spot. By Tracie Rozhon.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   UPS-DESIGN (Undated) _ Recently, Michael Beirut, a graphic
designer and partner at Pentagram, a firm known for nurturing the
eclectic visions of its partners, has been busy examining the
corporate identity of the United Parcel Service. His first instinct
was to introduce a little drama into the life of this nearly
century-old shipping company by changing the color of its trucks.
Maybe UPS trucks could be a lot of different colors, he suggested,
like M&AMP;M candies, with some of the trucks remaining the familiar
deep, chocolate brown. By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   NANTUCKET-DUMP (Undated) _ Nantucket Island, off the coast of
Massachusetts, harbor to generations of 19th-century whaling
captains and haven to 20th-century summer residents, rich with
stretches of unspoiled beach and rotten with wooden sailboats and
shingled cottages weathered the gray of a widow's hair, has a local

city's namesake, Odessa, Ukraine. It is a journey the group has
planned for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gang has been messing with this idea for a long time,
about 10 years,'' said Jerry Hensley, a trip coordinator. ``It is
fairly complicated. This year we decided to do it, and we contacted
our U.S. representative, Larry Combest. He sent a letter to the
State Department and got their approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley said the two Odessas have exchanged about 700 e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an advance trip,'' he said. ``But it is so far away,
and there is the language barrier _ but I believe we've about got
it now. We've got all our tickets and all our visas. If we don't go
now, we've wasted a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Odessa Chuck Wagon Gang was formed in 1940 to help promote
Odessa and West Texas. The group patterned itself after the old
chuck wagon cooks of early cattle drives. They cook their beef over
open pits, with a pot of beans on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Chuck Wagon Gang has served meals throughout the United
States. It served more than 40,000 plates at the Grand Ole Opry;
and 30,000 at Klondike Days in Edmonton, Canada. The group has
traveled to Scotland, Norway, Costa Rica and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever they go, the menu is always the same: Texas barbecue,
pinto beans, pickles, onions, coleslaw, iced tea, bread and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine, however, there won't be any iced tea. That is a
strange notion to the Odessans, Hensley said. ``I think we'll be
serving Coke,'' he said. ``If not, lemonade.''
</P>
<P>
   The group will cook ``West Texas barbecue beef,'' Hensley said.
``We'll have coleslaw, pinto beans, pickles and onions.'' The beef,
however, will not be from Texas. A local slaughterhouse will
provide the inside round the Gang uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did ship over a bunch of foil pans to use as serving
pans,'' he said. ``We also shipped some napkin packs, containing
napkins, toothpicks, plastic utensils, salt, pepper and sugar.
Everything else, we're buying over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Special grills have been built in Ukraine to handle the
barbecue. There is also a specially built, 200-gallon bean pot.
</P>
<P>
   The Gang plans to feed about 1,200 Odessans, including 500
businessmen, 100 expatriates, 100 members of the Odessa
Philharmonic Orchestra, and about 500 orphans and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the advance trip, we saw that the orphanage was very, very
poor,'' Hensley said. ``We decided helping them would be a part of
this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are a common need for the children at the orphanage. Chuck
Wagon Gang members at first thought of taking several hundred pairs
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out that we could buy good quality shoes there,
cheaper than we could take them with us,'' Hensley said. ``We can
buy good shoes for $8 or $9 a pair. We're hoping to buy about 300
pairs. Missionaries living there are already getting the sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the advance party made an immediate gift of $400 to
the orphanage. They were later told that it was the largest single
donation the orphanage had ever received. It was used to buy a
washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Odessa, Texas, it has always been said, was named by Russian
railroad workers laying tracks for the Texas and Pacific Railway
back in the 1880s. Somehow, the motion of the tall prairie grasses
reminded the workers of their homeland. Some say this was because
the swaying grasses resembled the wave action of the Black Sea;
others say it was the vastness of West Texas that reminded the
workers of home.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Odessa, Texas, and Odessa, Ukraine, look nothing
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their city doesn't look anything like ours,'' Hensley said.
``They have a very nice town, but there are a lot of trees; it is a
seaport. It doesn't look like Odessa, Texas, at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Each member of the Chuck Wagon Gang has paid $2,400 for the
trip. An advance team will leave Sept. 5; the others will follow
Sept. 8.

Prime Minister and Socialist Party chief Bennino Craxi, have been
discreetly allowed to leave Italy.

CANDIDATES SPAR OVER CALIFORNIA'S DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ In the heart of California's Central Valley,
the second gubernatorial debate was billed as a forum on the earthy
issues of agriculture, water policy and suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren and Democratic Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis spent much of the hour Tuesday bickering over
abortion, the death penalty and whether the state should issue
education vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' most extended argument of the evening came on
the issue of the death penalty, which both support.
</P>
<P>
   Davis went on the attack first, criticizing Lungren for
``distorting'' his votes in the Assembly on death-penalty issues
during the first debate in San Diego when he accused Davis of
voting twice to subvert the state's death-penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate, Davis' staff passed out a letter from Rep.
Gary Condit, D-Calif., saying Davis supported his ``major
death-penalty legislation'' in 1985, the same vote Lungren brought
up in San Diego, and that anyone who suggests Davis is not 100
percent pro-death penalty is misleading the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is you're for the death penalty and I'm for
the death penalty,'' Davis told Lungren, ``and you're trying to
deceive people on some procedural votes, and I think we need to get
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, however, said he believed Davis and other Democrats at
the time were involved in an effort to make ``fig-leaf votes'' on
the death penalty while at the same time attempting to weaken the
law or voting against attempts to strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defended the death penalty,'' Lungren said. ``You fooled
around with the death penalty. You made fun of the death penalty.
You played games with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during a shouting match over the issue, Davis told
Lungren to ``get real.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate at California State University at Fresno was the
second in a series of five televised forums leading to the Nov. 3
election. The next debate is scheduled for Sept. 23 in Sacramento,
followed by October matchups in the San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lungren and Davis will spend tens of millions of
dollars on television commercials, the debates are an effort to run
a campaign the old-fashioned way, focusing on issues. Lungren just
finished a traditional bus tour of the Central Valley and Davis
planned a four-stop bus trip Wednesday from Fresno to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, the clearest divisions between the two
candidates emerged over the issues of abortion and some education
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, for instance, said he supports vouchers, tax dollars
given to parents to send their children to private schools. Davis
said he would support vouchers only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something fundamentally wrong when we allow the
bureaucracy to dictate what we are doing with the kids, when
obviously things are failing,'' Lungren said. ``I think vouchers
will ... be the greatest injection of competition in order to
kick-start the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the better answer would be to improve standards for
the state's 6 million public school children and hold teachers to
higher standards and peer review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe vouchers are an easy answer to a tough problem,''
Davis said. At a news conference after the debate, he said he would
consider them only after every other education reform failed.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Davis pointed to Lungren's vote, while in Congress,
for the Human Life Amendment, which would have made abortions
illegal even in the case of rape and incest. And he noted that
Lungren voted 10 times to deny federal funding for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've made it clear that you don't trust women to control
their own bodies,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, without saying whether he really wanted to deny the
victims of rape and incest the right to an abortion, countered with
a vague explanation that he simply was trying to provoke debate on
the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking, `Did I engage in debate as to whether or not
it's a great thing to have millions of abortions,' you're
absolutely right,'' Lungren said.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Lungren said he wished the focus had been more
on agriculture, water and education issues important to the Central
Valley, but blamed Davis for bringing up abortion and other wedge
issues. Davis said he wasn't troubled about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren avoided direct criticism of Davis' close political
association with President Clinton, who helped the Democratic
candidate raise more than $3 million last week during a one-day
swing through California.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis was asked about the president's admission of having
an inappropriate relationship with a former White House intern, he
said he accepted Clinton's apology and would welcome the president
in a return visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said what he did was wrong. He said it was a critical lapse
of judgment,'' Davis said. ``I accept his apology and I think it's
time to move on.''

and a care coordinator are among the key elements that managed care
plans should provide breast cancer patients, according to a
yearlong study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans and The Commonwealth
Fund, a health research foundation, asked 1,000 health plans
nationwide, serving more than 140 million people, to submit their
approaches to breast cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the submitted proposals, four companies were chosen as the
best on the following criteria: patient satisfaction; overall
effectiveness; innovation and creativity; quality, relevance and
validity of the program's internal evaluation; and the ability for
other health plans to replicate and implement the program.
</P>
<P>
   The health care providers _ Humana Health Plan of Chicago,
Keystone Mercy Health Plan of Pennsylvania, Kaiser Permanente of
California in partnership with WIN Against Breast Cancer, and Blue
Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts in partnership with the American
Psychological Association _ developed the following questions women
should ask their health care plan provider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan have an aggressive and effective system
to remind and encourage patients to receive breast cancer
screenings?
</P>
<P>
   Early detection through mammography, clinical breast exam and
self examination are critical. More than 90 percent of women whose
cancer is detected and treated in its early stages are cancer-free
after five years. Health plans must develop systems for ensuring
members know about and utilize breast cancer screening services.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan have a comprehensive tracking system to
ensure every patient's treatment progress is carefully monitored at
all times?
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer becomes increasingly serious as it progresses.
Timeliness is as important as quality when it comes to treatment.
Health plans should develop safeguards to ensure a full range of
breast cancer care is delivered quickly and thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan have an effective tracking system to
monitor physician practices?
</P>
<P>
   Managed care plans can develop systems to track individual
physician's practices. This allows doctors to compare therapies
utilized by others, and provides ways for health plans to identify
physicians whose practices fall outside established guidelines.
This also ensures practitioners use current treatments and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Are your health plan's breast care centers accredited by the
American College of Radiology and certified by the U.S. Food &AMP; Drug
Administration, and have all radiologists received advanced-level
mammography certification?
</P>
<P>
   Mammograms must be of the highest possible quality. An effective
mammogram can detect a tumor up to two years before a doctor or
patient does. But poor handling of the films and inexperienced
staff doing the readings can result in tumors being missed. The FDA
has listed certified breast care facilities for each state at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/faclist.html. ((CQ))
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan make breast care more accessible to
low-income women by conducting community-based support?
</P>
<P>
   Mammography and other breast care services should be accessible
to women living in poverty. Breast cancer affects all races, but
death rates are much higher among women of low socio-economic
status, because cancer is often detected at later stages when it is
more aggressive and deadly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan provide breast cancer patients access to
important mental health and emotional support services?
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer brings up emotional issues regarding femininity,
sexuality and body image. Health plans should offer breast cancer
patients support when dealing with the effects of the disease on
their body, mind, and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan provide patients with a ``breast care
coordinator'' to offer additional support, helping to evaluate
treatment options, monitor treatment progress and identify
additional services?
</P>
<P>
   Women with breast cancer have to make tough decisions about
complicated treatment options. Health plans should provide a
designated staff person _ such as a breast care coordinator _ to
help women decipher information, track their treatment progress and
offer general support.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan supply breast cancer patients with
important treatment information in an easy-to-understand format?
</P>
<P>
   Women rely on their health care providers to supply information
to help them make informed choices. Health plans should develop a
standard set of materials and offer it in a variety of easy-to-use
formats. Materials should be written in language and literacy
levels appropriate for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan invest in research programs to evaluate
the effectiveness of pairing alternative therapies with traditional
medical treatments?
</P>
<P>
   Health plans should explore additional methods to provide care
to breast cancer patients, including participating in supplementary
programs. Group psychotherapy programs work as effective companions
to medical therapies, and may increase survival times.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Does your health plan gauge patient satisfaction and program
effectiveness by conducting opinion surveys among patients with
breast cancer?
</P>
<P>
   Health plans need to ask women for their input. Patient
satisfaction is a key for measuring the success of a program and
will assist the plan in providing more comprehensive service to
other breast cancer patients.

<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ Passengers on the Riddler's Revenge roller
coaster squealed with exuberance and panic, from the initial
15-story plunge right through to the last of six fearsome spirals,
many at freeway speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the ride's control room, a windowless office
underneath the ride platform here at Six Flags Magic Mountain
amusement park in suburban Los Angeles, was considerably more
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   One man sat gazing into a computer screen; at his side, inside a
cabinet that stretched the length of a Cadillac, a computer
performed acrobatics of its own, with no allowance for dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   From the safety announcements played as passengers wait to get
on board to the photographs of screaming riders sold at the exit,
computers play a starring but seldom-seen role in the operations of
roller coasters. As riders are whipsawed around a track in apparent
pandemonium, computers insure that the cars whiz down the track at
the right speed, do not collide and do not hit obstacles that block
the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the ride operator with a lever and brake is
history,'' said Jim Blackie, director of maintenance at Magic
Mountain. ``It's all computer controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the Riddler's Revenge, billed as the nation's fastest
and tallest stand-up roller coaster, the job of a ride operator is
similar to that of a flight attendant: make sure the automatic
safety bars are secure and that stuffed animals are stowed away.
Starting a train is accomplished with no more sweat than ringing a
door bell.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting is left to a massive computer built by the
Allen-Bradley Co., a unit of Rockwell International. It sits in an
air-conditioned room under the station platform. Behind steel
cabinet doors, red and green lights on the computer flash as the
trains circulate around the track.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively silent, the computer is hard at work. Before
each roller coaster takes a lap around the track, the computer
checks and then double-checks with a backup program between 100 and
150 features on the ride that may affect safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can dream it, these computers can do it,'' Blackie
said. For example, the station operator cannot dispatch the roller
coaster unless sensors along the track tell the computer that the
route is clear. Called the block system, a standard feature
throughout the industry, two cars cannot enter the same zone
anywhere along the track without the computer's shutting down the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Before computers, this job was left to human operators who had
to keep a constant eye on the track and their hands on a lever that
served as a break. High technology has taken their place and has
allowed as many as five trains to circulate at one time on some
coasters, compared with only two or three trains under manual
control.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the human element from nearly all aspects of roller
coaster operations is no accident, said Walt Davis, vice president
of Togo International, a roller coaster manufacturer in Cincinnati.
Automation is more reliable than part-time amusement park workers,
who may be faced with disturbances in the station, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make the control systems as idiot-proof as
possible,'' Davis said. ``Suppose an unruly kid distracted the
operators and his friend came over and started pushing buttons. We
don't want to give them the flexibility of changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   But can technology be trusted to control such a potentially
dangerous ride as a roller coaster, particularly given the
knowledge that technology can sometimes go haywire? Davis said that
computers may indeed ``have a bad day'' but that they, unlike
humans, can be programmed to tell operators when their circuitry
gets temperamental.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on Riddler's Revenge have their first contact
with the ride's computer while waiting in line. The computer cues a
stack of compact disk players and amplifiers in the control room
when to play theme music in the station and warn passengers to, for
example, pull down their safety harnesses as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of the chute, the coaster encounters an incline that
inspires even the most fearless of riders to brace their feet
firmly on the floor and squeeze handholds. The computer tags along,
so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the hill, the computer puts the lift system on
slowly, so the train can engage without a jolt. At the summit, it
insures that the roller coaster is released at the designated
speed.
</P>
<P>
   From there, gravity takes over, as does the spinning, lurching
and screaming. Barring any problems, the train will return to the
station three minutes after it left to pick up another load of
passengers. Of course, things do not always run so smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Riddler's Revenge shut down recently,
stranding passengers on the track, technicians found the reason on
a personal computer that sits on a folding table in an unpainted
corner of the control room. Hooked to the mainframe, the computer
indicated with a coded message, deciphered with a logic diagram,
that a fuse had blown in the station.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In all, the repair took only a few minutes, Blackie said, adding
that a similar malfunction 20 years ago could have taken hours to
repair because technology at that time was unable to tell engineers
where a defective part was located.
</P>
<P>
   Though amusement park engineers rely heavily on computers for
maintenance, they do so only to a point. At most parks, workers
inspect roller coasters every day. ``We will park a train on the
tracks and run another by to see if there will be an accident,''
said Jeffrey Budgeon, managing director of planning, engineering
and maintenance at Hershey Park amusement park in Hershey, Pa. ``We
want to make sure that the computer is doing what it is supposed to
be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If a minor problem develops, the computers that control roller
coasters will merely warn technicians rather than shutting down the
ride. Some obstacles, like those caused by extreme weather, may be
easily fixed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, roller coasters run faster in hot temperatures and
more slowly in cold. On the Manhattan Express roller coaster, which
spins around the fake landmark towers at the New York, New York
casino in Las Vegas, Nev., technicians can activate a special
computer program to compensate for the harsh desert climate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the computer's remedies is to adjust the speed of each
train as it begins it descent from the top of the first incline. It
can also slow a roller coaster car in mid-lap by applying the
brakes when sensors tell the computer that the train is speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Express control system also plays the role of
meteorologist by monitoring wind gauges perched high on the ride.
If headwinds get too strong, the computer alerts technicians
because trains may have trouble returning to the station.
</P>
<P>
   Some roller coasters have the additional protection of infrared
light beams that give an alarm when there is someone or something
blocking the track. If a light beam is broken, the computer stops
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when a bird has flown through or a squirrel
has run across and shuts down the ride,'' said Dennis Speigel,
president of International Theme Park Services, an amusement park
consulting business in Cincinnati. ``But that's OK, because safety
is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been deaths on roller coasters in recent
years, they appear to be more often the result of reckless rider
behavior and safety belt failures than computer malfunctions,
according to reports by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   No one has died as a result of computer failure since 1980, when
a 13-year-old girl was killed in a collision of two trains at the
Great America amusement park in Santa Clara, Calif., according to
the agency's records.
</P>
<P>
   It is most likely that the future of roller coaster technology
will rely even more heavily on computers, Speigel said. Part of
that role, he said, will almost certainly be in operating a new
propulsion system that uses hundreds of electromagnets along the
track instead of gravity and a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Only a computer can control the system since magnets must be
powered in sequence and in microsecond bursts. The few roller
coasters that already employ this technology can accelerate cars to
60 miles an hour as fast as a Porsche, Speigel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is advancing at such a pace now that it's not the
computers that are limiting roller coasters,'' he said. ``It's the
stresses that you can put on a body. You can only take so many
G-forces and so much of your eyes bulging out.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the standard computer in the industry is the
Allen-Bradley. With stacks of disk drives and a tangle of wiring,
the system is used to control everything from ocean liners to most
major amusement park rides.
</P>
<P>
   On the Riddler's Revenge, the influence of technology reaches
all the way to the exit, where passengers can buy photographs of
themselves in mid free fall. A high-speed camera alongside the
track takes pictures each time a train swoops by and immediately
sends the digital images to a computer in the sales booth.
</P>
<P>
   Though computers have an impact on nearly every facet of the
ride, most of the passengers were focused less on what happens
behind the scenes and more on what happens when the forces of
gravity begin to act on a human body that is being inverted and
flung around curves.
</P>
<P>
   Most were like Jackey Escobar, 14, who, after holding a hand
briefly to her stomach, talked about the perils of spinning upside
down. ``I feel like everything is going to come out,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Lotus Development Corp.'s chief executive, Jeffrey
Papows, strode to the front of a Senate hearing room last month to
join a parade of executives blasting Microsoft Corp.'s business
practices, he was doing an about-face.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Papows had tried to duck the controversy over
whether the software giant uses its dominance in computer operating
systems to unfairly stifle competition in other parts of the
software market. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lotus, a Cambridge, Mass. unit of International
Business Machines Corp., has a complex relationship with Microsoft.
It is both a technology partner and a competitor. For that reason,
Papows preferred not to toss rocks at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   So why the change of heart?
</P>
<P>
   One reason, it would seem, is that Microsoft _ which a few years
back walloped Lotus in the spreadsheet market it virtually invented
and once dominated _ is again breathing down Lotus's neck in the
emerging market for messaging and groupware _ software that lets
distant employees collaborate on a single project or document.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus also pioneered that market in late 1989 with the
introduction of Lotus Notes, following it up with an Internet-based
product called Domino. Today, Notes has more than 25 million users
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft introduced a
competing product called Exchange _ and it is gaining fast, with
about 16 million copies installed in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, Exchange outsold Notes for
the first time, 3 million copies to 2.7 million, according to
figures supplied by Lotus. Although it was Lotus' third-best
quarter ever, it was a milestone that clearly has Lotus worried. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The company is reorganizing its North American sales division
and bringing in new management in hopes of holding off Microsoft's
charge. And IBM &UR;  &LR; is stepping forward to promote Notes as an
integral part of its electronic commerce business strategy,
something it didn't do initially after buying the company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is more intense,'' Papows acknowledged in a
recent interview. But he insisted that the heat was being generated
internally and was not coming from IBM, which paid $3.2 billion for
the company, largely to get its hands on Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Papows rejected the notion that his decision to testify against
Microsoft, after resisting for so long, was a desperate attempt to
place blame for his company's shrinking market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair question,'' conceded Papows, who had been pestered
to testify for months by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the
Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is
investigating allegations that the world's largest software company
engages inmonopolistic business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch finally wore him down, Papows said, with a personal
appeal. ``He said, `I've talked to a lot of people in the industry,
and not only are you not helping me protect your industry, the fact
that you are not visible on this issue is a deterrent to getting
other CEOs to testify.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was a responsibility I was shirking. Frankly, that
cut pretty deep,'' Papows said.
</P>
<P>
   Papows said that he testified reluctantly, that he was careful
to emphasize that the companies have a good relationship overall,
and that he is not among the legions of ``Bill-bashers,'' people
who love to hate Bill Gates, Microsoft's billionaire chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He told the committee he was concerned that by bundling its
Exchange messaging software, at little or no cost, with other
popular office software, Microsoft was driving prices on groupware
down to zero, effectively locking out other competitors, including
Lotus Notes.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that Microsoft was using its dominance of
operating systems, which control a computer's basic functions, to
force computer makers to pre-load Exchange onto their machines,
again locking out competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you own the bridge &UR;  &LR; and control the toll gate, pretty
soon you get to decide what kind of cars get across the bridge,''
Papows testified.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials declined to comment on Papows' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But even Papows admits that some of Lotus's problems are of its
own making.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while IBM and Lotus officials maintain that the 1995
buyout was good for both companies, they admit that they probably
goofed by not trying to leverage IBM's enormous market presence to
help Lotus fend off Microsoft Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mutual mistake by not more prominently and visibly
linking the companies strategically,'' Papows said. ``We were so
manic about maintaining Lotus as a separate brand identity, that we
didn't do a lot to run Domino and Notes as part of IBM's e-business
ads.''

   IBM officials agree. ``Perhaps if we had positioned Domino as
the crown jewel of our e-business offering sooner, it would have
blunted their success, but it probably would not have resulted in a
major forestalling of the Microsoft juggernaut, given some of their
business tactics,'' said Mark Elliot, general manager of worldwide
sales and marketing for IBM's $13 billion software business.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales of Lotus Notes are still growing dramatically,
the inroads that Microsoft Exchange has made, especially in North
America, are worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources say US sales last quarter of Lotus Notes were
$90 million behind the company's plan, but Papows called the number
``grossly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that Lotus's North American business has
not performed as well as in other regions of the world, where
Microsoft is barely a factor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company is overhauling its North American
operations, bringing in a new manager with increased
responsibilities. Mike Laginski is a Papows protege who joined
Lotus five years ago, but left shortly after IBM bought the
company.
</P>
<P>
   He returned recently to take control of North American
operations and helps fill a void created by the departure of a
Deborah Besemer, a highly regarded Lotus executive who left last
November to become chief executive of SystemSoft, a Natick software
company.
</P>
<P>
   While reorganizing its internal operations, Lotus officials have
also mounted a public campaign to counter a damaging article that
appeared recently in Forbes magazine entitled &UR;  &LR;  ``The Decline and
Fall of Lotus.''
</P>
<P>
   The article said that IBM's purchase of Lotus had turned sour,
and that many large Lotus customers were ripping out their Notes
systems in favor of Microsoft Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated Lotus officials are demanding a retraction, and,
meanwhile, are moving to try to calm anxious employees and
customers who have spent millions installing Notes systems. Forbes
says it is standing by the story.
</P>
<P>
   Papows says it is true that some of Lotus's large customers are
installing Microsoft Exchange for corporate e-mail purposes, but
says they are retaining Notes for its advanced collaborative
features, many of which Exchange does not have.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees, but says its Exchange customers eventually
plan to replace Notes because they don't want to maintain two
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Baan Co. in Reston, Va., a major producer of business management
software for large companies, is one highly visible defector from
the Lotus camp.
</P>
<P>
   John Douglas, director of information technology, said that Baan
took a critical look last year at its Lotus Notes installation,
which served about 5,000 users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Notes implementation here was pretty abysmal,'' said
Douglas. ``There were a lot of hardware issues, and the cost of
administration was high.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas grants that the advanced groupware features of Notes are
superior to those of Exchange, but added that Baan was mainly
interested in a straightforward messaging system. In that
department, Douglas said, Exchange gets top grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely shocked at the amount of hardware it takes to
run Exchange _ or the lack thereof,'' Douglas said, adding that he
needed 40 server computers to run the Notes system. Today, Baan
runs an Exchange system that supports 10,000 users _ twice as many
as the Notes system it replaced. But Exchange requires just three
servers, powerful machines that link PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Baan is a major business ally of Microsoft in the development of
high-end business software. But Douglas said that this played no
part in the decision to switch to Exchange. ``We didn't even
contact IBM or Microsoft,'' said Douglas. ``We made the decision
internally.'' And Baan turned a deaf ear to Lotus's efforts to
reverse the decision. ``Notes is a good platform,'' said Douglas.
``It's just not for us.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, M&AMP;I Data Services, the data processing
division of Milwaukee-based Marshall &AMP; Ilsley Corp., left
Microsoft's older e-mail program, Microsoft Mail, to jump on the
Notes bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wallace, director of technical infrastructure, said his
company wanted to create an Intranet, a private network based on
Internet standards, with the ability to route forms around the
company, and other collaborative features, and found Exchange
couldn't do the job without a lot of expensive add-on software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the Domino-based solution was one third of the cost of
the Exchange-based solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who track the groupware market say the Forbes article
was way off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lotus is not declining, it is not falling,'' wrote Dan Rasmus,
an analyst with Giga Inforamtion Group Inc. of Norwell, shortly
after the Forbes story was published. ``Lotus is in fact holding
its own against Microsoft where other companies have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent research firm, Gartner Group of Stamford,
Conn., says it'll be mid-2001 before Microsoft catches Lotus in
sales of groupware, and points out that Exchange still dramatically
lags behind Notes's collaborative features.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is far from over, and Lotus is in a very good spot, a
very defensible spot'' said Ian Campbell, an analyst with
International Data Corp. of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two horse race and we're neck and neck,'' said Papows.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a muggy August day, two 8-year-old boys stand shoulder-deep
in water, waiting for the next wave so they can bodysurf to shore.
As they bob up and down, trying to dunk each other, one of them
points toward the horizon and screams, ``Look out, here comes a
huge one!''
</P>
<P>
   No, they're not at Jones Beach or the Jersey Shore but at the
wave pool at the Splish Splash Water Park in Riverhead, N.Y. Water
parks across the country are using technology to manufacture
artificial waves for your bobbing and riding delight _ and look,
Ma, no sand in your suit.
</P>
<P>
   How do the water parks coax water to move in directions it would
never otherwise go? In the wave pool at Splish Splash, waves are
produced by blowing tremendous gusts of air into the water at
different intervals, much like the way real waves are produced
except that the wind has to be manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Lining the back of the wave pool, called Surf City, are six
watertight concrete vaults, or caissons. Each caisson is basically
a box with one open side facing into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   In a building behind the pool, there are three 150-horsepower
turbines, which suck air into the building through vents and
produce air currents. These air currents are sent to compressor
tanks and then into large valves, which connect to the caissons.
</P>
<P>
   The valves open and close in quick succession to shoot the air
into the caissons and from there into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Each turbine can produce enough air for a wave measuring a foot
and a half high, and three turbines working together can produce a
wave more than four feet high. Surf City has eight different waves:
a diamond, a right diagonal, a center peak V, a right split roller,
a left diagonal, a side peak V, a left split roller and a big
roller. Each one is produced by blowing air into one or more of the
caissons at different intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Letting air flow into caisson one, for example, then into
caisson two a second later, then caisson three, and down the line,
forms a left diagonal breaking wave. Firing air into caissons one
and six at the same time produces a wave that comes together at
giant peaks down the center _ a diamond. Letting air into all six
caissons at once produces a big roller.
</P>
<P>
   The wave patterns are controlled by a programmable logic
controller, a sort of master control panel a short distance from
the turbines. (A programmable logic controller is also used in
industrial applications to receive and monitor data from sensors on
all the system components.)
</P>
<P>
   If a turbine overheats, or a valve doesn't receive a strong
enough air current, a sensor will signal the controller, which will
shut the whole system down.
</P>
<P>
   The wave programs are preset in 10-minute patterns. After every
10-minute period, the controller shuts the turbines off, letting
tired swimmers make their way to the concrete shore and letting new
swimmers in. Lifeguards, including one eyeing a series of video
cameras, can press one of several emergency stop buttons, signaling
the controller to halt the turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Another ride at Splish Splash, the Lazy River, pushes water _
and people, sitting snugly in inner tubes _ across a flat,
1,300-foot-long surface. Water gets sucked into grates positioned
every couple of hundred feet along the floor of the river, where it
travels via large pipes to one of three pumping stations in the
park.
</P>
<P>
   The pumping stations then pressurize the water and shoot it
through valves, where it is injected back into the river through a
series of openings, also situated along the floor of the river.
</P>
<P>
   If producing four-foot-high waves and a moving river aren't
worthy enough water-technology feats, Chip Cleary, president of
Splish Splash, said in the future the park may install a Master
Blaster, a water roller coaster ride that uses turbines and pumps
to inject water into the bottom of a flume and then move it up
hills.
</P>
<P>
   When it falls, according to the manufacturer, NBGS International
of New Braunfels, Texas, it can move faster than many traditional
roller coasters. (For a virtual test ride, go to the company's
site, www.nbgsintl.com/blastTXT.html.)

<P>
   Real estate surveys show that most home buyers decide to buy a
house within the first 15 minutes of seeing it. This kind of
impulsive buying can have disastrous repercussions if the house has
a major flaw or defect that's not immediately detectable. While
first impressions are important, they should be buttressed by a
careful inspection.
</P>
<P>
   When you drive up to a new house, take a few minutes to look at
it and the surrounding grounds before going inside. Study the lay
of the land. The ground should slope away from the house _ ideally
six inches for every three feet _ otherwise rain water will collect
around the foundation and eventually seep into the basement. Patios
and driveways should also slant away from the house for the same
reason. If possible visit the house after a rainstorm. Then, if you
see a number of puddles, you'll know that the house has a drainage
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any trees around the house? Big trees on the property
can provide shade during the summer and keep cooling bills down. If
they are closer than 10 feet, however, their roots might interfere
with the plumbing or the foundation. Evergreen trees can protect
your house from harsh winter winds. Willows and poplars are
picturesque, but they can be a nuisance if they are too close to
the house because they develop shallow root systems that spread
over a large areas.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to inspect the roof and gutters. Obviously, you
can't get up to the roof without a ladder. You can, however, get
some idea of the condition of the roof by looking at it with a pair
of binoculars. See if the roof sags anywhere. A sagging roof
indicates weak or damaged framing members and a major repair job.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the shingles. They should be flat, not curled, and of
uniform color. Shingles of contrasting color indicate that spot
repairs have been made. A few spots here and there are acceptable,
but a number of wide patches suggests that the roofing should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   At some point you'll want to ask the owner how old the roofing
material is. This will give you some clue as to how much longer it
will last. A roof with asphalt shingles will last about 25 years;
one with wood shakes, 40 years; and a slate tile roof 30 to 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Walk up to the house to examine the walls. They may be of
masonry (brick or stone) or sided with wood, aluminum or vinyl.
Masonry is more durable than the other materials, but over time the
mortar between the bricks or stones will deteriorate. You can test
the quality of the mortar by poking it with a pen knife. If it is
soft and crumbles, it may need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   Look for cracks in the mortar between the bricks or in the
bricks themselves. A few vertical cracks are bound to develop in
any house as it settles. Horizontal cracks, on the other hand, are
often the result of structural problems. These are cause for
concern, especially if they are wider than a quarter of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   If the house has siding, sight along the wall to see if is
straight without any sags or bulges. These defects suggest that the
wood under the siding has decayed. Another way to test the
soundness of the substructure is by pressing against the siding.
You should meet with firm resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect the doors and windows to see if they have been caulked
properly. Some small gaps are bound to be present, but wide gaps
may mean that moisture has seeped into the walls over the years.
Look carefully at the glazing around the windowpanes; it should
form a continuous bead.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor lighting can make your home safer and more secure. Look
to see if there is a porch light, one over the garage doors, and
fixtures around the house to illuminate the back door and yard. All
these lights will help to protect your house from break-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that when you are buying a house, you are also buying
into the neighborhood. Therefore it is important to check out the
community as well as the house. This is so important that many real
estate agents feel that the community evaluation should be the
house hunter's first priority.

BLUEBERRY DAYS; LOG-FIRE NIGHTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE V. IOVINE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vacationers with a puritanical streak are drawn to Maine, where
stark blue skies and towering evergreens meet jagged gray rocks and
the endless high-low seething of ocean tides. Here, even leisure
activities have an edge, whether it's knuckling down to sail in a
stiff wind or charging up graveled hills on a bike. Writers like
E.B. White and Robert McCloskey have found Maine rich in material
for moral tales of innocence unsettled by nature's
unpredictability. Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart can only dream of
bottling this essence of virtuous American simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from Cincinnati, where Nancy and Barron Krody
live in the winter. The couple _ she teaches prekindergarten, he
runs a marketing and design firm _ started coming to Maine more
than 30 years ago, when their two children, Margo and Eric, were so
small they didn't have to bend over to pick the blueberries. About
18 years ago, the Krodys decided to stake a more permanent claim,
calculating that their children, now grown, would be more likely to
visit them in Maine than in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   On Penobscot Bay _ not far from the hills encountered in
McCloskey's homespun children's classic ``Blueberries for Sal'' _
houses are simple, styled by time and the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Krodys bought theirs sight unseen in 1980. ``We'd heard it
was going to be available out on a gam,'' Mrs. Krody said, using
boaters' slang for the informal chats that develop between boat
crews moored alongside one another. They knew the spot from sailing
past on their way toward Bucks Harbor, another McCloskey landmark.
The house itself _ a gray shingled cottage with green shutters and
a stone and log foundation _ was nestled too deep in the pines to
be visible, except for the floating dock attached directly to a
huge boulder plunging into the sea. ``The site was so beautiful it
didn't really matter to us what the house was like,'' she said,
``though it turned out to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The cottage was built in 1927 for an engineer by Ferd Clifford,
a local lobsterman. In those days, the place could be reached only
by boat. It's not much easier today: a dirt road ends a
quarter-mile from the house. Visitors must trek the last 300 yards
through dense woods carpeted in moss. Groceries and luggage are
brought in by cart; the mail is picked up only sporadically. When
the Krodys moved in, there were still plenty of kerosene lamps
around in case the recently installed electricity failed. An
eternal spring up the hill provides a reliable source of water.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story cottage has a birdhouse verticality. The site,
which slips down to a wide cove, is so steep that even the ground
floor feels lodged in tree branches. Tall double-sash windows are
grouped in twos, and the space in between is lined with bookshelves
_ it's the kind of place where an Emerson or a Thoreau might
contemplate the meaning of self-reliance. The first-floor ceiling
is low, but painted white, along with the insides of the window
frames, to brighten the room.
</P>
<P>
   The requisite wood-burning stove stands at the ready, with an
armchair for reading and a couch for napping within reach of its
radiant glow. The dining table opposite the galley kitchen has
window seats; they were built in by a previous owner, a minister
who liked woodworking. Examples of his handiness give the place its
shipshape personality: a desk fit into a window; knickknack drawers
tucked between exposed 4-by-4 studs.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor, another living room attests to the
importance of the huddling factor. It can get extremely cold in
Maine, even in summer. An imposing fireplace made of stones hauled
up from the beach dominates the large room, which is open to the
rafters. The starkly simple pendant ceiling lights were rescued
from an old school in Cincinnati that was about to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Adjoining the living room are two tiny bedrooms _ really just
beds stowed behind a plank wall. In one, it's necessary to kneel on
the bed to reach the curtain-covered closet; the other has only
clothing hooks.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, light floods the entire floor, thanks to a
double set of folding french doors _ an unusual design flourish in
a rustic cottage of the 1920s _ that open onto a long screened-in
sleeping porch. Mrs. Krody leaves the doors open even when there's
a fire roaring. Much of the furniture was adopted from the two
previous owners or picked up locally. Not long ago, furnishings
could be delivered only by a schooner beached down in the cove,
then carried up through the woods. Mrs. Krody ordered her couches
from Pottery Barn; they were carted the last quarter mile from the
road. ``They said they could ship anywhere,'' Mrs. Krody said.
</P>
<P>
   A porch surrounding the house is wide enough on one side for
four Adirondack chairs that look out toward Deer Island in the
distance. A smaller balcony, shaded by fir and spruce, faces the
cove; it's large enough for only a sun-bleached table and four
mismatched chairs. This is where the Krodys have lunch: mussels
collected at low tide from the cove are edible, as are the
chanterelles culled from the damp recesses of the woods. By
evening, however, it's the mosquitoes who feast.
</P>
<P>
   Summers are for sailing and working on the house. Krody has
inherited the minister's wood shop as well as a habit of tinkering.
Mrs. Krody likes to visit the Blue Hill antiques fair that takes
place each summer on the fairgrounds, described in E.B. White's
``Charlotte's Web.'' In search of locally made folk art, she also
visits an old decoy maker on Deer Island and the prison shop in
Thomaston, which sells inmates' woodwork. ``I like junktiques,''
she said. ``And I'm in no hurry. It would be too boring if the
place were done all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Projects are always under way. To enlarge a dining-room table,
Mrs. Krody's daughter, Margo Blutt, a former dancer with the New
York City Ballet, took the old extension leaf stored in the rafters
and painted it urchin-shell green, a folksy way to disguise how
much the table itself had worn over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Krodys undertook a more ambitious plan, to rebuild
a dilapidated bunkhouse on their point into a three-bedroom cabin
for guests. Earl Clifford, the Krody's caretaker, and his son, Earl
Jr., descendants of the lobsterman who put up the main house, built
the new cabin. Clifford told the Krodys not to bother hiring
architects, that he could do it from a sketch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he'd have his own way of doing things,'' Krody said,
``and that would probably be the best way.'' So, Krody sketched on
graph paper the outlines of a simple gabled house with a wide
porch. Mrs. Krody requested that the interior be finished with two
``napping nooks,'' as she called them, like those she'd seen in a
magazine article about an island house near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin reveals its contemporary age. An expansive kitchen
with a large country table that upstages a wood stove reflects the
cultural shift from yarn-spinning around the fire to socializing
with the cook. The bedrooms _ one of them formerly held six bunks _
are no longer strictly utilitarian, but truly comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The little cottage in the woods is now a compound ready for
reunions. But for Mrs. Krody, the old-fashioned pleasure of
gathering around the big stone fireplace in the main house remains
the most idyllic of moments in their Maine sojourns. ``I love it
when it's cold in August,'' she said as the fire crackled and
popped.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a decade of research and political debate, most
of the world's consumer-electronics manufacturers have announced
their plans and prices for the new high-definition television sets
that go on sale in September. And talk about sticker shock: The
least expensive ones will cost $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, when manufacturers were lobbying the Federal
Communications Commission to pass the digital-television rules,
several major companies, including Thomson and Zenith, said the
first high-definition sets would cost $1,000 to $1,500 more than
conventional high-end projection sets. That estimate would have
placed even the most expensive high-definition models at $4,000 and
$5,000. So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say some of the components used to build these
sets cost more than they had anticipated. ``The cost of the display
has grown exponentially,'' explained James Meyer, head of Thomson
Multimedia's American operation. Thomson, a French company that
makes RCA, GE and Proscan models, is the largest manufacturer of
televisions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Meyer cited the display component, some people in the
industry said that high-resolution video displays _ the optical
components that produce a picture _ have been manufactured for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mature technology, fairly well known and understood
from a science and engineering standpoint,'' said Robert Perry,
director of marketing for Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Milbourn, a senior Thomson executive, said his company
had not been fully aware of the premium it would have to pay for
the high-definition optics used in mass-market televisions. Until
now, this equipment was used only in high-end projection TVs that
cost $20,000 or more. ``We'd never made a high-definition optical
system before,'' Milbourn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really difficult to get an accurate estimate early
on,'' said John Taylor, a spokesman for Zenith, discussing the
price.
</P>
<P>
   The retail price of an HDTV set is also driven by other issues.
For instance, Thomson and the other manufacturers all say they do
not expect to make or sell large numbers of these extraordinarily
pricey television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see a flurry of activity and interest this fall,
but not much volume,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high price, and despite the fact that most of these
televisions will be huge rear-projectors that will dominate almost
any room in which they are placed, retailers say they expect to
sell as many as the industry can make.
</P>
<P>
   This may not say a lot, since set makers don't intend to
manufacture very many _ probably no more than 100,000 this year.
But Americans already buy nearly 1 million conventional projection
televisions a year, including tens of thousands that sell for
$5,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   And when the first high-definition monitor made by a mass-market
manufacturer, Panasonic, went on sale Aug. 6 in two stores on the
West Coast, one of the stores, Dow Stereo/Video in San Diego,
reported that 15,000 people trooped through to see the set over the
first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Dow quickly sold out its first order _ reported by industry
journals to be 30 units. And on Tuesday, Thomas Campbell, an
executive with Dow, reported that 18 more people had placed orders
for the monitor, with full payment in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The list price for the monitor is $6,000, though Dow is selling
it for $5,500. But to receive high-definition programming when
digital broadcasting begins in the fall, owners of these monitors
will also have to buy a digital tuner box. Panasonic's goes on sale
in October for $1,700, bringing the total list price to $7,700.
</P>
<P>
   The television industry sells nearly 25 million sets a year, so
the sale of a few HDTV's is barely consequential. In fact, the low
volume contributes to the pricing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Mark Knox, a senior manager for Samsung Electronics
Company, put it: ``The costs are extraordinarily high because the
volume is so small.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsung's first HDTV, a 55-inch rear projection model, will go
on sale in November with a $7,999 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Knox and others also pointed to another reason for the high
price of a set. They said it was important for the industry to show
the best products they could at the start, no matter the cost, so
consumers who see HDTV for the first time would be impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these sets are intentionally overbuilt because it is
critical that we make the right impression with the consumer at
this point,'' Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these first sets are loaded _ like a car that comes
with a power sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated seats
and a global positioning system. The TVs have fancy multi-channel
audio systems, digital processors that upgrade the quality of
conventional television images and every other bell and whistle
normally built into high-end television sets. That's one reason
that Thomson's first set will cost $8,000 and Zenith's $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, all of the manufacturers swear that the prices will fall
_ and fast. This isn't of concern just to them. Television stations
that begin digital broadcasting, starting on Nov. 1, are spending
millions to make the transition.
</P>
<P>
   The money is wasted, they say, as long as the TV sets required
to receive digital signals are so expensive that almost nobody has
one.
</P>
<P>
   And the federal government is eager to speed the transition to
digital broadcasting. Every one of the nation's 1,600 television
stations has been lent a second channel for digital broadcasts.
When the transition is complete, when most everyone has a digital
television set, the old channels _ the ones on the air today _ are
to be taken back and auctioned for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds from those future auctions, estimated now at $6
billion, are already being counted in federal budget projections.
But no one believes the bulk of the population will embrace digital
television until prices for the sets fall by 90 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Thibodeaux, a senior economist with the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association, collects and analyzes sales
data for all sorts of consumer electronics products, including
televisions. And he says the industry's record shows that prices
for new products generally fall by about 50 percent after a decade.
</P>
<P>
   VCRs, for example, cost an average of $1,955 in 1974, when they
were first introduced, adjusting the numbers for inflation. It took
until 1983 for the average price to fall to half of that.
</P>
<P>
   By that calculation, the least expensive high-definition
televisions will still cost nearly $4,000 in 2007 _ hardly
encouraging to sellers and consumers alike. But manufacturers say
such a comparison is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   A year or two from now, many manufacturers, including Thomson,
will begin offering several more models. Some will provide a full
high-definition picture without all of the expensive extra
features. By then, the integrated circuits needed to translate and
display the digital signal, now a rarified and expensive piece of
circuitry, will almost certainly have dropped in price
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Today the chips alone contribute $2,000 or more to the retail
cost of an HDTV. But these chips should respond to Moore's Law, the
computer-industry guideline that says a microprocessor's capability
will double, and the price halve, every 18 months. Given the
universal appeal of televisions _ far greater than that of
computers _ Perry, the Mitsubishi executive, says he believes the
cost of the microprocessors will drop by 50 percent each year for
the next three.
</P>
<P>
   Knox says an HDTV will probably sell for $3,000 by 2002.
Milbourn said he believed his company would sell an HDTV for half
the current price by the time the second-generation models come out
in a year or two. Perry says ``they'll cost $3,500 a couple of
years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly better than $8,000, but still out of the reach
of most television buyers, who now pay $500 or less on average for
a new set. In fact, Thibodeaux's research shows that consumer
electronics products reach true mass acceptance only after the
price falls below $500.
</P>
<P>
   And how long before the industry is able to sell a
high-definition television set for $499.95? Within the industry,
that question generally is greeted with heavy sighs and pessimistic
shakes of the head. No one is willing to even guess.

AN UPGRADE GAME OF STOP-AND-GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (jt)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually I am at peace with my decision not to be an early
adopter of new technology. Given the choice between spending a
hundred hours debugging some brand-new, whiz-bang bit of gadgetry
and, say, raising my three children, I have opted for motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   So I did not mind a bit when my husband recently ordered a
Micron Millenia computer that runs at a slightly faster speed than
mine. I even managed a tight smile when it arrived with a pair of
Advent speakers that dwarfed mine. But when he pointed out that his
modem connected nearly twice as fast? That I could not bear.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to upgrade my U.S. Robotics 56K modem, a moment I
had been dreading since I bought it last spring. The problem was
that my modem's x2 technology, on which it relied to introduce
itself to other modems, was incompatible with the K56flex
technology my online provider used. So my 56K modem never
downloaded information any faster than 28.8 kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the International Telecommunication Union, a United
Nations agency, announced technical specifications for a new
standard, the v.90, for all 56K modems. Most major online services
and carriers _ including America Online, PSI Net, UUNet and
Mindspring _ have recently announced upgrades to their own
networks.
</P>
<P>
   On my husband's newer modem, the v.90 standard was installed in
the factory, effectively blowing the doors off my modem. My only
chance to catch up would be to download a software patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are probably the last person left on earth who hasn't
upgraded,'' my husband goaded me from his computer, where he
frisked like a dolphin in a vast sea of online information.
</P>
<P>
   I actually took comfort in those words, realizing that the early
adopters of upgrades had probably already worked out any kinks that
might have arisen in the six months since the v.90 standard was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, obtaining the software patch from the U.S. Robotics
support site  &UR; (www.usr.com/home/online) &LR;  shouldn't take more than
five minutes, with the aid of a Modem Update Wizard that I could
quickly download from the same site. But first, I decided to
perform a test at  &UR; www.3com.com/56k/need456k/linetest.html &LR;  to make
sure my home phone line was capable of sending data at a speed of
56 kilobits per second. ``The vast majority of phone lines can,''
Jim Thomsen, a product manager at 3Com, which owns U.S. Robotics,
assured me in a telephone interview. ``But some older phone lines
might have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   My phone line passed the test (time spent: 2 minutes),
emboldening me to try to download the Modem Update Wizard. This is
where I hit my first minor glitch: the connection between my
computer and the server where the wizard resided kept stalling. It
took me nearly a dozen tries to download the program (time spent: 1
hour).
</P>
<P>
   Next, I ran the wizard, which instructed my modem to phone a
U.S. Robotics server in Illinois (I had to pay for the
long-distance call). The capable wizard told the server my modem's
Device ID number, then waited patiently while the server flipped
through a catalog of software patches to find the right one. The
process seemed to be going smoothly _ in fact, I briefly considered
asking the wizard for some child-rearing advice _ but then the
trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of completing its task, the wizard suddenly informed me
via an on-screen window that an upgrade for my model was ``not yet
available.'' This seemed unlikely since my modem was one of the
most popular models on the market. But I repeated the process a
couple of times to double-check. Same result (time spent: 30
minutes). Confused, I phoned Thomsen (time spent: 5 minutes). Was I
doing something wrong? ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``We designed
the wizard to be pretty straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thomsen went off to check out the problem at his end, it
occurred to me to wonder whether this whole process was in vain.
What if my online provider, GST Whole Earth Networks, had not
upgraded its system yet to the v.90 standard? I could be wasting a
lot of time here only to find out _ eventually _ that my modem was
still incompatible with my online provider.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, a phone call to GST Whole Earth Networks' technical
support line (time spent: 10 minutes) seemed to confirm my worst
fears. The bad news was that the online provider, with headquarters
on the West Coast, leased phone lines on the East Coast _ where I
dial in to the network _ from UUNet. According to information
available to technical support, UUNet had not upgraded my local
dial-up.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I phoned UUNet to find out when the line would be upgraded
(time spent: 15 minutes). ``Whole Earth Networks gave you the wrong
information,'' said Alan Tassel, vice president of marketing at
UUNet. ``Our network is fully deployed to handle v.90. We announced
the upgrade last month.''
</P>
<P>
   I called GST Whole Earth Networks again, this time reaching
Dylan Larson, a product manager who said the confusion probably
arose because the online provider was still in the process of
upgrading to v.90. ``It's changing from day to day,'' he said,
explaining why the technical support staff did not have current
information (time spent: 15 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Thomsen from 3Com phoned to tell me that he had
solved the Modem Update Wizard's problem (time spent: 10 minutes).
``I don't know how it happened, but maybe a system administrator
made every catalog entry unavailable while he was doing
maintenance, and then when he brought it up again, he didn't hit
the switch on that particular entry,'' Thomsen said. ``It should
work now.''
</P>
<P>
   It did (time spent: 5 minutes). Soon after, I saw my modem's
speed jump to well above 50 kilobits per second. Am I annoyed by
the fact that I spent more than two and a half hours trying to
upgrade? No, because now my modem runs slightly faster than my
husband's. I suspect it will take him at least a hundred hours to
figure out why.

SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON HDTV 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The introduction of high-definition television will bring
changes for TV viewers. Here are the answers to some questions
about those changes: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When will the first high-definition televisions go on sale? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Several manufacturers have pledged to put their first models
on the market next month, and others will come through the fall and
winter. By January or February 1999, almost all major
consumer-electronics manufacturers should have sets for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies already sell high-definition monitors. They
have been available for years from high-end manufacturers.
Panasonic put a new one on the market early this month, the first
from a mass-market manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   These sets are capable of displaying a digital, high-definition
picture but need a new, digital tuner to receive the signal. The
first of these tuners will go on sale this fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If I buy an HDTV set, how much high-definition programming
will I see? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Residents of the nation's 10 largest cities will be able to
watch a small sampling of high-definition programming on 24
network-owned television stations starting no later than Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with the federal government, the stations
have promised to begin digital broadcasting by that date, but they
are not required to broadcast in high-definition. Most have
promised to show only a few hours of high-definition programming,
principally movies.
</P>
<P>
   By next spring, every network-affiliated television station in
the 10 largest cities will be required to begin digital
broadcasting. And by Nov. 1, 1999, all of the network-owned and
-affiliated stations in the 30 largest cities must go on the air.
The rest will begin over the following three years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, DirecTV, the nation's largest direct-broadcast
satellite service, has promised to broadcast two channels of HDTV
starting early next year. Unity Motion, a start-up,
direct-broadcast satellite company, plans to begin airing two
channels of HDTV by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   HBO and a couple of other cable channels plan to begin
broadcasting some HDTV early next year. But in the early days, at
least, there will be no way to receive any high-definition
programming transmitted by cable. The technology for that has not
been finalized. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do I have to buy a new TV? Will the conventional TVs I have
now stop working? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Maybe one day, but not for a long time. Every one of the
nation's 1,600 television stations has been lent a second channel
for digital broadcasts. All of the TV stations that are on the air
now will continue broadcasting in their regular places, and the new
digital programming will appear on the second, digital channel.
(Channel 4 in one city, as an example, might also broadcast on
channel 54.)
</P>
<P>
   But after a period of years, the government wants to take one of
these channels back, leaving only the digital channels on the air.
The present rule says the old channels will go off the air in 2006
_ unless fewer than 85 percent of the viewers in each city have
digital TVs by then. No one really believes that target date will
be met.
</P>
<P>
   Both the old and new channels will probably remain on the air
for many years. In fact, given the politics of this transition,
broadcasters are unlikely to give up their old channels until they
are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, anyone still using a conventional set will be able to
buy an inexpensive converter box that will translate the digital
signals for display on the old sets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I get an HDTV set, will I still be able to watch all my
old videotapes _ movies and the recordings I made with my video
camera? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. In the beginning and probably for a long time,
digital-television sets will also include a conventional analog
tuner. That means you will be able to watch digital programming on
the digital channels, analog programming on the original channels _
and all of the videotapes, Laserdiscs, DVDs and everything else you
have collected over the years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is digital, high-definition television better than what we
have today? Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. HDTV offers more than twice the resolution of today's
television. At its highest level, a high-definition signal holds
1,080 horizontal lines and 1,920 vertical lines, compared with 480
by 704 lines for today's television.
</P>
<P>
   Properly displayed, these images are so sharp, so clear, that
for many people the improvement changes the way they relate to
television. Often, first-time viewers say they have the impression
they are gazing through a window rather than looking at a picture.
As a result, they say they feel more involved with the program.
</P>
<P>
   But at least as important is the nature of the transmissions.
The new system is digital, so televisions can become interactive
and carry all kinds of information and data _ not just video and
audio signals. &QL;

BRINGING EXTRA PASSION TO A FINE ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (jt)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``nuance'' does not generally describe interactive
media. In most digital environments, the impetus is to race ahead
with both guns blazing, solve all the puzzles, beat the big bad
boss and never look back _ only ahead, to the next product. They're
like theme restaurants that pack tables and jack up the music so
that you'll eat and leave as quickly as possible. How refreshing,
then, to find the digital equivalent of a candle-lighted bistro,
tucked away on some side street, where patrons are encouraged to
stretch a few cups of coffee into literary conversations that last
for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Nick Bantock's Griffin and Sabine trilogy, Ceremony of
Innocence (Real World, CD-ROM for Mac and PC, $59.95), is an
epistolary romance between two artists, one of whom may be a
figment of the other's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the books, Ceremony of Innocence takes the form of
illustrated letters and postcards. But whereas the paper version
presented page-mounted envelopes and the illicit thrill of opening
someone else's mail, the CD-ROM translates each missive into an
audiovisual collage of handwriting, typewriting, animation, film,
music and spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   In the wrong hands, this sort of layering ends up a mess. But in
Ceremony it works, because there is nothing amateurish in the
production. When you hear a letter read aloud, you believe it,
because the voice belongs to Isabella Rossellini, Paul McGann or
Ben Kingsley. This is the work of trained artists. It's not just
technically impressive. It is genuinely sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways, Ceremony surpasses its printed source. For
example, a photorealistic painting of a goldfish and a broken
wineglass is an arresting image on the page. But on the screen it
becomes a fable: the glass is intact, and the goldfish is swimming
inside. Move the cursor across the glass, and the fish becomes
agitated, circling frantically. Click on it, and the wineglass
rings, as would a real glass, with different sound depending on
where you strike it. Click repeatedly and quickly, and the glass
will eventually shatter. You hear the sound, and you jump. You feel
responsible, and aghast, as if you'd broken a real glass.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you felt emotionally accountable for
anything you did with a computer mouse?
</P>
<P>
   There are fancifully drawn creatures on most cards, and the
mouse will sometimes scare them off. Or vice versa _ a mechanical
cat can swat the cursor away with its tail. A mythological animal
may eat your cursor, and you will see it trapped in the creature's
belly. At other times, there is no cursor at all, and the mouse
will pass across the screen invisibly, rustling images into motion
like leaves in a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, the picture's workings reveal themselves slowly.
You're forced to be patient and really look, slow down and really
notice what's going on and read the image on the screen the way you
would read a painting.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time anything on a computer screen inspired
you to be still? That's not what interactive media trains us to do.
The vast majority of software trains us to absorb, process and
discard information as quickly as possible. Churn through the data.
React instantaneously. If something takes more than three seconds,
click for more stimulation. If immediate gratification is not
forthcoming, abandon ship. If nothing else, this CD-ROM makes you
realize the extent to which people have been programmed by
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The face of each card and envelope poses a different question
about the relationship between pixels on the screen and the person
at the keyboard. You don't have to answer these questions. You
merely have to recognize that they exist, that all the metaphors
about pointing and clicking and cursors and mice are up for grabs.
Suspend your assumptions and the riddle unravels. The envelope
opens and falls away, and the correspondence continues.
</P>
<P>
   The story is the payoff and, in a sense, a mirror of the
viewer's experience. Every postcard and letter is a link in the
transcontinental romance between artists who write to each other,
each seeking his or her perfect opposite. The story alternates
between voices, but also between pictures and words. The visual and
the verbal stories intertwine and inform each other here, just as
the characters do.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer alternates as well, between the front and the back of
each card, between the outside of each envelope and the letter
inside, between the visual riddle, which demands interaction, and
the epistolary narrative, which simply unfurls. On the face of the
card, your presence matters. On the back, the characters are acting
and you're just watching. It's a correspondence between you and the
story. And it's a duet between the written and the spoken word, as
you hear the text read aloud and see the handwriting appear, then
fade, with the sound. There is a correspondence in this work,
wherever you look. It's like a fractal _ a pattern that repeats
itself on every scale.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you turn off the computer, the counterpoint persists
because the digital story is the perfect dual opposite of the paper
story. When you go back to the printed image after seeing it on the
screen, you cannot help imagining it in motion. When you read the
letters, you can almost hear the words spoken aloud. Ceremony
leaves a phantom trace on the page. It becomes a ghostly
counterpart to the books, and to Griffin and Sabine's extraordinary
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin and Sabine couldn't have done better themselves.

A NEW, WIRED BREED OF FREIGHT-HOPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By PAMELA LI CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real hobos don't use cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational hobos, however, are an increasingly wired breed.
Once, Depression-era tramps scratched symbols on train trestles to
pass information to others looking for an empty boxcar and a free
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Now so-called yuppie hobos _ who sneak onto freight trains for
adventure rather than out of economic necessity _ use scanners to
monitor railroad frequencies and cellular phones to talk with other
hobos. They also trade information via more than two dozen Web
sites, as well as e-mail discussion lists and newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us fortunate enough to have modems use our public and
secret hobo communities on the Net to keep in touch, share rail
information'' and complain ``that the railroads are getting too
tough on us innocent rail riders,'' Todd Waters, 50, a recreational
hopper, said by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who once rode the rails full time in his youth,
theorizes that the appeal of freight-hopping is due to what he
calls ``the drift: ``For me, the drift occurs when I migrate from
the linear world, neat with its processes and models, to the road,
where everything happens at once. You've got a general direction,
but it doesn't have much glue on it. The plan has equal weight to
every new distraction that comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Recreational hobos train-hop in part to pay homage to an ideal
of hobo freedom and self-reliance that experts say belies
historical reality. Yet, their stories of hopping can have a
romantic appeal and an infectious enthusiasm, as evidenced by those
collected on the Train Hopping Space (http://catalog.com/hop/) and
other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hans-Christoph Steiner of Manhattan posts photos of his ``hops''
on his personal Web site
(http://yagaland.razorfish.com/hoboFrame.html) and takes part in a
recreational hobo mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea always intrigued me,'' he said of train-hopping. ``I
liked the image of a hobo: a self-sufficient wanderer who doesn't
burden others.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said he was hooked after his first hop with some college
friends from Portland, Ore., to Seattle: ``Even though we spent 10
hours waiting for the train in two different yards, the trip was
well worth it,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ``We came upon the Puget
Sound _ the tracks were right on the coast _ and we watched the
sunset while sitting on top of a double-stacked container car
traveling through the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   But the online activities of recreational freight-hoppers _
whose hobby is illegal and dangerous, as a disclaimer on Steiner's
page states _ has also drawn the ire of rail-safety groups, known
as ``rail fans'' who fear a crackdown on legal access by all train
hobbyists, and the railroads themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites now offer a contrary view of hopping. One,
www.deadtrainbums.com, contains gruesome photographs of what are
said to be hoppers caught beneath the rails, and links to news
articles about injuries and deaths related to railroad trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1997 fatalities caused by trespassing in railyards
and on railcars (not including suicides) increased 15 percent over
1996, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
</P>
<P>
   While the statistics don't reveal how many of those deaths
involved hobos, some believe there is a link between the
availability of online information about hopping and the rise in
trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the House subcommittee on railroads in
April, Gerri Hall, the president of Operation Lifesaver, a
rail-safety group, said: ``Effective action needs to be taken to
discourage the promotion of romanticized images of dangerous
railroad trespassing activities. We need to find a way to put a
damper on Web sites that encourage unsuspecting young people to
engage in illegal and dangerous activities on railroad property.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah George, a filmmaker completing a short documentary called
``Hobo Jungles,'' says she has heard estimates of from 10,000 to
100,000 regular freight-hoppers. ``But my guess is there are
probably a couple thousand really hard-core riders and maybe as
many as 20,000 who ride the rails occasionally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, she said, the largest general groups are true tramps
(mostly men from 30 to 50 years old who are indigent) followed by
``punks'' (youths rebelling against society). She takes a dim view
of purely recreational hobos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. George's own Web site (www.worthyent.com/) drew an angry
response from the freight railroads, she said, because they feared
the film would glamorize hopping. Railyard personnel were told to
be on the lookout for her cameras, she said, and she took down all
but a brief description of the film from the page.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Furtney, Union Pacific Railroad's director of public
relations for the Western region, says that with just 250 special
agents to police 35,000 miles of track, Union Pacific has started
keeping at least a casual eye on hobo sites.
</P>
<P>
   This monitoring results in ``a small, incremental amount of
intelligence for our agents,'' he says. And railroad employees have
been known to post personal messages on newsgroups to counter the
hobos' information.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most well-known recreational hobo is ``North Bank
Fred'' (www.snowcrest.net/bndlstif/index.html), a middle-aged
construction worker who is determined to preserve his anonymity,
and who collects photos of modern-day ``monikers,'' hoppers'
painted or scrawled symbols.
</P>
<P>
   He recently removed an extensive collection of hopper anecdotes
from his page, citing ``the prying eyes of the railroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in e-mail, North Bank Fred said ``the Internet is the
perfect way for me to get my `information' out to people who can
benefit from it,'' who he said were ``Net-savvy would-be (or
current) train riders or established riders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention from such a broad-based audience as newspaper
readers can only do harm to freight-hopping _ it has in the past
and I'm sure it will happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mellman, another recreational hopper, has become even more
ambivalent about his Net presence. Although a frequently asked
questions document he penned several years ago on hopping continues
to be linked to widely (http://php.indiana.edu/mellman/trfaq.txt),
he now requires a password to access his main hobo page.
</P>
<P>
   Mellman says he threw a roadblock in front of his site not
because of surveillance but because ``I just started to get worried
that I could end up being responsible for some kid getting his legs
cut off.''

FCC TAKES A HARDER LOOK AT `MICRORADIO' STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For five years, Richard Edmonson snuck the sounds of defiance
from his living room and into his community. As operator of an
unlicensed radio station called San Francisco Liberation Radio, he
wedged his way onto the airwaves, using a vacant frequency to
broadcast 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The programming included news, music and shows like ``Voices of
the Rebellion,'' which focused on homelessness issues, and ``Time
Out,'' a program for children, often with a left-wing political
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   To his hundreds of appreciative listeners, Edmonson has been
Patrick Henry with an FM frequency, but to the Federal
Communications Commission, he is a criminal. In its lexicon, he and
dozens of other operators of unlicensed low-power radio stations
are ``pirates'' who interfere with licensed programming and with
air traffic control frequencies, creating a safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, a crackdown by the FCC has led to the closure
_ often voluntary _ of some 250 unlicensed stations; on Tuesday,
the FCC announced that it seized radio equipment from 15 unlicensed
stations in Miami. Edmonson, fearing the FCC's wrath, shut down his
own station in June, but he has done so with characteristically
defiant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the FCC truly supported free speech, they would be doing
everything in their power to make microradio happen,'' Edmonson,
45, said. ``Instead, they're trying to stamp it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in a new twist in the labored debate over the fate of
tiny community radio stations, the FCC appears to be doing both. It
is at once aggressively pursuing and shutting down microradio
stations, while also exploring for the first time whether it is
possible to license low-power players on the crowded airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes to the heart of how the airwaves are defined in
the United States and who has access to them. Increasingly, the
access belongs to major corporations: since the enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, the radio industry has
consolidated, leaving control of stations in the hands of powerful
media companies.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Kennard, the FCC chairman, said in an interview that
he was deeply troubled by this trend, which he said ``threatens the
diversity of voices'' on the radio dial. ``With consolidation,
radio has become the province of multibillion-dollar
corporations,'' Kennard said. ``The loss of small religious
stations and local programming is very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, the FCC for the first time will consider
licensing radio stations that broadcast below 100 watts of power,
compared with 50,000 watts for typical major radio stations. In a
procedural but symbolic move, the FCC this year asked for public
comment on three petitions calling for licensing of microradio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The public comment and rebuttal period ended July 24, and the
FCC said it received more than 200 comments, which it characterized
as an unusually high amount of feedback. Now, the FCC will evaluate
the remarks and determine whether to put forth a refined proposal
for licensing the stations.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said there was nothing inconsistent in his efforts to
crack down on unlicensed stations and to find room for low-power
stations on the radio dial. He said the matters represented two
separate issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's not some discipline to this process, the spectrum
just won't work,'' he said. ``We can't have pirates just signing
onto frequencies as they choose and broadcasting willy-nilly on the
airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Hiken, a lawyer for Edmonson, said proponents of licensing
microradio had found at least one other reason for optimism: Since
Kennard is the first African-American chairman of the FCC, he may
exert particular effort to increase the falling share of minority
ownership of radio stations. That ownership fell to 2.8 percent in
1997, from 3.1 percent in 1996, according to the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Should Kennard and the FCC ultimately seek to establish
provisions to license microradio, they will face stiff opposition
from the National Association of Broadcasters, a powerful lobbying
group that represents mainstream radio interests.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The association vigorously opposes licensing microradio on the
grounds that it will interfere with existing stations and that it
will be impossible for the FCC to police the stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To interject new stations into an FM band that is already
highly concentrated is just flat wrong,'' said Jeff Baumann, the
association's executive vice president for law. ``We're opposed to
a microradio service, pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters association contends that diversity on the dial
has actually increased in recent years, arguing that consolidation
has given major corporations more resources to expand programming
and to try out new formats.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Baumann said the market should decide _ and is
deciding _ what programming gets on the air, and that the airwaves
should not be open to anyone who happens to have a transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   The mass market, he added, clearly is not interested in the
likes of radio stations like Radio Free Berkeley, Steal This Radio
on the Lower East Side, Black Liberation Radio in Decatur, Ill., or
San Francisco Liberation Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the barrier to entry is low. Start-up costs for
low-powered stations add up to hundreds of dollars, including the
price of a transmitter and basic studio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To open his station in 1993, Edmonson cobbled together the
necessary hardware in the $650-a-month one-bedroom apartment he
shares with his girlfriend and the station co-founder, Jo Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment is now scattered among the other living-room
accouterments: a microphone, a mixer and a compact-disk player sit
on a hand-made wooden table; a chair for guests of the show sits
across the room, near the bicycles and the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonson said the 40-watt signal of his station, located near
the ocean on the west side of San Francisco, traveled at most 10
miles in any direction over the 93.7 frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely gave you a different political slant than you'd
hear on commercial radio or even National Public Radio,'' said Tom
Burghardt, a regular listener. ``The music was good; there were no
commercials. What more could you ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonson said he had 350 listeners at any given time, although
he said he didn't know how many regular listeners tuned in and
could only tick off the names of a handful of die-hards. What's
important, he said, was that he was able to broadcast views from
outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted his frequency did not interfere with other
California stations that shared the station's frequency, including
a station in Sacramento. ``You could barely hear their signal when
we were off the air,'' Edmonson said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonson pulled the station off the air for good on June 17, the
day after a federal judge enjoined another pirate station, Radio
Free Berkeley, from broadcasting. United States District Court
Judge Claudia Wilkins rejected the Berkeley station's argument that
the government had violated its right to free speech by not
permitting it to broadcast without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonson said because his station was so similar to Radio Free
Berkeley, he figured the decision applied equally to him. He has
since turned his makeshift radio station into a writing room,
spending his days penning a book on the struggles of the microradio
movement and his ideas for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds from his living room are pessimistic. ``It's a great
loss for the community,'' he said of his station's closing. ``It
has tragic implications for free speech.''

FOR SALE: POLITICAL MEMORABILIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., W.Va., Ohio)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.)

 By STEVEN R. KNOWLTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At exactly 9:15 p.m., the electronic gates opened. For the next
90 minutes, button collectors from across the country pored over
the latest list of political buttons for sale: $156 for a John W.
Davis (1924), $104 for William McKinley and his 1900 running mate,
Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Lest frenzy swamp reason, all orders sent by e-mail to the
seller, Stephen E. Cresswell, in this first 90 minutes were filled
at random. ``When it was strictly first come, first served, people
were rushing so to get their orders in that they'd miss things, or
order things they didn't really want,'' Cresswell said of the
activity at his site (www.msys.net/cress/list.htm), which sells
hundreds, even thousands, of old political campaign buttons every
month.
</P>
<P>
   The reach and immediacy of the Web are becoming irresistible for
history buffs and collectors of political paraphernalia, even among
those who see impulse as the enemy and whose collections tie them
so tangibly to the past they love.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Windisch, one of the nearly 50 collectors who placed an
order, was rewarded with an enameled brass Benjamin Harris item
from 1888. A research chemist in Richland, Wash., Windisch happened
onto Creswell's List two years ago, when he was looking to put
together a collection to pass along to his son, Tommy, then 2.
</P>
<P>
   Cresswell's sales are popular among academics and other
professionals, perhaps because of his job as a history professor at
West Virginia Wesleyan College near his home in Buckhannon, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   His monthly sales list is sprinkled with descriptions that show
his passion, like this one: ``Though the price is not high, I
believe this is one of the most important pieces of history ever
offered on Cresswell's List. From Bleeding Kansas of the 1850s
comes this rare paper ballot ... $36.'' It sold the first night.
</P>
<P>
   Windisch is trying to keep his collection modest. He is forgoing
the popular (and expensive) buttons called jugates (pronounced
JOO-gits), which feature two candidates' pictures and can run into
five figures. Instead, Windisch is going after buttons with names,
not pictures, and wants to accumulate the major candidates for
president going back as far as he can without breaking the bank.
</P>
<P>
   That will probably mean to 1840, when the candidate William
Henry Harrison waged the first media campaign. In the absence of
even newspaper photographs, a favorite medium was the brass lapel
pin touting the hero of the Tippecanoe Indian battle and his
running mate, John Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Brass tokens from that campaign were stamped in huge numbers and
can be found today for around $20.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites have different personalities. Among the most popular
is EBay (at pages.ebay.com/aw, click on Collectibles, then
Political), where several hundred dealers and individuals have
auctions going at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran buyers caution neophytes that EBay can be addictive.
Closings are timed to the minute and as electronic bids pour in, an
auction is something like speed chess: a thrill for true believers,
an oxymoron for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But button collecting is still mostly an in-person or mail-order
operation. One of the biggest still-mostly-by-mail auction sites is
run by Allan Anderson in Troy, Ohio. Anderson maintains a Web page
(www.erinet.com/aaauctn) to announce his auctions and sell a few
items but said the great bulk of his business comes from his
quarterly printed catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like to beef up his Web site to show current
high bids from auctions in progress, but that will have to wait.
His Webmaster goes off to college this fall.

IN CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRATIC ANGST OVER CLINTON'S INFIDELITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Saddened. Embarrassed. Disappointed. That's how
Democratic leaders in California described their reactions to
President Clinton's admission of adultery and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   With the November elections approaching, political analysts say
the party should add another adjective: Worried.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the state acknowledge much is at stake in the Nov.
3 general election: several shaky congressional seats, Sen. Barbara
Boxer's job and their first good shot at the governor's office
after 16 years of Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   Long billed as the party's ``No. 1 asset,'' Clinton has raised
millions of dollars for Democrats in California. Now, party
candidates may find themselves tied to a president whose
credibility is under fire by members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a severely weakened president,'' said David Kirp,
professor and former dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``That makes it harder
for him to make one of his hourly stops in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public admission Monday night has put House Democrats
in the tough position of condemning his actions while trying to
avoid undermining his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic candidates said the scandal might have bruised
the president, but had done little to hurt their own bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone was disappointed in the president or turned off by
that, which they would have every reason to be, why would the
president's conduct wash over me?'' said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be any fallout in this district,''
said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco
area. ``I've been impressed with the wisdom of people in the Bay
Area who want to accept the president's admission and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, strategist for the California Democratic Party,
said Clinton remained the party's top asset, and that candidates
would continue to seek his help in raising money.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican political consultants said the president's
televised admission had already cut into his popularity in parts of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton may be seen in San Francisco and West Los Angeles, the
liberal strongholds ... but I'll bet 10 bucks (the party) won't
send him to Stockton or through the Central Valley,'' said GOP
consultant Allen Hoffenblum.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans in Congress have called for Clinton's
resignation or impeachment, but more are withholding judgment until
the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, sends his report
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republican political analyst Tony Quinn said the scandal wasn't
likely to unseat incumbent House members in safe Democratic
districts. But in more marginal areas, where voter registration is
split, Clinton's troubles could help GOP candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These districts are more middle-of-the-road, more
middle-class,'' Quinn said. ``I don't think voters there will be as
forgiving of lying and things that go along with it, like
obstruction of justice or the hiding of Monica Lewinsky's gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders see two seats, in particular, as up for
grabs: one vacated by retiring Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio, the other
left open by Rep. Jane Harman, who gave up the seat for her
unsuccessful bid to win the Democratic nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio's district in Sacramento is a battleground between two
little-known politicians: Democratic attorney Sandra Dunn and
Republican businessman Doug Ose. Ose hasn't made an issue of the
charges against Clinton, but supporters say the scandal would help
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton does get impeached, that would really demoralize
Democratic voters and make them less likely to turn out,'' said
Peter DeMarco, Ose's press secretary. ``If Clinton isn't impeached,
it would really get Republican voters upset, and that would
increase voter turnout. It's a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The great fear for Democrats is that the public's disgust with
the scandal could drive down voter turnout. Democratic voters
traditionally are less likely to vote on Election Day, and a low
turnout could sink some candidates.

<P>
   Republicans see Boxer as particularly vulnerable if Clinton's
support drops. She has close ties to Clinton, often supports the
administration in Senate votes, and her daughter, Nicole, is
married to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Anthony
Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Boxer's opponent, Republican Matt Fong, went on
the attack Tuesday, questioning the senator's moral standards in
accepting funds raised by a president who had admitted lying to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you Matt Fong would not be comfortable with someone
who lied to the American public coming out to raise money for
him,'' said Steve Schmidt, Fong's press secretary. ``We hope
Barbara Boxer has the same high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer spokesman Roy Behr said Fong's attack was likely to
backfire with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer will talk about issues like education, safe
neighborhoods, economic growth,'' Behr said. ``Matt Fong will
apparently be talking about sex scandals. That's a contrast that
will obviously work in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Helen Grieco, president of the National Organization for
Women in California, said Boxer and other candidates should shun
Clinton for his deceit and his treatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Boxer use Clinton in a fund-raiser? If I were her
strategist, I would say no,'' Grieco said. ``The president has
shown he lacks moral character. I think as a politician, it's very
important to demonstrate that you know how to pick your friends.''

GETTING THEIR CLASS-ACT TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picture it. The year is 1965, and Mom has taken
you shopping for your annual back-to-school wardrobe. It's no easy
task, what with all those strict dress-code rules issued by the Los
Angeles Unifed School District.
</P>
<P>
   You know, skirts that had to be long enough to brush the floor
when a girl got down on her knees (a typical test routinely
conducted by surly vice principals). And everybody who was anybody
had to have pricey dyed-to-match skirts and sweaters ... and a
purse to match every outfit.
</P>
<P>
   And guys? Let's put it this way: They were wearing the corporate
version of casual Friday, long before IBM and Boeing discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   Sneakers? They were reserved for P.E. class only.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, school dress codes are more relaxed now. Class acts
are also more unisex than in recent years, making shopping a
no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Just leave all the heavy metal at home so you can pass through
the metal detector at the school entrance _ and make sure your
pants stay up without a belt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the big trend was khaki, and while it's still in,
denim is the fabric of choice for fall '98. ``It's always been
popular, but it's experiencing a major resurgence ... and being
reinterpreted in endless styles and finishes,'' says OshKosh
spokeswoman Barbara Widder-Lowry. Like other retail experts, she
reports over-dyed indigo blue as the denim of choice this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sears fashion director Fran Yoshioka says you'll see the new
denim looking best in jeans that ride lower and flare wider _ as
wide as 30 inches in circumference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-expression is the key,'' explains Yoshioka, adding that
children tend to dress themselves with reference points from their
lives, including pop-culture icons and favorite pastimes such as
skateboarding. So that's why you'll see more athletic looks, such
as hooded tops, snap pants and outer seam striping on boy and girl
members of the in-crowd. Honest, it's true. According to the Teen
Caravan Survey for T.J. Maxx stores, 87 percent of girls age 12 to
17, preferred pants to skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Sweaters are the big news on campus, report fashion experts from
numerous retail stores, including J.C. Penney, which reports
cardigans and matching shells are its current best sellers for
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that classic twinset, look for traditional argyle
designs (especially pullover vests), V-neck pullovers, knit tank
tops and cable-knit cardigans topped with fake fur collars. A
survey of local malls showed them with horizontal stripes, fuzzy
``eyelash'' yarns, graduated color yarns and embroidered and beaded
floral designs circa 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Guys also are wearing sweaters, including short-sleeved knit
shirt-jacs, athletic striped pullovers and baggy turtlenecks that
have a relaxed, slapdash 'tude.
</P>
<P>
   Juniors, that fickle category of young female teens, are
reportedly the hardest to please. According to the American Express
Retail Index on back-to-school shopping, the average American
family will spend $408 per teen ($300 on younger children), an
amount that is ballooning because this age group is ultra
label-conscious and wants something new every week.
</P>
<P>
   When a teen-age girl says ``new,'' she may mean alternative
fashions such as gothic-inspired ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' tops
(available at Warner Bros. stores), jeans by designers Lucky or
Angel (try major department stores), and slinky skirts and clingy
tops sporting labels such as Porn Star, Girl Star and 26 red. If
she's going to dress up, she'll probably shop for something with
lace or feather trim, and the labels to look for are X0X0, Rampage
and Mica, all of which can be found in the junior department of
most department stores and teen boutiques. An old brand parents may
remember is Esprit, which has bounced back into style, offering a
variety of wrap-front and clingy dresses to wear when one's jeans
are in the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   But most teens _ at least 58 percent _ according to that same
American Express report, prefer high-profile names advertised in
fashion magazines. The nation's faves among boys and girls, reports
American Express, are (in order of popularity) Tommy Hilfiger (the
Izod of the '80s), Levi's, the Gap, Polo by Ralph Lauren and Calvin
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Uniforms have become a popular choice at both public and private
schools, and shopping for those kids has never been easier. In
previous years, parents had to order uniforms from a catalog, but
now they're available at most stores, including Wal-Mart, Kmart,
Mervyn's, Sears, Macy's and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The basics are tan or navy, with skirts, pants, long shorts and
jumpers worn with white blouses or cotton knit polo shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are the same, whether the child is wearing a uniform or
not. The operative word is chunky, in oxfords and loafers for both
boys and girls. But the sneaker, with retro detailing (such as
stripes), is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories are important, but thankfully (for the
budget-conscious) not as plentiful as last fall. Girls are wearing
patterned socks and tights, and hair clips with tiny crystals or
butterflies, and everybody's strapping on sports watches with all
the bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacks continue to be the book bag of choice, but novelty
totes such as Hello Kitty's hatbox design are newer. And instead of
brown bags, the fresh take on lunchboxes is a zippered soft vinyl
insulated box, hopefully in bright colors with a cartoon character
on the front, to hold bottled water, juice boxes and turkey wraps
or pita pocket sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   That school wardrobe budget also needs to stretch to the locker.
Now a personal space instead of merely a place to stash books
between classes, there are entire aisles at mass merchandising
stores dedicated to locker accessories. Among the hot tickets are
shelves to fit inside the locker, magnetic mirrors, magnets for
messages, magnetic bulletin boards and removable paper to cover the
utilitarian beige or gray walls.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, parents may be thinking how they were thrilled to
get a new notebook and a box of crayons, but don't go there.
Remember how you hated it when your parents told you about the five
or 10 miles they walked to school through sleet and snow and how
they had to write in pencil because Bic and Pentel gizmos hadn't
been invented yet?

PROPRIETY AND PASSION IN VICTORIAN BRITAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some early reviews of ``The Governess'' have called the film
stiff and dull; others have called it one of the better movies of
the year. Watching the film, one gets the sense that the first
group of critics stopped paying attention after the first hour,
about the time the second group started.
</P>
<P>
   The movie changes from a ``Masterpiece Theatre''-style
ponderousness to erotically charged melodrama at the midway point,
as if someone had flipped a switch. But the latter half is done
with enough grace and delicacy to keep it from looking like some
pretentious late-night cable entry (you know, like this spring's
``Dangerous Beauty'').
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first movie to take advantage of Minnie Driver's
unique beauty, and the first since ``Circle of Friends'' that her
acting skills have been fully exploited. Since ``Circle,'' she has
frequently been relegated to understanding/long-suffering
girlfriend roles, as in last year's ``Good Will Hunting.'' She
received an Oscar nomination for that, but she gives a better
performance here.
</P>
<P>
   Driver plays Rosina Da Silva, the oldest daughter in a Sephardic
Jewish family in 1840s London. When her father dies, leaving her
family deep in debt, she adopts the name Mary Blackchurch and hides
her Jewish background to take work as a governess for a Catholic
family in Scotland. When she enters the home of the Cavendishes,
you might think she has walked into a road company of ``Rebecca:''
the servants don't trust her, the mother is coldly formal, and the
little girl in her care is a demon child. It doesn't take
Rosina/Mary long to let the little girl know who is boss, though.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary has a harder time controlling the men of the house _
and her own libido. Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson) is conducting
early experiments in photography, and they intrigue Mary enough
that she starts working with him. Those scenes are a little
heavy-handed _ they almost have a ``Let's put on a photo show!''
quality _ but they lead to an inevitable romance, and the movie
picks up then. Writer-director Sandra Goldbacher makes up for the
predictability of the affair by taking it to unexpected depths,
especially after the movie's slow-moving first half.
</P>
<P>
   When the affair starts, it's as if the movie is achieving its
own sexual release, but Goldbacher doesn't coil the early scenes
tightly enough to make the release entirely satisfying. Driver,
however, shows a fearlessness she has not before demonstrated as an
actress, finding new layers in what becomes an obsessive passion.
Wilkinson is her match, in what can only be called a Jeremy
Irons-ish role after Irons' work in ``Damage'' and ``Lolita.'' If
they occasionally get a little histrionic, blame it on Goldbacher,
who not only doesn't rein them in, but appears to be egging them
on. Things only get more extreme when the Cavendishes' prodigal son
Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) shows up and falls for Mary.
</P>
<P>
   In her first film, Goldbacher shows a lot of confidence, which
makes the flaws all the more aggravating. She appears to be
interested in the differences and similarities between Jews and
Catholics in early Victorian England, but she oversimplifies them
radically.
</P>
<P>
   For all its problems, ``The Governess'' has much merit, thanks
largely to the performances but also to Goldbacher's feel for
atmosphere. She uses music and colors well, with a haunting Middle
Eastern-influenced soundtrack and striking blacks and reds. Her
screenplay may occasionally be forced, but its novelistic qualities
are impressive, especially for a first feature. It's an ambitious
movie, and it will be interesting to see what happens if Goldbacher
learns from her mistakes.

THE PRESIDENCY WILL SURVIVE REGARDLESS OF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This summer the most compelling drama in movie
theaters is ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's
excruciating depiction of death on the bloody beaches of Normandy,
while the most compelling drama on the political stage is ``Saving
Bill Clinton,'' the embarrassing saga of sex and the president's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, Ryan survives the brutality of World War II. On
the national scene, Clinton's fate remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The link between these events is the fact that they cast new
perspectives on institutions that have protected liberty and
sustained the republic since its birth _ war and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Spielberg film offers the most graphic and honest
re-creation of the horror of the World War II Normandy invasion
ever shown in a professional movie. The Clinton drama is less
graphic, less honest and, therefore, less persuasive than the tale
of a squad of soldiers trying to find and protect a private whose
three brothers already have been killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Spielberg replaced the glory of war with the gore of
war, Clinton simply sought, in his brief televised address to the
nation after his grand jury testimony last week, to gloss over
incredibly irresponsible actions _ first the sexual encounters with
Monica Lewinsky and then, for seven months, his public denial of
those encounters. He conceded that he had misled the people and his
wife, but he did not really apologize for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   His confession failed to answer key questions about his conduct
and his veracity. And, in a self-serving move, Clinton sought to
blame Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for an investigation that
``has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's contention that Starr's probe now must end sounded
like an echo of Richard Nixon's repeated refrain at the beginning
of 1974 that ``one year of Watergate is enough.'' Investigators
refused to bow to Nixon's plea for an end to the inquiry, and seven
months later he forced to resign the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Clinton did nor reach further back into history and
attempt to picture his labrador retriever Buddy as a reincarnation
of the ``little dog Checkers'' that Nixon described so emotionally
in a 1952 TV appearance. Then, he was defending the fact that
wealthy Californians were providing funds to help sustain him in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There may be ample reason to criticize Starr's investigation,
but Clinton's stonewalling is to blame for much of the length of
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   His confession was far from a total loss, however. Interviews
with people around the nation indicated that a majority of
Americans continue to approve his handling of the presidency
despite the reckless manner in which he conducts his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no matter what happens to Clinton between now and Jan. 20,
2001, the presidency will remain a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, it has survived crisis after crisis. It
was not destroyed by the forced resignation of Richard Nixon, the
assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, the
departure from the White House of Theodore Roosevelt or the death
in wartime of his distant cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson steered the nation safely through the days of
tragedy following Kennedy's death. Gerald Ford accomplished a
similar feat after Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But as an institution, the presidency is stronger than anyone
who occupies the post. Turbulent events or weak and duplicitous
leaders can diminish its authority but only for a brief period. The
right person coming to office at the right time can breathe new
life into the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After the bitter, often violent, division over Vietnam that led
Johnson to reject a bid for reelection in 1968, the Watergate
scandal that forced Nixon's resignation and the Iran hostage crisis
that magnified Jimmy Carter's ineptitude, the presidency was in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some learned Americans wrote books and articles suggesting that
the time had come to reform the office and possibly divide up its
authority. The thinking was that the world was too big and complex
for one person to handle such an all-encompassing post.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronald Reagan sauntered into the White House and
demonstrated that the presidency was as strong and vibrant as it
ever had been. He did so by communicating brilliantly with the
people, exuding self-confidence, enunciating a limited policy
agenda that he could implement and standing firm against the ``evil
empire'' of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Iran-contra scandal of the late 1980s, which led to
critics to suggest his impeachment, failed to diminish Reagan's
standing with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Clinton's presidency is that he had a grand
opportunity to lead a prosperous and peaceful nation triumphantly
into the 21st century. Now that opportunity has faded. Many people
who once trusted him no longer feel they can.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might learn from his friend Spielberg that there is
profit in honesty. With the passage of time, World War II _ the
seminal event of the 20th century _ has become wreathed in
nostalgia that is stripped away in Spielberg's film.
</P>
<P>
   The president also could learn something from the 19th century
French writer Henri-Frederic Amiel: ``Truth is the secret of
eloquence and of virtue, the basis of moral authority; it is the
highest summit of art and of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a good Democrat, Clinton just might ponder some words
uttered in 1932 by Franklin D. Roosevelt: ``The presidency is ...
preeminently the place of moral leadership.''

   Wondering if you'll get that new job? Meet that special someone?
See the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Super Bowl? Every day, legions
of seekers take their questions, however mundane, to legions of
psychics: on the street, on the phone, on the tube, and,
increasingly, online.
</P>
<P>
   Sammye Souder of Raleigh, N.C., who works as the psychic
``Sammye'' online, had been practicing for years off line when a
friend suggested she see clients over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of her primary marketing tools is a site through America
Online. Like most Web psychics, she offers traditional phone
appointments, plus personal e-mail readings (not to mention selling
her homemade barbecue sauce, ``Sammye's Sumptuous Sauce'').
Customers fill out an online form with their credit-card numbers,
birth dates and questions. Sammye responds in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   A true clairvoyant need not perform a session in person, she
said in an interview. ``I have the capacity to tune in to people
when they send me e-mail,'' she said. ``Their message has their
energy because they sent it; I can pick that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Anderson, another online psychic, says she believes
e-mail or online chat can interest clients who might not ordinarily
seek out psychic guidance. ``The Web does not have the same warmth
as a personal meeting,'' she said, ``but it offers anonymity to
someone who might be concerned about a serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Anderson's clients, Zachary Stuart, a New York actor,
said not all Web psychics are created equal. While he said he's
satisfied with Ms. Anderson, ``I had a couple experiences online
that were really quite the joke,'' he said in an e-mail message.
``The connection the psychic made with me and the things I was told
had absolutely nothing to do with who I was whatsoever. It was
humorous how `wrong' my first couple readings were. It seemed so
very generic I requested refunds.''
</P>
<P>
   Exchanging metaphysical energy over the wires isn't cheap. The
Psychic Internet charges customers by the word length of the
psychic's reply: $35 for what's called a ``quick hit'' reading of
200 words to $175 for an 1,800-word ``e-mail comprehensive.'' One
customer wanted to find a job in biotechnology sales. According to
the tarot cards' answer, part of the Psychic Internet site, the job
seeker was talented but suffered from a Type A personality and
needed therapy. (This customer is in luck: There are plenty of
online therapists.)
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has to pay for a premonition. Many free sites are
harnessing the power of age-old and new-age oracles. Ouija boards
abound on the World Wide Web Ouija; players rest their fingers on
the mouse, telepathically sliding the cursor over the letter board
on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 the World Wide Web I Ching has brought the ancient
Chinese ``Book of Changes'' into the digital era. To simulate the
throwing of the three yarrow sticks, surfers type in a question and
then click a button on screen. The resulting hexagram reading is
revealed with a traditional explanation under each heading.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gamson, an avid I Ching user, likes the immediacy of the
online version. But it doesn't quite evoke the mystical experience
he conjures off line, which includes candles and incense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process leading up to receiving an oracle is as important
as the oracle itself,'' he said. ``It is a period of clearing the
mind similar to meditation. You simply can't get that by watching
the Web browser load the next page.'' Also, he noted, ``It's
essentially just a random number generator.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, random generator programs, which spit out responses
each time a button is clicked, inform a sublegion of psykitsch
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens emulate the erstwhile Magic 8 Ball. The creator of Kurt
Cobain's Magic 8 Ball promises that the Punk Poet of Grunge is
standing by on the other side, ready to help you tackle the big
questions. Visitors type in queries and then click on Kurt for a
response. Using random sound files from old Nirvana interviews, the
site answers with casual obliqueness: ``Yes, no, maybe so, kind of,
sort of.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how dependable are online psychics? When asked, a pudgy
automated psychic called The Dack Head had this to say: ``Could you
rephrase the question in a way that would make me care?''
</P>

 By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. every Sunday, Stephen Negron receives a telephone
call from a person in distress. Roger Garvin was interrupted by a
caller during his 49th birthday party, and was on the phone for an
hour. Jim Mulcahy got his own party interruption during a St.
Patrick's Day bash, a call that kept him away from the beer and his
friends for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   These men are not volunteer firemen or suicide help-line
workers. They are computer tutors, or computer doctors, or geeks,
or just plain nerds _ the people whose job it is to help other
people figure out their computers. And when their clients and their
clients' computers are on the brink of a breakdown, these tutors
jump to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   When they started their businesses, phone calls outside of
business hours were not in the game plan. Experts in machinery that
no one else seemed to understand, their business mission was
simple: to help those whom they fondly refer to as ``normal
people'' or the ``technically challenged'' learn how to use their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   That mission has changed along with their roles. Tutors have
become nursemaids, confidants, friends. They are like psychiatrists
who make house calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing guys will tell you that the computer does
everything and you have to know nothing to do it,'' said Garvin,
owner of Results Technologies, a computer consulting business in
Brea, Calif., near Los Angeles. ``That's drivel. That's like
tossing the car keys to a 16-year-old and telling him to go have
fun. Cars are simple, but you need to learn how to use them.''
Personal computers are now in 42 percent of American homes,
according to Odyssey, a market research company based in San
Francisco, and the need for people who can teach their owners how
to run them is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Computer tutoring is an unregulated industry. Anyone who knows
one program better than another can call himself or herself a tutor
and charge $50 to $100 an hour for his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Wild West out there,'' said Negron, who left full-time
computer consulting for a permanent job at ABC Inc. as a programmer
and analyst because, he said, there were too many unqualified
people calling themselves tutors. ``They were pests making a lot of
messes.'' Now he tutors part time.
</P>
<P>
   The people who hire computer tutors are often small-business
owners who may or may not be home-based; neophytes who want to use
a computer for household tasks and hobbies, or people who are
making upgrades _ say, from Windows 3.1 to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Some are switching from a Macintosh to a PC or vice versa. They
range in age from children to senior citizens. Many are new to
computing and want to use their machines to get onto the Internet
and send e-mail. Except for the kids, most are scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very frightened of my first computer,'' said Martha P.
Nochimson, a former soap opera writer who now is an author and
professor at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. ``It was like when
you had your first baby and the slightest little thing happened and
you'd become totally unhinged.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nochimson bought her first computer at the urging of a
technologically adept colleague. She called him so often with
questions, he started dodging her calls, and she said she realized
she needed to develop a little self-sufficiency. Then she found
Negron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of what we do is to work ourselves out of a job,''
Negron said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching clients how to run their computers is only part of what
these consultants do. Some advise on computer purchases, even
accompanying clients on shopping trips. They set up the computers,
recommend software, provide the training and offer support, solving
inevitable glitches that flare up to torment their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the help desk for people who don't work for a
corporation,'' said Mulcahy, a tutor in Bronxville, N.Y., who
traverses the metropolitan area in a black '92 Acura Integra
emblazoned with the logo of his company, Computer Tutor (AT) PCI.
</P>
<P>
   While most tutors prefer to get involved with their clients
right when they buy a computer, many jump in only after hardware
mistakes have already been made.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sorby, owner of Sorby Contracting in Briarcliff Manor,
N.Y., bought a computer for his business and called Mulcahy to set
it up. Once Mulcahy checked out the goods, he told Sorby that he
had bought the wrong computer for the job, which included running
engineering software.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they returned the machine and bought another. Sorby
even saved some money. He still had to learn how to run the
computer, though. Mulcahy took care of that, too.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most computer tutors say that teaching people how to use a
computer offers them the greatest satisfaction. There are a few
caveats: this is true primarily if the student is willing to spend
time outside of ``class'' to work on his computing skills. The mix
of student and teacher must also be right. Some trainers cannot
adjust their techie language to basic English.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, tutors say that lesson one is often helping
students overcome their fear. ``If they're in a mind-set where the
computer is going to give them grief, people freak out,'' Garvin
said. ``You have to be a counselor to find out why and then move on
to the training.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the silly questions start. A client of Mulcahy's called him
in a panic one evening because his computer wouldn't boot up. He
instructed the client to remove the diskette from his floppy drive
and press any key to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The man started screaming that he couldn't find the ``any'' key.
Mulcahy calmly told him it was next to the ``something'' key. The
man finally relaxed. Problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   Many times problems are not so easily fixed, of course,
especially when files or programs disappear. Then computer tutors
arrive like white knights to rescue the files. If they cannot fix
the problem, they will know where to go for help: manufacturers'
help lines, the Internet or books.
</P>
<P>
   Mulcahy even calls the help lines for clients himself, sparing
them the torture of listening to recorded music for minutes on end
and the confusion of speaking to a technician whom they might not
understand.
</P>
<P>
   At times, there are problems even tutors cannot solve _ when the
computer actually breaks, for example, as Ms. Nochimson's did when
she was facing a deadline. Negron lent her a laptop computer to
help her out of her jam. ``I didn't ask him for it,'' she said.
``It was very princely. He's like a merry little conductor on the
choo-choo of computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Before hiring a computer tutor, ask yourself what you want him
or her to do for you. Computer tutors, unlike software trainers who
are expert in one program, offer a range of services to their
clients, from buying the hardware to providing phone support when
the computer crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is unregulated, so interview prospective tutors and
check their references before your first session. Then, find out if
the tutor meets this criteria: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOWS THE HARDWARE Many tutors will help clients buy their
computers, add hardware or decide what kind of phone lines they
need. Some will even go to the computer store or take part in
conference calls to help clients buy hardware over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   KNOWS SOFTWARE AND HOW TO USE IT Trainers have their favorite
programs but should know which software is most appropriate for
each user and teach you how to use it. Many will also recommend
Internet providers and an e-mail system and train on that, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKS YOUR LANGUAGE Tutors should be able to make technology
plain, not intimidating and confusing. Often, they recommend
reference books.
</P>
<P>
   HAS OUTSIDE RESOURCES Despite the white knight syndrome, tutors
don't know everything. A good one will know where to find the
answers. If you present a tutor with a problem he or she cannot
solve, don't expect to be charged for the time it takes to find the
solution. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few other hints: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXPECT TO PAY $50 to $100 AN HOUR Many tutors require you agree
to a minimum number of hours before they starting consulting work.
Beware of the tutor offering a deal.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERSTAND THE PHONE-TIME POLICY Emergency phone help, even for
the silliest question, is an integral part of the tutoring
experience and tutors expect these calls. If calls can be
dispatched in five minutes, there is usually no charge. After that,
the clock generally goes on.
</P>
<P>
   BEWARE OF THE HELPFUL FRIEND who fiddles with your computer to
help you fix something, and then disappears. Your files could
vanish, too _ along with the friendship. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tutors, beloved by clients, are not so generous when describing
their clients. Here are some of their pet peeves:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clients who don't practice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clients who just want it fixed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clients who refuse to upgrade their computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clients who keep upgrading when they don't need to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clients who tinker when they don't know what they are doing,
and can't remember what they did.

COMPILING YOUR `GREATEST HITS' ON DISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every music collection has one _ the hourlong compact disk
acquired solely for the sake of a three-minute song. The bait might
have been a popular single that sizzled on a summer movie
soundtrack or a nostalgia-inspiring hit that gleamed in the middle
of a golden-oldies collection, but many listeners are lured into
sinking $15 on an unfamiliar album after catching one hook-laden
tune on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   For Philip David Morgan, an insurance-rate assessor in Saint
James, N.Y., the culprit was ``Save Our Souls,'' by the
singer-songwriter Happy Rhodes, which he first heard on a local FM
station. Although he has since become a fan of Ms. Rhodes' music,
Morgan acknowledged that the decision to buy her 14-track disk
``The Keep'' for that one song ``isn't exactly what I'd call
swift.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, 36, subsequently discovered a better way. Through custom
CD Web sites, he assembles full-length disks composed of individual
tracks that appeal to him. So far, he has obtained four of these
made-to-order compilations, including one he dubbed ``The Beggars'
Ball.'' It is a mix of reggae, '60s-era pop and alternative rock,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at custom-CD sites said the manufacturing process may
occur within seconds of an order being received and that a
70-minute disk can be ``burned'' in less than 20 minutes; buyers
must still wait several days for their order to be delivered via
the mail. Some sites also permit customers to pick out cover art
and, if the CD is intended as a gift, to write personal liner notes
that will be laser-printed on the sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a custom disk is slightly more expensive than buying a
new release. Each song costs about $1, and the bill for the
finished product ranges from $18 to $25. The price is a bargain,
though, compared with what it would take to purchase the source
CD's separately.
</P>
<P>
   Custom-CD services began to emerge on the Web last fall, and
there are now at least nine of them. (K-Tel International plans to
start a similar service this month.) The growth of such sites has
been stunted by the major record labels, reluctant to cannibalize
sales by licensing their hit-saturated catalogs to the custom
sites. As a result, the sites tend to be stocked with loads of
moldy oldies and a slew of jazz, blues and reggae tracks from
independent labels.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing restrictions pose further difficulties. On the
Musicmaker.com site, songs from the Fantasy Records catalog cannot
be mixed with another label's. At Customdisc.com, selecting more
than three cuts by certain artists is forbidden. Performers without
major-label record deals are less constrained by these limitations,
and several sites exploit this by focusing on up-and-coming artists
signed to independent labels.
</P>
<P>
   Although site executives tout custom CD's as a convenient
alternative to making audio cassette compilations, be prepared to
spend a significant amount of time at the task. Even with a
reasonably fast Internet connection, searching through thousands of
tracks can be a chore, especially when one encounters six
renditions of ``Some Other Time'' by Bill Evans on the
Musicmaker.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tracks are picked, sequencing them sensibly is next.
Morgan ponders tempo, tone and key signature when arranging his
disks, and conceded that it may take him two or three visits to
build a disk to his liking. ``Sometimes it still ends up wild,'' he
said. Despite this, he is considering making a jazz-themed CD as an
anniversary present for his sister and brother-in-law. Please, try
not to spoil the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Large Roster Of Jazz Giants: WWW.MUSICMAKER.COM
</P>
<P>
   The Music Connection Corp. was founded by record industry
executives who used their knowledge to amass on the Musicmaker.com
site one of the largest rosters of high-quality titles that can be
had from a custom-CD service. Because the company's first deal was
with the esteemed Fantasy Records label, the 100,000 songs on the
site include gems by jazz giants like Miles Davis, John Coltrane,
Wes Montgomery and Thelonious Monk. Bruce Block, vice president of
business development for the Reston, Va., company, said he expected
to have one million songs licensed to the service by year-end,
although it might take some months to load them on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing limitations prohibit mixing Fantasy tracks with
material from other labels, so it is not possible to construct a
greatest-hits disk by the blues great John Lee Hooker that combines
cuts drawn from different labels. The restriction on Creedence
Clearwater Revival _ the band's tracks can't be mixed with any
other performers' _ is even more vexing, but frustration may fade
with the realization that one could easily make three full disks
composed of different versions of the Monk classic `` 'Round
Midnight'' performed by top Fantasy artists like Sonny Rollins and
Freddie Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the Monk title is listed throughout the site as ``
'Round About Midnight,'' a reminder that search operations are only
as good as the database being scoured. Fortunately,
Musicmaker.com's is one of the better ones, frequently supplying
track-personnel, songwriting-credit and album-source information
that can clarify results. It would be helpful, though, if searches
also scanned the entries for supporting players, especially on jazz
titles on which the accompanists can be as important as the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While the bland, frame-heavy site is unlikely to win any
graphic-design awards, Musicmaker.com has some nifty features that
some of the competing services have yet to duplicate. For example,
tracks can be rearranged numerically instead of repositioned by
using up-down arrows to move each song one notch at a time. An
on-screen button will start the audio-preview function and play all
of an artist's song excerpts in sequence. Having trouble filling a
disk? A program will supply suggestions based on the preferences of
like-minded visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Disks from Musicmaker.com cost $9.95 for the first five songs,
and CD's can contain up to 20 cuts or 70 minutes. Additional songs
are $1, and any track longer than 5 minutes costs 20 cents for each
extra minute _ a penalty assessed on lengthy jazz tracks. A
collection of 15 instrumentals by the bluegrass guitar virtuoso
Tony Rice cost $22.66, including $2.95 for shipping and handling.

   Cutting-Edge Dance Music For the Club-Going Crowd:
WWW.CDUCTIVE.COM
</P>
<P>
   This site, whose name is pronounced ``seductive,'' is for anyone
interested in contemporary dance music. Taking a niche approach,
Group K Inc., in New York, has installed 5,000 tracks from the
electronica genre on its sleek site, including cuts by such
standard-bearers as Roni Size, Goldie and Howie B.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who do not intend to spend a dime may enjoy exploring
the site, which is subdivided into a dozen categories with exotic
names like ``illbient'' and ``trip-hop/leftfield.'' Generous
45-second song samples for tracks by Funki Porcini, Yerbouti and
others give a good sense of the flavor of each tune, and the site
is regularly refreshed with hot titles _ a necessity for a genre in
which hits are often short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The site's founders, Alan Manuel, John Rigos and Thomas Ryan,
met while attending business school outside Paris in 1996. An
entrepreneurism class sparked Manuel to propose forming a custom-CD
business. With planning sessions taking place in the Rex Club, a
leading techno-music venue in Paris, the focus on electronic dance
music seemed obvious. The trio set up shop in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said: ``The guy behind the counter at a specialty deejay
shop expects you to know the most minute details about the most
obscure label in Iceland before he'll give you the time of day.
There's really no good way for you to get to know this music unless
you have a friend who's into it. We decided there must be a lot of
people who feel left out by this system.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so. Since the site went up in December, sales have
doubled every month, Ryan said. He is the partnership's music
expert, spending hours in the dance club Twilo in Manhattan and the
deejay-oriented shop Temple Records in the East Village to scout
out the trendiest new material. Cductive also is scheduled to
introduce a new area devoted to independent rock music next month.
</P>
<P>
   Disks from Cductive can be up to 72 minutes long. They cost
$4.99 for the first song and 99 cents for each additional, but
tracks taken from the company's promotional samplers are free,
which can help hold down the cost. A 15-cut collection of acid-jazz
and big-beat titles cost $18.87, including $2.99 for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   All the disks ordered for this article sounded good, but most
relied on vintage material. Only the Cductive disk, with its
cutting-edge ambiance and booming bass beats, managed to knock the
socks off this listener's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Oldies, With a Few Detours: WWW.CUSTOMDISC.COM
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when David Gould was courting the woman who would
become his wife, the couple spent evenings in his Gramercy Park
apartment listening to ``Love Train'' by the O'Jays and other songs
from his huge collection of vinyl records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me during one of these sessions that if we
could put this experience onto a CD, that would be a great
business,'' Gould recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after a bad round of golf, he suggested the
custom-disk idea to his Harvard Business School classmate Nicolas
Darveau-Garneau, who immediately envisioned it as a Web-based
venture. After graduating, the two set up shop as Custom
Revolutions Inc. in the basement of their Upper West Side apartment
(their offices have since moved to Connecticut) and opened
Customdisc.com in March.
</P>
<P>
   The company has licensed about 165,000 songs. Half of them have
been posted on the site, which has just been updated with a crisp
new graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks are all over the map, from 3,500 chart-topping
singles like ``Love Train'' to a poem read by the author Ursula Le
Guin. There is a decent selection of classical entries, and more
contemporary songs by the Pharcyde, Brand New Heavies, Tone Loc and
Suicidal Tendencies are due to be added soon.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still ironing out a few bugs as it upgrades the
site, so search-error messages like ``Page 7 of 3'' that occurred
with Netscape's browser should end soon.
</P>
<P>
   More disconcerting, though, is the site's approach to
alphabetizing performers by their first names, so that Martha
Reeves is listed under the M's instead of the R's.
</P>
<P>
   And if you search by song title, be sure to start with the T's,
where you will find ``The Lady Is a Tramp,'' ``The Great
Pretender'' and all the other songs that begin with ``The.'' The
multiple movements of symphonic works are not always clearly
marked, and some sleuthing may be required to determine the
composer.
</P>
<P>
   Customdisc.com charges $5.99 to start building a 70-minute CD of
up to 25 songs, with most costing 99 cents. Licensing limitations
prevented me from assembling a CD with more than three cuts by the
singer-songwriter David Wilcox, but I did manage to construct a
25-track oldies CD while maintaining the reassuring message ``There
are currently no errors in your order.''
</P>
<P>
   The final price was $33.17, including $2.43 for shipping,
perhaps making it the most expensive CD in my entire collection.

   ``A 10-track CD will cost $15.99,'' Gould noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we see it, people can spend the same amount of money
and just get one or two songs,'' he added. ``And if they had to go
out and buy traditional CD's to get the same 10 songs, they would
spend three or four times that.''

<P>
   Big Names but So-So Titles: WWW.MY-CD.COM
</P>
<P>
   This site's magic moment occurred just as Tyler Peppel was
thinking about how Oompala, his software company, might use the
Internet to personalize entertainment. ``Around that time, my
assistant's boyfriend gave her a CD he recorded for her with only
one special song on it,'' Peppel recalled from his San Francisco
office.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the romantic gesture, Peppel pitched the custom-disk
idea to financial backers, and MY-CD Inc. was born as a separate
enterprise. Edward A. Bennett, former president of VH1, was brought
in to run the New York company. The site was opened in May and
already offers 16,000 cuts. It is especially strong in jazz and
blues. The rock music area has some star-studded acts, including
Fleetwood Mac and Santana, but their major-label hits are
noticeably absent. Track annotation is sparse, so listening to the
audio samples is essential to insure that the version of a song you
have selected is the original you truly want.
</P>
<P>
   The MY-CD site was recently overhauled, but some bugs still need
to be worked out. As I tried to compile a collection, the software
lost my order every time I tried to go back a page to review it.
The company vowed to fix this soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I did succeed in creating a custom disk, combining
all the tracks from the avant-samba composer Arto Lindsay's ``Mundo
Civilizado'' with 9 of the 11 cuts from his ``O Corpo Sutile''
album for about half the price of the two CD's bought separately.
In the bargain, I lost the song-lyric translations and original
cover art. Disks from MY-CD cost $16.99 and are limited to 25
tracks or 70 minutes. With shipping, the total for the Lindsay disk
was $19.48.
</P>
<P>
   All of the custom-CD sites hope to reach the same level of
success as Peppel's assistant and her beau. The couple, he
reported, is ``living happily ever after.''

BARRY BONDS IS WORTH HIS WEIGHT IN DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Barry Bonds will turn 400 sometime in the next
two weeks, but there seems to be remarkably few parties being
thrown in honor of the big day. Strange.
</P>
<P>
   The ``400'' of which we speak refers to home runs, and when you
combine that figure with the 438 stolen bases he has amassed, it
will make him the first player in major-league history to combine
the two feats. Yet nobody seems all that overwhelmed by the
occasion. Weird.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it seems oddly fitting that Bonds will likely hit No.
400 on the road, because his legacy with the San Francisco Giants
seems oddly muted, even after nearly six years' faithful service.
Even after you allow for the fact that Bay Area ball fans have
always hesitated to take to imported stars, from Willie Mays on
down, there's something missing here. I mean, 400 homers and if you
weren't paying really close attention, you wouldn't know it.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes you wonder if, after almost 1,000 games, Barry
Bonds is ever going to hit it big here _ if, after more than $52
million in salary, he has repaid the investment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not be a treatise on whether Bonds is a nice guy or not,
largely because sportswriters are no better suited to make such a
judgment than any other clothesline gossip. Oh, we try to make
sweeping generalizations on people's inner workings the same as
anyone else, but our success rate isn't much better than that of
the average presidential defender.
</P>
<P>
   So let's ask the question a different way than it's been asked _
not by tooling around his brain, but around his deeds. It is, after
all, the way he has always been asked to be evaluated, and he has
played here long enough to deserve a home game for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Try the numbers first. He is a .305 hitter in his time with the
Giants, has hit 222 homers and driven in 630 runs. He has played 96
percent of his team's games in that time and has never been on the
disabled list. The most you can say in opposition to his on-field
performance is his occasionally casual response to balls he feels
he didn't hit properly, but those aren't reflected in the
statistics. On that basis, he is not assailable. If he is paid for
his numbers alone, he has earned the check.
</P>
<P>
   Try the leadership issue. He said he wasn't going to be a leader
in the conventionally defined way when he got here, and he hasn't
been. He has not been the one to stand up holding the tattered flag
and yell through the hail of bullets at his fallen comrades,
``C'mon, boys, let's go take that hill.'' He hasn't even been the
cheeriest clown in the overfilled circus Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   He has provided inspiration through numbers, but not by nature.
The answer to this question, then, is to ask not whether the Giants
would have paid this much money for a hitting machine, but whether
they expected leadership from him when they signed him. If they
did, they heard only what they wanted to hear. Still, by their
definition, he came up well short. Why else would general manager
Brian Sabean have tried to trade Bonds before he traded Matt
Williams in 1996?
</P>
<P>
   Try the standings. The Giants with Bonds are 29 games over .500,
which figures to an annual record of 82-78. They have one
postseason, a three-game sweep at the hands of the now fictional
Florida Marlins, and a near-miss in 1993. He was part of three
divisional winners in Pittsburgh. At these prices, the management
probably thought it was getting more than this, based on the
difference between the percentage of Bonds on the roster (4) and
the percentage of his salary on the total payroll (this year,
roughly 20 percent, although in earlier years he was nearly 30
percent of the figure). Again, less than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Try the crowds. Again, you cannot separate Bonds from the other
factors here than you can from the rest of the team, but most
operators believe that your star should bring people to see him. As
it turns out, the Giants' chief marketing tools in Bonds' time here
are manager Dusty Baker and a ballpark that hasn't been built yet.
Neither of these is an ideal marketing strategy, and Bonds has
shown no indication that he wants to market anything more than his
presence in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in his time here, the Giants broke their attendance
record in 1993, then set their second- and third-best attendances,
and would have had a fourth if not for the strike of 1994. While he
hasn't overcome the Giants' self-defeating dynamics (over-maligned
stadium, over-hyped new stadium, three losing records in five
years, lots of other pastimes, the strike), neither has he been the
drag he is perceived to be.
</P>
<P>
   Try the salary. Ah, the central question at last. Bonds' salary
is going to skyrocket into eight figures this coming year when his
new contract kicks in, and if the club picks up his option for
2001, it will have paid him nearly $80 million. Alonzo Mourning
makes more and has delivered less. Until this year, Michael Jordan
made less and delivered more. The Giants thought they were getting
something closer to Jordan. On this, Bonds has missed, but only if
you don't believe that money for athletes long ago had lost all its
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, Bonds has not been the all-fired steal the Giants
imagined him to be in December of 1992, but he surely cannot be
considered a waste, either. With him, the Giants have been a
slightly above-average but less than nationally riveting team.
Without him, Peter Magowan would never have made any noticeable
splash as an owner, and may have never convinced anyone that he was
a serious enough operator to build a ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at it that way, yes, he's been worth the money. But
if you see the ballpark not as a cash cow for the century ahead but
as a debt factory that could weigh down the stockholders just as
long, then maybe he wasn't a help at all.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Barry Bonds has been worth the money, but only
depending on the question you ask. These past few years may never
be known as the Bonds Era, and his 400th homer may not cause
spontaneous parades to fill the streets, but imagining this time
without him is nearly impossible. If that isn't worth $80 million,
it comes close enough.

ROBERT JOHNSON'S MUSICAL INFLUENCE _ AND HIS MYSTERIOUS LEGEND _
LIVE ON
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-BLUESMAN-ACOUSTIC) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty years ago this month, a Mississippi-based blues musician
died.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what he died of.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know where he's buried.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what became of his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson was only 27 when he died Aug. 16 in Greenwood,
Miss., a small town north of Jackson and just east of Indianola,
where B.B. King grew up.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, few people outside his family and friends even
noticed. Johnson was, at best, a regional star: He had released a
handful of 78s, none of them national hits. He was not rich and,
perhaps, was barely solvent.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled constantly, from small Delta town to small Delta
town, over to Arkansas and at least once up into the Midwest,
playing at Saturday-night parties and on street corners, doing
anything from his own haunted blues to jukebox favorites, whatever
would keep the coins coming.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the past 35 years, this thin man with long, spidery
hands has remained the most legendary bluesman _ acoustic or
electric, black or white _ of all time.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, his work is stunning: The combination of his
unmatched slide guitar playing and intense singing and songwriting
has never been equaled.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, his songs formed the bedrock of the song
structures and lyrical outlook that, via Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf
and others, defined electric Chicago blues _ the starting point for
everyone from the Rolling Stones to Led Zeppelin to Eric Clapton to
the Fabulous Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   There is literally not a single blues band that hasn't played a
Johnson song, or a song that is based on or influenced by a Johnson
song. Before being ``rediscovered'' by white blues and folk
fanatics in the '60s, his music had already survived for decades
simply because of its potency, and from the many black blues
artists who adapted it and made it their own.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first bluesman, or the first to have an impact on
other bluesmen, but his legacy has extended further and shows no
sign of diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sang of having hellhounds on his trail, of need and
abandonment, with a searing emotional tone that, even all these
years later, makes the hair stand up on the back of the neck. An
eerie, scary immediacy endures as he sings of restlessness on ``I
Believe I'll Dust My Broom'' and ``Walking Blues,'' about inner
turmoil (constantly, but perhaps most eloquently on ``Stones in My
Passway''), of violence on ``Me and the Devil Blues'' and ``32-20
Blues,'' and of soul-destroying loneliness on the epic ``Cross Road
Blues'' and ``Love in Vain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the art _ it's like asking what makes W.B. Yeats' poetry
survive,'' says author Peter Guralnick, who has written extensively
about Johnson. ``It just achieves a standard of art that other
blues didn't. Johnson took a conscious approach to the music that
allowed him to exist outside the framework of the music. He just
aimed higher and had a gift that took his work to a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's the legend: The stories of a
handshake deal with the devil at midnight at a deserted crossroads
(seven years of unmatched skill as a bluesman for his soul is the
bargain said to have been struck), the constant wandering, the
mysterious death at a young age, the burial in an unmarked grave.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Johnson dichotomy: We feel that his songs take us as
far into his soul as we can possibly go, but his shadowy death _ he
is said to have been poisoned by a jealous husband _ is a fitting
end to his life.
</P>
<P>
   We know Johnson recorded twice, in 1936 in San Antonio and in
1937 in Dallas. And for years Johnson was only a voice: Only two
photographs have been made public, both only in the past few years.
For most of the time that men like Keith Richard, Eric Clapton and
John Hammond have revered him, Johnson has been, literally,
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The music is still what matters most, at least to those like
bluesman Corey Harris. Harris was a disc jockey and amateur
bluesman back in 1989 or 1990, when a friend gave him a tape of
Johnson's music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about him, but when I heard it I thought it was a bit
strange,'' said Harris, who has recorded several well-received CDs
for Chicago's Alligator Records. ``It's like I `felt' the songs. It
wasn't just toe-tappin' music _ it wasn't something you kind of
listened to and carried on a conversation. It was so up in your
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings it to you _ he doesn't just say, `I'm feeling kind
of bad today.' He's gonna tell you exactly what it is and detail
it. He communicates a feeling with words and in the end, you're
left with that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, the two photographs and the 41 songs
released in 1990 as ``The Complete Recordings'' were assumed to be
all there was left of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But two tantalizing nuggets recently have come to light: a newly
discovered alternate take of ``Traveling Riverside Blues'' and the
holy grail of blues fanatics, what is believed to be actual
``film'' of Johnson in performance.
</P>
<P>
   Blues archivist Alan Lomax had the take of ``Riverside'' in his
collection, and it will appear on the Sept. 15 CD reissue of ``King
of the Delta Blues Singers,'' the 1961 LP that made such an impact
on young white American folk fans and English blues-rockers.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The snippet of silent 16mm film is owned by Memphis blues
memorabilia collector Leo ``Tater Red'' Allred. According to New
York blues guitarist and researcher David Rubin, who has seen the
film, Johnson is on screen about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He is seen from the waist up, wearing a hat and a harmonica rack
(which may seem odd, as he never played harmonica on a record). He
looks straight into the camera and ``actually plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin remembers being stunned at viewing the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dead giveaway is the fingers _ it's those long, long
fingers. It's him,'' he says. ``You see people on the street, cars
_ and him playing. It was the thrill of a lifetime. We were truly
transfixed watching this, and I've heard other people who have seen
it started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten seconds of one of the greatest musicians of all time. It's
not enough, not for any fan, but considering the rest of Johnson's
life and death, it's perfectly fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson lived by night, on the move, doling out his art
in anguished, impassioned snippets _ only one of his songs,
``Terraplane Blues,'' is three minutes long _ and then vanishing
into the collective imagination of blues fans around the world.
</P>
<P>
   We imagine what we can't know, make up our own visions of him
walking down a lonely country road, or playing a raucous party, or
recording in some makeshift studio. And whatever else, we can
always listen again, and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, ultimately, it comes down to the music,'' Guralnick
says. ``He saw his songs as finished pieces of art, and he
crystalized both the Delta blues tradition and the more popular
blues of the day, people like Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell and
the Mississippi Sheiks. And the music will be there after the myth
of Robert Johnson goes away.''

MORE BLUES DONE RIGHT _ ACOUSTICALLY, THAT IS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies BC-BLUESMAN-LEGACY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heyday of acoustic blues was from the late 1920s _ when
Dallasite Blind Lemon Jefferson became a star _ through the '30s,
after which the advent of the electric guitar made it somewhat
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But the acoustic legacy of Robert Johnson continues. John
Hammond, Rory Block, Taj Mahal and Johnny Winter have cut acoustic
tunes. And a number of currently popular bluesmen are following in
Johnson's footsteps:
</P>
<P>
   KEB' MO': This California native (whose real name is Kevin
Moore) uses the old acoustic blues styles but has found his own
voice with incisive, thoroughly modern folk-blues songwriting. His
first, eponymous CD in 1994 featured two Johnson covers; his 1996
CD, ``Just Like You,'' had one.
</P>
<P>
   COREY HARRIS: Based in Virginia, Harris is known for deep,
``deep'' Delta blues, including songs popularized by Son House, one
of Johnson's mentors. His ghostly slide and brooding vocals are
obviously in the Johnson mode. Both 1995's ``Between Midnight and
Day'' and last year's ``Fish Ain't Bitin''' are excellent
evocations of the Depression-era blues.
</P>
<P>
   ALVIN YOUNGBLOOD HART: Hart is as hyper-eclectic as bluesmen
get: His second CD, ``Territory,'' includes everything from
impressive takes on country blues such as Skip James' ``Illinois
Blues'' to a version of a slippery, almost-hard-rock Captain
Beefheart instrumental _ ``Ice Rose'' _ to a ska tune, ``Just About
to Go.'' And most of it is very good.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS WHITLEY: Whitley first gained national attention with the
stark, dusty, sexually charged folk-blues of ``Living With the
Law.'' He made a stunning return to his solo acoustic roots this
year with ``Dirt Floor,'' recorded in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's a new compilation of Johnson songs by a bona
fide blues-rock legend: Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green, who
wrote ``Oh Well'' and ``Black Magic Woman,'' has just released
``The Robert Johnson Songbook,'' 14 classics done with help from
guitarist Nigel Watson. The style is not straight acoustic Delta
blues; the songs feature bass, drums, piano and, occasionally, a
backing vocal group.

SCREEN SAVER: OUT OF A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do you really have to use a screen saver to prevent burn-in,
or is computer screen technology more advanced these days? What's
the best type for protecting the monitor? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Screen savers have become an art form unto themselves over
the years, so it's sometimes hard to remember that they were
originally designed to serve a very practical function. When
monochrome monitors were the standard, a file left on the screen
for a long time could leave a ghostly pattern on the glass, burned
in by the constant light needed to display the image.
</P>
<P>
   With modern color monitors, burn-in is not the problem it used
to be, but a small risk remains. An image left on a laptop LCD
screen for an extended period can leave a ghostly reminder, but
unlike desktop monitors using cathode-ray tubes, LCD screens can
rebound from this, erasing the ghost after the screen is off for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer systems will automatically put the screen in
``sleep'' mode if there is no activity for a specified period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer professionals say that elaborate animated screen
savers hog system resources and may wear out the phospors faster.
So a dark, simple screen saver could be best for preserving the
life of your monitor. &QL;

   Perennial Snapdragons? Absolutely
</P>
<P>
   Q. A friend is trying to find perennial snapdragons for her home
garden but can't find anyone who sells them. Do they exist? Can we
find them in the Delaware area?
</P>
<P>
   A. Your friend will find perennials if she finds any at all,
because the common snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) isn't really an
annual. It's a short-lived perennial that will overwinter anywhere
temperatures stay above 10 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In such places, snapdragons are usually done in by fungus
disease, not frost. They are susceptible to snapdragon rust,
anthracnose and botrytis, and they often rot in the cold, damp
weather of early spring. Those vulnerabilities explain why they are
usually categorized as annuals in spite of their true nature.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your friend was hoping that perennials would look better
than the ever-squattier, ever-duller snapdragons in garden centers
in spring. Fortunately, all she has to do is grow from seed to
enjoy all sorts of beautiful varieties, including many that have
been bred for rust resistance. They are usually categorized by
height, from eight-inch dwarfs to three-foot giants. Flowers may be
the classic lipped tube or a more open, flatter shape called azalea
or butterfly-flowered. Double and single, ruffled and smooth, they
come in every color but blue.
</P>
<P>
   Snapdragons take a long time to flower. They must be started
early to give a long season of bloom. Gardeners in the
10-degree-and-below belt have to begin indoors around Valentine's
Day, but everywhere else seeds can be planted in fall and wintered
outside as young plants.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware is right on the edge, so if your friend is in a warm
part of the state or has a protected place in the garden, she can
give outdoor planting a try. Seeds sown now will make good growth
before winter sets in and will be ready to take off as spring
comes.
</P>
<P>
   If a cold frame is available, start them there. Otherwise,
choose a sheltered spot where they will not be buffeted by strong
winds. Avoid southern exposures, where the plants may be subjected
to repeated freezing and thawing. Press the very tiny seed into the
ground and water well, but don't cover with soil _ snapdragons need
light to germinate (which will take several weeks).
</P>
<P>
   If you already have plants you like, give them their best shot
at survival by keeping them weeded, removing spent flowers and
getting rid of any foliage that looks diseased. Don't fertilize
after mid-August; you want the plant to concentrate on toughening
up, rather than making new growth.
</P>
<P>
   Snapdragon seeds are widely available. The Brighton Rock strain,
which resembles the parti-colored varieties popular in the 19th
century, is offered by Select Seeds Antique Flowers, 180 Stickney
Hill Road, Union, Conn. 06076-4617; (860) 684-9310 (catalog $1).
The beautiful velvety red Black Prince is sold by Pinetree Garden
Seeds, P.O. Box 300, New Gloucester, Maine 04260; (207) 926-3400
(free catalog).
</P>
<P>
   One Tough Clematis
</P>
<P>
   Q. For three years, I've watched my clematis rise from its
planter and climb aggressively up its trellis, only to wilt and die
once it gets two and a half or three feet tall. The soil appears to
be good. The plant gets full sun until about 1 p.m., and I feed and
water it regularly. What can I do to keep this from happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if your plant is afflicted with a fungus disease
called clematis wilt, which has no cure. But it also sounds as if
you've got a tough plant, since it isn't dead yet. To reward its
perseverance, start by getting rid of every trace of the diseased
foliage. Then repot it in new soil, burying it about an inch deeper
than before. Don't feed it until next spring, and then only
sparingly until it is well along. Be sure the soil stays barely
moist, not waterlogged.
</P>
<P>
   The standard wisdom on clematis is ``head in the sun, feet in
the shade,'' because the plants appreciate cool soil around the
roots. Since yours is in a container, there's a good chance that as
the season warms up, the soil will be doing the same, and that just
when the plant most needs cool roots, they are instead being fried.
This is most likely to be a problem if the container is on a stone
patio or other hot spot. Dark colors absorb heat, too. If your
container is anything but pale, it might be wise to paint it or use
a light-colored one.
</P>
<P>
   Death to Bugs. All Bugs?
</P>
<P>
   Q. This is my first year to have a garden. I have corn,
tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and cucumbers. I have encountered
some minor insect problems and was wondering what insecticide I
might be able to use on everything, as well as around my house.
</P>
<P>
   A. Surely not EVERYTHING! Not the beneficial ladybugs that eat
bad actors like aphids. Not the harmless little wasps that keep
whiteflies at bay. Not the . . . well, you get the idea. It's
natural to want to get rid of damaging insects, and it certainly
would be convenient if one product fixed every problem, but gardens
_ even the simplest ones _ are fantastically complex ecosystems
where one size never fits all.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if you are in an ideal place to start out right.
Your insect problems are still minor, and you haven't yet started
poisoning everything in sight and wiping out all your helpers.
Natural predators need a wide variety of habitats. Encourage them
by planting lots of different flowers, vegetables and herbs. Keep
your plants healthy; sick ones are much more likely to suffer from
insect attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And get one of the many books that have pictures of good and bad
bugs in it; for example, ``The Organic Gardener's Handbook of
Natural Insect and Disease Control'' (Rodale Press, 1992). Armed
with such a guide, you'll be able to tell friend from foe, and how
to have at the latter without doing harm to the former.

   SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y. _ Gardening has few heroes, being generally
an unheroic pastime, but William Price, 84, is surely one of them.
Blind for more than 50 years, he does all his gardening by himself,
once someone else turns the soil with a rototiller in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else has set foot in this garden to work in it except
me,'' Price said with uncharacteristic fierceness the other day,
standing in his 45-by-50-foot plot of vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Raising plants from seed (he collects some himself), laying out
rows, planting, weeding, watering, picking, staking the remarkable
dahlias he has grown for years and finding and squishing tomato
worms _ surely, one of a gardener's most satisfying and grisly
tasks _ Price does it all. ``I found a four-inch one the other day,
and it really gave me the chills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like some modest 19th-century hero who acted as if it was all in
a day's work Price will complain about tomato worms but not much
else. Certainly not about the osteoporosis that is doubling him
over, nor the arthritis in his feet, nor the fact that he is among
the 10 percent in the world of the visually impaired who are
totally without sight. He does not want to emphasize the
difficulties of blindness but simply to point out that there are
lots of ways to get around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's a resourceful and courageous man, Bill figures
out ways to do these things on his own,'' said Betty Bird, the
senior vice president for rehabilitation at the Lighthouse, the
national nonprofit association for the visually impaired and who is
also blind. ``Most people, when they lose their vision, don't know
what their options are. They don't believe they can do it. It's
beyond their imagining that they could garden for pleasure. They
need encouragement. Bill got past that point. He took life and ran
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Price has retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary progressive
degenerative disease of the retina, which slowly narrows vision to
a pinpoint and, in his case, after that to nothing. By the age of
30, he had lost his sight entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Before that happened, however, he worked in a brokerage house
and went to the State University Agricultural and Technical College
at Farmingdale, N.Y., which explains how he learned garden
techniques, but not how he learned to adapt them to his darkened
world or how he developed his remarkable memory.
</P>
<P>
   After agriculture school, he farmed and gardened, bracing
himself for the day when the lights would go out. During those
years, he amassed a large visual vocabulary of plants and flowers
and developed a grasp of space, mass and volume.
</P>
<P>
   The 1880s farmhouse where he lives for six months of the year
with his wife, Elaine (who is sighted), stands at the edge of
Coecles Harbor. (They spend the other months on Johns Island, S.C.)
They married, he for the first time, 22 years ago, and moved to
this house in 1981, but Price has known summer on Shelter Island
since he was a boy growing up in Brooklyn, where his father was a
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The screened porch looks over a sunburned lawn to a water view
crowded with sailboats. ``I can see where I am out there,'' Price
said, remembering his childhood sailing days and adding that his
disability gives him certain advantages, like being able to garden
at night and not having to see the large television satellite dish
that is now part of the view.
</P>
<P>
   The usual shrubs that flower in August _ rose of Sharon,
buddleia, abelia, hydrangea, perpetual flowering roses _ were
cheerfully blooming their heads off. Price gets up early and waters
them.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the garden, Price picked lettuce and dill, so he
could make egg salad sandwiches for lunch. (He does all the cooking
for the two of them.) Then he made a beeline for his pride and joy,
his dahlias. Most are named after friends or donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Allie, tall and yellow, with a large flower,'' he
said. ``And there's Andy, short, but also with a large flower.'' He
has known some of these varieties since the time when he could see
them.
</P>
<P>
   From the shapely look of his dahlias, it is clear that Price
also knows the architecture of plants. Disbudding, nipping off some
buds to insure that the ones that remain will be bigger, means
gauging which buds to lop off. More remarkable for someone who
cannot see is his instinctive judgment about form, being aware of
each bud and balancing the framework of stem and foliage to get
maximum sun and space for the flowers. Texture and form, he says,
are what he is after in the garden, far more than fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragrance is a sighted person's concept of what a blind person
would enjoy,'' Ms. Bird said. ``Texture is more important to the
blind. But they leave lacy or tiny flowers _ those little
gossamer-type plants _ to the sighted. The visually impaired
usually like things such as tulips, sedums or roses, things they
can get their hands round to feel the shape.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no obvious clues that Price's garden belongs to a
blind person, but subtle indications are there. The paths are
Braille for his feet: one path is floored with wood chips; another
with old boards, and still others are plain dirt. In the spring,
Price lays out two fishing lines and plants seeds between them to
get his rows straight.
</P>
<P>
   He once had dreams of becoming an architect, and he annually
memorizes his handsome garden layout: New Zealand spinach, rows of
green beans, limas, tomatoes neatly staked and tied, eggplant,
peppers, zucchini. Finding the ripe vegetables is done by touch he
said. He pointed out the wax and yellow beans, the chard and
carrots. Marigolds and orange cosmos filled out his rows; he grows
them from seed he saves every year. He also knows his way by the
texture and shape of flower and foliage. And, he said, ``I know all
the weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else who gardens in the Northeast, he has a mortal
enemy: hungry deer. So, with a little help from Mrs. Price, he
strung the top of his garden fence with electric wire.
</P>
<P>
   The bright yellow of the wire and the red of the conductors seem
to add something to the garden, a doughty sense of enclosure and
protection. Inside the fence is a thick border of cosmos and
invasive purple loosestrife, which he concedes is hard to control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he headed across the lawn to the house to make lunch, he
commented that he thought the hydrangeas someone gave him were too
high for the scale of the yard. How did he know? By touch, of
course, he said, but also by an innate faculty that helps him
understand proportion and space.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bird believes that Price has heightened ``object perception
capability.'' Research has shown that people can perceive objects
without seeing them because of a change in pressure in the
semicircular canals of the inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he touches helps Price orient himself. Three old
field junipers stand a few yards south of the garden, and to watch
him put his hand on the bark is to see him check out his location.
Sometimes, however, he does get lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, I was wheeling a barrowload of blackweed down to
the pile by the beach _ I'd never put that stuff in my compost _
and I got a little off course on my way back,'' he said. The
remarkable thing is not that he got lost but that he routinely
negotiates the long slope to the beach with a full barrow of weeds
at age 84 _ and blind, of course.
</P>
<P>
   How does he do any of it? Like those dahlias. When he digs up
the tender tubers, how does he keep them organized each winter so
that he can replant them in the spring. He has his own system:
``Boxes of different sizes, shapes and textures,'' he answered.
``Andy goes into an old copper boiler.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch over, Price announced that he had to be getting back to
work. Like all gardeners, he was thinking about the future; like
only the best gardeners he had the energy and the stamina to make
his vision come true. That afternoon, he said, he was going to fill
that wheelbarrow with bricks and begin laying out a new path.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A cartoon published Monday on the front page of the
newspaper Le Monde shows a dazed-looking pair, Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, stripped of almost everything but their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to you?'' Clinton asks. ``An intern?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Yeltsin replies. ``A devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The imagined scene of the American and Russian leaders facing
their respective moments of truth captured a widespread
international image of Clinton as a devalued leader.
</P>
<P>
   While they repeatedly deny it in official statements supporting
their fellow incumbent in Washington, foreign leaders are puzzled
and even resentful, officials say privately, about a chain of
events that has put Clinton on the defensive, crippled White House
initiative and deprived the West of attentive, sustained U.S.
leadership in a series of international crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their conflicting impulses _ the reflex of standing by the
democracies' leader and disappointment over Clinton's inability to
deliver internationally _ have been only partially mirrored in
media reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, foreign publications and television stations
have bored in on the dramatic moment when Clinton would become a
sitting president under interrogation, an unthinkable eventuality
in almost any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Europeans admit bafflement as they contemplate the
world's most powerful nation finding itself in near political
paralysis because of sexual antics involving a middle-aged leader
and a young, provocative woman of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of bedroom farce continued Monday when Elle, the
French women's magazine, published a full-page cut-out Monica
Lewinsky doll whose wardrobe includes Teflon jeans _ recommended
wear, the magazine said, around the president instead of a dress
that stains easily.
</P>
<P>
   But a new mood among Europeans, a slightly aggrieved sense that
Clinton's woes have started dragging them down in his wake,
surfaced in a sharp sound bite from the former French Minister of
Culture, Jack Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American president's sex organ seems to have become the
center of the universe,'' he complained Monday on French radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators seemed to believe that the saga will culminate
with Clinton's eluding any evidence of perjury and thus staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear the slow tearing now'' as Clinton undoes Velcro
tapes meant to catch him, Andrew Sullivan wrote in London's Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a chorus of dire warnings about how the White
House could rebound dangerously. The French press revived its
warnings, which emerged during the confrontation with Iraq last
year, that Clinton might be tempted to engage in risky U.S.
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was echoed in British and German media, with the
suggested possible adversaries ranging from Fidel Castro's Cuba to
drug lords in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, diplomats and government officials in Europe said
that their leaders blamed Clinton for just the opposite: Creating
vulnerabilities that exposed the presidency to his domestic
political enemies and crippled U.S. ability to provided attentive,
sustained leadership in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In worrying aloud, these officials pointed out that their
complaints underscored their own governments' feeling of dependence
on U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But as a German official said, ``The president likes reminding
everybody that the United States is the indispensable nation, so
what do we do when that country is there too late or isn't there at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   None of these concerns, which underscores European leaders' need
for Washington's help, have been aired publicly. Instead, the media
concentrate on dangerous fallout from the Clinton saga such as the
risk of a rising tide of press snooping into politicians' private
lives _ a concern firmly espoused by most European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Sunday Telegraph of Britain, highlighting the
danger of a rising sleaze factor in Western democracies, carried an
article by John O'Sullivan predicting that ``even if Clinton
survives, he will be remembered as a dirty joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Independent seemed to reflect a broader view, obviously
espoused by the Blair government, that Clinton's ``troubles are our
concern and it is right for America's allies to help him keep
dignity if he is to remain responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For such self-proclaimed U.S. enemies as Iraq, the Clinton
combination of weakness at home and aggressiveness abroad has been
staple fare. But outside Europe, most countries seem too immersed
in local problems to follow the U.S. presidential tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even in India, currently at odds with Washington, coverage has
been largely factual. But an Indian editor cited as a revealing
clue to discussion among elites a comment by a businesswoman: ``We
know America is a dying society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo and other Asian capitals have had little to say in recent
days about the drama in Washington as they concentrate on their own
economic urgencies and domestic political complications.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has
managed to keep some distance between the White House and himself,
enabling him to operate apparently undamaged as the czar of U.S.
policy in economics _ the aspect of U.S. power of greatest direct
interest in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The same tactics have not worked for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, according to diplomats and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she has often operated well on her own, these sources
said, her credibility depends too much on presidential clout for
her to succeed long with a White House largely absorbed by domestic
concerns and a constant need to be planning legal defense
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ``We don't want a lame duck president,'' The
Independent newspaper of Britain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of that editorial was that Clinton may have
already lost the degree of presidential authority necessary in an
era when the United States is expected to operate as the sole
superpower. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950; UNCUT VERSION RUNS 1,075 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Even in crises in which Washington forces showdowns, as it did
with Iraq last year, these sources noted, often the White House has
backed away later, as it currently seems to be doing with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In places as different as Iraq, Kosovo, India and Israel, the
Clinton administration's reactions have often seemed to deliver too
little too late, according to U.S. diplomats and foreign officials
in European capitals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House's reluctance to confront the
Pentagon helps to explain why Washington shunned intervening in
eastern Zaire last year and in effect let rule in the county pass
to Laurent Kabila. &QL;

   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ Bard College, a small liberal arts
school on 550 acres here, wants to build a knock-your-socks-off
building, a sculptural shell to show off music, drama and dance.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Frank O. Gehry, an architect who is basking in the
triumph of his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, the $24 million
Bard Performing Arts Center would have some of the same sweeping,
fluttering silvery roofs, some of the same draftsman-defying curves
as its Spanish sibling-under-the-skin _ and some crinkles thrown
in.
</P>
<P>
   To townspeople, preservationists and Bard's president alike, the
860-seat arts center might well be another of Gehry's architectural
coups, a mecca for architectural pilgrims and lovers of the
performing arts. It could also be a draw for this bucolic region
studded with stately homes _ in an area still reeling from the IBM
plant closings that knocked more than 20,000 workers off the
payrolls four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one problem.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think it's in the wrong spot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Gehry structure is designed to nestle in a ravine
next to another of Bard's performing arts buildings. The site is
305 feet from the Saw Kill creek, across from land owned by
Montgomery Place, whose mansion and grounds are listed on the
National Register of Historic Places and are seen by 30,000
visitors a year. While the new center would not obstruct Montgomery
Place's view of the Hudson, it would look out over a pristine,
backwoods lake and dam rhapsodized by A.J. Downing, one of the most
famous of 19th-century romantic landscapers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are worried that the 105-foot stainless steel, glass
and concrete building will be seen above and through the trees from
the mansion's numerous trails _ and Lucy Kuriger, director of
Montgomery Place, fears it might even be visible from the columned
porch of the 1804 classical revival house itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be moved back,'' said Richard Jenrette, the
well-known financier, house restorer _ and neighbor. On June 15,
Jenrette expressed his concerns in a letter to the planning board
of Red Hook, the township that includes the hamlet of
Annandale-on-Hudson. The town has been asked to grant a variance to
allow the center.
</P>
<P>
   Jenrette is joined in his concern by other preservationists and
environmentalists. The State Parks Department ``strongly
recommends'' that the center be moved somewhere else _ or be
reduced in height. The National Park Service worries that the
construction will pose ``a threat'' to the historic district,
according to letters to the planning board.
</P>
<P>
   In his own letter, Jenrette said the building would ``despoil
the single most important area of natural beauty in Dutchess
County.'' The siting of the proposed building, he wrote, ``seems
almost vindictive.'' At the end of his letter, he asked, ``If the
proposed Frank Gehry structure is going to be beautiful, why not
stick it in a place where Bard can enjoy all sides?''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, even Gehry asked the same question of Bard's
determined president, Dr. Leon Botstein, who is also the conductor
and music director of the American Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argued with him a lot,'' Gehry said. ``Your first take is:
when you have this beautiful building, why put it down there?'' If
the building were in the center of the campus, he said, ``it would
make it a more important building.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Gehry was convinced by the arguments of
Botstein, whom he called ``a genius.'' ``He's vehement: He's not
building it just to build an edifice, for fluff,'' he said. The new
center, the architect said, must be ``part of the teaching
experience'' and relate to the two adjacent arts buildings, which
will become part of what Botstein sees as the campus arts complex.
</P>
<P>
   The building has to be massive, Gehry added, because it must
work for orchestra, opera, theater and dance. It must be almost
100-feet high because of the flies _ the area above the stage that
holds the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Both Botstein and Gehry agreed that to move the building would
require a completely new design and more money because the center
was designed to be used with the older arts building next door _ to
share dressing rooms, for example. ``If you moved the building,
everything would be more complicated and a lot more expensive,''
Botstein said, adding that compared with other liberal arts
schools, Bard has a small endowment: only $82 million. (Vassar, 35
minutes away, has an endowment of $555 million.)
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, Bard volunteered to submit an environmental impact
statement by Oct. 1. Officially, everyone is waiting _ although
Botstein vows to start construction in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the public relations maneuvering goes on. Botstein
invited Jenrette to tour the campus. For another visitor, he
brandished a stack of glossy snapshots as thick as a plumber's
thumb, purporting to show that balloons raised to the height of the
proposed building could barely be seen from across the Saw Kill.
For their part, the preservationists show photomontages that
purport to show just how looming the new building will be _ even
when the leaves are out in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Was Jenrette convinced?
</P>
<P>
   ``I softened my position,'' he said. ``Leon had some reasons. I
don't think he MEANT to be mean and hateful. But I still think they
should move it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A cartoon published Monday on the front page of the
newspaper Le Monde shows a dazed-looking pair, Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, stripped of almost everything but their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to you?'' Clinton asks. ``An intern?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Yeltsin replies. ``A devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The imagined scene of the American and Russian leaders facing
their respective moments of truth captured a widespread
international image of Clinton as a devalued leader.
</P>
<P>
   While they repeatedly deny it in official statements supporting
their fellow incumbent in Washington, foreign leaders are puzzled
and even resentful, officials say privately, about a chain of
events that has put Clinton on the defensive, crippled White House
initiative and deprived the West of attentive, sustained U.S.
leadership in a series of international crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their conflicting impulses _ the reflex of standing by the
democracies' leader and disappointment over Clinton's inability to
deliver internationally _ have been only partially mirrored in
media reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, foreign publications and television stations
have bored in on the dramatic moment when Clinton would become a
sitting president under interrogation, an unthinkable eventuality
in almost any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Europeans admit bafflement as they contemplate the
world's most powerful nation finding itself in near political
paralysis because of sexual antics involving a middle-aged leader
and a young, provocative woman of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of bedroom farce continued Monday when Elle, the
French women's magazine, published a full-page cut-out Monica
Lewinsky doll whose wardrobe includes Teflon jeans _ recommended
wear, the magazine said, around the president instead of a dress
that stains easily.
</P>
<P>
   But a new mood among Europeans, a slightly aggrieved sense that
Clinton's woes have started dragging them down in his wake,
surfaced in a sharp sound bite from the former French Minister of
Culture, Jack Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American president's sex organ seems to have become the
center of the universe,'' he complained Monday on French radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators seemed to believe that the saga will culminate
with Clinton's eluding any evidence of perjury and thus staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear the slow tearing now'' as Clinton undoes Velcro
tapes meant to catch him, Andrew Sullivan wrote in London's Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a chorus of dire warnings about how the White
House could rebound dangerously. The French press revived its
warnings, which emerged during the confrontation with Iraq last
year, that Clinton might be tempted to engage in risky U.S.
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was echoed in British and German media, with the
suggested possible adversaries ranging from Fidel Castro's Cuba to
drug lords in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, diplomats and government officials in Europe said
that their leaders blamed Clinton for just the opposite: Creating
vulnerabilities that exposed the presidency to his domestic
political enemies and crippled U.S. ability to provided attentive,
sustained leadership in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In worrying aloud, these officials pointed out that their
complaints underscored their own governments' feeling of dependence
on U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But as a German official said, ``The president likes reminding
everybody that the United States is the indispensable nation, so
what do we do when that country is there too late or isn't there at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   None of these concerns, which underscores European leaders' need
for Washington's help, have been aired publicly. Instead, the media
concentrate on dangerous fallout from the Clinton saga such as the
risk of a rising tide of press snooping into politicians' private
lives _ a concern firmly espoused by most European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Sunday Telegraph of Britain, highlighting the
danger of a rising sleaze factor in Western democracies, carried an
article by John O'Sullivan predicting that ``even if Clinton
survives, he will be remembered as a dirty joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Independent seemed to reflect a broader view, obviously
espoused by the Blair government, that Clinton's ``troubles are our
concern and it is right for America's allies to help him keep
dignity if he is to remain responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For such self-proclaimed U.S. enemies as Iraq, the Clinton
combination of weakness at home and aggressiveness abroad has been
staple fare. But outside Europe, most countries seem too immersed
in local problems to follow the U.S. presidential tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even in India, currently at odds with Washington, coverage has
been largely factual. But an Indian editor cited as a revealing
clue to discussion among elites a comment by a businesswoman: ``We
know America is a dying society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo and other Asian capitals have had little to say in recent
days about the drama in Washington as they concentrate on their own
economic urgencies and domestic political complications.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has
managed to keep some distance between the White House and himself,
enabling him to operate apparently undamaged as the czar of U.S.
policy in economics _ the aspect of U.S. power of greatest direct
interest in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The same tactics have not worked for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, according to diplomats and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she has often operated well on her own, these sources
said, her credibility depends too much on presidential clout for
her to succeed long with a White House largely absorbed by domestic
concerns and a constant need to be planning legal defense
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ``We don't want a lame duck president,'' The
Independent newspaper of Britain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of that editorial was that Clinton may have
already lost the degree of presidential authority necessary in an
era when the United States is expected to operate as the sole
superpower. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950; UNCUT VERSION RUNS 1,075 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Even in crises in which Washington forces showdowns, as it did
with Iraq last year, these sources noted, often the White House has
backed away later, as it currently seems to be doing with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In places as different as Iraq, Kosovo, India and Israel, the
Clinton administration's reactions have often seemed to deliver too
little too late, according to U.S. diplomats and foreign officials
in European capitals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House's reluctance to confront the
Pentagon helps to explain why Washington shunned intervening in
eastern Zaire last year and in effect let rule in the county pass
to Laurent Kabila. &QL;

PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM ON-LINE PREDATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After logging on to a chatroom for timid people, ``Britny02''
said she had just moved to a new town and was interested in
learning new things. Within half a minute, Britny02 was receiving
messages from a man who said he was significantly older and wanted
to know about what sort of new things she was interested in
learning, if she had ever messed around with a boyfriend, and if he
could call her. Soon three or four other men were propositioning
her too.
</P>
<P>
   In a Seattle classroom, six parents of elementary school
children stared in disbelief as the dialogue flashed on their own
terminals and the potential child molesters ``groomed'' the young
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were attending a seminar on Internet safety led by
Seattle vice detective Leanne Shirey. Fortunately, ``Britny02'' was
fictitious, an online pseudonym created, typos and all, by Det.
Shirey. But the problem ``Britny02'' illustrated was all too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised by how quickly we got the guy to come out
of the woodwork,'' Detective Shirey said. ``That's exactly what we
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by a volunteer group of public and private security
experts and local and federal law enforcement officials, the
seminar provided parents with tips for protecting their kids from
online predators, the first such seminar in the country, according
to Detective Shirey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something every police department in the country could
offer within two years for free,'' said the detective, who is
working with federal law enforcement trainers to expand the
seminar. ``A lot of parents don't understand computers, or how to
learn about Web safety when they're told to go to this Web site for
more information. We're the generation with the blinking 12:00 on
the VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents at the seminar were taught how to search for secret
e-mail addresses their children may have obtained (try searching
for your child's name on the e-mail search pages of four11.com or
lycos.com) or postings they may have made on newsgroups _ search in
www.dejanews.com).
</P>
<P>
   Parents even learned how to read their children's e-mail if
necessary, even without knowing the password _ by checking under
the child's screen name in the Organize folder of some programs.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Dowling, an attendee whose 14-year-old son uses the
Internet, was amazed by how quickly children can find trouble even
when they aren't looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can decide oops, I'm in the wrong place, if they want to
learn about the White House and end up in a porno site,'' she said,
noting addresses like www.whitehouse.com, porn sites discussed at
the seminar that are accidentally visited by students who had
intended to visit government sites instead.
</P>
<P>
   Parents using filters or blocking devices on the computer should
understand the limitations of software, Detective Shirey said. She
also stressed that if someone on line tries to lure a child to a
face-to-face meeting, the police should be notified immediately:
the average child molester reaches 100 victims before ever being
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips of the day: kids shouldn't use their ages, birthdays
or graduation years in their screen names, as child molesters can
search for such numbers when trolling for potential victims. And if
parents want to keep their own passwords secret for long, they
should avoid obvious ones. (Pet names, for example, are easy for
kids to figure out.)
</P>
<P>
   And if a child has a pager, parents might need to keep an eye
out for suspicious incoming numbers or numeric messages like 1-2-3,
a code for ``I love you.'' Consider getting a duplicate pager if
strange messages come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids know you don't give out your phone number, but pedophiles
will say, `here's my number, call collect,' '' and the child's
number will show up on the molester's phone bill, Det. Shirey said.
From there, using a reverse phone directory like one at lycos.com,
it's not hard to find full names and street addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The most common mistakes parents make include letting a child
have a computer in his or her room, or letting the screen face a
wall instead of the middle of a common room, Det. Shirey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent so much time getting our kids on the Internet,'' she
said, ``but we didn't get the parents there first.''

IS IT THE EARLIEST LIKENESS OF THE MAN ON THE $5 BILL?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the small, leather-encased oval daguerreotype of
someone who looks like a young Abraham Lincoln surfaced a few years
ago, experts have been arguing about it. If the picture, made
around 1843, is of the 16th president, it would be Lincoln's first
likeness, predating a daguerreotype in the Library of Congress that
was made between 1846 and 1849. It would be a major historical
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The image in question, known as the Hay Wadsworth daguerreotype,
has thus faced all kinds of scrutiny: by a forensic anthropologist,
a criminal identification specialist, a photographer who ``aged''
the image by computer and two medical experts who analyzed the vein
pattern in the subject's hand. Most of them think it is Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics persist, led by the doubter-in-chief, Lloyd
Ostendorf, 77, of Akron, Ohio, the surviving co-author of ``Lincoln
in Photographs'' (Morningside Press, 1985). ``I have no questions
about what that is, and it's not Lincoln,'' he said, reeling off a
dozen physical characteristics, from the big, sharp nose to the
too-small ears, that do not match Lincoln's.
</P>
<P>
   Now the market will decide. The owners, Robert and Joan Hoffman
of Pittsford, N.Y., a suburb of Rochester, have consigned the
daguerreotype to Christie's, which is to auction it on Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very daring move,'' said Harold Holzer, the author
of 12 books on Lincoln and the Civil War. (He is also chief
spokesman for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. If it is the first daguerreotype of Abraham
Lincoln, it could fetch $1 million, Lincoln scholars estimated. And
if it is not? ``It's worth $5 or $6 on the antique photograph
market, maybe $50 at tops,'' Ostendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, while bullish, is not pushing too hard. In the
catalog, it will describe the work as ``Portrait of a Gentleman,
Believed to Be Abraham Lincoln, Aged 34.'' The estimate is $200,000
to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the record auction price for a Lincoln memento of
any sort is $1.54 million, set in 1992, for an 1857 draft of his
``house divided'' speech opposing slavery. The record for a
daguerreotype is $189,000, set in 1995, for ``The Capitol
Building'' by John Plumb, circa 1846.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can add this to the gallery of Abraham Lincoln
images carte blanche,'' said Rick Wester, director of Christie's
photography department. ``Christie's needs to be realistic about it
and say there is a possibility that it is not Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Caveat emptor, in other words. Auctioneers frequently sell items
they cannot identify precisely, of course. Christie's and Sotheby's
do not guarantee anything made before 1870, and they often label
Old Master paintings as ``circle of'' or ``school of'' particular
artists, for example. Sometimes, buyers do more research and the
attribution may change to a more highly valued artist _ or to a
less respected one.
</P>
<P>
   Daguerreotypes, which are one-of-a-kind mirror images, pose
particular problems of their own. They became common only in 1839,
and the process, the early lenses used and the required harsh
lighting distort the picture of the sitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffmans _ he is an antiques dealer and she an educator at
the Strong Museum in Rochester, N.Y. _ refuse to disclose what they
paid for their treasure, but they knew they had to make a case for
it. If the Hay Wadsworth image is Lincoln, it depicts him as a
beardless member of the Illinois State Legislature, 17 years before
he was elected president and before his new wife, Mary Todd
Lincoln, a socially prominent banker's daughter, spruced him up.
But the public knows Lincoln as he is depicted on the $5 bill, on
the penny and in his majestic marble memorial in Washington, always
with the beard he grew after he was elected president. Many people
would no doubt have a hard time reconciling the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always surprised that people think people will age the way
they do in movies,'' said Holzer. ``But faces really change _ noses
droop, things sag, a lot can happen.'' He added that the Library of
Congress' daguerreotype was originally doubted, too, requiring
Lincoln's son Robert to authenticate it three times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holzer is not entirely convinced. ``I think the
possibility exists that it could be Lincoln'' is his most forceful
verdict after reviewing the supporting evidence and writing two
articles about it.

 UNDATED: about it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That evidence is varied. Allen Phillips, a photographer, used a
computer to line up facial features of five later images of Lincoln
and easily ``dissolved'' or ``morphed'' the daguerreotype image
into the last known photo of him, taken in April 1865, the month he
was shot. Albert Harper, a forensic anthropologist, measured such
things as forehead height, nasal height, mouth contour and other
facial elements and found matches with later Lincoln portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Buberger, a dealer in antique photographs and the
daguerreotype's most ardent champion, traced the travels of
itinerant photographers in 1843 and found at least two who visited
Springfield, Ill., where Lincoln lived that year. Buberger, who
helped the Hoffmans and who, some experts said, harbored hopes that
he would sell it for them on commission, even called in Dr. Henry
Lee, the forensic scientist whose testimony helped acquit O.J.
Simpson. Lee agreed with those who think the portrait is genuine. (
Hoffman said that all the experts volunteered their expertise. ``No
one ever charged us or anyone else for the research,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   The vein analyses, on the other hand, were mixed. Dr. Ralph
Leonard, a medical professor at Wake Forest University, concluded
that the vein patterns in the daguerreotype did not match
Lincoln's. But Dr. Blaine Houmes, the deputy medical examiner in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a Lincoln photo collector, said they did
correspond.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing the consignment, Christie's relied most heavily on
the work of Lewis Sadler, the head of the Biomedical Visualization
Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Sadler
developed an identification process that feeds mathematical
``facial maps'' into a computer model and sifts the data for
matches. To test the daguerreotype, he mapped it and three other
Lincoln images and mixed them with 300 other facial maps of white
males. He got three matches _ with the three other Lincoln
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have observed this type of clustering only in cases where we
had photos of the same individual and in the case of identical
twins,'' Dr. Sadler wrote. ``I would have to conclude that there
was nothing to indicate that this was not a photo of Abraham
Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny that,'' Wester of Christie's said. ``Everything
else is human opinion.'' Believers are also buoyed by the
daguerreotype's provenance, which shows a strong yet circuitous tie
to Lincoln. The Hoffmans bought the image from George Feeley, an
antiques dealer in Caledonia, N.Y., shortly before he died in 1993.
Feeley, Hoffman said, was the private liquidator for the Wadsworth
family. Senator James W. Wadsworth Jr. was married to Alice Hay,
who was the daughter of John Milton Hay, Lincoln's private
secretary (and later Secretary of State under Presidents William
McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt).
</P>
<P>
   Hay and Lincoln were close. During the Civil War, Hay moved into
the White House, and Hay, some historians say, was the only person
there who referred to Lincoln by his first name. Documents show
that the Lincolns gave Hay many artifacts, including a lock of the
president's hair, letters and two copies of the Gettyburg Address,
as well as a scrapbook of Civil War news clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants also say that they recall seeing the daguerreotype
in the Wadsworth household.
</P>
<P>
   To which Ostendorf said, so what? ``Everybody has pictures of
family and friends. If that's convincing provenance, I'd like to
see unconvincing provenance.'' Scholars said many look-alikes sent
Lincoln and his family their own pictures, and Hay might have had
one of those.

HOW PEEL, CUBE AND SLICE MANGOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEELING and CUBING &QL; 
1. Set mango stem end up with narrow side facing you. Make vertical
slice to about 1/2 inch to right of stem so it barely clears the
long, flat, narrow stone that runs almost the length of the fruit.
Do the same on the other side. &QL; 
2. Use small bits of fruit still clinging to stone as a snack or in
a recipe. &QL; 
3. With butter knife, score flesh of each half in squares of
desired size, cutting to, but not through the skin. &QL; 
4. Press skin so cut sides pop outward, hand-grenadelike (also
called hedgehog fashion) Slice cubes from skin. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TO SLICE: Divide fruit in seedless halves. Slip paring knife under
skin of cut half. Slowly carve out flesh in a single piece, cutting
as close to skin as possible. Slice these hemispheres (more or
less) to suit. &QL; 
 &QL; 
For large, plump mangoes, this slicing method works best: Holding
the whole mango cradled in your palm, with a very sharp knife score
the skin of the upturned half in lengthwise quarters. Gently pull
off the skin. Cut the exposed flesh in slices, cutting each from
the seed as closely as possible (still resting the mango in your
hand). &QL; 
Do the same to the other side, which is going to be a bit trickier,
but it does work. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ The early morning August sun beat down on
Mary Langdon, 86, a manager of estate sales, as she stooped to pick
two yellowing botanical prints in cherry wood frames from the
ground. She blew the dust off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree,'' Mrs. Langdon said with a dry smile. ``The only
difference between us and the sea gulls is they have wings.'' Not
that they get to everything first, though.
</P>
<P>
   Nantucket Island _ off the coast of Massachusetts, harbor to
generations of 19th-century whaling captains and haven to
20th-century summer residents, rich with stretches of unspoiled
beach and rotten with wooden sailboats and shingled cottages
weathered the gray of a widow's hair _ has a local scene that does
not show up on postcards.
</P>
<P>
   A popular decorating and renovation resource, islanders call it
the Madaket Mall.
</P>
<P>
   What it is is the dump. Inaugurated in 1988, the
17,500-square-foot Nantucket Citizens Recycling Drop-Off Center and
Landfill _ complete with gray shingled shed _ has its own weekly
social set, from year-round local residents to summer people. The
Mercedeses pull in next to the trucks. ``The only thing that's
missing is the coffee and doughnuts,'' said Mrs. Langdon, who has
summered on Nantucket for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, the things you'll find. Open from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m. on
weekdays and 7 a.m. until noon on weekends, the dump, regulars
agree, offers the best ``diving'' on Sunday, when what did not sell
at Saturday tag sales gets, well, dumped. Spring and fall are good,
when the season-rental storms of heavy cleaning wash up on
Madaket's shores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a thick, down-easter flotsam of chintz chairs,
wicker settees, architectural salvage, antique trunks, monogrammed
Brooks Brothers shirts and late-model mountain bikes, there is real
treasure. Last summer, Mrs. Langdon found an Empire sofa, circa
1850, in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind you, this never hit the ground,'' she said later that
afternoon at home, gesturing with a willowy tanned arm toward the
prize peach-upholstered sofa. ``It went from one man's truck right
into the back of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Willett, director of public works, said, ``I don't think
anyone has found the missing Rembrandts out there, but some
valuable antiques HAVE surfaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Ole Lokensgard, 52, an architect who visits the dump twice a
week, has done devotees like Mrs. Langdon one better.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the ornate clock, found there two years ago, signed
``E. Ingraham Co., Bristol, CT,'' that now graces his mantel.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lokensgard's house, which was largely built and furnished
with dump items found and then incorporated into his design: from
the cottage's oddly shaped windows to its mismatched doors, from
the icebox hardware on the kitchen cabinets to the refuse lattice
that encloses an outdoor shower.
</P>
<P>
   Each brick in the fireplace, which took Lokensgard three months
to build, was handpicked. His wife, Mary, painted the family's
eight dining chairs _ from multiple dives _ a sea-foam green, to
make a set.
</P>
<P>
   Lokensgard pointed wistfully at a window that was a tad smaller
than the one next to it. ``It's a mixed blessing with found
stuff,'' he said. ``I refer to my house as the idiot savant house
because of its eccentric nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, as regulars took their positions by the drive-in
entrance, the chatter was about the new one-year-old Nantucket Golf
Club (initiation fee: $300,000), the horror of Kathy Lee Gifford
buying a house on the island and a bald eagle that had taken up
residence in the back section of the landfill. No one seemed to be
paying attention to the sign in the corner of the discard shed: NO
LOITERING: 15 MINUTES. The rule is not enforced. There are simple
rules of etiquette at the dump that most seem to follow. If you
pick something up, it is yours until you put it down. And so it
goes.
</P>
<P>
   Regulars are quick to say the glory days may be ending. Stories
of entire trunks filled with antique books, old photographs and
estate jewelry are already folklore. With the island's new
construction boom, the demolition of old homes and the influx of
people with decorators on the payroll, the drop-offs have been good
but the diving has become more competitive. And tidy innovations
like recycling and the somewhat controversial ``take it or leave
it'' pile have made it easier _ and more attractive _ for amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Lokensgard, a former divinity student, is philosophical. ``If
you are using the dump regularly, you become part of the community,
and that means a lot to people,'' he said. He recalled dropping off
an old boat chair. ``Gosh, I was hoping for one of these all
morning,'' the man next to him exclaimed.

<P>
   Employers increasingly are finding ever sneakier ways to watch
their employees' every keystroke. A new generation of software has
emerged that allows managers to record not just which Web sites
employees browse but which programs they use, which memos they
write, any e-mail they send _ in short, every single move they make
on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, WinWhatWhere Corp., a Kennewick, Wash., software
company released a program called Investigator that according to
the company makes and stores a record of every keystroke, mouse
click and command entered on a PC. The program costs $285 for each
desktop computer on which it is deployed. (The per-desktop price is
lower for larger purchases.)
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tech Assist Inc., of Largo, Fla., began distribution in
North America of ``Desktop Surveillance,'' a comprehensive computer
monitoring program made by Omniquad in the United Kingdom. The
software costs $55 per computer and has been on sale in Europe for
about eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Each program allows employers to hide the fact that the software
is running. In the case of Desktop Surveillance, a log of the
employee's activities can be automatically e-mailed to a
supervisor, unbeknownst to the employee.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Tech Assist and WinWhatWhere said they had
decided there was a market for their products, after hearing what
they said was tremendous demand from employers concerned about
employees wasting time on company computers. They said employers
also want to use the recorded events if the employees bring, or are
defendants in, lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richard Eaton, president of
WinWhatWhere(www.WinWhatWhere.com) said his company, which
specializes in monitoring programs for home and business, struggled
with whether to produce software that could be used to invade
employees' privacy in such minute detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of turmoil internally about monitoring
keystrokes,'' Eaton said. ``It just seemed like too much, but it
was the No. 1 request from our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Less Expensive PDAs Coming, but With Fewer Features
</P>
<P>
   Furthering its efforts to become known as the maker of no-frills
gadgets, Royal Consumer Business Products next month plans to begin
selling a low-cost Personal Digital Assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Royal, a subsidiary of one-time typewriter giant Olivetti, will
offer its $99 PDA, called Da Vinci, with such basic features as
handwriting recognition and an address book. Two weeks later it
plans to start shipping Da Vinci Pro, a slightly souped-up and
pricier version with a slot for a modem card and full fax and modem
capability.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off for consumers who buy the lower-priced Royal line
(compared with $300 or more for other PDA brands) is that it has
fewer features than other power-packed PDAs. For instance, Royal
left out such functions as an expense manager, which it says few
PDA owners use anyway, said Robert J. Robinson, executive director
of marketing for Royal.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that the economy PDAs were part of the company's
business plan to offer lower-cost versions of electronic gadgets.
For instance, Royal sells paper shredders for less than $30 and the
most basic of electronic organizers for under $10, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many features you can put on before a
product gets too complicated,'' Robinson insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Da Vinci lines do have one optional feature not found
on other personal digital assistants. For an extra $29.95,
consumers can buy a very small folding QWERTY keyboard that plugs
into the back of the PDA.
</P>
<P>
   Government Seeks Better Key to Lock Up Top-Secret Data
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to pull back the curtains on Thursday on 15
candidates for one of the tougher job assignments that the 21st
century has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all are algorithms, one of which likely will be
chosen as the basis for the government's standard encryption system
in the coming century. The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), a branch of the Commerce Department, plans to
unveil the contenders at a cryptography conference in Ventura,
Calif., north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bulman, spokesman for NIST, said the agency wanted to
pick the winning algorithm by 2001. Before then, leading
cryptographers will take their cracks at cracking and refining the
system. Ultimately, the code will be the basis for encrypting data
for the federal government agencies, along with banks and financial
institutions, Bulman said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, researchers cracked the existing data-scrambling code,
known as the Data Encryption Standard, or DES. DES uses a 56-bit
key _ which is a measure of how many possible password keys protect
a system. But yes, size does matter in cryptology too, and the new
algorithm will be substantially harder to crack because it will use
128-, 192- and 256-bit keys, Bulman said.

   Unsolicited Junk E-Mail Now Officially Called Spam
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Spam is more than a meal. If there was any doubt
about the popularity of the word ``spam'' as a derisive name for
unsolicited e-mail, the New Oxford Dictionary has officially
chiseled it into the lexicon
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the New Oxford Dictionary of English,
published last Thursday, defines the word as ``irrelevant Internet
messages sent to a large number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of the definition was noticed immediately by the
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, a lobbying group
pushing for anti-spam legislation. ``I guess it's official,'' said
a board member, John Mozena. ``Spam is not just for breakfast
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Remote Control for PC Can Enhance Presentations
</P>
<P>
   Television users who live and die by the remote control soon may
have a counterpart device for their computers. Interlink
Electronics Inc. of Camarillo, Calif., has begun public
demonstrations of the FreedomWriter, which the company plans to
market as a remote control for the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The handheld wireless device can be used as a mouse and touch
pad, allowing users to surf the Net, read e-mail, even enter text
using a handwriting-recognition feature.
</P>
<P>
   The company is initially marketing the FreedomWriter as a
business tool, for use in presentations. The company says the $199
device, which goes on sale in November, can be used by a presenter
to annotate slides and annotate text with a stylus.

   Vatican Plans More Webcasts of Audiences by the Pope
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Roman Catholic Church streamed live video and audio
over the Internet of Pope John Paul II's address on the Feast of
the Assumption, the celebration of Mary's ascension into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first papal Webcast but not the last: The Vatican
plans to post the pope's regular Wednesday audiences and Sunday
Masses over the Internet on the Vatican Web site (www.vatican.va).

   Smithsonian Robot to Have a Kid-Friendly Sweet Touch
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution is creating a robot that not only is
user-friendly but looks user-friendly too: It can smile and even
offer candy to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of
Bonn in Germany created the robot, named ``Minerva'' after the
Roman goddess of wisdom. The scientists hope to use the exhibits at
the Smithsonian to test the robot's ability to navigate a crowded
room without bumping into objects or people.
</P>
<P>
   Minerva is equipped with sensors that allow it to determine if
something, or someone, is in the way. It also has two video cameras
for eyes, which capture what Minerva ``sees.'' The images then will
be displayed on the Internet site for the Smithsonian museum's
Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation
(www.si.edu/nmah/lemel), which is sponsoring the robot's visit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to refining the robot itself, the scientists also
hope Minerva will help children feel comfortable with technology,
and will familiarize them with robots. To prepare children for the
new technology, they are relying on an old-fashioned trick: A box
of candy will be placed on board the robot to encourage youngsters
to approach.
</P>
<P>
   The robot will be on duty from from Monday to Sept. 5 in the
museum's ``Material World'' exhibit, which shows the impact on
people's lives of the use of wood, metal and synthetic materials.

   Comet Systems Inc., a New York company, has begun licensing
software that can turn the cursor itself into any graphic or
animation. On Sept. 9, Comedy Central (www.comedycentral.com), one
of the cursor's early adopters, will debut the technology on its
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Comedy Central site will be able to surf with a
cursor that looks like the animated characters ``Kenny,'' from the
show ``South Park,'' ``Dr. Katz'' from the show of the same name,
or the comedy network's logo. Visitors must first download the free
Comet Systems software, which takes little more than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old Comet Systems (www.cometsystems.com) is marketing
its malleable cursor as a way for companies to get their messages
across in a pointed fashion. For instance, the 1-800-Flowers site
is going to feature a cursor that morphs into a price tag when it
is scrolled over certain sale items; other times it is a red rose
beside ``1-800.''

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers
through exposure to the arts. (slugged:

   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often
find themselves faced with a difficult decision _ whether to let
the child be one of the youngest in the kindergarten class, or wait
until the following year. Bulion tells the stories of three
families confronted with this dilemma and how they reached their

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.
</P>

 &UR; By ANN ORR
</P>
<P>
   Once seniors overcome any anxiety they might have about
computers, they find a host of intriguing Web sites to suit their
needs and interests. Ann Orr, a software reviewer for Children's
Software Revue, highlights some of the best sites that are geared
to or likely to appeal to seniors. (slugged:

   It's late at night and you suddenly feel chest pains. Do you
call an ambulance or figure that it can wait until the morning?
Lenane offers tips on how to determine whether various ailments _
skipped heartbeat, chest pain, cramps, night sweats, dizziness _
are likely to be serious enough for a 3 a.m. run to the emergency

   As people age, they tend to suffer memory loss. Glicksman
discusses the three types of memory _ long-term, intermediate and
short-term _ and how each is affected by the aging process. She
also offers strategies on how to keep one's memory sharp. ``Much
like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning,'' she writes. (slugged:

   ``Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long,'' writes Feldman, a professional
organizing consultant. Discussing how she assisted her own mother,
she gives practical advice on reorganizing kitchens, shelves,
personal papers, shopping lists and jewelry boxes to make life
easier for the elderly. (slugged:

   Millions of senior citizens and their offspring wrestle with the
difficult and often heartrending problem of where the elderly
should live when they can no longer cope alone at home. These days
nursing homes or moving in with the children are not the only
options. Daniel looks at some of the alternatives he and his wife
explored for his aging mother-in-law, including cooperative living,
home sharing, assisted living and continuing care. (slugged:

 &HT;    Transform your child's study sessions _ with the help of a
computer, CD-ROMs and the Internet.
 &HT;    The latest techno-tools can captivate reluctant students, bring
ordinary text to three-dimensional life and condense a bookshelf's
worth of reference guides into a single disk.
 &HT;    Is your son struggling with square roots? There's new and
exciting software _ see Algebra Smart _ that takes the drudgery out
of drill and practice and can be programmed to focus on square
roots, fractions or whatever else makes up this week's lesson plan.
 &HT;    Your daughter's studying Africa? With the click of a mouse _ see
Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe _ she can hear the music of Rwanda,
see a sweeping 360-degree panoramic map, even access a Website that
details the war between the Tutsi and Hutu peoples.
 &HT;    Below are recommendations on the best and most interesting study
aids and reference tools _ each of which has been approved by a
panel of parent and child testers. You'll need a CD-ROM drive for
all of the programs mentioned, and an Internet connection to visit
the Websites.
 READING AND LANGUAGE ARTS  
 &HT;    Reading Blaster: Ages 6-9. For reading-skills practice, you
can't go wrong with this space-age game show that teaches
comprehension, vocabulary, spelling and phonics through seven
different reading games and three printable storybooks. In Word
Zapper, youngsters dodge falling meteors as they scramble to build
words based on phonics sounds and spelling rules. In Get-a-Clue,
children read for meaning as they use their deductive reasoning to
solve mysteries. More than 2,000 words are presented, and the
program features nine levels of difficulty.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, $30, ages 6 to 9.
 &HT;    Major League Reading. Sports fans can improve their reading
comprehension, spelling and vocabulary skills when they play this
simulated baseball game. Kids control the plays by reading
curriculum-based articles and answering questions that test their
comprehension.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Sanctuary Woods, $29.95, ages 8 to 12.
 &HT;    Claris Works for Kids. While older kids can handle the adult
version of Claris Works, elementary-age children will enjoy hearing
their stories read aloud, learning about fractions by making their
own pie charts and creating multimedia book reports and
presentations with sounds and movie clips.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Claris Corp., $49, ages 5-11.
 MATH  
 &HT;    Algebra Smart. This entertaining game makes studying algebra fun
_ no kidding! More than a hundred video lessons and 500 practice
problems make up the core of the program, but the zip comes from
the software's zany humor. In The Algebra Games, kids compete
against a team of math nerds, complete with thick specs and pocket
protectors.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. The Princeton Review, $30, ages 14 and up.
 &HT;    Treasure MathStorm! In an arcadelike format, children sharpen
their math and problem-solving skills. Their task is to climb a
snowy mountain _ capturing elves, answering math problems and
testing their knowledge of time and money along the way. The
software automatically adjusts in difficulty, or grown-ups can set
specific levels. Our testers couldn't get enough of this one!
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Learning Company, $29.95, ages 5 to 9.
 &HT;    Geometry Blaster. Kids outsmart the evil Geometrons by
completing activities dealing with perimeter, area and volume,
proofs and theorems, ratios and proportion _ a full year's worth of
curriculum. Tutorials, extensive record-keeping and three levels of
difficulty make this an excellent choice. A ninth-grade math
teacher who tested this program liked it so much he promptly
ordered one himself.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, $35, ages 12 and up.
 &HT;    Mighty Math Calculating Crew. Third-to-sixth-grade math is the
focus of this excellent program. Superheroes such as Wanda Wavelet
use on-screen objects to teach addition, subtraction,
multiplication, estimation and geometry. There's a Superhero
Superstore where kids practice money skills and a 3D lab where they
classify two- and three-dimensional figures. The program tracks
each child's progress and automatically adjusts in difficulty.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Edmark, $39, ages 8 to 12.
 SCIENCE  
 &HT;    The Universe According to Virgil Reality. Virgil Reality, an
offbeat professor, uses videos, songs, activities and projects to
teach dozens of science concepts, including the principles of
flight, animal behavior, magnetism and chemistry. Kids can witness
the Hindenburg's demise, view actual NASA footage and assemble a
working model of a compound microscope. Also includes directions
for hundreds of offscreen activities, including home experiments,
games, dioramas and paper airplanes.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows. 7th Level, Inc., $39.99, ages 8-14.
 &HT;    Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Science 2.0. This resource delves
deep into physics, chemistry, math and life sciences. Kids can
explore rotating models, see the inner workings of cells, meet
scientists from the past and present and test their knowledge with
the Quiz Master game.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. DK Multimedia, $39.95, ages 10 and up.
 GEOGRAPHY  
 &HT;    Rescue Geo I. Learning about U.S. geography has never been more
fun. Children are challenged with the task of repairing a computer
infected with pesky bugs and viruses. Kids turn to maps and other
visual aids to answer geography questions and save the day. The
software features more than 600 questions and more than 1,400 maps,
charts and photos.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Houghton Mifflin, $59.94, 8 to 12.
 &HT;    Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 1998 Edition. A must-have for
any home software library, this version features 19 map styles, 1.2
million place names and 500 new geography articles. Kids can ride
along on spectacular 3-D fly-throughs over the Andes or the Grand
Canyon and zoom in on street-level maps of 50 world cities. Three
thousand color images and 4,000 sound and music clips add to the
memorable experience. This excellent reference tool is so slick and
entertaining parents and kids will return to it often.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows 95. Microsoft, $54.95, ages 10 and up.
 MULTI-SUBJECT  
 &HT;    Grolier's CornerStone Home. Here's an impressive set of
programs, perfect for concentrating on just those math and
language-arts skills that give a youngster the most trouble. This
12-volume series is grouped by subject and grade level. For
instance, there's one CD that focuses on third and fourth-grade
spelling and capitalization. Another CD helps seventh- and
eighth-graders practice their fractions and percents. Each program
presents lessons, quizzes, instant feedback and progress reports.
Success is rewarded with game time in a multimedia arcade. This is
serious skills practice in a fun package.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. SkillsBank Corporation (The Learning
Company), $49.95 per grade level and subject area _ English or
math, ages 7 to 13.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

 By FLORENCE FELDMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.

   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

<P>
   Passengers on the Riddler's Revenge roller coaster squealed with
exuberance and panic, from the initial 15-story plunge right
through to the last of six fearsome spirals, many at freeway
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the ride's control room, a windowless office
underneath the ride platform here at Six Flags Magic Mountain
amusement park in suburban Los Angeles, was considerably more
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   One man sat gazing into a computer screen; at his side, inside a
cabinet that stretched the length of a Cadillac, some complicated
hardware performed acrobatics of its own, with no allowance for
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   From the safety announcements played as passengers wait to get
on board to the photographs of screaming riders sold at the exit,
technology plays a starring but seldom-seen role in the operations
of roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   As riders are whipsawed around a track in apparent pandemonium,
it is machines and not people that insure that the cars whiz down
the track at the right speed, do not collide and do not hit
obstacles that block the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the ride operator with a lever and brake is
history,'' said Jim Blackie, director of maintenance at Magic
Mountain. ``It's all computer controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the Riddler's Revenge, billed as the nation's fastest
and tallest stand-up roller coaster, the job of a ride operator is
similar to that of a flight attendant: make sure that the automatic
safety bars are secure and that stuffed animals are stowed away.
Starting a train is accomplished with no more sweat than ringing a
door bell.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting is left to two Allen-Bradley PLC-5s, which are
the size of encyclopedias but serve as the brains of a massive
control system built primarily by Rockwell International's
Allen-Bradley unit. Sitting in an air-conditioned room under the
station platform, they provide a full set of instructions to the
massive control system built around them every 20 to 40
milliseconds. Behind steel cabinet doors, red and green lights
flash as the trains round the track.
</P>
<P>
   Roller coaster control systems may often be referred to as
computers, by Blackie and others. But manufacturers are resolute in
using the term ``programmable logic controller'' to describe the
innards of theme ride technology. ``They look something like a
computer, they act like computers, but they're not as finicky as a
computer,'' said Kristen Carter, spokeswoman for Rockwell
Automation, a major producer of theme ride controls.
</P>
<P>
   Built to focus on their assigned task, these systems are
designed to operate without rest and always with utmost precision,
Ms. Carter said. In contrast, she said, personal computers and
mainframes may pause momentarily if given new instructions and are
more susceptible to temporary failure.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively silent, the Allen-Bradleys are hard at work.
Before each roller coaster takes a lap around the track, the check
and then double-check with a backup program between 100 and 150
features on the ride that may affect safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can dream it, these computers can do it,'' Blackie
said. For example, the station operator cannot dispatch the roller
coaster unless sensors along the track tell the computers that the
route is clear. Called the block system, a standard feature
throughout the industry, two cars cannot enter the same zone
anywhere along the track without making the Allen-Bradleys shut
down the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Before computers, this job was left to human operators who had
to keep a constant eye on the track and their hands on a lever that
served as a break. High technology has taken their place and has
allowed as many as five trains to circulate at one time on some
coasters, compared with only two or three trains under manual
control.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the human element from nearly all aspects of roller
coaster operations is no accident, said Walt Davis, vice president
of Togo International, a roller coaster manufacturer in Cincinnati.
Automation is more reliable than part-time amusement park workers,
who may be faced with disturbances in the station, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make the control systems as idiot-proof as
possible,'' Davis said. ``Suppose an unruly kid distracted the
operators and his friend came over and started pushing buttons. We
don't want to give them the flexibility of changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   But can technology be trusted to control such a potentially
dangerous ride as a roller coaster, particularly given the
knowledge that technology can sometimes go haywire? Davis said that
computers may indeed ``have a bad day'' but that they can be
programmed to tell operators when their circuitry gets
temperamental.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on Riddler's Revenge have their first contact
with the ride's computer while waiting in line, with automated
theme music and warnings to the passengers to pull down their
safety harnesses as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of the chute, the coaster encounters an incline that
inspires even the most fearless of riders to brace their feet
firmly on the floor and squeeze handholds.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the hill, the roller coaster's brains put the
lift system on slowly, so the train can engage without a jolt, then
release it at the designated speed at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   From there, gravity takes over, as does the spinning, lurching
and screaming. Barring any problems, the train will return to the
station three minutes after it left to pick up another load of
passengers. Of course, things do not always run so smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Riddler's Revenge shut down recently,
stranding passengers on the track, technicians found the reason on
a personal computer that sits on a folding table in an unpainted
corner of the control room. Hooked to the mainframe, the computer
indicated with a coded message, deciphered with a logic diagram,
that a fuse had blown in the station.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the repair took only a few minutes, Blackie said, adding
that a similar malfunction 20 years ago could have taken hours to
repair because technology at that time was unable to tell engineers
where a defective part was located.
</P>
<P>
   Though amusement park engineers rely heavily on computers for
maintenance, they do so only to a point. At most parks, workers
inspect roller coasters every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will park a train on the tracks and run another by to see
if there will be an accident,'' said Jeffrey Budgeon, managing
director of planning, engineering and maintenance at Hershey Park
amusement park in Hershey, Pa. ``We want to make sure that the
computer is doing what it is supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If a minor problem develops, the computers that control roller
coasters will merely warn technicians rather than shutting down the
ride. Some obstacles, like those caused by extreme weather, may be
easily fixed. For example, roller coasters run faster in hot
temperatures and more slowly in cold.
</P>
<P>
   On the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York, New
York casino in Las Vegas, Nev., technicians can activate a special
computer program to compensate for the harsh desert climate. One of
the computer's remedies is to adjust the speed of each train as it
begins its descent from the top of the first incline. It can also
slow a roller coaster car in mid-lap by applying the brakes when
sensors tell the computer that the train is speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Express control system also monitors wind gauges
high on the ride. If headwinds get too strong, the computer alerts
technicians because trains may have trouble returning to the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Some roller coasters have the additional protection of infrared
light beams that give an alarm when there is someone or something
blocking the track. If a light beam is broken, the computer stops
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when a bird has flown through or a squirrel
has run across and shuts down the ride,'' said Dennis Speigel,
president of International Theme Park Services, an amusement park
consulting business in Cincinnati. ``But that's OK, because safety
is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been deaths on roller coasters in recent
years, they appear to be more often the result of reckless rider
behavior and safety belt failures than computer malfunctions,
according to reports by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   No one has died as a result of computer failure since 1980, when
a 13-year-old girl was killed in a collision of two trains at the
Great America amusement park in Santa Clara, Calif., according to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   It is most likely that the future of roller coaster technology
will rely even more heavily on computers, Speigel said. Part of
that role, he said, will almost certainly be in operating a new
propulsion system that uses hundreds of electromagnets along the
track instead of gravity and a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Only a computer can control the system since magnets must be
powered in sequence and in microsecond bursts. The few roller
coasters that already employ this technology can accelerate cars to
60 miles an hour as fast as a Porsche, Speigel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is advancing at such a pace now that it's not the
computers that are limiting roller coasters,'' he said. ``It's the
stresses that you can put on a body. You can only take so many
G-forces and so much of your eyes bulging out.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the standard computer in the industry is the
Allen-Bradley. With stacks of motor drives and a tangle of wiring,
the system is used to control everything from ocean liners to most
major amusement park rides.
</P>
<P>
   On the Riddler's Revenge, the influence of technology reaches
all the way to the exit, where passengers can buy photographs of
themselves in mid free fall. A high-speed camera alongside the
track takes pictures each time a train swoops by and immediately
sends the digital images to a computer in the sales booth.
</P>
<P>
   Though computers have an impact on nearly every facet of the
ride, most of the passengers were focused less on what happens
behind the scenes and more on what happens when the forces of
gravity begin to act on a human body that is being inverted and
flung around curves.
</P>
<P>
   Most were like Jackey Escobar, 14, who, after holding a hand
briefly to her stomach, talked about the perils of spinning upside
down. ``I feel like everything is going to come out,'' she said.

   Comedian Frye should have stopped with Nixon
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Kloerc. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, when another president, Richard Nixon,
was in trouble, comedian-impressionist David Frye was all over him
like a 5 o'clock shadow, knocking out a devastatingly twisted Nixon
regularly on Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' and other gigs. But
time has not been kind to Frye, who's back with a Clinton spoof
after years spent _ where? Omaha dinner theater? His Clinton
impression is barely adequate, well below the late Phil Hartman's,
on this series of PG-13 riffs on the president's sex life. Just
when you think he's hit bottom (Clinton double-dates with O.J.
Simpson, whom Frye does like an African-American Walter Brennan),
he finds a new low (Clinton goes to Dr. Ruth for counseling). It's
a laugh-free comedy album that's utterly pathetic.

 &HT;    Welcome, Dolly; we missed you
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turn on the porch light and heat up the coffee: Dolly Parton has
come home. After spending years as one of country music's most
inconsistent artists by splitting her sound between that of
barefoot mountain girl and Hollywood disco diva, she's finally
returned to what she does best: uncluttered Smoky Mountains tunes
that showcase her mockingbird-sweet voice.
</P>
<P>
   Every tune was penned by Parton during a three-month retreat to
the Tennessee cabin where she grew up. She says she ``fasted and
prayed'' and asked God to help her in a time when she didn't know
``exactly what I should be doing in my musical career or in my life
at this point.'' Now, Parton has made the heavenly decision to put
her haunting voice front and center, harking back to her unpolished
days with Porter Wagoner.
</P>
<P>
   The title track opens with a brooding Jimmie Rodgers guitar,
over which Parton warbles a poignant personal tale of midlife
malaise. There's the required whippoorwill ballad (``Blue Valley
Songbird''); a ``Jolene''-inspired story song (complete with
recitation intro) about old man Zeke, who's waiting for the time
``When Jesus Comes Calling for Me''; and even a hard-core bluegrass
tune (``Time and Tears'') that would make Ralph Stanley smile.
</P>
<P>
   There are two drawbacks: Parton can't keep her painted toes out
of her spiked heels entirely, and she throws in a couple of tunes
that are pop drivel (``The Salt in My Tears'' and ``Honky Tonk
Songs''). But, overall, this album is a happy return to Parton's
roots that, surprisingly, are as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton. Decca. 12 tracks.

   As hot as Cam'ron's ``Horse &AMP; Carriage'' single is now, it's
disappointing that his ``Confessions of Fire'' debut album just
simmers. Song after song, Cam'ron relies on the same start-stop
delivery that makes ``Horse'' rhythmically infectious. But
infectious _ song after song, for a total of 19 _ becomes
monotonous. The drone is tolerable, however, thanks to the often
interesting production, the well-written ``D Rugs'' and the
inclusion of popular barker DMX (``Pull It''), Mase and his lazy
bravado (``Horse,'' ``We Got It''), R&AMP;B's Usher (``Feels Good'')
and Faith's incredibly beautiful vocals on ``Prophecy.''

<P>
   On his third album, hopeless romantic Richard Buckner seemingly
equates love with a thousand points of light. The former Atlantan
writes of a ``moonless'' couple, a woman whose ``spark was fine,''
of leaving a lover with ``shadows on my eyes'' and of a dream
couple ``dancing close and drunk in the spray of lights.''
Surprising, then, that Buckner and producer John David Foster have
wrapped this heartbreak in such fiery, rockin' songs. In tunes like
``Believer'' and ``Goner w/ Souvenir,'' acoustic strumming gives
way to molten electric lead playing by Dave Schramm, among others.
Few singer-songwriter albums sound this great. But, in a way, the
hot playing only tends to emphasize Buckner's limited vocal range.
Too bad harmonizer extraordinaire Syd Straw is around for only one
of the 16 cuts.

<P>
   John Michael Montgomery is going to go down as one of the great
country balladeers of our time, for two simple reasons: He keeps
finding great songs for that mellow voice, and he seems stuck in
3/4 speed. The few rockers on his seventh album are largely
forgettable, making the weepers (``Little Cowboys Cry'' and the
title track about the painful souvenir of love lost) and the
midtempo, heart-heavy numbers like ``I Don't Want This Song to
End'' and ``Cover You With Kisses'' really stand out. Maybe he sold
off his dancing shoes at the Grundy County Auction.

   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   If jazz ever gets around to having its own Lollapalooza,
trumpeter Dave Douglas could book the whole thing with his
never-ending array of concept bands. Besides fronting the
Balkan-themed Tiny Bell Trio, a string group, and a combo that
features accordion genius Guy Klucevesek, among others, Douglas
also ventures into the jazz mainstream. This latest endeavor is one
of the player-composer's best, built around a trio of Joni Mitchell
songs (``Roses Blue,'' ``My Old Man'' and ``The Same Situation'')
that provide launching pads for delicately phrased explorations.
The group context (Bill Carrothers, piano; James Genus, bass; Billy
Hart, drums) glows with a subdued intensity, like a sunset through
frosted glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Remember Miles''

<P>
   Shirley Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Verve/Polygram. 9 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The emotional depths explored by this veteran pianist-vocalist
on her latest studio release would require scuba gear for most
artists. Horn's heartfelt valentine to her late mentor, Miles
Davis, is so intense at times that other recent Davis tributes lose
some sheen in comparison. By focusing on tunes such as ``I Fall in
Love Too Easily,'' ``Baby, Won't You Please Come Home'' and ``Basin
Street Blues,'' Horn beautifully conveys the scope of their musical
relationship in discreet, understated tones. She incites shivers
when she sings ``honey from a horn so sweet'' on the closing
number, ``Blue in Green.'' Not only does she pay tribute to Davis,
but to her own immeasurable talent as well.

 &HT;    Korn harvests familiar crop
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite its goofy name _ which, even with the fascist-looking
``K,'' brings to mind not so much post-apocalyptic industrial
mayhem as ``Hee Haw'' or a foot ailment _ Korn manages to kick up a
fairly intimidating ruckus. The Bakersfield, Calif., group mixes
equal parts Metallica and Nine Inch Nails (with a dash of rap) into
a sonically dense stew, then garnishes it with vaguely sinister
imagery. ``Something takes a part of me,'' screams vocalist
Jonathan Davis, before degenerating into a satanic scat.
</P>
<P>
   The formula seems to be working. Korn's 1996 opus, ``Life Is
Peachy,'' debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard albums chart, and the
video for the featured track ``A.D.I.D.A.S.'' became an MTV staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the Leader'' should put the band in the Top 10 again,
since it sticks hard to ``Peachy's'' crunchy, growly blueprint.
Unlike its influences, Korn doesn't seem interested in stretching
its parameters to include ballads, a la Metallica's ``The
Unforgiven,'' or techno beats, such as the ones that propel Nine
Inch Nails' ``The Perfect Drug.'' As such, the relentless,
lumbering groove grows tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, Korn is capable of big statements. ``All in the
Family'' imagines a war of words between a gangster rapper and a
fey, goth-industrial singer (shades of Trent Reznor) and culminates
in the chorus ``I hate you, / You hate me; / It's all in the
family.'' Such adroit observations deserve a more adventurous
musical setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the Leader''
</P>
<P>
   Korn. Immortal/Epic.
</P>
<P>
   13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   Kalifornia kombo delivers more sound and fury, signifying a rut.

 &HT;    `Stella's' groove eclipses lyrics
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basically, all this ``Stella'' soundtrack has is groove. It's
what keeps you into Stevie Wonder and Wyclef Jean's ``Mastablasta
'98'' even while Jean sings the reworking of Wonder's reggae single
in an annoyingly pinched way. It, in hip-hop/soul form, is what
makes Shaggy and Janet Jackson's ``Luv Me, Luv Me'' kind of
interesting long after you realize that all Jackson is really doing
is giggling, cooing and ``ooh boy-ing'' throughout. The groove,
too, in the form of an INXS sample of ``Need You Tonight,'' is what
seems to slow rapper Big Pun down on his team-up with Beenie Man on
``Make Me Sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, who knows or remembers what Boyz II Men (``Your Home
Is in My Heart'') or Mary J. Blige (``Beautiful'') are actually
saying underneath Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' sweeping, pleasing
production?
</P>
<P>
   And coming after the brilliantly penned Babyface soundtrack that
accompanied the first Terry McMillan movie adaptation, ``Waiting to
Exhale,'' expectations for this release are high, lyrically and
musically. But they are met only on the reunion of the original
configuration of London's Soul II Soul (Jazzie B and Caron
Wheeler), back together on ``Free Again'' with more than just
incredible groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' soundtrack
</P>
<P>
   Various artists.
</P>
<P>
   Flyte Tyme. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Stella and anyone else should find groove to spare
here. And that's kind of the problem.

 &HT;    A re-markable performance by Robert Duvall is backed by a strong
supporting cast
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Apostle'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   The greatest actors are magicians. They make themselves
disappear. That's what happens with writer, producer, director and
star Robert Duvall's slow-moving but beautifully observed character
study about a Pentecostal preacher who finds out that being a holy
man and being a good one aren't always the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Texas preacher Euliss ``Sonny'' Dewey making his rounds
from one tent meeting to another, testifying with other white
clergymen, with Hispanics and African-Americans. When his wife
(Farrah Fawcett, solid in a small role) says she wants out of the
marriage, it ignites a violence in Sonny that sends him on the lam
to small-town Louisiana. There, as he restores an old church and
gathers new congregants, the film transforms the idea of redemption
from an elusive concept to something tangible, a hands-on state of
active pursuit. The strong supporting cast includes Billy Bob
Thornton, June Carter Cash and Miranda Richardson. And Duvall is
remarkable. His utter lack of condescension toward Sonny is
bolstered by a scientifically precise understanding of the man.
It's a small miracle. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Recommended movies with Robert Duvall: ``To Kill a
Mockingbird,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``The Godfather Part II,''
``Tender Mercies,'' ``Apocalypse Now,'' ``The Great Santini,''
``Rambling Rose,'' ``Sling Blade.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Here's the curriculum for home schooling
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   School days, school daze.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year again. Time to go back to reading,
writing and 'rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most students (and teachers), the movies love going back
to school. Pictures with classroom or campus settings typically
provide a tempting blend of desirable demographics (all those
14-to-24-year-olds to identify with) and juicy, star-friendly
roles. So get out your No. 2 pencils and prepare to take notes.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE'' (1955)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: Glenn Ford stars as a committed
young teacher facing school board apathy, classroom boredom and
vicious students (led by jaded juvenile delinquent Vic Morrow).
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: Look for a young Sidney Poitier as the
``good'' student and natural leader. More than a decade later, he
switched to teaching in ``To Sir With Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: The movie was banned in
Georgia because it showed desegregated classrooms. The Atlanta
Constitution filed suit and took the case to the Supreme Court in
an attempt to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH'' (1982)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: Loosely based on Cameron
(``Jerry Maguire'') Crowe's undercover expedition into the wilds of
high school in the early 1980s, Amy Heckerling's film offers an
enjoyable array of student types and rising stars (including Phoebe
Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh, daughter of ... Vic Morrow).
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: Sean Penn made his breakthrough with his
memorable surfer-dopehead character.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: This was the first film
for Eric Stoltz, Forest Whitaker and Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``IF ...'' (1968)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: Malcolm McDowell leads a surreal
revolt at a British boys' school.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: McDowell. Soon afterward, he starred in
Stanley Kubrick's ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: Director Lindsay
Anderson did a kind of Further Adventures of Mick, McDowell's
character, in 1973's ``O Lucky Man!''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF'' (1986)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: The title character (Matthew
Broderick) plays hookey in style with Mia Sara and Alan Ruck.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: Director John Hughes, who mined
box-office gold out of a number of high-school-themed flicks,
including ``The Breakfast Club,'' ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``Some
Kind of Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: This is former Vice
President Dan Quayle's favorite movie.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'' (1969)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: In Edinburgh in the 1930s, a
flamboyant teacher (Maggie Smith) makes an indelible _ and possibly
unhealthy _ impression on her chosen circle of students.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: Smith won an Oscar for her performance.
Of her win, the Academy's then-president, Gregory Peck, said,
``This is great. Now you can see it's not rigged.'' (Smith wasn't
the best-known nominee.)
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: Smith won her second
Oscar, this time in the supporting category, in 1978 for
``California Suite.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``LOVE STORY'' (1970)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal
cavort around Harvard Yard while learning that love means ...
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: MacGraw snagged an Oscar nomination and
a marriage proposal from the film's producer, Robert Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: Michael Douglas, Jon
Voight and Beau Bridges were among those who turned down O'Neal's
role. David Birney, Ken Howard and Christopher Walken were among
those who auditioned and failed.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``STAND AND DELIVER'' (1988)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: It's the true story of Jaime
Escalante, a teacher in East Los Angeles who inspired his students
to learn calculus and pass the advanced placement exam. And that's
not the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: Edward James Olmos, who not only got an
Oscar nomination for playing Escalante but also helped finance the
film. It was made for $1.7 million and grossed more than $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: Olmos pulled a Robert
De Niro and gained 40 pounds for the role.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``SCHOOL DAZE'' (1988)
</P>
<P>
   For whom the school bell tolls: Spike Lee's second movie is
about conflicts between assimilation-minded and Afrocentric
students at fictional Mission College (it was filmed at Atlanta's
Morehouse College).
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to succeed: Laurence _ then still going by Larry _
Fishburne, who solidified his post-``Apocalypse Now'' career
playing a campus leader who gives the students a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the head of the class if you knew: At the Los Angeles
premiere, a movie-struck 19-year-old finally got to meet his idol,
Spike Lee. The kid's name? John Singleton.

 &HT;    Mini views: Reviews of the latest out on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Kundun'' (PG-13) _ The first hour of Martin Scorsese's
biopic of the Dalai Lama's early life whets your expectations.
Scorsese channels his prodigious filmmaking skills into a
mesmerizing child's-eye view. He delights in the normal kidness of
the young Dalai Lama. But it's the far superior half of an
overlong, unfocused movie. At its best, ``Kundun'' helps us
rediscover the pleasures of space, silence, simplicity. And it has
moments of breathtaking imagery. Once the film enters the political
realm, with China threatening the borders of Tibet, the air (or the
script) proves too thin to sustain the director's vision. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Newton Boys'' (PG-13) _ Richard Linklater's movie about
the most successful bank robbers in U.S. history engages in some
pretty nifty larceny of its own. It lifts a moment here, a shot
there, a tonal shading wherever from two of the best outlaw
pictures of the late 1960s: ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' The boys, a quartet of rambunctious
Texas brothers, did their robbing between 1919 and 1924, hitting
more than 80 banks. They never killed anyone, never stole from
women or children and, most amazingly of all, lived to a ripe old
age. Best known for low-budget wonders (``Dazed and Confused''),
Linklater shows us that he can handle a Hollywood budget as well as
anyone. The cast includes Ethan Hawke, Matthew McConaughey, Skeet
Ulrich and Vincent D'Onofrio. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Borrowers'' (PG) _ This adaptation of Mary Norton's
classic children's series about teeny folk who live under
floorboards and inside walls is a victim of timing. The plot _ how
the Borrowers team up with a normal-sized boy to foil an evil
developer (John Goodman) _ is a rehash of ``Mouse Hunt'' and the
``Home Alone'' movies. Though the effects are certainly effective,
you sense that the book's charm has been scuttled by the jacked-up,
too-familiar action scenes. Grade: C

<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

LEWIS CARROLL REVISITED: IN A LOOKING GLASS, DARKLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Even by Victorian standards, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson
was a considerable eccentric. When the shy Oxford University
lecturer veered away from his academic interest in mathematics to
publish ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ``Through the
Looking Glass,'' he hid behind the nom de plume of Lewis Carroll
and, even late in life, refused to acknowledge that he was the
author of the best-selling children's classics.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. Dodgson exhibited a lifelong affection for
little girls, seeking them out not only to enjoy their company and
tell them stories, but also to photograph them, at times naked. His
university colleagues thought this bizarre, but he evidently did
not. In a letter to the mother of two of his pre-pubescent models,
he wrote: ``Their innocent unconsciousness is very beautiful, and
gives one a feeling of reverence, as at the presence of something
sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the centenary of Dodgson's death being
celebrated here with exhibitions, conferences, walking tours,
ballets, musicals, television documentaries and new publications,
the personality and obsessions of the man behind the pseudonym are
again being put to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But now, viewed through contemporary eyes, his image is no
longer unblemished. At the very least, his fascination for little
girls is today considered dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a show of his photographs in 1974, and at the time no
one asked me about pedophilia,'' said Colin Ford, the director of
the National Museum of Wales and curator of a new exhibition of
Dodgson's photographs at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
``This year, the question has overshadowed everything. So a quarter
of a century has totally changed our views. We see pedophilia
everywhere nowadays. The world has changed quite dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, though, is among Lewis Carroll experts who believes that,
while clearly obsessive, Dodgson's attraction to young girls was
probably motivated by a highly romanticized view of innocence.
``Victorian England had a clear notion that a girl before puberty
was as pure and divine as was possible to imagine,'' he said.
``Then, when she reached puberty and was ready for marriage, hands
off!''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it is impossible to imagine the unmarried Dodgson _
or Carroll _ writing books for children unless he had a special
affection for them. He was the eldest of 11 children of a Church of
England priest and, as such, grew up in a household of little girls
and boys. Then, in the mid-1850s, he first met the three children
of Harry Liddell, the Dean of Christ Church College, and for the
first time could claim what he called ``child friends'' of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Alice was the youngest and prettiest of the sisters.
And it was thanks to Alice's insistence on being entertained that
``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' was born during a boat trip to
Godstow Lock outside Oxford on July 4, 1862. Alice was 10, 20 years
Dodgson's junior. By the time the story improvised that summer
afternoon appeared in book form in 1865, however, Alice's mother
had banished Dodgson from the Liddell household, perhaps because
she feared that one day Dodgson could become her son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgson was distraught. In his 1996 biography of Lewis Carroll,
Michael Bakewell concludes quite simply that ``he was in love with
Alice.'' Certainly he continued to speak of her as his ``ideal
child friend,'' and in 1872 she was again the unseen muse for
``Through the Looking Glass.'' The book's closing poem includes the
lines: ``Still she haunts me phantomwise/Alice moving under skies/
Never seen by waking eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgson nonetheless continued to befriend and photograph young
girls. In the introduction to a Penguin Books centenary edition of
Carroll's two best-known stories, Hugh Haughton, a lecturer at the
University of York, notes that Dodgson would list his ``child
conquests'' in his diaries. ``Dodgson was the Casanova of the
Victorian nursery,'' he offers.
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading up to his decision to abandon photography
in 1880, Dodgson also began taking photographs of his ``child
friends'' in the nude. ``With children who know me well, and who
regard dress as a matter of indifference, I am very glad (when
mothers permit) to take them in any amount of undress which is
presentable, or even in none (which is more presentable than any
form of undress),'' he wrote in his diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although only four of these nude photographs survive (he
destroyed most of them before his death in Guildford on Jan. 14,
1898), these at least are not remotely salacious and are more
evocative of the cherubic children who routinely appeared in the
Pre-Raphaelite paintings that Dodgson admired. Indeed, the
photograph that experts consider most emotionally _ and perhaps
sexually _ charged is ``Alice Liddell as a Beggar Girl,'' which
shows Alice in ragged clothes, her bare shoulders visible, her head
cocked to one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet Carroll _ and Tennyson (who thought this the most
beautiful photograph he had ever seen) _ surely saw only innocence
in it,'' Ford writes in an essay accompanying the show at the
National Portrait Gallery. ``For them, Alice's costume was simply a
picturesque version of a beggar's clothes, her fixed gaze the
result of having to keep absolutely still.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that his purpose in organizing the show, ``Lewis
Carroll: Through the Viewfinder,'' which runs through Oct. 11, was
simply ``to say he was a great photographer, able to take
illuminating pictures of children more than anyone in the 19th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, individual portraits of girls account for only a
third of the 70 or so photographs in the show, although children do
appear in other group photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgson's skill as a photographer is most evident in the
portraits taken in his rooftop studio in Oxford where, unlike many
of his contemporaries, he invariably captured his subjects in
informal and natural positions, as in his famous photograph of a
later favorite, Alexandra Kitchen, asleep on a couch. ``His ability
in establishing relaxed relationships with his sitters means that,
though they had to sit still for just as long as they did with
other photographers of the time, they mostly look calm, confident
and not at all artificial,'' Ford writes.
</P>
<P>
   If the children in particular seem at ease, it was also because
the stammering Dodgson, who was socially dysfunctional with most
adults, felt at home in their company. In several later memoirs,
some of his young sitters recalled the fun they had visiting his
studio and dressing up to be photographed. And it was with them
that Dodgson evidently felt freer to develop his art;
significantly, he always referred to himself as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems reasonable to wonder whether Dodgson developed his
interest in photography as a way of drawing young girls into his
company. Certainly, he remained attached to his ``child friends''
after giving up photography, even sketching some naked girls as
late as 1885. In 1892, at the age of 60, he wrote delightedly of
having ``girlfriends'' between the ages of 10 and 24 ``to brighten
my lonely life by the sea,'' which, he said, was ``one of the great
advantages of being an old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to suggest that he did nothing but dream of young
girls is to forget that, as Carroll, he wrote more children's
books, notably ``The Hunting of the Snark'' and ``Sylvie and
Bruno,'' and as Dodgson, he published some 200 books and pamphlets,
many of them popular works on mathematics and logic. Reflecting his
conservative view of life, he also published some 50 pamphlets in
opposition to a series of proposed social reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a different _ at least more sentimental _ Dodgson who
comes into focus ``through the viewfinder.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ford, any sexuality seen in his photographs remains a
product of our age. He notes that popular 19th-century erotic
photographs were seen as pornographic in Victorian times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, they seem harmless enough, exploitative of their models
perhaps, but almost charming and surely unarousing,'' he writes.
``These once-shocking images have become safe, while Carroll's
always innocent nude children have become dangerous and
threatening.''

<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   Remember rock'n'roll? Remember feminism? Those were the warm-up
acts. They were cultural revolutions of power and moment, but the
main attraction, the baby boomers' ultimate coup and 21st century's
first Big Idea, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   What? you say. Bigger than the invention of the teenager? Bigger
than civil rights? Bigger than the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ because the last, best thing the baby boomers are
going to do in this world they've created in their own image is to
grow very old.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit us yet, but soon old people will be the happening
demographic _ between the years 2010 and 2030, the over-65
population in the U.S. will increase by 75 percent, to more than 69
million souls.
</P>
<P>
   To put their consumer spending power in perspective, consider
that the Census Bureau estimates there are now just under 20
million 15- to 19-year-old ne'er-do-wells afoot. And just look at
how much marketing hype they get, given that most of them don't
have jobs, let alone estates.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a brave new world in which baby boomers redefine what it
means to be old.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly we know in 1998, our parents and grandparents,
contracted with the government (via the Social Security Act of
1935) and private industry (pension plans had become widespread by
the 1930s) to work with Protestant doggedness for 20 years or more
and then to STOP completely and play golf or else sit in a chair
and watch the neighbors come and go from the front window.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current rate of increase in both life expectancy and
quality of life, that scenario doesn't look so viable anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be-elderly baby boomers haven't worked in
anticipation of a gold watch and a fare-thee-well at 65. Unlike
their parents, they haven't worked for one company, they've
accumulated their own irritatingly-complex-tax-situation estates,
and they will no longer be put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible that by 2030, the golf-and-bridge model of
senior citizenship will be a thing of the past. For one thing,
older Americans will want to work. In some cases they'll stay with
their jobs longer. In other cases they'll work part-time, perhaps
as interns, often as volunteers, in entirely new fields, or they'll
undertake the advanced study of fascinating but unremunerative
things (comparative lit, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   The concept of senior leisure will evolve, too, away from
passive, pleasant time fillers toward more dynamic activities: a
sail around the world, say, instead of an Alaskan cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Work, pleasure, or a combination _ it all depends on your
priorities, and the way things are headed, you'll have time for
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to say `elderly' or `senior.' We prefer the term
`Third Age,''' says a spokesman for Third Age Media, which operates
a Web site (www.thirdage.com) for the 50-plus American.
</P>
<P>
   The division of ages into quarters of a hundred is bold and apt:
Recapture the under-65 set (the 50-plussers) and you reinvigorate
the concept of aging entirely. (Also ignore the fact that 0 to 25
isn't exactly a lifestyle category, though no less so than 25 to
50).
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of such thinking will be your 60-year-old college
students and consumers of retail goods. Pretty soon the middle
years will be the necessary evil, and retirement will come to seem
the be-all in addition to the end-all.
</P>
<P>
   There's no innate reason why it shouldn't. Among the Dagara of
West Africa, old age and childhood are held to be the important
times in life, the times when one does great work.
</P>
<P>
   Children and the ``elders,'' being chronologically closer to the
spirit world, hang out together and discuss the meaning of life,
while those in their middle years are seen as more or less taking
up space, providing little more than manual labor to feed the wise
children and elders.
</P>
<P>
   This might not be such a bad model for 21st-century America,
after all: Live like hell in the First Age, pay for it in the
Second, and do it right this time in the Third.

yourself an elder and go for broke _ the statistics are in your
favor. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

SUPPORTERS OF FLAG AMENDMENT PLAN AD BLITZ AS SENATE VOTE NEARS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of a proposed constitutional amendment
that would give Congress the power to ban flag desecration said
.MDNM/Wednesday they would launch a television ad campaign to
pressure Senate opponents to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The television spots, sponsored by the Citizens Flag Alliance, a
coalition of 130 civic and veterans' groups pushing the amendment,
will feature celebrities such as Tommy Lasorda, general manager of
the Los Angeles Dodgers; entertainer Wayne Newton; and John
Schneider, an actor who played Duke on the television show ``Dukes
of Hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the ads, to be aired next week in California,
Illinois, Maryland, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington
state, Tommy Lasorda, seated in baseball bleachers, tells people
that ``Our flag is precious and deserving of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Another commercial uses images of flags burning,
interspersed with a young boy reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
The ad ends with the message: ``When they desecrate the flag and
you stay silent, they burn us all. Break the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, chairman of the
Indianapolis-based flag alliance, told .MDSD/.MDNM/a news
conference that the organization intends to ``reclaim and restore
the Constitution'' by gathering support for the amendment. If
approved, it would become the 28th amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that burning the flag was a
right protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of this and past efforts to outlaw malicious
destruction of the flag say it would trample an individual's right
of self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, however, argued that founding fathers such as Thomas
Jefferson and James Madison never intended flag desecration as a
constitutional right. The amendment, he added, would let the
American people protect the Stars and Stripes and take ``control of
the flag away from the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wheeler, president of the Citizens Flag
Alliance.MDSU/.MDNM/, said the organization would continue to buy
television time until the Senate votes. Group leaders said they
have spent $2 million so far on advertising, but would not say how
much more they planned to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said the alliance hoped pressure from constituents would
convince opponents such as Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., to support the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle, who voted against a similar amendment in 1995, will
do so again, his spokeswoman, Molly Rowley, said. He ``thinks flag
burning is repugnant,'' Rowley added, but believes it is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign also will target Illinois, where Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, a Democrat, voted against the 1995 proposal. Her
spokesman, Michael Briggs, said she would not bow to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun has previously said that destroying the flag is
``a horrible and reprehensible act,'' but ``foremost among the
values that make our country great is the right to express one's
view, no matter how unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The very values this flag symbolizes would be diminished if
the Congress dictates how it is to be treated,'' she said in a
statement earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment reads: ``The Congress shall have power to
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The House approved it last year, 310-114. If passed by
two-thirds of the Senate _ or 67 senators _ then 38 states would
have to ratify the amendment before it could be added to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Congress tried to bypass the Supreme Court's 1989 decision with
a federal law prohibiting flag burning, but the high court ruled
the federal law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/In 1995, Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y. led an
unsuccessful push to amend the constitution to overrule the court's
decision. It passed the House in a 312-120 vote, but fell three
votes shy of a two-thirds majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 amendment would have given both states and Congress the
power to prevent desecration of the flag. But the current proposal
only would allow Congress to ban the malicious destruction of the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   If the amendment is passed, Congress would then have to approve
a bill that would ban flag desecration and make the act a federal
crime.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snow, R-Maine, is one of the 64 senators in favor
of the amendment. Earlier this year, she said the amendment
protects a ``national emblem of the world's greatest democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said almost all the states, the federal government and the
majority of the American people support protecting the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our flag should be treated with respect and with care,'' she
said. ``It is altogether just that we try to ensure that it is
publicly displayed with pride, dignity and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the amendment criticize it as an attack on the Bill
of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way, a liberal group promoting First
Amendment rights, said in July during the release of that
organization's ad campaign against the amendment, that there are
questions of interpretation that will have to be settled if the
amendment is passed, such as the definition of desecration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the planned TV blitz, an hour-long television
show featuring celebrity supporters of the amendment began airing
on July 26 in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C.,
and will continue until Aug..MDSD/.MDNM/ 23. The Citizens Flag
Alliance.MDSD/.MDNM/ also sponsored newspaper and radio ads in
South Dakota and Utah that are expected to run until the end of
August.

<P>
   Remember rock'n'roll? Remember feminism? Those were the warm-up
acts. They were cultural revolutions of power and moment, but the
main attraction, the baby boomers' ultimate coup and 21st century's
first Big Idea, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   What? you say. Bigger than the invention of the teenager? Bigger
than civil rights? Bigger than the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ because the last, best thing the baby boomers are
going to do in this world they've created in their own image is to
grow very old.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit us yet, but soon old people will be the happening
demographic _ between the years 2010 and 2030, the over-65
population in the U.S. will increase by 75 percent, to more than 69
million souls.
</P>
<P>
   To put their consumer spending power in perspective, consider
that the Census Bureau estimates there are now just under 20
million 15- to 19-year-old ne'er-do-wells afoot. And just look at
how much marketing hype they get, given that most of them don't
have jobs, let alone estates.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a brave new world in which baby boomers redefine what it
means to be old.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly we know in 1998, our parents and grandparents,
contracted with the government (via the Social Security Act of
1935) and private industry (pension plans had become widespread by
the 1930s) to work with Protestant doggedness for 20 years or more
and then to STOP completely and play golf or else sit in a chair
and watch the neighbors come and go from the front window.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current rate of increase in both life expectancy and
quality of life, that scenario doesn't look so viable anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be-elderly baby boomers haven't worked in
anticipation of a gold watch and a fare-thee-well at 65. Unlike
their parents, they haven't worked for one company, they've
accumulated their own irritatingly-complex-tax-situation estates,
and they will no longer be put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible that by 2030, the golf-and-bridge model of
senior citizenship will be a thing of the past. For one thing,
older Americans will want to work. In some cases they'll stay with
their jobs longer. In other cases they'll work part-time, perhaps
as interns, often as volunteers, in entirely new fields, or they'll
undertake the advanced study of fascinating but unremunerative
things (comparative lit, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   The concept of senior leisure will evolve, too, away from
passive, pleasant time fillers toward more dynamic activities: a
sail around the world, say, instead of an Alaskan cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Work, pleasure, or a combination _ it all depends on your
priorities, and the way things are headed, you'll have time for
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to say `elderly' or `senior.' We prefer the term
`Third Age,''' says a spokesman for Third Age Media, which operates
a Web site (www.thirdage.com) for the 50-plus American.
</P>
<P>
   The division of ages into quarters of a hundred is bold and apt:
Recapture the under-65 set (the 50-plussers) and you reinvigorate
the concept of aging entirely. (Also ignore the fact that 0 to 25
isn't exactly a lifestyle category, though no less so than 25 to
50).
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of such thinking will be your 60-year-old college
students and consumers of retail goods. Pretty soon the middle
years will be the necessary evil, and retirement will come to seem
the be-all in addition to the end-all.
</P>
<P>
   There's no innate reason why it shouldn't. Among the Dagara of
West Africa, old age and childhood are held to be the important
times in life, the times when one does great work.
</P>
<P>
   Children and the ``elders,'' being chronologically closer to the
spirit world, hang out together and discuss the meaning of life,
while those in their middle years are seen as more or less taking
up space, providing little more than manual labor to feed the wise
children and elders.
</P>
<P>
   This might not be such a bad model for 21st-century America,
after all: Live like hell in the First Age, pay for it in the
Second, and do it right this time in the Third.
</P>
<P>
   And after age 75, by the year 2030, you might as well call
yourself an elder and go for broke _ the statistics are in your
favor. &QL;

 &HT;    American takes off after Southwest's customers
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ American Airlines is still two weeks away from taking
off with new service between Austin and Dallas and Houston, but
already it's waging a war of words with rival Southwest Airlines,
the biggest carrier at Robert Mueller Municipal Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Aug. 31, American will offer 14 daily flights between
Austin and Love Field in Dallas, where Southwest is based. On Sept.
9, the airline will start three daily flights between Austin and
Houston Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, American mailed tens of thousands of postcards to
American frequent flier members in Austin, Dallas and Houston,
offering them 2,500 extra miles for every five segments they fly
between Austin and either Dallas Love Field or Houston Hobby
between Aug. 31 and Dec. 15. The airline's top-tier frequent fliers
are being offered additional inducements to fly the routes.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also has launched a newspaper advertising campaign
in the three cities, using the theme ``To Austin with Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are competitors in the marketplace, but we fully
expect to capture our share,'' said American spokes man Tim Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the airline's sales staff also is meeting with travel
agencies to let them know abut the new service, touting the
differences between American and Southwest _ reserved and
first-class seating and the broader scope of its frequent flier
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based airline currently offers jet service only
to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Houston's George
Bush Intercontinental Airport, rather than the two urban-area
airports.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, the Wright Amendment has restricted service
at Love Field, just north of downtown Dallas, to flights to and
from other Texas cities and four adjoining states _ Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The law was designed to
decrease competition for D/FW and to increase air safety between
the two airports. But last year, Congress added three more states
that can be served from Love Field: Alabama, Kansas and
Mississippi, prompting airlines like American to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline analysts said they think American will become a
major player in the market between Austin and Dallas and Houston _
a market long dominated by Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Airlines can do pretty much anything it wants to
do,'' said Edward Starkman, a director of Warburg Dillon Read, an
investment banking firm. ``It would be understating it to say they
have a strong frequent-flier base in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin has been a good market for American. With the new
service, it will have 42 daily flights out of Austin, including
nonstops to Chicago, San Jose, Calif., Miami and Los Angeles. It
also is adding daily one-stop service to New York's LaGuardia
Airport beginning Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   American's market share has steadily grown, rising 4 percent
over the past year to 27.6 percent, according to the City of Austin
Department of Aviation, and currently it is Mueller's
second-biggest carrier behind Southwest. Through July, Southwest
had 33.9 percent of the Austin market, about the same as it did a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they must offer service to Love Field to
fend off competition. But they said expansion to a second Dallas
airport threatens the viability of 18,000-acre D/FW.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're philosophically opposed to that, we do need to
compete,'' Smith said. ``Austin is a logical first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Southwest Airlines officials say they are ready
to handle additional competition from American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest isn't new to competition from American or another
airline,'' said Melanie Jones, spokeswoman for Southwest. ``We
compete with other airlines in every market we serve.''

<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL;

<P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

 &HT;    Embassy bombings might lead to company growth
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS _ When Americans are targets, Wackenhut Corp.
has a business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It's the nature of Palm Beach Gardens-based Wackenhut Corp.'s
business of guarding people and places around the world. So when
terrorists simultaneously bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7, killing 250 people, including 12 Americans, the
company saw it as potential for growth in government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These East African countries were considered a low threat.
Because of those low levels of threat or disturbance, it allowed
for those countries to be open as a target for terrorism,'' said
Alan Bernstein, Wackenhut president of North American operations
and a member of its board of directors. ``Those countries that are
complaining aren't upset at the United States. They're worried that
they will be target.''
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut, which employs 300 at its headquarters in Palm Beach
Gardens, protects 27 embassies in conjunctionalong with the U.S.
Marines contingent stationed in those locations. The embassies are
scattered around the world, but Wackenhut was not stationed in
Kenya or Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The company also protects U.S. operations in 26 other countries,
mainly military bases, Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 250 U.S. embassies, consulates and other
posts, including missions, which are lower-level State Department
offices where visas are issued and where Americans can go if they
have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut (NYSE: WAK, $19.81) doesn't break out its revenue from
the State Department for protecting embassies. But the business has
grown from the end of 1997, when the company stood guard at 19
embassies, according to Wackenhut's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Its revenue from international operations, which includes
embassies and missions, improved from $146 million in 1996 to
almost $174 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That business is one that's growing. And as embassies are
re-evaluated, we should get more of that business,'' Bernstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like being a doctor. No one wants to go to the
doctor but you have to at times. We, as a company ,are a necessary
component of the 21st century,'' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, CTC International Group of Palm Beach, gathers
foreign intelligence for Fortune 500 companies. But company
Chairman Frederick Rustmann said he doesn't see growth in his
business from the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a lot of calls from (reporters), including CNN.
But I don't see any new business because we don't handle
security,'' Rustmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The growth for Wackenhut will come after the State Department
finishes reevaluating the need for additional security at
embassies, Bernstein said. He stopped short of guaranteeing that
Wackenhut would be brought in because the State Department could
decide to beef up the embassy structures.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernstein has He hopes that Wackenhut will find itself in
the new mix of security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six weeks ago, the threat in Canada was one of the lowest in
the world,'' he said. ``Though it isn't on the same par as a Saudi
Arabia, there's still a potential for terrorism. It can no longer
be considered a low threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut (NYSE: WAK) closed at $19.81, up 19 cents a share.

 &HT;    I discovered America
 &HT;    By Martin Reeder
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: West Palm Beach attorney Martin Reeder pedaled
across the country this summer as part of the GTE Big Ride, a
seven-week trip benefiting the American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   We made it! The GTE Big Ride Across America, the largest bicycle
crossing of the North American continent, is over. About 700 of the
724 riders who started in Seattle on June 15 crossed the finish
line Aug. 1 in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Together, we rode 3,350 miles and raised $6.5 million to aid the
American Lung Association's fight against lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to have taken part in the Big Ride Across America and
am grateful for the support of the 102 family members, friends and
colleagues who made my trip possible by donating $10,300 to the
Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   Since I came home to West Palm Beach, everyone has asked about
the Big Ride. The experience is fresh and vivid, and I will talk
about it as long as anyone cares to listen.
</P>
<P>
   I sense, however, that most of those who ask about the trip are
looking more for wisdom than facts. They want to know what I have
learned about America and about life. How have I been affected by
the experience of escaping the confines of my regular existence for
seven weeks to ride a bicycle across America?
</P>
<P>
   I have no firm answers. I hope to have more insight after having
some time to reflect on the summer's journey and to reexamine my
familiar routines in the light of that experience. I can, however,
offer a few of my stronger impressions.
</P>
<P>
   There is a different and wonderful America beyond the urban and
suburban areas that most of us call home. It is the America
described by John Steinbeck in ``Travels with Charley'' and William
Least Heat Moon in ````Blue Highways.'' It is an America where
people still open their hearts and homes to strangers without
having to curb their generosity because of fear of violent crime,
where people do not seem to be forever in a hurry and where people
are almost uniformly more relaxed and less irritable.
</P>
<P>
   The computer revolution is giving more of us the option to live
in a small town without sacrificing economic opportunities or
cutting ourselves off from the knowledge and diversity formerly
available only in great cities. If you like small towns and can
afford to do so, consider moving to one in a beautiful place. Even
if you choose to remain an urbanite, spend some weekends or
vacation time visiting rural America. It will make you feel good
about your country. Ride a bicycle if you can. It's the best way to
really get in touch with the land. On a bike you can smell the
earth and the flowers, taste the breeze and feel the land's
undulations in your legs.
</P>
<P>
   The American West is a big place, and there is still plenty of
wilderness out there. Go see Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. Learn
about the Indians who loved these magnificent places for thousands
of years. Honor the heritage of the American Indian by regarding
the Earth as a sacred place, to be lovingly cared for and passed
down by us to the next generation in better condition than we
received it.
</P>
<P>
   The human mind and body are amazing creations. The body can
perform almost any task the mind wills. I saw a man with paralyzed
legs ride 3,350 miles over long, steep mountains by turning a hand
crank mounted in front of his chest. I saw a woman with two
transplanted lungs, whose muscles had deteriorated from taking
anti-rejection drugs, ride day after day from daybreak until dusk.
I saw a mother of five, whose doctors thought she would be dead by
now, ride across America breathing oxygen from a bottle strapped to
her bike. I saw a man whose right leg had been amputated at the hip
ride up some of the steepest mountains in America, his face a
picture of indomitable courage as his left leg pumped like a
magnificent piston.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of us on the Big Ride were blessed with strong,
healthy bodies that enabled us to complete the journey without
requiring such heroic displays, there was enough adversity to test
each of us in some way.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the biggest challenge was the weather. Try changing a
flat tire on a high mountain pass in sleet and freezing rain when
the cold has robbed the feeling from your hands. Try descending 10
miles on an icy mountain road in a gusting crosswind after the rain
has soaked your clothes and your body is shivering so hard that you
cannot hold the handlebars steady. Try riding a hundred miles in
the hot sun, being rained on all night until you are too soaked to
sleep, and then getting up to ride another hundred miles the next
day. Try living in a tent and sharing portable toilets with 800
other people for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All of this really happened _ and much more _ yet I can honestly
say that the Big Ride was a wonderful experience that I will always
remember.
</P>
<P>
   I think that most of us had a wonderful time despite the
adversities because the people who did the ride were special people
_ each so committed to riding across the country that nothing could
stand in his or her way. Achieving the goal required each of us to
surpass personal limits that we seldom approach in our ordinary
lives.
</P>
<P>
   First, we had to overcome all of the sensible reasons why we
could not or should not do the ride. Second, most of us had to
overcome apprehensions about taking so much time off from work.
Third, each of us had to raise more money (a minimum of $6,000)
than almost any of us had ever done before. Fourth, we had to train
for the ride and acquire all of the necessary equipment. Finally,
we had to do the ride itself, which meant getting up each day and
riding another 80 or 100 miles no matter what the weather was like
or how tired we were.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamers, the uncommitted, the unresourceful, the whiners
and the naysayers of this world were almost entirely absent from
our ranks. They never made it even to Seattle. The 724 riders were,
instead, a group of ``can do'' folks for whom adversities were just
challenges to be shared and overcome.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget the day we rolled into White Sulphur
Springs, Mont., cold and wet after climbing over the Big Belt
Mountains in freezing rain. Riders on the verge of hypothermia took
over the town laundromat, dried their wet clothes, hopped back on
their bikes and rode another 60 miles to Harlowton.
</P>
<P>
   Or the day we crossed the Continental Divide at MacDonald Pass
in sleet and freezing rain and then descended into Helena, stopping
at a Wal-Mart store long enough to buy rubber gloves and enough
warm clothing to get through another 50 miles to our destination.
</P>
<P>
   Or the two riders who borrowed rusty old Huffy bikes after their
bikes were stolen in Huron, S.D., and rode them 60 miles until
their bicycles were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Or the woman who separated her shoulder during the ride one day
and rode another 50 miles in that condition.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Castro, my closest friend on the ride, called me at work a
couple of days ago to see how I was handling being back in the real
world. I told him how much I appreciate each day with my daughters
after being away from them so long and how wonderful it is to sleep
in a real bed again and to enjoy a quiet evening with a friend,
eating good food and listening to good music in a cool, dry house
with a front door that opens and closes on hinges instead of a
zipper.
</P>
<P>
   We talked of returning to work and spinning our wheels as we
tried to decide where to start.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we came to the heart of what we both wanted to talk
about. We talked about the special bond that exists between us and
the others with whom we shared the vivid, exciting and, yes,
glorious days of the Big Ride Across America. Legs and hearts were
strong, and we lived each day intensely, wringing every bit of
triumph, joy, challenge and passion it had to offer _ sharing it
all together and laughing all the way.
</P>
<P>
   There will be another Big Ride next year. Remember what Helen
Keller said: ``Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at
all.'' My advice _ if you love to ride a bike, want to see America
and are willing to help the Lung Association _ is to go for it. You
won't regret it.

 &HT;    Dell defies PC industry with 62% profit jump
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Seemingly impervious to weaknesses in the
personal computer industry, Dell Computer Corp. reported Tuesday,
August 18, a 62 percent increase in profits during the second
quarter to $346 million on record sales of $4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per diluted share were 50 cents, up 72 percent from the
second quarter last year and 4 cents higher than the consensus of
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a two-for-one stock split effective
Sept. 4 for shareholders of record on Aug. 28. It is the sixth
split in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an outstanding quarter,'' Ashok Kumar of Piper Jaffray
said Tuesday. ``There's no two ways to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares dropped $1 to $109.56 1/4 in Nasdaq trading
Tuesday. The results were released after the markets closed. Shares
jumped about $4 in after-hours trading, according to wire reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which takes orders directly from customers and builds
computers after they are paid for, continued its habit of
outperforming its competitors and the PC industry overall. Industry
shipments of PCs worldwide increased a mediocre 7 percent during
the April-June quarter, according to International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices for PCs and the Asian economic crisis were among the
reasons cited by Compaq Computer Corp., IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co.
for disappointing results during their most recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Dell chief executive Michael Dell said in an interview Tuesday
that while the company's average selling price of about $2,400 for
all computers slipped 11 percent from the year-ago quarter, the
decline reflected a drop in component costs. Moreover, component
costs fell faster than Dell lowered prices, which helped preserve
Dell's profit margin, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's gross margin, the difference between revenue and
production costs, increased to 22.7 percent from 22.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe costs of components such as DRAM memory and
hard drives may stabilize in coming months. But for now the
declining prices favor Dell, because its competitors typically have
inventories of machines that were built with higher-priced
components.
</P>
<P>
   If they lower prices on those machines, they sacrifice profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell's model is optimal for that type of business
environment,'' said Cody Acree of Southwest Securities in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Internet sales increased from $2 million a day a year ago
to more than $6 million, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell said that the company's performance was strong in
all products and regions. Revenue increased 50 percent to nearly $3
billion in the Americas, 73 percent in Europe and 34 percent in
Asia-Pacific, where analysts estimate total industry shipments
declined by 9 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that kind of improvement is very much the anomaly,''
Acree said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which introduced a new lines of workstations and servers
this summer, said business for all its enterprise products more
than doubled for the seventh straight quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell said the company is being considered in a growing
number of bids for large corporate accounts in part because Dell's
computers are winning industry awards.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's performance intensifies pressure on Compaq, its
cross-state rival and the world's biggest PC company.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates by Dataquest show Dell in a virtual tie with Compaq
for No. 1 in U.S. PC shipments at about 1 million units in the
second quarter. But Compaq officials say those estimates fail to
include about 500,000 computers that were sold by retailers and
resellers during that quarter, when the company stopped shipping
for nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Compaq stopped shipping and cut prices to thin a
backlog of unsold computers. IBM and HP were forced to follow with
their own price cuts or risk losing market share.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that Compaq will have considerably more
flexibility in cutting prices in coming months because it can
subsidize the cuts with revenues from Digital Equipment Corp.,
which it acquired this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dell scoffed at that threat, at least in the immediate future.
He said Digital wasn't profitable during the first six months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to make money before they can use it to subsidize
something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is growing in terms of employees as well. It has 14,000 in
the Austin area and 20,000 worldwide.

   ``I misled people . . . I did not volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``I lied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on too long . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's one thing we can all agree on. But whose fault is
it this has gone on too long? Is it really the fault of Ken Starr,
Linda Tripp or ``a politically inspired lawsuit''?
</P>
<P>
   No. It has gone on for too long because you looked the American
people in the eye in January, wagged your finger and lied: ``I did
not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' And you
went on lying for seven months, until a blue dress backed you into
a corner and left no choice but to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And then you couldn't even muster one simple, heartfelt,
unlawyerlike sentence: ``I'm sorry I lied to you.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to scream as I listened to Clinton's weasel-worded,
whiny confessional Monday night. This should have been a time for
profound and deep contrition. This should have been a time to
reflect on what you have done to the American people and not what
others have done to you. This should not have been a time for
finger-pointing _ for acting like a 6-year-old child, who, by the
way, may comprehend better than you, Mr. President, that the truth
should have been told in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Instead you gave us more defiance than remorse, more
defensiveness than self-blame.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you are a human being who was put in an impossible
situation, forced to answer ``questions about my private life,
questions no American citizen would ever want to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ken Starr is a ferociously partisan ``independent
counsel,'' a man who was prepared to file an amicus brief for Paula
Jones before he took the job.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the mainstream press has turned Hard Copy on this story,
pursuing it with a relentlessness and vigor they could never quite
rally for the Iran-contra affair. Yes, Ronald Reagan got away with
saying ``I can't recall'' whether he authorized arms shipments to
Iran. Now they're naming airports after him.
</P>
<P>
   I'm furious about all that, too.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that is any excuse for what you did.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr didn't force you to have an affair with a woman then
only three years older than your daughter is now. He didn't force
you to abandon everything you understand about women in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Your political enemies didn't force you to hang out to dry your
aides, friends, supporters, wife and daughter. For seven months you
stood by and watched their loyal suffering, a heartless wager that
you wouldn't get caught.
</P>
<P>
   So don't give us any more of this ``Ken Starr made me do it''
routine. Don't try to tell us your deposition in the Paula Jones
case was ``legally accurate,'' or insult our intelligence with any
convoluted nonsense about how the acts in question weren't really
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't want you to lose your job over this, not
based on what we know so far anyway. But we don't want any more
lies or half-truths, either.
</P>
<P>
   You're right, Mr. President, this has gone on too long. This
unprecedented witch hunt, this National Enquirer media frenzy, this
national soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it is your lie that has gone on too long

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the tima you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nmw that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

 &HT;    Making the adjustment
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Little Leagues to college baseball, players grow up using
aluminum bats. But anyone who has hopes of reaching the big leagues
must learn to work with a wood bat as much as possible. And the
adjustment from an aluminum to wooden bat can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new experience,'' said North Carolina Wesleyan senior
Andy Jones of his first Coastal Plain League summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is now in his second year with the Rocky Mount Rockfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to hit it on the barrel. I just wanted to try and
make solid contact,'' he said. ``But after the first couple of
weeks, I got used to it. It's just an adjustment to try and hit it
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockfish teammate Jason Dubois seems to have made that
adjustment, having stroked 17 homers and knocked in 51 runs this
summer with the wood bat. Rockfish manager Bob Keller attributes
that to dedication and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is Jason was forced to make a mechanical
adjustment and use his hands more, let the hands, the pitcher and
the ball do the work,'' Keller said. ``He found some success doing
that. One of the biggest mistakes guys get when they get that wood
bat in their hands, they start to over-rotate their upper body and
get a lot of excessive movement, that they have to muscle up a
little more. If you can learn to swing with the hands, you're going
to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If a player can make the adjustment, it can pay off in the long
run, even if he never gets a chance to play professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps a lot, especially for the guys that come out
of this league swinging a wood bat and then go home and continue
it,'' Keller said. ``Swinging that wood bat is going to help them
increase their bat speed. Guys with good bat speed can have more
holes in their swing and get away with it, to a certain amount.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the case for Jones, who started the spring
college season on a hot streak, stroking the ball around the field.
But at the end of the year, his 1998 numbers were slightly lower
than his previous year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a big benefit,'' former Wesleyan coach
Mike Fox said. ``But hitting is such a difficult thing. He started
out real well, but then had some ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed: Using a wood bat helped him early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it really (helped),'' Jones said. ``I felt
like I played in a real solid league. When you come back with the
aluminum, you feel like you can mash. You feel like you've got
unbelievable bat speed. Then after a month or two, it's back to
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bat or the player?
</P>
<P>
   Players today are getting bigger and stronger. Just a generation
ago, a player as tall as 6-9 J.R. Richard was an anomaly. Now, it's
rare to see any major leaguers shorter than 5-11. In addition,
there's no doubt that today's players are often on a strict
strength program. Mark McGwire's forearms have been measured at 17
inches in diameter. That's larger than the average man's neck size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line,'' Keller said. ``You're starting to look at
a lot of players in the big leagues like McGwire, (Jose) Canseco
and some of these guys that have been on serious weight programs
for years. It used to be in the old days, it wasn't acceptable to
be a baseball player and a guy who lifted weights. Now there's been
a strong trend to that. You have a lot of guys taking weight
protein supplements, creatin, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, some of the most important coaches in collegiate
athletics are the strength coaches, in every sport. Whether it's
football, baseball, basketball, the strength coaches are some of
the most influential coaches that you have. I know at Georgia
State, we take that guy real seriously and he has our guys on a
strong weight-conditioning program.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubois knows the combination of stronger athletes and lighter
bats has had an effect on the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to get bigger,'' Dubois said. ``But they're
making the bats lighter, so it's more to the hitter's advantage. So
it gives them the upper edge.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how quickly baseball's hitting records would
fall if McGwire or Tony Gwynn were allowed to use an aluminum bat.
It's conceivable that the single-season home run record could reach
100, or hitters might break the .400 mark on a routine basis.
</P>
<P>
   Fans love homers and high-scoring games, but would the prospect
of five- or six-hour slugfests get old in a hurry?
</P>
<P>
   What can be done?
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, along with other organizations, is taking a close look
at the continued development of bats and is trying to bring
aluminum bats more in line with wood.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee is examining the
issue this week. Fox, named head coach at the University of North
Carolina this spring, recently completed a six-year term on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time was spent on bats, `` Fox said. ``I hadn't
given it much thought, but after seeing some video and statistics,
it got me to thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Breidenthal, staff liaison with the NCAA Baseball Rules
Committee, says the committee is looking at a conflicting issue:
trying to ensure player safety while preserving the integrity of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard decision to make,'' Breidenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the NCAA has tried to develop a measurement of
a bat's performance, called a BPF. It's a measure of the rebound of
a ball off a bat shot from a cannon at a set speed. The BPF has
been measured at speeds as high as 110 mph, although the committee
is trying to set a limit of 93 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the National Federation of State High School
Associations announced new guidelines for bat performance, based on
wood bats. The new standards will be announced by Oct. 31 and take
effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   What 1998 Division I batting leaders would have accomplished
with aluminum bats, based on a 162-game season:
</P>
<P>
   Batting average: .464, Pat Magness, Wichita State (major league
record: .426, Nap Lajoie, 1901)
</P>
<P>
   RBI: 295, Damon Thames, Rice (major league record: 190, Hack
Wilson, 1930)
</P>
<P>
   Home runs: 102, Kevin Mench, Delaware (major league record: 61,
Roger Maris, 1961)
</P>
<P>
   Doubles: 99, Robert Gonzales, New Mexico (major league record:
67, Earl Webb, 1931)

 &HT;    COLUMN: A celebration to remember, under the sky
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ Some days, the house just isn't big enough;
only the outdoors can hold the spirit of celebration that crackles
and fizzes all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of those days _ a blue-sky Sunday in August, a day
to mark a boxful of family birthdays, including those of Gran Lyn;
our daughter Cami Foley; her full-time 2-year-old twins, Nicholas
and Alexander, and her fabulous daughters, Lauren and Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
   What a day for celebration. Dry, breezy, morning temperatures in
the 60s. Pre-fall. A great day for eating with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   To prime ourselves for the big afternoon feast, we rose early
and enjoyed a lip-smacking lumberjack breakfast, prepared by our
son-in-law, John Foley. Blueberry pancakes, bacon, fruit, coffee,
juice. Thus fortified, we all went for an honest-to-goodness Sunday
drive through the verdant countryside of southern Massachusetts and
northern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon we were back at the house, joined by John's
sister, Kathryn, and their parents, Pat and Emmet. Next-door
neighbor Michelle Albano came, too. All of us were in an
outdoor-eating state of mind, including Max, the floppy,
big-footed, long-tongued palooka-of-a-dog.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a picnic, especially as summer days
dwindle to a special few. We know that, soon, it will be too cold
(here in New England, at least) to feast in the back yard, sharpen
appetites with a romp in the grass, a walk through the park, a ride
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eating outdoors is a primeval call and response. It feels more
celebratory than eating indoors because we can slosh clam juice on
the ground and toss ice into the flower beds, spill at will. Be
free and easy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there's something ancient and extraordinarily
satisfying about putting fire to food under a big sky. On this day,
it was a New England boil, as textured an outdoor meal as I've
enjoyed, washed down with everything from exotic rum drinks to
microbrewery beer to soda.
</P>
<P>
   With John chefing again, the feast began. Leading the way was a
pot of steamed clams, plump and juicy. Pull one out of the shell,
dip into the broth, then into melted butter, ease it into your
mouth and _ my, my, eating doesn't get any better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Then the shrimp came, pink, succulent, so tender you could suck
off their shells before dipping them in spicy red sauce. Then,
riches on top of riches, lobster. First a claw, pried open, the
meat extracted and dipped into, yes, of course, butter.
Excessively, I sought, found and destroyed a tail, unmindful of my
ballooning waistline; this was no time to care.
</P>
<P>
   This was celebration. Picnic time. Thus no one was surprised
when Cami's broiled steaks showed up. The ultimate surf and turf.
Too: corn on the cob, wine-sauteed mushrooms, salad.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate outdoor meal. One to remember when the snow
swirls and the winds howl. One to remember many summer birthdays
from now.

 &HT;    School lunches to male kids healthy and happy
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's going to stuff down sprouts while having sweet dreams of
cookies?
</P>
<P>
   Kids want chips, cookies and candy bars, their parents want them
to eat fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   This truism of parenting goes double when you pack them off to
school and beyond your control.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to packing a lunch box, the gap between what they
want and what you want for them is so wide, in fact, it's the
third-leading cause of back-to-school arguments behind only
homework and fashion, a Quaker Oats survey reports.
</P>
<P>
   But when we asked readers how they manage to slip in a little
nutritional punch, we found it can be done with some thought, a
little effort and sometimes a twist that has nothing to do with
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I think, `Oh, man, what can I come up with that's
different?''' said Julie Gillespie, after packing lunches for her
daughter, Laura, for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, 13, is used to light food, isn't much of a sandwich eater
and is at an age now when ``they're so funny they don't want you to
send anything that looks baby,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   She packs lunch every morning for her daughter to take to a
private school that has no cafeteria. Usually it's a tortilla roll,
soup or leftovers. The school has a microwave, ``a lifesaver for
me, especially in the wintertime'' when hearty black beans and rice
would be unappetizing served cold, Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading goes on at the Duluth, Georgia school that Laura
attends, as it does even at public schools that ban under the table
trading, but it's rarely a problem for the Gillespies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that if I'm forcing my taste on her, she ends up
trading,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Communication helps. Often Laura asks for larger helpings of
favorites _ not to trade but to share.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes just making food or the package more personal is
enough to help kids hang onto their own lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one little girl, every time she comes to school her
sandwich is cut into a different shape,'' said Kathy Sullivan, a
preschool teacher and lunch packer for her three children.
</P>
<P>
   That idea _ cutting sandwiches into shapes with cookie cutters _
was by far the most often mentioned tip sent in by parents. Others
suggest adding a note, fancy napkin or even a small prize.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan said even the pickiest eaters need more variety
than just the shape of their sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents will get on to something that works really well one
day and go with it for two months. That doesn't work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ask children what they like and really listen to their answers,
she said. ``Even in preschool, children know what they like.''
</P>
<P>
   Keylee Clemons of Dahlonega, Georgia, who enters sixth grade
next week, knows and packs what she and her 6-year-old sister,
Kayna, like. Typically it's tuna in a pita, with fruit. Sometimes
muffins left from breakfast. Once in a while she brings cereal and
buys milk at school or cooks a hot dog in the morning and packs it
in boiling water in a thermos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have complimented me on lunches. They're healthy,''
said Keylee, who won a top prize and $1,000 in a national recipe
contest this year.
</P>
<P>
   A corner of the Clemonses' refrigerator holds lunch items, and
the sisters have a variety of totes and ice packs to help keep
cheese and dips chilled. The American Dietetic Association also
recommends freezing low-fat yogurt and letting it double as an ice
pack.
</P>
<P>
   While Keylee prefers her own lunches to those served in a school
cafeteria, she's in the minority at public school. In Georgia,
which has the nation's third-highest participation in the school
lunch program, 77 percent of public school students bought lunch in
1996-97, the latest figures available.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the ADA says, those lunches are nutritious. But
they're not appealing to every child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to do a very good job, but you know when they cook in
bulk and your child's not used to that, it's tough,'' Gillespie
said, admitting she was ``very nervous'' when her only child set
out for public kindergarten seven years ago. ``They had weird
combinations, too _ some kind of sandwich with peas and carrots.
Kids are just not prone to eat that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch should provide a third of a child's daily intake of
vitamins, minerals and calories, according to Dr. Debby
Demory-Luce, nutritionist at the Children's Nutrition Research
Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But if they won't eat it, it doesn't matter how nutritious it
is. ``You can put the food in front of them, but other than shoving
it in them, there's nothing you can do,'' says pediatric
nutritionist Carolyn Silzle of Scottish Rite Children's Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   If they want peanut butter and jelly every day, Silzle says
that's OK, as long as parents are aware of what else their children
are eating. Parents, in fact, are often part of the problem. The
east Cobb schools that her children attended ``finally had to put a
stop to all the moms bringing in fast-food for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Her best advice? ``It helps if parents provide a good example.
Give children an opportunity to see you eating a variety of foods,
and they won't think anything of it.''

 &HT;    Getting the best bang for your buck
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the ping that makes cash registers ring.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats were first produced in the 1970s as a cheaper
alternative to wood bats. Batmakers promised unbreakable aluminum
bats would last longer than breakable wood, at a reasonable cost.
At the time, the cost savings of aluminum bats allowed youth
leagues, high schools and colleges to save money by making the
switch.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the case any more.
</P>
<P>
   As any parent of a baseball player knows, the price of aluminum
baseball bats continues to rise. The newest top-of-the-line models
easily cost $300. A new Worth bat, which will include piezoelectric
shock absorbers, will retail in the neighborhood of $280.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the current price of wood bats, which retail for
around $20. Of course, the quality of the bat you can purchase at
your local retailer is far from what Mark McGwire is using. But you
can now buy 15 wood bats for the price of some aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest advantages of aluminum bats is that they
supposedly last longer. But as manufacturers have made the walls of
hollow aluminum bats thinner to make the bat lighter, aluminum bats
are cracking and denting much more easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aluminum bats don't last long at all,'' North Carolina
Wesleyan's Andy Jones said. ``They tell you not to hit under 65
degrees. It's worse than a wood bat (in some cases).''
</P>
<P>
   Most companies will allow you to return an aluminum bat if it
cracks or dents. Jones said that sometimes can be as often as every
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some college programs don't purchase bats at all, because of
contracts with aluminum bat companies. Louisville Slugger sponsored
both Arizona State and Southern California, the two teams that met
in the 1998 Division I College World Series final.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that many college coaches haven't spoken out
about the bat issue. They don't want to bite the hand that feeds
them. But as is the case in most businesses, if somebody's given a
free ride, someone else has to pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston stated in his study on the
difference between wood and aluminum bats: ``If thousands of these
high-performance bats are being given to programs under contract
each year, it is understandable why the price of the bats to
non-contracted programs (college, high school, individuals) has
risen so dramatically in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools with smaller athletic budgets get by because players
often provide their own bats. Former North Carolina Wesleyan coach
Mike Fox said he hadn't bought a large number of aluminum bats for
the Bishops in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is one of the biggest factors for colleges. But is it still
cost effective?
</P>
<P>
   There are now special wood bats which are supposed to be less
breakable. Most are coated with a special fiberglass, or have some
sort of composite material included. The Coastal Plain League has
provided its teams with composite wood bats the past two years, but
most CPL players were still willing to spend $20 on a wood bat of
their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cost is about $100 per bat,'' said Mark Cryan, CPL
director of operations. ``We use about eight to 10 bats per team,
or about $800 per season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cryan said if the league switched to true wood bats, the cost
would be approximately $2,500 per team.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden shift in policy by the NCAA may leave many programs
scrambling to find the funds to purchase wood bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason college favors aluminum bats, like anything else,
money is the big factor, it's the driving force,'' Georgia State
assistant coach Bob Keller said. ``They say money is the reason why
they won't go to wood. There are some ways to get around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are going to break wood bats more, so your turnover ratio
of having to buy bats is obviously going to be more. The problem
you have there is that there are only a handful of programs in the
country that have enough money to go switch over to wood. While
that's nice, there's more programs that are small-time programs
that don't have money to be continually buying wood bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bat manufacturers want the NCAA to fully evaluate the issue
before rushing to any conclusions. Obviously, they don't want to
lose out on the millions of dollars aluminum bats bring in every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston noted that there are several reasons why bat companies
are against reducing the explosive power of metal bats, with
profits coming out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would severely reduce the profitability margin of the
bat,'' Thurston said. ``It allows other bat manufacturers (who
presently don't have the high-tech engineering capacities) to
compete in the market, and reduces sales because the bats would be
more durable and not need to be replaced as often.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   Easton Sports, one of the two major aluminum batmakers, has
filed a $267 million pre-emptive lawsuit against the NCAA, alleging
unlawful restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA this week approved rules changes designed to reduce the
impact speed of aluminum bats by Aug. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let them know that this is a serious change,'' said
Jim Easton, the chairman of Easton Sports, which is one of the two
biggest manufacturers of aluminum bats. The other is Louisville
Slugger, and together the two companies produce about 40 percent of
the 500,000 aluminum bats manufactured annually in the United
States.

 &HT;    Safety issue is paramount
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The silence said it all.
</P>
<P>
   As Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina lay in front of the mound
earlier this spring, blood gushing from a cut over his eye, his
teammates in the dugout were silent, some weeping. More than 48,000
people in Camden Yards were quiet. Mussina had just been hit in the
face by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Houston pitcher Billy Wagner was hit in the
head by a line drive. After the impact, the ball rolled all the way
to the edge of the third-base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, both Mussina and Wagner suffered only minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case for 17-year old pitcher Julius Riofrir of
Glendale, Calif. He was killed last summer after being hit in the
right temple by a ball hit with an aluminum bat. He was warming up
at the time and suffered a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   In a game where pitchers have less than a second to react to a
line drive, the three incidents clearly show how dangerous the game
of baseball can be.
</P>
<P>
   With aluminum bats being used in college, high school and youth
baseball, fielders seem to be coming under fire more often. Is it
safe to play with aluminum bats?
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers contend they are producing safe bats and the game
is still safe, according to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety issue is a big one,'' Louisville Slugger executive
George Manning said. ``Discussion will continue on the safety of
the bats. But the trend has not been upwards. This issue has been
there all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning says in the pros, a player is hit by a batted ball an
average of once every 25 games. At the college level, it happens
once every 75 games.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA's annual injury surveillance system,
college baseball is one of the safest sports in college athletics.
Over the past few years, the NCAA has conducted random surveys to
gather information on defensive players being struck by batted
balls. Yet, only 14 percent of Division I institutions have
completed that survey.
</P>
<P>
   According to Todd Breidenthal, staff liaison with the NCAA
Baseball Rules Committee, this past season, 150 pitchers were hit
by a batted ball. Of those, between 20 and 25 missed at least one
practice or game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State pitcher Ryan Mills suffered a broken jaw several
years ago by a line drive, and a University of Houston pitcher lost
two teeth. But there have been no fatalities, according to
Breidenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we lucky?'' Breidenthal asked, rhetorically. ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just an issue at the college level. As Mussina's
and Wagner's incidents show, it can happen at the highest levels,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it always takes some serious injury for
(something to be done),'' Georgia State assistant coach Bob Keller
said. ``You'd think that (Mills' injury) would have been enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball finally made batting helmets mandatory
after several horrifying incidents, including Boston's Tony
Conigliaro having his cheekbone fractured by a thrown ball in 1967.
In 1920, Cleveland's Ray Chapman was struck in the head by a pitch
and killed, the only on-field fatality in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 percent of Division I schools not responding to the NCAA
survey, no one knows the exact number of players hurt by batted
balls. But everyone knows it's become more of a problem in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think safety is an issue,'' North Carolina baseball coach
Mike Fox said. ``A lot more get hurt than get reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he doesn't remember a player being seriously hurt by a
batted ball during the 15 years he was at North Carolina Wesleyan.
He considers himself, and his program, to be fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Keller has seen his share of players hit, but not necessarily on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anybody get hit in the face,'' Keller said.
``I've seen pitchers go down, and leave the game taking one off the
ankle, getting hit in the chest and whatever. It's pretty
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the aluminum bat injuries that you see are
(pitchers) getting hurt in the (batting) cage. Because they're so
close and those balls are ricocheting off the poles on the side of
the cage. I know some coaches now that are making it mandatory for
their guys throwing down in the cage to be wearing helmets. Those
cages are so tight and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller recalls a third baseman in Georgia who was hit in the
head last year. He's now blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many incidents is it going to take?'' Keller asked.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from 60 feet, 6 inches, a pitcher usually ends up about
55 feet away from the batter after his delivery. It can be a scary
sight seeing a ball coming at your head. Sometimes you don't even
see it. Virginia Commonwealth sophomore Jason Dubois pitched
against both aluminum and wood this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' Dubois said. ``You're the closest (fielder) to
the plate, and you're throwing the ball and moving in all these
awkward positions. You throw the ball 90 miles per hour, and the
guy hits it, it comes back at about 120. That's got to be the most
frightening thing ever when you're on the ballfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston has studied the statistical
differences between aluminum and wood. Because an aluminum bat is
lighter and a batter can generate more force, Thurston came to this
conclusion: ``If a batted ball is hit at a greater velocity, at the
same distance and hit harder more often, the potential for more
injuries, and more severe injury, is certainly increased.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   NCAA baseball officials have approved rules changes designed to
cut the performance of aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I and II championship baseball committees approved
the changes for next season. The Division III committee - concerned
about the financial impact it would have on its schools - asked
that the implementation date be pushed back seven months to August
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said the amended bats would protect pitchers and
preserve the integrity of the game.

 &HT;    Do metal bats take the ballance out of baseball?
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1961, Mike Gillespie scored the winning run in the College
World Series as Southern California defeated Oklahoma State 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Gillespie coached the Trojans to their 12th CWS
title, he had a little more breathing room as Southern Cal defeated
Arizona State 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 CWS set 13 offensive records as the eight teams
combined to bat .318 and belt 62 home runs, shattering the previous
records of .303 and 48, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So why the explosion of offense at the college level?
</P>
<P>
   Many are pointing to bats as the culprit. New standards may be
set on aluminum bats, while others would like to see the NCAA bring
wooden bats back to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see all of college baseball go to wood bats,''
Georgia State assistant Bob Keller said. ``I've always felt that
way, but even after being here in Rocky Mount this summer and
watching how much crisper the game is, it's played like it's
supposed to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, the hitting instructor at Georgia State, is the head
coach of the Rocky Mount Rockfish this summer. His experience this
season has strengthened his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With wood bats, you can play percentage baseball and have a
greater chance for success,'' Keller said. ``If we draw the infield
in with a wood bat, and a guy hits a hard ground ball, the chances
aren't as good of it getting through as if it were with an aluminum
bat. That ball is going to come off the bat a lot harder, a lot
faster and might get through the infield. It takes away some of the
strategy from the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, college team batting averages have risen 16 points,
scoring is up 14 percent, and home runs have increased 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, team earned run averages have risen almost a
full run a game in three years.
</P>
<P>
   What's in the bat?
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of differences between aluminum and wooden
bats, besides the sound of the crack or the ping.
</P>
<P>
   The larger the diameter, the bigger the hitting area.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden bat must be solid, and therefore the weight is usually
contained in the barrel. Baseball rules state a bat can not be more
than 2 3/4 inches in diameter at its greatest spot. But most wood
bats never reach that limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are 2 1/2 to 2 5/8 inches,'' Louisville Slugger executive
George Manning said. ``Aluminum bats are 2 3/4 and the weight is
distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most aluminum bats are hollow and extremely light. The NCAA
allows the difference between the bat's weight and length to be no
less than five. For example, a 33-inch bat can weigh just 28
ounces. That limit will be four for the 1999 season and may drop
further if new standards are inacted.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the key, because contrary to popular opinion, it's bat
speed that makes a ball travel farther - the ability to whip the
bat head through the hitting zone with the greatest force.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats also have a greater hitting area, usually called
the sweet spot. Rawlings has developed a metal bat with a 10-inch
sweet spot. Worth is preparing to release a new aluminum bat which
contains piezoelectric dampers to control the amount of vibration
in the bat. The bat is supposed to allow the hitter to hit the ball
harder and extend the sweet spot down into the handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wooden bat has a smaller sweet spot,'' Rawlings wooden bat
marketing director Tom Nailor said. ``But a ball can travel farther
if you hit it just right with a wood bat.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when a batter gets jammed with a wooden bat, he's
more likely to break it, allowing the fielders to react to the
change in the ball's direction. With an aluminum bat, a jammed
batter can still hit the ball hard enough to carry over an
infielder's head.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics don't lie
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston, the NCAA baseball rules
editor, is involved in a study of college hitters and pitchers who
play in wood bat summer leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston followed 90 Division I hitters with at least 70 at-bats
in the Cape Cod Summer League and 60 pitchers who threw at least 25
innings. The ball used in that league is the same one used in many
college leagues, so he could rule that out as a variable.
</P>
<P>
   He then compared the summer wood bat statistics to each player's
college regular-season numbers with aluminum bats, taking into
consideration the number of games played.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston's study showed batting averages fell 107 points when
batters used wood compared to aluminum. Slugging percentages were
down 226 points. And with aluminum bats, batters hit a home run
every 25 at-bats, compared to every 74 with wood.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the batters in the study hit over .400 with aluminum
bats and 31 more hit at least .350. But not one of those same
players hit over .350 in the Cape Cod League, and only five were
able to bat better than .300.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Thurston found pitchers' ERAs decreased an average
of 2.10 runs per pitcher. Two lowered their ERAs over five points
and seven dropped more than four runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve saw their ERA shrink by three runs. In addition, each
pitcher allowed an average of 2 1/2 fewer hits per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   There are always exceptions to the rule. Rocky Mount Rockfish
outfielder Jason Dubois hit 17 home runs with a wood bat this
summer, after just seven round-trippers as a Virginia Commonwealth
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Dubois doesn't have one answer as to why his numbers have
jumped, though he said he tends to swing a wood bat more during
practice and the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swinging a wood bat helps,'' Dubois said. ``I've been swinging
a wood bat for five years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he played in a league in which he was allowed to
use either wood or aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used wood most of the time,'' Dubois said, ``until I found
somebody that was throwing mid-90s and then I broke out my
aluminum, just because it was easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like wood over aluminum, because it feels more natural.
You're actually using more power with wood than you are with
aluminum. Most aluminum bats now are so springy, that you hit a
ball and it goes in about a quarter of an inch and then shoots
right off.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one way millions of American have to get rich _ or at
least richer _ quick. &QL;

 &HT;    Kids more likely to eat what they help fix
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love Presley's sons begged to help. When she said yes, the pair
pulled up chairs to the kitchen counter, turned them around and
hopped up and down collecting ingredients, measuring cups, wooden
spoons and bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Presley read the recipes because the boys were too young to read
and reached overhead for implements out of their reach.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of work in the kitchen, begun at an early age, can
help families grow closer and, the Eatonton woman believes, help
children eat better. Her sons, now in their 40s, liked everything
but broccoli. ``And they're both fabulous cooks,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most children like what they help prepare. Saturday is a good
time to teach your child,'' Presley advises. ``Let them do it, and
enjoy it with them. And teach them how to clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even kindergartners can help with some of these recipes, chosen
because they're nutritious and appealing to many children. Many
5-year-olds can slice a banana with a blunt knife for a fruit salad
to be served at school in an ice cream cone. Some third-graders can
make Not Hot Salsa, and middle schoolers who rise early enough can
make their own Tortilla Roll in the mornings.
</P>
<P>
   But because the beauty of Zucchini Bars and Sweet Potato Maple
Muffins is the way they conceal vegetables, you may want to make
those yourself.

 &HT;    School lunch tip: Think safety
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's hot, keep it hot. If it's cold, keep it cold.
</P>
<P>
   That's the simple food safety rule to follow when packing
perishables for lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria that can cause sickness multiply most rapidly between
40 degrees and 140 degrees. That's why food safety specialists
recommend using ice packs with foods that would normally have to be
refrigerated, such as ham and yogurt, and heat packs or thermoses
for foods that are served hot, such as soup and leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   While ice packs and heat packs will do the job until lunchtime,
neither will last all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any perishable leftovers after lunch should be discarded and
not brought home,'' according to Bessie Berry, manager of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Ice packs come in a variety of sizes, materials and shapes to
fit well into insulated bags and boxes. Or freeze juice boxes or
filled plastic bottles to double as ice packs. Food should be
chilled in the refrigerator before being packed in an insulated
container with a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Heat packs are microwavable gel packs useful to help keep cooked
or heated foods hot. Make sure the food is thoroughly cooked or
reheated before packing with a heat pack.
</P>
<P>
   Some lunch totes have two or three separately insulated sections
to accommodate both hot and cold foods.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch packing is a good time to talk to children about food
safety, especially the importance of washing their hands. To help,
the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Services has an activity book
for children that can be found on the Internet at
http://www.foodsafety.gov/(tilde)dms/cbook.html/.

 &HT;    Cox News Service readers' tips on school lunches
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUNCH TIP: COMMUNICATE
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cole of Norcross, Ga. said her mother often sent messages
on banana skins, using a fork tine or knife tip, and by the time
Cole got to school, ``I love you,'' ``Have a happy day'' or a
smiley face was visible. She has continued the tradition with her
daughter and, now, grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Alice Rhodes of Lilburn, Ga. broke the day-to-day monotony
for her two daughters, both now teachers, by tucking interesting
decorated napkins into their lunches. By the time they got to high
school, she was secretly packing in other small surprises like
Tootsie Rolls. ``It adds a little spunk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Black of Douglas County(Ga.) saves cards, cuts off the
backs, and writes a message on the backside of the decoration.
She's been doing this since her now-12-year-old daughter was in
kindergarten and said she still loves it.
</P>
<P>
   LUNCH TIP: THINK SMALL
</P>
<P>
   Small, ready-to-eat foods are most likely to be eaten, parents
say, explaining why they take the time to chop, pare, peel and
package fruits and vegetables or heat and bag mini-bagels for
children's lunches. Food companies have figured out how popular
snack sizes are, too, and now offer mini-pizza kits using crackers
for the base, packages of baby carrots with dip and, now,
single-serving packs of cereal not meant to be eaten with milk.
This month Kellogg's introduced three of its popular kids cereals
in snack packs.
</P>
<P>
   MORE TIPS
</P>
<P>
   -- Spread peanut butter or flavored cream cheese on a rice cake.
Pack sprinkles, raisins or pretzels for decoration.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pack a banana. Put peanut butter in a small container, put
sprinkles in another and include a plastic spoon. Your child can
decorate the banana at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kitty Black, Douglas County(Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   -- For sandwiches, cut bread into different shapes with cookie
cutters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several readers
</P>
<P>
   -- Shelled sunflower seeds and individually wrapped string
cheese are handy sources of protein.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous e-mail
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I'll do banana nut muffins and grate some carrots in them
so fine they don't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Brenda Moseley, Ellenwood , Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pack fun straws or small prizes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nutritious convenience foods include packaged carrots with
dip, apples with caramel dip, small packs of crackers and
fruit-and-grain bars.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Freeze grapes so they're super-cold for lunchtime. My kids
eat more when I do this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathy Sullivan, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cut up apples and put a little lemon juice on them so they
won't get brown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keylee Clemons, 11, Dahlonega, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Layer light or fat-free soft cream cheese, then salsa,
shredded light or fat-free cheddar/Jack cheese mix and finely
shredded lettuce. Packed in that order, the salsa blends with the
cream cheese and the lettuce doesn't get soggy. If your children
like, you can add chopped tomatoes or black olives, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Julie Gillespie, Lilburn, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   -- Core an apple, stuff it with peanut butter and wrap in foil.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Nuts and bolts of preparing gelatin salad
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Frances Allen of Atlanta requested a recipe for a layered
gelatin salad called Under the Sea, we were flooded with responses.
Twenty-eight of you sent copies _ or even original pages cut
directly from a Jell-O cookbook _ for a salad by that name.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is that while Allen recalled a lime layer and a cream
cheese one that may have contained nuts, the ``Joys of Jell-O''
recipe calls for pears, not nuts, in the cream cheese layer.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of readers sent recipes for a dish that sounded more
like what Allen had in mind, never mind the name. This one is from
Gloria Conrey of Lithonia, Georgia, who says her mother made it in
the '60s using pineapple and nuts.
</P>

   We're giving you both, so you can take your pick.

MANGO TANGO: TIME TO REDISCOVER JUICY, FRAGRANT FRUIT  
 (WITH SIDEBAR MANGOSIDE)  
 (ART ADV: ART HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - You don't need everything but the kitchen sink to
enjoy mango mania. All you need IS the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just eat 'em over the sink,'' urged local mango maven Kathleen
Vanesian. ``It's not the most attractive thing, but it's certainly
the most satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mango madness comes over otherwise sensible people this time of
year, when the fruit is so juicy, so fragrant, so flowery. Now that
they're going for three for $1, it's a great time to experiment
with mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes are native to India and now are grown in hot, humid
regions around the world. Arizona gets its mangoes year-round from
Florida, Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, mangoes are artful street food, speared on sticks and
peeled open to look like edible flowers, according to Kathleen
Vandervoot, spokeswoman for the Fresh Produce Association of the
Americas, which is based in Nogales, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled with lime juice and chili powder, they are delicious.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, Vanesian said, ``you will find Mangoes with Sticky
Rice sold on every street corner in Thailand. It's their hottest
month, and their mango month.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes with Sticky Rice has become a sort of national dessert
there, Vanesian said. The rice for ``sticky rice'' is widely
available in Asian stores; it's also known as sweet rice or
glutinous rice. It has a distinguishable translucence, both raw and
cooked. When cooked, it can be packed into bowls to unmold and gild
with sweetened coconut milk and fans of mango slices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of the tangy tartness of the mango with the
creamy coolness of the coconut sauce is a combination that's hard
to beat,'' Vanesian said.
</P>
<P>
   During August, Vanesian's Viet namese friends in California send
or bring her lugs of a variety of mangoes known as Sun Da. They're
neither fibrous nor resinous, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to use the mango right away, Vanesian said,
``look for one that smells good and yields to light pressure.''
Avoid mangoes that are too soft or wrinkled. Mangoes taste best at
room temperature, but can be refrigerated if ripe to hold for a
couple of days longer.
</P>
<P>
   Think tropical when you're dreaming up your own mango dishes.
Mangoes meld well in flavor combinations with hot chiles and hot
spices, as well as cilantro, lime juice, red bell peppers, green
bell peppers, and jicama, for starters. Bell peppers and jicama and
crunchy vegetables provide great texture contrast with the velvety
mango flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The mango has a couple of odd things about it, starting with
that pit. What gives with that thing, anyway? It takes up half the
fruit's interior, or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Schneider calls mangoes ``the most clingstone and
clingpeel of fruits'' in her latest edition of ``Uncommon Fruits &AMP;
Vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Mango aficionados will gnaw the seed to get every last juicy
bite. And here's the other weird thing: Mangoes belong to the
cashew family and are related to poison ivy and poison oak. When
they touch the skin or sap, some sensitive people may get red
rashes or blisters. Schneider reports that these same individuals
may not be bothered by eating the ripe fruit.
</P>
<P>
   So what else can you do with a mango? Put it in fruit salad,
vegetable salad; make tarts with it over vanilla cream; saute them
as you would bananas, in brown sugar and butter, and use over ice
cream. Or pair mangoes with grilled or roasted poultry or pork, or
even cold meats. Green mangoes are used in some recipes, and could
be shredded into salads.
</P>
<P>
   Mango chutney, which is easy to make, is a standard condiment on
many continents. You can freeze mangoes by pureeing the pulp and
then pressing it through a sieve. Pack in plastic freezer bags or
containers.
</P>
<P>
   How about nutrition? Mangoes are very good sources of potassium,
according to Schneider, and superior sources of vitamins A and C.
Low in sodium but high in fiber, they are also moderately high in
calories: 70 per mango half.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their tropical lushness and because they blend so
well with hot flavors, chefs and food companies have taken the
mango to their bosoms. You can find a variety of mango products
such as juices, canned mango in syrup, and bags of frozen mango
chunks, as well as mango-accented dishes on menus all over town.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Norman Fierros of Norman's Arizona loves mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   To eat them, though, he admits, ``I have to hang over the
kitchen sink.'' &QL;

MANGOES WITH STICKY RICE &QL; 
(From Kathleen Vanesian) &QL; 
Approximate values per serving: 254 calories, 8 g fat, 0
cholesterol, 44 g carbohydrates, 141 mg sodium, 26 percent calories
from fat.
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 cups still warm, cooked sticky rice (also called sweet or
glutinous rice)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup canned coconut milk (more if you want to follow drizzling
directions below)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar (or more or less to taste)
</P>
<P>
   3 large ripe mangoes, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   To fix rice: Put rice in cold water for at least 20 minutes.
Drain, rinse, and put in a pan with an equal amount of cold water
(for 2 cups rice, use 2 cups water). Cover and cook on high until
water boils. Reduce heat to very low and cook about 12 minutes.
Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. Rice should be getting
very gooey.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, mix coconut milk, salt and sugar until salt and
sugar dissolves. Mix in cooked sticky rice; let sit for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mound sticky rice in center of large platter; arrange mango
slices around mound of rice. Serve.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's note: If you want to get fancy, make a little more of the
coconut cream mixture and drizzle it over everything. If you really
want to make it pretty, mold rice into a bowl and turn it out onto
the serving platter. Fan mangoes around it. &QL;

 c.1998 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.
</P>

least richer _ quick. &QL;

CITY TURNS TO CONSULTANTS TO AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So many developers are so close to Mayor Willie
Brown that city officials are turning to outside consultants to
screen proposals for major real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
   The move, taken at the direction of the mayor's office, is aimed
at blunting charges of favoritism in the awarding of major
development deals.
</P>
<P>
   It could also deaden the punch of a potential campaign issue as
Brown look ahead to re-election: that his administration has been
awash in conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a prudent effort to inject more objectivity into
the process,'' said Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause,
a government watchdog group that has been critical of Brown's ties
with developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the face of it, it sounds like a good-faith effort,'' Knox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Redevelopment Commission, whose members are
appointed by the mayor, authorized Redevelopment Director James
Morales to hire an outside consultant to evaluate four bids for
redevelopment of the 500-acre Hunters Point Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the commission gave Morales approval to hire a
consultant to review four bids in a highly controversial sale of
property next to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for a hotel
and condominium development.
</P>
<P>
   But looking outside City Hall for expertise _ and for a shield
against charges of cronyism _ comes at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Morales estimates that each consulting contract will cost the
Redevelopment Agency tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs taxpayers money and, in an administration with
integrity, wouldn't be necessary,'' said state Sen. Quentin Kopp,
I-San Francisco, one of Brown's sharpest critics.
</P>
<P>
   From China Basin, where the San Francisco Giants are building a
new waterfront stadium, to downtown and Treasure Island, Brown's
friends, political associates and former law clients are either
doing or seeking major real estate deals with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the mayor say it's inevitable that someone like Brown,
so long in public life, would encounter his associates,
particularly in real estate boom times.
</P>
<P>
   But now the mayor's team is looking to put some distance between
City Hall and those relationships.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, for instance, when redevelopment officials opened
four bids from companies looking to manage development of the
Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, one of the proposals was from
Catellus Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Catellus had hired Brown as an attorney from 1982 to 1994 during
his tenure as speaker of the state Assembly. The company paid him
more than $140,000 in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Another bid came from Forest City Enterprises. Forest City
employs Brown political supporter Natalie Berg, the chairwoman of
the Democratic County Central Committee, which recently endorsed
the mayor for re-election _ 16 months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Catellus and Forest City are vying for the right to convert the
Hunters Point shipyard into a residential neighborhood and home to
commercial development and light industry.
</P>
<P>
   By using consultants, the Redevelopment Agency would turn over
its role as an evaluator of the proposals, according to Kofi
Bonner, the mayor's chief economic adviser.

truth. But Clinton's admission Monday that he'd lied, that he
really did have a relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, had to be a cruel slap in the face. Begala is the
man who, perhaps more than any other, has stood out front and taken
the heat for the leader of the Western World. Begala did it because
he's a believer. It may sound corny, but it's true: he believes in

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ Passengers on the Riddler's Revenge roller
coaster squealed with exuberance and panic, from the initial
15-story plunge right through to the last of six fearsome spirals,
many at freeway speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the ride's control room, a windowless office
underneath the ride platform here at Six Flags Magic Mountain
amusement park in suburban Los Angeles, was considerably more
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   One man sat gazing into a computer screen; at his side, inside a
cabinet that stretched the length of a Cadillac, some complicated
hardware performed acrobatics of its own, with no allowance for
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   From the safety announcements played as passengers wait to get
on board to the photographs of screaming riders sold at the exit,
technology plays a starring but seldom-seen role in the operations
of roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   As riders are whipsawed around a track in apparent pandemonium,
it is machines and not people that insure that the cars whiz down
the track at the right speed, do not collide and do not hit
obstacles that block the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the ride operator with a lever and brake is
history,'' said Jim Blackie, director of maintenance at Magic
Mountain. ``It's all computer controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the Riddler's Revenge, billed as the nation's fastest
and tallest stand-up roller coaster, the job of a ride operator is
similar to that of a flight attendant: make sure that the automatic
safety bars are secure and that stuffed animals are stowed away.
Starting a train is accomplished with no more sweat than ringing a
door bell.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting is left to two Allen-Bradley PLC-5s, which are
the size of encyclopedias but serve as the brains of a massive
control system built primarily by Rockwell International's
Allen-Bradley unit. Sitting in an air-conditioned room under the
station platform, they provide a full set of instructions to the
massive control system built around them every 20 to 40
milliseconds. Behind steel cabinet doors, red and green lights
flash as the trains round the track.
</P>
<P>
   Roller coaster control systems may often be referred to as
computers, by Blackie and others. But manufacturers are resolute in
using the term ``programmable logic controller'' to describe the
innards of theme ride technology. ``They look something like a
computer, they act like computers, but they're not as finicky as a
computer,'' said Kristen Carter, spokeswoman for Rockwell
Automation, a major producer of theme ride controls.
</P>
<P>
   Built to focus on their assigned task, these systems are
designed to operate without rest and always with utmost precision,
Ms. Carter said. In contrast, she said, personal computers and
mainframes may pause momentarily if given new instructions and are
more susceptible to temporary failure.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively silent, the Allen-Bradleys are hard at work.
Before each roller coaster takes a lap around the track, the check
and then double-check with a backup program between 100 and 150
features on the ride that may affect safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can dream it, these computers can do it,'' Blackie
said. For example, the station operator cannot dispatch the roller
coaster unless sensors along the track tell the computers that the
route is clear. Called the block system, a standard feature
throughout the industry, two cars cannot enter the same zone
anywhere along the track without making the Allen-Bradleys shut
down the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Before computers, this job was left to human operators who had
to keep a constant eye on the track and their hands on a lever that
served as a break. High technology has taken their place and has
allowed as many as five trains to circulate at one time on some
coasters, compared with only two or three trains under manual
control.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the human element from nearly all aspects of roller
coaster operations is no accident, said Walt Davis, vice president
of Togo International, a roller coaster manufacturer in Cincinnati.
Automation is more reliable than part-time amusement park workers,
who may be faced with disturbances in the station, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make the control systems as idiot-proof as
possible,'' Davis said. ``Suppose an unruly kid distracted the
operators and his friend came over and started pushing buttons. We
don't want to give them the flexibility of changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   But can technology be trusted to control such a potentially
dangerous ride as a roller coaster, particularly given the
knowledge that technology can sometimes go haywire? Davis said that
computers may indeed ``have a bad day'' but that they can be
programmed to tell operators when their circuitry gets
temperamental.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on Riddler's Revenge have their first contact
with the ride's computer while waiting in line, with automated
theme music and warnings to the passengers to pull down their
safety harnesses as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of the chute, the coaster encounters an incline that
inspires even the most fearless of riders to brace their feet
firmly on the floor and squeeze handholds.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the hill, the roller coaster's brains put the
lift system on slowly, so the train can engage without a jolt, then
release it at the designated speed at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   From there, gravity takes over, as does the spinning, lurching
and screaming. Barring any problems, the train will return to the
station three minutes after it left to pick up another load of
passengers. Of course, things do not always run so smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Riddler's Revenge shut down recently,
stranding passengers on the track, technicians found the reason on
a personal computer that sits on a folding table in an unpainted
corner of the control room. Hooked to the mainframe, the computer
indicated with a coded message, deciphered with a logic diagram,
that a fuse had blown in the station.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the repair took only a few minutes, Blackie said, adding
that a similar malfunction 20 years ago could have taken hours to
repair because technology at that time was unable to tell engineers
where a defective part was located.
</P>
<P>
   Though amusement park engineers rely heavily on computers for
maintenance, they do so only to a point. At most parks, workers
inspect roller coasters every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will park a train on the tracks and run another by to see
if there will be an accident,'' said Jeffrey Budgeon, managing
director of planning, engineering and maintenance at Hershey Park
amusement park in Hershey, Pa. ``We want to make sure that the
computer is doing what it is supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If a minor problem develops, the computers that control roller
coasters will merely warn technicians rather than shutting down the
ride. Some obstacles, like those caused by extreme weather, may be
easily fixed. For example, roller coasters run faster in hot
temperatures and more slowly in cold.
</P>
<P>
   On the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York, New
York casino in Las Vegas, Nev., technicians can activate a special
computer program to compensate for the harsh desert climate. One of
the computer's remedies is to adjust the speed of each train as it
begins its descent from the top of the first incline. It can also
slow a roller coaster car in mid-lap by applying the brakes when
sensors tell the computer that the train is speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Express control system also monitors wind gauges
high on the ride. If headwinds get too strong, the computer alerts
technicians because trains may have trouble returning to the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Some roller coasters have the additional protection of infrared
light beams that give an alarm when there is someone or something
blocking the track. If a light beam is broken, the computer stops
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when a bird has flown through or a squirrel
has run across and shuts down the ride,'' said Dennis Speigel,
president of International Theme Park Services, an amusement park
consulting business in Cincinnati. ``But that's OK, because safety
is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been deaths on roller coasters in recent
years, they appear to be more often the result of reckless rider
behavior and safety belt failures than computer malfunctions,
according to reports by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   No one has died as a result of computer failure since 1980, when
a 13-year-old girl was killed in a collision of two trains at the
Great America amusement park in Santa Clara, Calif., according to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   It is most likely that the future of roller coaster technology
will rely even more heavily on computers, Speigel said. Part of
that role, he said, will almost certainly be in operating a new
propulsion system that uses hundreds of electromagnets along the
track instead of gravity and a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Only a computer can control the system since magnets must be
powered in sequence and in microsecond bursts. The few roller
coasters that already employ this technology can accelerate cars to
60 miles an hour as fast as a Porsche, Speigel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is advancing at such a pace now that it's not the
computers that are limiting roller coasters,'' he said. ``It's the
stresses that you can put on a body. You can only take so many
G-forces and so much of your eyes bulging out.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the standard computer in the industry is the
Allen-Bradley. With stacks of motor drives and a tangle of wiring,
the system is used to control everything from ocean liners to most
major amusement park rides.
</P>
<P>
   On the Riddler's Revenge, the influence of technology reaches
all the way to the exit, where passengers can buy photographs of
themselves in mid free fall. A high-speed camera alongside the
track takes pictures each time a train swoops by and immediately
sends the digital images to a computer in the sales booth.
</P>
<P>
   Though computers have an impact on nearly every facet of the
ride, most of the passengers were focused less on what happens
behind the scenes and more on what happens when the forces of
gravity begin to act on a human body that is being inverted and
flung around curves.
</P>
<P>
   Most were like Jackey Escobar, 14, who, after holding a hand
briefly to her stomach, talked about the perils of spinning upside
down. ``I feel like everything is going to come out,'' she said.

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.

will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.

`MOST GERMAN OF THE ARTS': MUSIC AS PART OF THE SPOILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publicatio notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a music critic who tilts at German crossword puzzles in odd
moments to dredge up forgotten vocabulary, it was frustrating, at
first, to find ``Liszt'' as the answer to ``German composer.''
Those little instruments of torture are difficult enough without
some boneheaded quizmeister's venturing into an area he obviously
knows nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Liszt kept coming up, occasionally as a Hungarian, more
often as a German. Franz Liszt (Liszt Ferenc, originally) lived and
worked in Weimar from 1848 to 1861, it is true, and he was a
central figure in the Wagnerian fray and the development of the New
German school of composition. Still, would anyone think to call
Chopin a French composer?
</P>
<P>
   With repetition, this stray bit of colonialism came to seem a
little creepy. Now comes Pamela M. Potter, in an illuminating book,
``Most German of the Arts: Musicology and Society From the Weimar
Republic to the End of Hitler's Reich,'' to report that it was not
entirely stray.
</P>
<P>
   ``During World War II,'' Ms. Potter writes, ``Germany's
territorial gains inspired musicologists, in a sense, to annex the
musical achievements of subjugated countries and broaden the
definition of German music and to increasingly portray developments
in European music history as German accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Old habits die hard, as Ms. Potter, an assistant professor in
the School of Music and the department of German at the University
of Wisconsin, Madison, makes clear in other respects as well. Her
most valuable contribution, in fact, is to establish that ``Nazi
musicology'' was not an isolated infection, a phenomenon
hermetically confined to a single time and place. It had roots in
the way Germans have thought about music over the centuries and
effects that carry into the present, not least in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, another German puzzle much to the point cropped up
recently, one of those that, when solved, yields a saying. In this
case the quotation was from Weber (the sociologist Max, presumably,
not the composer Carl Maria von): ``Art has no fatherland.'' That
noble sentiment is evidently a hard sell in Germany where music is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is German, isn't it?'' a young German professor of
technology is reported to have said in 1992 to Albrecht
Riethmueller, a musicologist who evidently inspired Ms. Potter's
title with another quotation: ``Music, the most `German' of the
arts'' (``Musik, die `deutscheste' Kunst'').
</P>
<P>
   What music may well be is the most intractable of the arts, the
hardest to bend to political uses. ``Music was far more elusive in
character than the visual arts,'' Ms. Potter writes, ``one reason
why Goebbels remained aloof from musical matters and focused his
energies on dictating policy in other arts and media.''
</P>
<P>
   That elusiveness is nowhere more apparent than in attempts to
pin down the very concept of ``Germanness'' in music. Ms. Potter
devotes a chapter to the subject and admirably withholds guffaws
even when matters descend to the ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   While German commentators as ancient as Johann Adolph Scheibe,
an 18th-century composer, found it easy to point to distinguishing
features in the styles of Italy, France and Poland, they were hard
put to do the same with their own music. The land of polyphony, if
such could even be claimed, is not exactly a concept to melt the
heart alongside, say, the land of melody.
</P>
<P>
   So Germany was to be, simply, the land of music. All the music
that was fit to annex. Germany's essential musical genius, some
conveniently concluded, lay in its ability to adapt, synthesize and
thus ennoble the music of other nations. And what emerged from that
German meat grinder was to be deemed ``universal.'' Liszt should
perhaps have been grateful to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Not every chapter offers as much black humor or will hold as
much interest for the average music lover. The discussions of
musicological organization and methodology in Germany from the end
of World War I to the end of World War II are crammed with detail
(and footnotes, with occasional chunks of untranslated German) that
will be of value _ great value, to be sure _ mainly to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are not unduly technical, and they tell a
fascinating tale of a discipline still young, undefined and
insecure trying to prove its usefulness, to survive in shifting and
ultimately dangerous waters. It is the story of the adolescence not
only of German musicology but also of American musicology. As in
other areas of music, some leading lights were driven out only to
shine abroad, including Willi Apel, Alfred Einstein, Otto Erich
Deutsch, Hans David and Karl Geiringer.
</P>
<P>
   The musicology of the Nazi era, in its concerns with questions
of community, nationality and race, drew heavily on that of the
Weimar Republic and before, Ms. Potter shows. ``It is important to
recognize the seamless transitions in musical life from one system
to the other,'' she writes. And again as in the Weimar Republic,
musicologists in the Third Reich failed to exert much influence on
practical policy, for all the efforts of individuals and
organizations to make themselves useful to the regime.

   Such efforts to ingratiate are nevertheless painful to encounter
from the likes of Arnold Schering, an acquaintance if not an old
friend of Bach adepts for his useful introductions to Eulenburg
scores. In 1933, Ms. Potter reports, Schering wrote to Goebbels on
behalf of the German Music Society, proclaiming the organization's
``joyful will to work together to build a new German culture with
all of its strength.'` At such infuriating moments, as at the
``comic'' ones, Ms. Potter retains an admirable sobriety.

   Until recently, general readers had access to remarkably few
sources of solid information on the musical history of the Third
Reich. All of that has changed drastically, thanks first to Michael
Kater, with his ``Different Drummers: Jazz in the Culture of Nazi
Germany'' and ``The Twisted Muse: Musicians and Their Music in the
Third Reich,'' and now to Ms. Potter.

   On Wednesday, in the humid wake of a tropical disturbance
churning westward, heavy thunderstorms erupted over Puerto Rico.
The disturbance, one of several westward-moving systems strung out
over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, will bear down on the peninsula
of Florida on Thursday, setting the stage for clusters of heavy
showers and thunderstorms. The heaviest rains will likely occur
near the East Coast, where the leading edge of the sea breeze works
in tandem with the disturbance to rapidly lift very warm and humid
air. Street flooding is likely in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   A volley of heavy showers and thunderstorms will soak parts of
southern Louisiana as an upper-level disturbance drifts westward
from the Florida panhandle. The system will forge slowly but
steadily westward Thursday night, raising the probability of heavy
rain by Friday in east Texas. Another westward tracking,
potentially wet disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico will arrive in
south Texas by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of showers and thunderstorms will bubble up
over eastern Montana, Wyoming and western South Dakota as a jet
stream disturbance lifts gathering humid air. A few of the storms
will approach severe levels, with hail, strong winds and tornadoes
posing threats.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly early morning in the Northeast, Thursday
afternoon temperatures will rebound under strong August sunshine,
but will stay several degrees below the average. Under the auspices
of high pressure, unseasonably low humidities will embrace the
Middle Atlantic States as far south as North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Twist of Fate
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, temperatures at Del Rio, located on the upper Rio
Grande River of Texas, soared to 105 degrees, marking an all-time
record 69th day this summer with triple-digit readings. The
tenacious south Texas heat wave also teamed with devastating
drought. In an abrupt twist of fate on Tuesday, 1.23 inches of rain
fell at Del Rio, breaking the record for the date. The high
temperature was 82 degrees, the lowest high ever on August 18. The
air over Del Rio was nearly saturated to an altitude of 20,000
feet, providing a favorably moist environment for cooling, heavy
thunderstorms.

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

PUBLIC EYE: LEARNING TO LOVE BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Recently, Michael Bierut, a graphic designer and
partner at Pentagram, a company known for nurturing the eclecticism
of its partners, has been busy re-examining the corporate identity
of United Parcel Service. His first instinct, he said, was to
introduce a little drama into the life of this nearly century-old
shipping company by changing the color of its trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe UPS trucks could be a lot of different colors, he
suggested, like M&AMP;M candies, with some of the trucks remaining the
familiar deep chocolate brown.
</P>
<P>
   Bierut, like all experts in corporate identity, looks hard at
the commercial paraphernalia we see all around us but rarely
notice, and revamps a logo or a typeface or a color so that, for a
moment or two, we do notice.
</P>
<P>
   When I originally encountered Bierut more than a decade ago, he
had just helped rescue the Cinzano logo. The Italian liqueur maker
had paid a company for a drastic redesign, something minimalistic
and cool, and then, horrified, ran to Bierut's former employer,
Vignelli Associates. Vignelli assured Cinzano that it was OK to go
back to its old logo.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bierut used this anecdote to advance the notion
that graphic designers should be like historic preservationists,
shoring up beloved old corporate symbols to withstand the rigors of
time, instead of bulldozing them.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, Bierut made that same case. As it turns out,
UPS, though momentarily charmed by the novelty of a tutti-frutti
fleet, quickly said no. ``If someone could make a really good
business case to get rid of brown, they would,'' Bierut insisted.
``It's a hard case to make. I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the designer immersed himself in the shipping company's
culture. He donned the brown uniform and rode with a UPS driver
around the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He spent a night in a
company shipping center watching brown boxes whiz by. And he
learned to really appreciate the color brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started out being Pullman brown,'' said Peter Fredo, UPS'
vice president for advertising and public relations, when I ask him
about the history of the brown trucks. The trucks have been brown
since 1916. ``The reason they picked up on Pullman,'' Fredo said,
``is that it was the epitome of luxury and class at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredo is something of an expert on the culture of brown. He
mentions the Paris exposition of 1867, where the main hall was
decorated in brown and gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a long period where brown was not in fashion,''
Fredo acknowledged, failing to mention that point in history when a
brown shirt signified a storm trooper, ``until Prada turned the
light back on.'' A few years ago, when brown was declared the new
black, Prada made a bag in UPS' favorite color.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar UPS truck, with its distinctive pug-dog nose, is a
classic, designed in the early 1960s when the company transformed
itself from a delivery service for department stores into a common
carrier. If it were a building, it would be eligible for
landmarking. The UPS logo, a simple gold shield topped by a
schematic package, was designed in 1962 by Paul Rand. ``Every
designer sees it and thinks, `I can do better,''' Bierut said. To
date, no one has.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1996, when the company painted a Web-site address on its
fleet, a news release noted that it was only the third time in 30
years that the company had changed the look of the truck. The
previous occasion was in 1993, when the company added the globe and
arrow symbol as well as the phrase ``Worldwide Delivery Service.''
</P>
<P>
   The company may be hard-pressed to walk away from brown, but in
the prototype for its soon-to-open storefronts, brown and gold will
be joined by sky blue, symbolizing air freight.
</P>
<P>
   I'm indebted to Bierut because, until he mentioned it, I had
never thought of the UPS trucks as objects of beauty. Nor had I
appreciated the singular nature of the corporation's color sense.
More astute observers, however, have long admired UPS brown.
</P>
<P>
   As Stan Herman, the Seventh Avenue stalwart responsible for the
design of the original Federal Express wardrobe, put it, UPS brown
is ``absolutely smack on target.'' Herman was appraising the
uniforms, but his observations also apply to the trucks: ``You
become a poet if you stick to your guns.''

LAURYN HILL: CROSSING BACK OVER FROM PROFANE TO SACRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)  
 (bl)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On her solo debut album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,''
the rapper, singer and visionary artist Lauryn Hill imagines
herself as part of a very old story. It transcends her own
23-year-old life, as stimulating as that may be with the success of
her hip-hop group, the Fugees, her highly promising career as a
musician and producer and her personal happiness mothering a baby
boy.
</P>
<P>
   And it eclipses the back catalog of rhythm-and-blues, although
Ms. Hill has established herself as a tradition bearer by
respectfully reworking the classic ``Killing Me Softly'' for the
Fugees' biggest hit, writing a song for the regal Aretha Franklin,
inviting funk-rock guitarist Carlos Santana to appear on the solo
album and recording part of that album at Tuff Gong Studios,
founded by reggae icon Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   The saga that inspires Ms. Hill even surpasses the details of
black American life that fill her work, right down to her album's
title, which echoes that of ``The Miseducation of the Negro,'' a
book that she probably read in an Afro-American studies class at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Her gaze reaches farther, to what she considers the Greatest
Story Ever Told: that of a black spiritual legacy grounded in
Christianity but constantly adapting to the world outside the
church, the buried lifeline of the African diaspora's social
movements and its arts, foremost among them the music that
``Miseducation'' (Ruffhouse/Columbia) renews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now some might mistake this for a simple song, and some don't
know what they have till it's gone,'' Ms. Hill warns on ``Lost
Ones,'' the first track on ``Miseducation'' and one of several
rebuking her peers who ignore the hallowed sources of the music
they mine. ``You can't hold God's people back that long,'' she
intones with a lilt redolent of Rastafarian reggae, the Jamaican
version of the story she embraces.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill assumes a prophet's voice because she genuinely
believes that today's youth lose themselves when they forget that
their material gains, their sexual prowess and their emotional
well-being are all God-given gifts. Nonbelievers may find her
preaching self-righteous. Her religious fervor is not what makes
``Miseducation'' exceptional; it is the way that her faith, based
more in experience and feeling than in doctrine, leads her to
connect the sacred to the secular in music that touches the essence
of soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miseducation'' is Ms. Hill's attempt to reanoint
hip-hop-flavored soul. The great artists to whom she is often
compared crossed the same boundary between the holy and the
profane, in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Aretha Franklin was a minister's daughter who transformed the
hosannas of gospel music into a language exalting human love. Al
Green, himself a man of the cloth, delved deep into the nexus of
sensuality and mysticism and recast sex as a sacrament. James Brown
learned from his gospel roots how to perfect the hypnotic
call-and-response of funk. Marvin Gaye, soul's great agnostic,
imbued social protest and seduction with fragile grace.
</P>
<P>
   These are only a few of many famous examples; in fact, the whole
trajectory of rhythm-and-blues can be described as a journey, with
plenty of baggage, from church to nightclub. What made the music so
rich was not the simple union of religious content into pop but the
human enigmas it illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans, historically forced to adjust their own
spiritual practices to fit within their oppressors' religion,
created a consecrated language far more flexible than traditional
Christianity had ever been. Soul music showed how that language,
and the music that expressed it, could elevate people's
understanding of carnal pleasures, personal relationships and
social concerns. In bringing religion down to earth, it sanctified
the commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill enters into this context and find universal lessons
in contemporary scenarios. Although many of the songs on
``Miseducation'' tackle the troubles of earthly love, nearly all of
them make reference to the Bible or its God. The link she forges
with this God replays the African diaspora's process of spiritual
syncretism, or adapting a belief system to new circumstances, on a
personal level.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, Ms. Hill gains a modern woman's
self-respect, not a Southern Baptist lesson of submission that some
consider sexist.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Franklin first did in the 1960s, Ms. Hill uses spiritual
rhetoric to create a highly introspective and ethical view of
romance. ``Father, you saved me and showed me that life was much
more than being some foolish man's wife,'' she and her soul sister
Mary J. Blige sing in their duet, ``I Used to Love Him,'' thanking
a God within for the strength to leave a destructive man. In the
album's title track, Ms. Hill declares that religion helped her
resist peer pressure and turn inward. ``I made up my mind to find
my own destiny,'' she croons over lush orchestration that recalls
Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of Christian pop pablum that puts its
message first. In gospel, where Ms. Hill begins, the music is the
message, the purest expression of the spiritual self. Ms. Hill
honors this fundamental tenet by challenging herself and her
listeners, crossing musical borders in pursuit of gospel's
wandering lineage. She finds it in doo-wop, soul and rock, but she
concentrates on the conduit that brought it from the 1960s to the
1990s: reggae, from Bob Marley to hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill makes reggae her main power source. She reworks a
Marley song, ``Concrete Jungle,'' to include a rap by the Jamaican
artist Shelley Thunder, and her own declamatory rapping technique
often incorporates Jamaican slang and inflection, recalling how
hip-hop evolved from those influences.
</P>
<P>
   The album's stunning vocal arrangements are greatly inspired by
the harmonies of Marley's former back-up singers, the I Threes. The
connection to Jamaica is a personal one; Ms. Hill's lover and the
father of her child, Rohan Marley, is one of Bob and Rita Marley's
sons. But it also updates the story of soul by grounding
``Miseducation'' in a more recent moment when the sacred met the
secular.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reggae began as a hybrid form, marrying soul melodies to
Caribbean rhythms; in Marley's hands, it expanded to include
elements of rock and Dylanesque folk. In the 1970s, when Ms. Hill
was growing up, reggae, influenced by Rastafarianism, was the most
vital musical expression of the African diaspora's spiritual life.
</P>
<P>
   Rastafarianism is a paradoxical faith, orthodox in its tenets
but anarchistic in its practices, embracing no leaders but many
prophets. Pioneering rappers like KRS-One employed the reggae
inspired by Rastafarianism as a bridge between old-style preaching
and newfangled rhyming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miseducation'' is not a reggae album, but it adopts reggae's
open, synthesizing approach in songs that vary in tone from
``Nothing Even Matters,'' a slow but rhythmically dazzling duet
with D'Angelo, to ``Superstar,'' a rap that borrows its first line
and percolating keyboards from the Doors.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Hill's more audacious bits of preaching takes place
in ``Superstar,'' when she compares today's rap stars to Christ,
reminding them that fickle crowds tend to crucify their heroes. But
Ms. Hill makes her most daring, and beautiful, leap in ``To Zion,''
which celebrates the arrival of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Naming the baby after the homeland longed for by the Bible's
chosen people and later by the Rastafarians who re-envisioned that
home as Africa was brash enough. But Ms. Hill actually imagines
herself in the place of the Virgin Mary, receiving an angelic
annunciation that ``unto me a man child would be born.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill is not our Lady of the Turntables. But her locating
herself in one of the great Christian narratives lends gravity and
grace to her expression of new motherhood's elation and fears.
</P>
<P>
   As the chorus builds, with a gospel choir singing ``Beautiful,
beautiful Zion'' and Ms. Hill shouting herself hoarse in the
foreground, the song becomes the high point of a miraculous album,
a hymn to all the holiness the mortal heart can generate.

FACING WHAT HIS CHARACTERS PROBABLY NEVER WILL: SUCCESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23)

<P>
   Everybody's dying just to get the disease,'' sang Elliott Smith
about the perils of fame in ``Pictures of Me,'' one of the most
memorable pop songs of last year. It appeared on ``Either/Or,''
Smith's third album, and it was a startlingly advanced report of
dissaffection sung in a high voice by a slouchy 27-year-old Beatles
fan from Portland, Ore., with a pallid, wounded demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, ``Pictures of Me'' had a particular power because
Smith was still untainted by fame, and the song seemed to confide
the details of its author's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The song had hooks and drama and a queasy, beautiful-loser's
weariness that would almost certainly make him famous, and it was
humid with Smith's revulsion at that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could afford his reverse snobbery then, recording for an
independent label called Kill Rock Stars, whose distribution
extends only to college towns. But a year has passed, and in that
time five of Smith's songs were used in the film ``Good Will
Hunting,'' directed by Gus Van Sant _ whose primary material is
beautiful losers _ and one was nominated for a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   Smith held hands in a stage bow with Celine Dion on national
television in the Academy Awards show, and his new album, ``XO,''
is on the major label Dreamworks. As he does on his other albums,
Smith plays all instruments, down to piano, drums and organ (except
for the strings that decorate a few songs), and his harmonies and
structures have grown more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had something to prove when he stepped into the more
complicated waters of mass-consumption pop, and he has made an
impressive record; it's so good that he's going to have to learn to
live with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   George Harrison is Smith's patron saint, which sets him apart
from the regular stripe of John-and-Paul-favoring Beatles
enthusiast. Harrison's songs ``Something'' and ``Isn't It a Pity''
are part of Smith's live repertory, and elements of other Harrison
tunes like ``I Want to Tell You'' and ``Blue Jay Way'' are echoed
in Smith's original songs on ``XO.''
</P>
<P>
   Like George Harrison, Smith has anti-charisma. If you like him
at all, you've already gone more than half way into his psyche. And
once you're there, he operates on your expectations according to
the classic mold of the rocker or beatnik hero _ Dean, Brando,
Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   His male fans might revere him for the casual cruelty in his
lyrics or the abdication of responsibility as his characters watch
friends self-destruct or embark fatalistically on another doomed
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his female fans want to comfort him, picking up on the
scraps of redemptive language in the songs, sensing that he's not
thoroughly cold and rotten.
</P>
<P>
   Smith comes on like a member of Deadbeats Anonymous, and his
mantra, from ``Waltz (NU)2,'' the first single from ``XO,'' uses
the appropriate language of recovery: ``I'm so glad that my
memory's remote/ 'cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to
note.''
</P>
<P>
   With his unusual gift for melody amid a melody-poor generation
of rockers, Smith may be the most fully formed singer-songwriter to
come along since Elvis Costello, and like Costello's early records,
``XO'' has a perversely adversarial relationship to the listener.
</P>
<P>
   In song after song, he seems to plead for you to go away,
singing ``I'm tired, I'm tired,'' ``Don't you dare disturb me while
I'm balancing my past,'' ``I'm so angry,'' ``Leave me alone.'' Even
as the forms vary, from downcast finger-picked ballads to barbed
electric pop to the four-part harmony vocals of ``I Didn't
Understand,'' Smith works with one emotional stance, and it's
rooted in resentment and fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   He's like the boy nobody understands who both wants and rebuffs
your attention; giving in to the abundant pleasures of his craft,
as is the case with watching Smith in concert amid rapt fans, is
like being taken captive by a brilliant and petulant child.
</P>
<P>
   The choice Smith's characters have to face seems is either
addiction and failure, which he watches with head-shaking
detachment, knowing that he can't get too involved _ or the
self-imposed exile of someone trying hard to walk the straight and
narrow. He invites the women that populate his love songs to come
live with his depression, warning them that it will all end in
tears anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And without being grandiose or literary or even particularly
clever with his lyrics, he sings about drugs with a squalid
honesty. Mordant references to drugs pop up throughout the album:
``Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done''; ``Gonna spend the day
higher than high''; ``She shows no emotion at all/ stares into
space like a dead China doll''; ``It's a chemical embrace that
kicks you in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a poet of the seedy world, he's also above it, adding
pinches of moralizing: ``Once I was you,'' he sings to a
shooting-star in ``Independence Day,'' adding, ``Don't go too
far/stay who you are ... go to sleep and make the change/ I'll meet
you here tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``XO'' is that it feels unfinished. Smith has
performed these songs live with only an acoustic guitar, and to
hear him this way is to know that he's the real thing; the songs
translate beautifully to solo performance, as most rock songs one
hears on the radio do not.
</P>
<P>
   But here and there are inklings of a greater sound-world _
electronic tones creating weirdly inapposite harmonies at the end
of ``Baby Britain,'' deep overlays of strings, guitars and
keyboards in ``Everybody Knows, Everybody Understands''_ that make
you wonder why he didn't use more of this kind of ornamentation on
the album.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that he hedged his greater aspirations and made the
kind of modest record he knows how to make. Still, sometimes you
want to enroll the talented and standoffish Smith in a
self-actualization course: who does he want to be? King of the
indie-boys or mass-pop communicator? What's so rare about him is
that either one lies within his grasp.

CLASSICAL CDS: PIANISTS WHO SHOW WHAT THE TALK IS ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sergei Babayan
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Babayan, an Armenian pianist who came to the United
States in 1989, was a forceful presence at last year's Van Cliburn
International Piano Competition, even though he was neither a
competitor nor a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Babayan, who is an artist in residence at the Cleveland
Institute of Music and also runs his own teaching academy, had four
students in the contest, and one heard his name evoked reverently
with unusual regularity. His disciples' playing suggested that he
demanded much of them technically and that he encouraged them to
explore some unusual repertory byways.
</P>
<P>
   One work that several of them played was an electrifying Sonata
by Carl Vine, a 44-year-old Australian. That work, a two-movement
essay in complex, propulsive rhythms and insistently expansive
chordal clusters, is the centerpiece of a new recording by Babayan
(Pro Piano PPR224517).
</P>
<P>
   Besides doing the service of putting the Vine Sonata on disc,
the recording goes a long way toward explaining the fuss about
Babayan. The repertory of varied 20th-century works puts a
spotlight both on his extraordinary technique and on his ability to
play densely harmonized works with an illuminating transparency.
</P>
<P>
   Babayan's arching accounts of ``Premiere Communion de la
Vierge'' and ``Le Baiser de l'Enfant Jesus'' from Messiaen's
``Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant Jesus'' are pictures of carefully
judged meditative intensity. Those movements surround a bracing,
sharp-edged performance of the ``Noel'' movement from the same
work.
</P>
<P>
   Two Respighi rarities _ the first of the three Preludes on
Gregorian Melodies and a gentle Notturno _ offer a sweet-toned,
impressionistic interlude before selections from Gyorgy Ligeti's
early ``Musica Ricercata,'' a group of miniatures in which a
Lisztian approach to the keyboard is refracted through a modern
harmonic lens.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly striking among the Ligeti works is No. 7, marked
``Quieto (poco rubato) _ Cantabile _ Molto Legato,'' in which a
gentle melody floats over a muted repeating bass figure played so
rapidly that it begins to sound almost like a synthesizer
recording. To produce that effect with the left hand while the
right produces a singing, free-spirited melody requires a daunting
measure of control.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil Say's Mozart
</P>
<P>
   After years of listening to critics' complaining that so many
young musicians' recordings are brilliantly polished but
interpretively indistinguishable, record companies are taking some
risks, signing players with strong personalities and
individualistic approaches to the repertory. But they seem unable
to resist turning these adventurous gestures into promotional
circuses, with campaigns that focus on eccentricity rather than
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   When Warner signed Fazil Say, a 28-year-old Turkish pianist
whose live performances have alienated some and won over others, it
put him on a pop label, Atlantic, rather than on one of its
classical lines (Teldec, Erato or Nonesuch). His debut disc, an
all-Mozart program, is adorned with a sticker in which he is
described, in a review quotation, as ``a wild man at the
keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   In some repertory _ his recent ``Rhapsody in Blue'' with the New
York Philharmonic, for example _ that description is not far off
the mark. But it doesn't apply to the performances on his Mozart
disc (Atlantic 21970-2). That's not to say that Say's performances
are quirk-free.
</P>
<P>
   He is selective about repeats, for one thing; he plays none of
them in the C Major Sonata (K. 330). In the first movement of the A
Major Sonata (K. 331), he plays them in some variations and skips
them in others, and in the final variation he plays the first two
repeats but skips the third.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners with an ear for architecture may find this jarringly
asymmetrical, but Say may have been less concerned with the
symmetry than with the idea that the closing chords of that final
variation can make a repeat seem anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   At times his readings draw so fully on the dynamic and
coloristic resources of the modern piano that a listener is tempted
to regard his readings not simply as romantic interpretations but
as acts of rebellion against the period instrument movement.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly fiery in the ``Ah, vous dirai-je, maman''
Variations, but in the Sonatas, too, he passes up few opportunities
for dramatic contrast. Often he does this to fine effect: The
Andante Cantabile of the Sonata in B flat (K. 333) has an almost
operatic quality, not only because Say makes the melodic line sing,
but also because he suggests orchestral coloration and balances in
the accompanimental figures.

 &HT;    Morrison salute to include reading by the author
 &HT;    By Don O' Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The list of major literary figures coming to Atlanta this fall
is growing. Two weeks after John Updike was announced as a featured
speaker at the Atlanta Jewish Community Center's November book
festival, Toni Morrison has been booked for a conference in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel laureate will read from her novel ``Paradise'' at 8
p.m. Sept. 26 at the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts as part
of the first biennial conference of the Toni Morrison Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State University(GSU)-sponsored conference Sept.
23-27 will focus on the meaning of the American South in Morrison's
fiction. Morrison's parents, like many African-Americans in Lorain,
Ohio, where she grew up, were part of the 20th-century migration
from the South.
</P>
<P>
   As her fictional characters suggest, these migrants lived with
contradictory memories of the South. They loved the communities
they left, but could not forget the racial violence and
discrimination that forced them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly,'' says conference organizer Carolyn Denard,
``humanities scholars are focusing on the cultural and
psychological meanings of the great migration. Morrison's fiction
is an important repository of those meanings. And it is precisely
this distanced, remembered view of the South _ nurturing and
inhibiting _ articulated by those who left the region that we seek
to explore during this conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Denard, a GSU English professor, launched the Toni Morrison
Society in 1993 to encourage discussions and projects devoted to
the study of the works of the author. The society publishes a
semiannual newsletter and gives an annual award for the best book
published on Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Among the events at the Atlanta conference are a performance by
Spelman College(Ga.)'s Readers' Theater, ``Talking Drum,'' and a
trip to the Noble Hill-Wheeler Museum in Bartow County, where
Morrison's father was born.
</P>
<P>
   For information about the conference, call 404-651-3584; for
tickets to Morrison's reading, call 404-651-4227.
</P>
<P>
   A LATE ADDITION: Speaking of the Atlanta Jewish Community Center
Book Festival, spokeswoman Esther Solin announced this week that
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein will speak at
7:30 p.m. Nov. 21 at the AJCC midtown branch, 1745 Peachtree Road
N.E. Wasserstein's works include ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and ``The
Sisters Rosensweig.'' Information: 404-875-7881.
</P>
<P>
   NO BARE BONES PROMOTION: Scribner is not going to scrimp on
promotion of Stephen King's novel ``Bag of Bones'' next month. The
$1 million marketing campaign will include TV commercials,
advertising in movie theaters and radio station giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the banks of Dark Score Lake in Maine, ``Bag of Bones''
(Scribner, $28) is the tale of best-selling novelist Mike Noonan,
who still grieves for his wife four years after her death.
Suffering from nightmares as well as writer's block, he flees to a
lakeside getaway named Sara Laughs. There he is drawn into a
custody battle for the 3-year-old granddaughter of a powerful
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In a note in his publisher's catalog, King says he wanted to
write one more ``really good scary story'' before he hit 50. ``I
wanted something else as well: to tell a tale combining the
romantic suspense of `Rebecca' and that sense of otherworldly
terror that permeates `The Haunting' and `The Uninvited.' ... If I
had to describe it, I'd call it a haunted love story.''
</P>
<P>
   HISTORIC DEAL: Author Margaret George has signed a seven-figure
deal with Viking Penguin for her next three books. George, whose
recent historical novel ``The Memoirs of Cleopatra'' will be an ABC
miniseries next spring, plans to focus on women in history. Her
next subject: Mary Magdalene.

 &HT;    A plane garden: Love of aircraft propels artist to create works
using found objects, imagination
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C.Herron Briggs is a plane man. Walking through
his garden in a near-downtown neighborhood of little homes and
small businesses, you see all manner of winged craft _ dozens of
them _ floating among the sunflowers, the hollyhocks and
hydrangeas, their propellers turning in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear them, too, whirring, whirring, a thousand
whispering counterpoints to the roaring traffic on Church Street.
</P>
<P>
   This is Briggs' gallery. His plane garden. Open to all.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, next to his cream-colored house, in the shade of a
big old split-trunk oak, that he displays his art, here that he
creates it. For nearly 30 years, Briggs has made planes, hunkered
down at a little bench facing the street in fine weather, holed up
in his tiny workshop when foul weather strikes. His creations are
fashioned from tin cans, pieces of wood, radios, fan blades, toy
wheels and just about anything else his fertile imagination calls
for. He has never flown in a plane and has no plans to, learning
all he knows from just looking.
</P>
<P>
   His planes draw visitors from near and far _ and were featured
in a recent exhibit of watercolors by Greenville artist Lynn Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Folk artist? You could call him that. Or just artist. But
there's more to what he does. In these planes that do not fly,
Briggs transports all who visit to places of the mind, far, far
away. We soar on his passion and joy, appreciating that he can
create meaningful art _ and have fun with it, too.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting him in March, I visited again in August. On this
warm, breezy afternoon, I find Briggs putting the finishing touches
on a stealth bomber, painted black, sporting a figure with a
bowling ball on its swept-back right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just painted this plane,'' he says. ``Had to put a special
paint on it because, you know, this plane is invisible.'' His laugh
carries down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a P-38 with a basketball player shooting over the
propeller. ``I don't know where his basket is,'' Briggs says
thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   His plane garden also grows passenger craft, fighters,
helicopters and others. Recently, he began experimenting with
brighter colors, such as purple and yellow, to complement his
longtime standards, red, white, blue and silver.
</P>
<P>
   After making planes by heart for more than two dozen years,
Briggs began fashioning some from a book (``1001 Images of
Aircraft,'' Crescent Books) that a visitor gave him about a year
ago. When the man wanted to become a business partner, ``I said,
`No, no, I don't need anybody to help me collect the money.''' His
wife, Lida, does that just fine, he says.
</P>
<P>
   With no book, no pictures, Briggs says he still could create _
in much the same way some musicians can play music after hearing it
once: ``I can see a plane, and if I see it from the side, I can
build it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in me all along,'' this love of plane-making, says
Briggs, who is a fit-looking 75 years old. ``But I didn't think it
would go this far.'' While he made a plane here and there decades
ago, his production really took off when he retired from his
forklift-operator job at a cotton warehouse in 1988. ``Now, I'm
full time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago, he'd sell a plane for $25; now, they command
prices up to about $1,000, sold to people from California to
Germany. His output ranges from five or six planes some months to
as many as 30.
</P>
<P>
   There's one he won't part with. A silver-colored helicopter with
a red saw blade for its rear propeller and a red fan blade up
front. It's one of his first creations.
</P>
<P>
   When he started tinkering in the 1960s, Briggs recalls, he was a
neighborhood curiosity, especially to youngsters. ``They'd come by
and say, `Look at that man with all those cat-food cans.''' Over
time, the lookers became visitors; the curiosity became an
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   (And the cans. I started writing down Spam cans, stew beef cans
..., when Briggs interrupted, saying, ``Oh, man, you name all the
cans I use, and you got two books.'')
</P>
<P>
   Greer, the watercolorist, passed Briggs' garden gallery for many
years before she summoned the courage to stop, ``invade his
privacy'' and introduce herself to the man whose work she had
enjoyed during drive-bys. ``The first time I saw it, in the spring
of 1997, I felt like a child in Disney World. It's just so much
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She immediately began photographing and painting the garden, and
in May presented her watercolors in a one-woman show that included
seven other gardens. ``His had to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes his art so appealing? Greer, whose connection with
Briggs shows with each click of her shutter, says, ``He has that
natural, childlike wonder that, in most of us, gets suppressed by
`technique' as we grow older. His creativity has not been
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he maintain that delightful wonder about planes if he ever
got on one?
</P>
<P>
   Would you ever fly? I ask. Says Briggs, emphatically: ``No,
please no! I don't believe I could have that kind of nerve. I love
'em down here on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense; after all, art does not have to be life.
</P>
<P>
   For a minute or two, Briggs and I say nothing, contemplating his
certain sense of flying his way; the only sound in his garden is
the whirring propellers. Taking us away.

 &HT;    450-mile-long annual rite put on by the neighbors
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Brown was plumb tickled to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bought an antique plant seeder for $25. That's a
steal,'' Brown said to her traveling companions. ``Of course, I
don't know what I'll do with it. Sit it on the porch, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was perusing early morning bargains with Hazel Miller of
Acworth, Georgia, Gail Arnette of Stockbridge, Georgia, and Dot
Spencer of Jonesboro, Georgia in a field dotted with tents and
tarps and tables in Gadsden, Alabama otherwise known as the POB.
</P>
<P>
   The POB is the Point of Beginning for the ``World's Longest
Outdoor Sale'' _ 450 miles of flotsam and jetsam from overstuffed
attics, overstuffed barns, an overstuffed century.
</P>
<P>
   Each year on the third weekend in August, folks who live along
Lookout Mountain Parkway from Gadsden to Chattanooga, Tenn. and
U.S. 127 from Chattanooga to Covington, Ky., toss everything from
rusty farm implements to male mannequin torsos out into their
meadows and main streets for one colossal yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   And each year, more than 30,000 treasure seekers trade whooshing
down the interstate for inching along scenic highways, at times
bumper to bumper, to take their pick of props. Along the way they
feast on corn bread salad, pinto beans and swamp cabbage and share
fellowship with neighbors down the road or travelers from as far
away as California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is American free enterprise at its purest,'' touts Lloyd
Wagnon, director of the Gadsden-Etowah Tourism Board and the wizard
of the sale. ``Who knows how much money changes hands? We don't
handle the cash boxes, but we can tell by the smiles on the faces
there are some good trades going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale began 11 years ago in Jamestown, Tenn., as an effort to
pull travelers off nearby interstates and into the Sequatchie River
Valley of the Cumberland Plateau. It spread like kudzu up and down
the U.S. 127 corridor, and in 1994, the Lookout Mountain Parkway
hooked up to the route.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the spirit of the sale grows, with more buyers and
sellers joining the chain. This year, there was a somber undertone
as news spread about a recent tragedy that claimed the lives of two
and injured 19 others. An 18-wheeler lost its brakes as it came
barreling down a mountainside and crashed through an intersection
of U.S. 127 near Dunlap, Tenn., tossing cars and tumbling tables
and tents. All morning, folks traded what they had heard of the
accident and advised one another to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, two-lane roads were built at a time when we went
along with the gentle curves of the green earth, rather than
blasting our way through, straight and wide. The two-lanes take you
up mountains, around town squares and along the curving spines of
lush valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Come upon a pasture and you're likely to see a cluster of
tables, some loaded up by locals, others by professional vendors
who've made the annual event a part of their circuit. Go around the
bend and you see a solitary soul sitting by the side of his truck,
hoping to sell home-grown tomatoes or his cousin's old eight-track
tape player.
</P>
<P>
   Go through small towns such as Pikeville, Tenn., and every sign
welcomes the ``U.S. 127 sale shoppers.'' The churches have opened
up as ``rest stops,'' and people seem genuinely pleased to sell you
their old party dish set for 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers come knowing what they're looking for. ``I look for
old dolls, cookbooks, cast iron and cookware,'' said Margaret Avant
of Hillsboro, who was traveling from Georgia in a motor home with
her husband, Henry. They started looking Thursday morning in
Gadsden, and by Saturday afternoon, she was in Lawrenceburg, Ky.,
with more than 20 dolls for her collection.
</P>
<P>
   Others are like Bruce Jones of Pascagoula, Miss. ``I'm looking
for the find of a lifetime,'' said Jones, traveling the route for a
second year with his wife, Ann. ``Of course, I don't know what that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, he had spent a dime on a carpenter's pencil
and a quarter on an old military patch. Not much for two days of
scavenging. But it was clear that most buyers and sellers were as
interested in visiting as bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this every year, and the greatest thing is the people
you meet,'' said Esther Clemmons in Signal Mountain, Tenn.
``Yesterday we had folks by from Oklahoma, Iowa, West Virginia and
New York. It's just so much fun to listen to their accents and try
to guess where they are from.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemmons said she makes a few hundred dollars every year from
the sale, which is now stocked with the overflow from the attics of
friends and family members since her stock is depleted. Fadana
Bramblett in Owenton, Ky., said her yard sale brings in about $900
each year, which she donates to the adult education program in her
town.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``great find'' you didn't know you were looking for,
the sale is one of those tonics you don't know you need until you
travel the route.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many outdoor events involving 30,000 people, no one was
drunk or hostile. Everyone was courteous. Buyers and sellers
actually wanted to look at each other and say hello when they were
making a transaction. Rain and traffic jams were no excuse for
impatience or rudeness. And not one single person talked of the
Monica issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than drinking and juking. I don't feel bad the
next morning,'' said Henry Avant, explaining the appeal. ``It's
just the anticipation of finding what you're looking for.''

 &HT;    Your guide to the new fall TV lingo
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost fall, which means the over-boiled hyperpole for the
new TV season is in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Of course every show can't be a hit, but if you're a highly-paid
network exec there's no tactful way to say, ``This show really
bites,'' without losing your job.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with a team of crack linguists, We Who Surf
have begun deciphering the bizarre doublespeak of the men and women
who spend gazillions of dollars every year developing new
television shows only to cancel most of them 13 weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   We've compiled a handy primer to help you, the viewers at home,
figure out what the programming execs say, and what they really
mean:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``This show has plenty of attitude.'' Translation: ``This
show has plenty of cursing.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The show is a result of corporate synergy.'' Translation:
``Our parent company is forcing us to use Scott Baio in the lead
because he's got two years left on his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It has an organic feel.'' Translation: ``We hired a slew of
writers at the last minute to punch up the pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``We had to punch up the pilot.'' Translation: ``After hiring
a slew of new writers, the show still doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``This show is an example of our programming for the
millenium.'' Translation: ``We have no idea what the show is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``This show is an example of our new family programming.''
Translation: ``Grandma will be asleep before the first commercial
break.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It will appeal to urban viewers.'' Translation: ``It has
all black characters.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It has a really hip feel.'' Translation: ``It has more than
two black characters.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``It will appeal to suburban viewers.'' Translation: ``There
are less than two black characters.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``This show is kind of quirky.'' Translation: ``This show has
more than two black characters, and one of them is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Documentry almost as good as the real thing
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Waterfalls of the Southern Appalachians'' (PBS,
check local listings), is a half-hour survey of 59 cascades in five
states and almost as good as a trip to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Impressionistic in structure, it follows Atlanta filmmaker Chris
Lockett's crisscrossing journeys to places like Amicalola Falls in
North Georgia and Dry Falls in North Carolina, and spots in South
Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The trek, a circular sweep that dabbles in history, wilderness
theory and sociology, can sometimes feel like crossing a mountain
stream one slippery stone at a time. No matter. The photography is
breathtaking, the bluegrassy soundtrack mountain-born, and
ultimately, the raw, charging beauty of these falls are what
register most.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Michael Kahn still remembers his nervousness when
Steven Spielberg hired him to edit ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind'' in 1976. On his first day on the job, after editing a scene,
Kahn awaited Spielberg's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you cut it that way?'' Spielberg asked Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it just felt right,'' said Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good enough for me,'' said Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, an Academy Award winner for ``Raiders of the Lost Ark''
and ``Schindler's List,'' has edited every Spielberg film over the
last two decades, including ``Saving Private Ryan,'' for which
several critics singled out his work. Asked about his editor,
Spielberg had one terse but telling comment: ``He's got rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of Hollywood's foremost editors, Brooklyn-born Kahn is a
veteran member of a select group whose work, while extremely
important in the creation of films, is unknown to most moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director is like the architect _ it's his or her vision _
and the editor is the builder,'' said Kahn, sitting in his editing
room at Dreamworks. ``With Steven, it's like building a beautiful
house.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Do editors feel undervalued? Of course. Editors
sit quietly in the dark and do their work. You have to like having
no ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Alan Heim, editor of classics like ``Network'' and
``All That Jazz,'' for which he won an Academy Award, said,
``People think you're in a dark room all day, eating potato chips,
removing the bad stuff and leaving in the good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the editor is a storyteller,'' he said. ``The editor
restructures and rewrites and rebalances the story by juxtaposing
images. What was in the script in the first place _ and what the
director's vision was at the beginning _ is never quite the same as
the reality of what comes out on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the expense of movies, and the increased number of
large-scale action and ``event'' films, like ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' has made the editor's role even more important than it was
in the heyday of the studio system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Editors have been undervalued because of the nature of what we
do and how we do it,'' said Donn Cambern, president of the Motion
Picture Editors Guild, whose editing career includes ``Easy Rider''
and ``Romancing the Stone.'' ``We're away from the shooting stage,
from the lights, from the celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In the last few years, though, there's been an
extraordinary awareness of the editor's role. I see it at film
festivals. I see it from students at UCLA and USC. I see it from
people in and out of the industry. There is a high level of
fascination as to what editors do.''
</P>
<P>
   What editors do is assemble film that has been shot and, in the
words of Mark Goldblatt, a top editor, ``actualize the director's
vision: interpret the filmed material presented to him by the
director and put it together, mold it, and create a motion picture
that will ultimately find its shape in the final release version.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, you're building the entire picture based on many,
many different shots with different performances,'' said Goldblatt,
whose films include ``Armageddon,'' ``The Terminator'' and its
sequel, and ``Rambo.'' ``You might pick one line of dialogue with
10 or 12 choices of that line. Whether you pick a close-up or a
medium shot or a wide shot creates a different psychological
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating the right rhythm and balance for a film can prove
herculean. Walter Murch, who received Oscars for editing and sound
mixing for ``The English Patient,'' was given 1.25 million feet of
film _ which works out to be just under 230 hours _ on Francis Ford
Coppola's ``Apocalypse Now.'' The finished film ran 2 hours 25
minutes. Murch has said that editing, even on an average film, ``is
not so much a putting together as it is discovery of a path.''
</P>
<P>
   At one level, an editor's job is to shape what has been filmed
and make it coherent in the ``first cut,'' or editor's version.
Then the director takes over, working hand in hand with the editor.
(There have been several prominent editors turned directors,
including David Lean and Robert Wise.) At another level, though,
the editor's choices are indelible and have a powerful impact on
the final film.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, for example, said that, in the creation of ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' he was near the film set on the Irish coast, where
the prolonged opening sequence of the D-Day landing was shot, and
at an abandoned British Aerospace building in Hatfield, 45 miles
north of London, where other scenes were shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven would come in any time and run footage; he was shooting
as I was editing at the same time,'' said Kahn, who began his
career by editing more than 140 episodes of ``Hogan's Heroes,'' and
who won an Emmy for the television series ``Eleanor and Franklin.''
``There were a lot of options. So the next day, he would see the
cut scene to see if he had everything he needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said the two decided to break convention for the grueling
opening battle, to show as little of the entrenched German soldiers
as possible but focus instead on the almost horrific impact the
Germans had on Americans landing on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a battle near the conclusion of the movie was a
striking display of Kahn's skill: He kept alternating between a GI
being brutally killed by a German soldier and an American who is
frozen with fear in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you intercut is so important because there's rhythm,
there's pace, there's emotional drama taking place,'' said Kahn.
``If you're on something too long, then you lose power in the next
scene. There's rhythms within a scene, and there's rhythms that are
going to move the scene forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn cited another example from ``Schindler's List,'' in which
Spielberg heightened the drama by intercutting. In one scene,
Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, is sitting in a nightclub
listening to a singer. This is contrasted with a scene in which the
German concentration camp commandant, played by Ralph Fiennes, is
sexually coercing a Jewish woman who is both a prisoner and his
housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each scene would have been lengthy, but by intercutting Steven
raised the emotional level, especially when you heard the nightclub
music while Ralph Fiennes was with the woman,'' said Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said editing a film for Spielberg was almost a visceral
exercise. ``You don't do anything from knowledge, but from feeling,
intuition,'' he said. ``I do something a certain way to see how he
reacts. I keep noodging him. I try to convince him. He's very open
with me. He often says: `Look, I'll give you my notes and ideas,
and do what you want with it. Don't play safe. Don't be afraid to
be wrong because if you're afraid, you won't try things and be
innovative.'''
</P>
<P>
   Why editors often feel undervalued is partly rooted in their
history and, perhaps, their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Chew, one of the editors of ``Star Wars,'' ``One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and, more recently, ``Waiting to Exhale''
and ``Hope Floats,'' said that as significant as editors were in
the creation of films, they were often ignored even within the
movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's our fault,'' said Chew. ``We tend to be more
self-effacing. We're not as articulate and certainly not as
egotistical as directors.'' He laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But Tina Hirsch, whose films include ``Dante's Peak'' as well as
several television mini-series, observed: ``At first, the film
editor was, literally, the director's secretary. A film was shot as
if it were a play. Each scene was a single master shot, and the
secretary would assemble them for a 10-minute movie.'' Later,
editors sometimes worked in studio hallways with Moviolas, the
editing machines that have been superseded somewhat by digital
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors, like Kahn on ``Saving Private Ryan,'' use the
Moviola instead of digital technology, in which films are edited on
computers. Spielberg is one of a handful of filmmakers who still
use the old-style Moviola on all films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven likes the smell of film,'' said Kahn. ``He likes to
feel it, hold it. He doesn't want to look at a monitor. He also
likes the idea of the Moviola. This is how so many great movies
were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the Moviola, editors ``made their marks on each piece of
film and cut it physically, and then you went to your next piece of
film,'' said Heim, editor of ``All That Jazz.'' ``You put the
pieces on pins in a bin, and then you splice these pieces together,
and you have your first cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new method, everything is digitally loaded into a
computer. You splice it together electronically, using a key
stroke. The benefits are speed and the ability to make many choices
and look at alternatives instantly.'' But ``the image is not as
good to look at,'' he said, ``and it's more difficult to make
certain performance judgments. It's hard to see peoples' eyes, and
most editors use eyes a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences. ``We used to make one decision a
minute, now we make 30 decisions,'' Ms. Hirsch said of the new
digital technology. ``The impact of that is a much more intense
working situation. There's no dip in concentration. Time is more
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   By several accounts, though, the actual result of using digital
editing, while accelerating the process, is not especially
different from the Moviola days.
</P>
<P>
   (Editing is one of the few jobs in movies that have
traditionally been available to women. The top editors in recent
decades have included Dede Allen, who made ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and
``Dog Day Afternoon''; Verna Fields, who edited ``American
Graffiti'' and ``Jaws''; Ann Coates, who made ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' and other David Lean classics, and Thelma Schoonmaker, who
edited a number of Martin Scorsese's films.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most delicate issue for editors is their
relationship, sometimes ambivalent, with the director. Chew said
that working with first-time directors like Forest Whitaker
(``Waiting to Exhale'') and Tom Hanks (``That Thing You Do'') was
especially satisfying. ``Maybe because they're actors and realize
how collaborative the process is, they welcomed and acknowledged
the editor's contribution to the picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other directors are far less forthcoming about their editors,
Chew said. ``Very seldom have I worked on a film where the director
is in the editing room every day that I'm there,'' he said. ``By
and large, they come in, look at what I've done, give me some
notes, and they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing annoys an editor more than to hear a director giving
interviews saying, `I'm really busy editing my film now,''' Chew
added. ``What the director means to say is that he hasn't shown up
in the editing room that day to see what the editor has done
because he's too busy taking all these meetings looking for his
next project.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, though, editors and directors are collaborators who
understand each other's role and talents. Kahn said that his
experiences editing Spielberg's films, especially some recent ones,
had affected him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Private Ryan,' I felt like a soldier, and with
`Schindler's List' I felt like a Jewish prisoner,'' he said. ``I
took it hard. It was very intense. When it was over, I'd talk about
it and start crying. Steven was very nice about it. He said, `I'm
going to put you on a comedy to lighten you up a little bit.' So he
put me on `Casper.' That lightened me up.''

asked a young engineer fresh out of MIT, `And what starting salary
were you looking for?'
</P>
<P>
   The engineer said, `In the neighborhood of $125,000 a year,
depending on the benefits package.'
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer said, `Well, what would you say to a package of
5-weeks vacation, 14 paid holidays, full medical and dental,
company matching retirement fund to 50% of salary, and a company
car leased every 2 years _ say, a red Corvette?'

   &UR; Clinton rules late night television &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So there I was enjoying the happy glow of confusion that
enveloped me following the president's drive-by confession, when I
began to fantasize about the huge effect it will have on modern
television.
</P>
<P>
   Fade in ...
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Great show, Seymore. Ratings went through the roof.
For a pilot, it was kind of short, but I think we might be able to
convince the studio to give us a contact for 12 more episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: Episodes? Pilot? That wasn't a pilot, sir. That was
President
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apology to the country for having had something
resembling but apparently almost completely unlike actual sex in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Apology? Seymore, you amaze me. That was no apology.
If anything, it was merely a mea gulpa.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: A mea gulpa?
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Yeah, It's like a mea culpa, except you are thrown up
against a wall and people point rifles at you. I want more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: But, sir, the president says it's time to put this
matter behind us. It's time to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Move forward? Are you insane? No, moving forward! We
camp here. Water the horses. Pitch the tents. This is the Ponderosa
of Ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I don't know, sir. The latest polls say that people
don't want to hear anymore about this story.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Seymore, I know you're the station owner's nephew, but
if you say anything that stupid again, I'll smack you with
teleprompter. Those are polls of ALL Americans, not Americans who
watch television. Television watchers want more, more, more!
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I have to admit, that was the best late night numbers
we've ever had. But there's no way we can get Clinton to do a
regular gig. Maybe he'll invade Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Invade Iraq? Are you crazy? You know how expensive
covering a war is? No, we want Bill. In a chair. With some fake
flowers behind him. Perfect demographics, low production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: But he can't confess more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Sure he can. There's Paula, Gennifer, Kathleen, Sharon
... god, we might be talking syndication after two years!
Confession may be good for the soul, but it's dynamite for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Symore: But how do we know he won't lie again?
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Who cares? Lying's cool. But before each show we'll
put him under oath: Mr. President, do you swear to be legally
accurate, be wholly legally accurate and to be nothing but legally
accurate, so help you God?
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I don't know, sir...
</P>
<P>
   Producer: And we'll have a patriotic lead in, like, you know,
rework the Declaration of Independence to make it more relevant to
the Trickle Down Morality crowd: We hold these legally accurate
thingies to be self evident, that all men are created theoretically
equal ...
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: My uncle might not ...
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Uncle? Great idea! Our co-host will be Uncle Sam, Ed
McMahon in a big hat. He'll say things like: Honesty is one of the
better policies. Being legally accurate is the best policy. Boffo
stuff!
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: There is a slight possibility the president might be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Argh! Bite your tongue, you nitwit. Don't even breathe
that. My God. Al Gore as president. Viewers will stay away in
droves. Gore is so boring, he could kill radio. He thinks
television commercials cause global worming.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I believe that's warming, not worming.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Whatever. The man's a ratings assassin. No, we need
more Bill. All Bill, all the time. Must See Bill Confess T.V.,
Seymore. That's the ticket.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What odd symmetry: On the very day that Boris Yeltsin devalued
the ruble, Bill Clinton devalued himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even presidents have private lives,'' Mr. Clinton says. Well,
not all. Some never had private lives, not having served in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   We bet the Clintons' vacation plans would have changed if Monica
Lewinsky's first name were Martha.
</P>
<P>
   In his post-testimony speech, Mr. Clinton talked of ``the two
people I love most _ my wife and our daughter.'' How telling that
he felt obligated to say who they are.
</P>
<P>
   There's some talk that the president might have to give more
grand jury testimony. Why? To get him to confess he's the ``real
killer'' O.J. has been looking for?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his answers in the January deposition ``were
legally accurate.'' One more indication of what a low standard that
is.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's speech, Senator Hatch was overheard
saying, ``Wasn't that pathetic? I tell you, what a jerk.'' Senator
Ashcroft, by contrast, wasn't as complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he's proud of Bill Clinton because he ``had the
courage to acknowledge mistakes.'' Real courage would be a vice
president acknowledging a president's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misled people,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``including even my
wife.'' Obviously one of his speech writers this time was Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise: Mr. Clinton went right from his testimony and
TV speech to a vacation without an appearance on, say, Jerry
Springer's show.

 &HT;    10 MUST-HAVES FOR COLLEGE
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 23: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time has come for freshmen entering college to consider two
crucial questions: what to major in and what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one's easily answered.
</P>
<P>
   But the thought process involved in the former has applications
for the latter as well.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a major and packing for college are both best achieved
by covering the basics. Comfort, practicality and versatility are
qualities to look for in campus wear. But choosing clothes that
make sense doesn't necessarily obviate (oh, look it up)
opportunities for students to showcase their individual sense of
style.
</P>
<P>
   The checklist below should serve as a guide to those students
with more doubt in their minds than time on their hands to get
packed. Unlike some guides, this one doesn't demand that you ``stay
with the group.'' Just don't stray so far from it that you wind up
looking and feeling lost.
</P>
<P>
   MEN
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gilligan'' hat: For when you really need a haircut, or the
one you got from a new barber is too laughable for words. ($28 from
Gadzooks)
</P>
<P>
   The blue blazer: For fraternity soirees or that ``chat'' with
the dean. ($230 from Brooks Brothers)
</P>
<P>
   The messenger-style shoulder bag: Backpacks are for book-laden
dorks.
</P>
<P>
   ($17 from the Gap Outlet)
</P>
<P>
   Vests: It doesn't take much to dress up a T-shirt ($25 by Point
Zero, from Uptons.)
</P>
<P>
   Dark denim: Fewer visible stains equal fewer trips to the
laundry room. ($20 from the Gap Outlet)
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Hair jewelry: For days when that just-got-out-of-bed look isn't
intentional. (``Chopsticks'' and ponytail clip, both $4 from
Claire's Boutique)
</P>
<P>
   The little black dress: When asked out on a date, it's OK to act
surprised, not be caught off-guard. ($50 from the BCBG Outlet)
</P>
<P>
   The messenger-style shoulder bag: Better-looking and better for
you than backpacks. ($17 from the Gap Outlet)
</P>
<P>
   Dark denim: They've got an edge in style over the faded jeans of
old. ($20 from the Gap Outlet)
</P>
<P>
   High-heeled sneakers: For a needed lift when you're on the go,
go, go.
</P>
<P>
   ($50 by Sbicca, from Uptons.)
</P>
<P>
   Just trust us on this one. (Panties $3 each, sheer bra/panty set
$5.50, all from the L'eggs-Hanes-Bali-Playtex Outlet)

   &UR; HONOLULU LITE &LR;

<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clinton rules late night television &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So there I was enjoying the happy glow of confusion that
enveloped me following the president's drive-by confession, when I
began to fantasize about the huge effect it will have on modern
television.
</P>
<P>
   Fade in ...
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Great show, Seymore. Ratings went through the roof.
For a pilot, it was kind of short, but I think we might be able to
convince the studio to give us a contact for 12 more episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: Episodes? Pilot? That wasn't a pilot, sir. That was
President
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apology to the country for having had something
resembling but apparently almost completely unlike actual sex in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Apology? Seymore, you amaze me. That was no apology.
If anything, it was merely a mea gulpa.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: A mea gulpa?
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Yeah, It's like a mea culpa, except you are thrown up
against a wall and people point rifles at you. I want more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: But, sir, the president says it's time to put this
matter behind us. It's time to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Move forward? Are you insane? No, moving forward! We
camp here. Water the horses. Pitch the tents. This is the Ponderosa
of Ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I don't know, sir. The latest polls say that people
don't want to hear anymore about this story.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Seymore, I know you're the station owner's nephew, but
if you say anything that stupid again, I'll smack you with
teleprompter. Those are polls of ALL Americans, not Americans who
watch television. Television watchers want more, more, more!
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I have to admit, that was the best late night numbers
we've ever had. But there's no way we can get Clinton to do a
regular gig. Maybe he'll invade Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Invade Iraq? Are you crazy? You know how expensive
covering a war is? No, we want Bill. In a chair. With some fake
flowers behind him. Perfect demographics, low production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: But he can't confess more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Sure he can. There's Paula, Gennifer, Kathleen, Sharon
... god, we might be talking syndication after two years!
Confession may be good for the soul, but it's dynamite for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Symore: But how do we know he won't lie again?
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Who cares? Lying's cool. But before each show we'll
put him under oath: Mr. President, do you swear to be legally
accurate, be wholly legally accurate and to be nothing but legally
accurate, so help you God?
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I don't know, sir...
</P>
<P>
   Producer: And we'll have a patriotic lead in, like, you know,
rework the Declaration of Independence to make it more relevant to
the Trickle Down Morality crowd: We hold these legally accurate
thingies to be self evident, that all men are created theoretically
equal ...
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: My uncle might not ...
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Uncle? Great idea! Our co-host will be Uncle Sam, Ed
McMahon in a big hat. He'll say things like: Honesty is one of the
better policies. Being legally accurate is the best policy. Boffo
stuff!
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: There is a slight possibility the president might be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Argh! Bite your tongue, you nitwit. Don't even breathe
that. My God. Al Gore as president. Viewers will stay away in
droves. Gore is so boring, he could kill radio. He thinks
television commercials cause global worming.
</P>
<P>
   Seymore: I believe that's warming, not worming.
</P>
<P>
   Producer: Whatever. The man's a ratings assassin. No, we need
more Bill. All Bill, all the time. Must See Bill Confess T.V.,
Seymore. That's the ticket.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What odd symmetry: On the very day that Boris Yeltsin devalued
the ruble, Bill Clinton devalued himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even presidents have private lives,'' Mr. Clinton says. Well,
not all. Some never had private lives, not having served in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   We bet the Clintons' vacation plans would have changed if Monica
Lewinsky's first name were Martha.
</P>
<P>
   In his post-testimony speech, Mr. Clinton talked of ``the two
people I love most _ my wife and our daughter.'' How telling that
he felt obligated to say who they are.
</P>
<P>
   There's some talk that the president might have to give more
grand jury testimony. Why? To get him to confess he's the ``real
killer'' O.J. has been looking for?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his answers in the January deposition ``were
legally accurate.'' One more indication of what a low standard that
is.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's speech, Senator Hatch was overheard
saying, ``Wasn't that pathetic? I tell you, what a jerk.'' Senator
Ashcroft, by contrast, wasn't as complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he's proud of Bill Clinton because he ``had the
courage to acknowledge mistakes.'' Real courage would be a vice
president acknowledging a president's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misled people,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``including even my
wife.'' Obviously one of his speech writers this time was Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise: Mr. Clinton went right from his testimony and
TV speech to a vacation without an appearance on, say, Jerry
Springer's show.

   NEW YORK _ As any number of performers will tell you, Hollywood
can be humbling. Take Billy Crudup, for example, the promising
young actor whose last two films, ``Grind'' and ``Inventing the
Abbotts,'' were quick-to-video releases.
</P>
<P>
   Now Crudup, who was widely praised in the 1996 production of
``Bus Stop'' at Circle in the Square, is returning to the stage to
appear as the title character in ``Oedipus,'' by Dare Clubb,
starting on Sept. 20 at the CSC Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He joins a cast that includes Frances McDormand, who won an
Academy Award in 1997 playing a pregnant police officer in
``Fargo.'' She will play Merope, the adoptive mother of Oedipus.
</P>
<P>
   Country Rambler
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up another continent for Garth Brooks. Brooks, the country
music star who conquered New York's Central Park last summer, will
stage his first show in South America on Saturday. The concert, in
Barretos, Brazil, coincides with the Rodeo Barretos, a 10-day event
that is expected to draw as many as 1.5 million visitors to the
inland city.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is anticipating a considerably smaller audience, but more
than 30,000 tickets have already been sold. In addition to Brooks,
the rodeo will feature performances from Chitaozinho and Xororo, a
top Brazilian country duo.
</P>

   Cabaret would seem to be anything but academic, but starting
Friday at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn.,
some of the biggest names in the song-and-dance business will be
sitting down to discuss their craft and teach some younger show
people the tricks of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Neill Cabaret Symposium, which runs until Aug. 29, is said
to be the only conference in the United States devoted to the form,
and will include performances and workshops by the singers Margaret
Whiting and Julie Wilson, and the actress Tovah Feldshuh.
Thirty-five ``Cabaret fellows'' were admitted to this year's
conference, which will also be celebrating its 10th anniversary
with a ``master teachers' special performance'' on Aug. 28.

   Continuing a recent crackdown on unlicensed radio, the Federal
Communications Commission has announced the closing of 15 pirate
radio stations in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The low-power stations were raided late last month by agents of
the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies. The FCC
chairman, William Kennard, called the raids the largest action ever
against unlicensed stations, and said the commission would
``continue vigorously to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Ruggiero, co-founder of the New York Free Media
Alliance, which supports pirate radio, called the raids an attack
on free speech. Stations must maintain a minimum transmission power
of 100 watts to be licensed; most pirate stations broadcast at 10
to 20 watts.

HIGHLY TOUTED `MEET JOE BLACK' REPORTEDLY OVER BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It's an unwritten Hollywood rule that action and
special-effects movies, like ``Titanic,'' go over budget.
Unpredictable weather, computer glitches and expensive crowd scenes
all contribute to soaring costs.
</P>
<P>
   A corollary to that rule is that romantic dramas and comedies,
like ``The Bridges of Madison County,'' ``Sleepless in Seattle'' or
``City of Angels,'' generally keep within tight budgetary
constraints.
</P>
<P>
   And then, or so the buzz goes, there's ``Meet Joe Black.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most anticipated films of the fall, ``Meet Joe
Black'' is a romantic drama with Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and
Claire Forlani that has reached production costs of about $90
million, several agents and producers said. This would be a record
for a traditional romance.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and agents with knowledge of the movie's finances said
that the film was as much as $30 million over budget, although
Universal Pictures, which made the film, says that figure is much
too high. The movie, set to be released Nov. 13, was nearly three
hours long but will probably be pared down to two hours and 30 to
40 minutes, still at least half an hour longer than the usual
romantic drama.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Silver, chairman of Universal Pictures, said that the
movie, directed by Martin Brest, was over budget, ``but not
insanely over budget.'' He said that the rumors proliferating
around Hollywood about its cost were not true, though he declined
to say how much the film cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty Brest is a perfectionist,'' Silver said. ``This is a
first-class production, and I committed to Marty that we'd be
making this first-class in New York and Rhode Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great movie, a complete home run,'' he said. ``It's
over two and a half hours in length and it didn't go anywhere near
$30 million over budget. That's nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver added that Brest's two previous films, ``Midnight Run,''
with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin, and ``Scent of a Woman,''
for which Al Pacino won an Academy Award, had been profitable.
``This will be a commercial and critical success too,'' Silver
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black,'' adapted by Bo Goldman, one of Hollywood's
foremost screenwriters, and inspired by the 1934 Fredric March
classic ``Death Takes a Holiday,'' deals with a young man who
recently died (Pitt) and who embodies death as a kind of Grim
Reaper. He takes a holiday among the living, encounters a business
tycoon (Hopkins) and falls in love with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Brest is known here as a perfectionist, albeit a successful one,
who labors over projects for years. One of his most successful was
``Beverly Hills Cop,'' the 1984 comedy that made Eddie Murphy a
star.
</P>
<P>
   Why ``Meet Joe Black'' costs so much, in contrast to other
romantic dramas, is not entirely clear. A coming Warner Brothers
romantic comedy, ``You've Got Mail,'' starring Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan, and directed by Nora Ephron, cost $60 million to $65 million,
mostly because of the huge salaries of the two stars and because it
was made in New York City. ``Bridges of Madison County,'' another
romantic drama, cost about $35 million and grossed more than $70
million. More recently, ``City of Angels,'' a romance with Nicolas
Cage and Ms. Ryan, cost about $55 million and grossed nearly $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and others who are knowledgeable about ``Meet Joe
Black'' attributed the high costs partly to slower-than-usual
filming, which delayed the opening by about five months. That meant
post-production offices were kept open far longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the studio said that the shooting was at
least two months over schedule, which drove up salaries and
overtime pay. In addition, an elaborate set as well as a swimming
pool were built to serve as the glittering home of the Anthony
Hopkins character.
</P>
<P>
   The sets included highly expensive rented antiques and
furniture. Instead of using them for a limited period of time, said
one producer, the filmmaker kept the stage home going for an
extended period. .
</P>
<P>
   Various executives expressed surprise at reports of the high
cost of the movie, largely because it will have to turn into a
substantial box office success to earn its money. With marketing
costs reaching $35 million to $40 million, ``Meet Joe Black,'' just
to break even, would have to match the box office totals of a
successful film like ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' which grossed $126.5
million. The potential, of course, is far greater: the record
setter for a romance is ``Ghost,'' which grossed $217 million.

TREASURY PRICES ARE LITTLE CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices were little changed Wednesday,
with the dollar continuing to slide against the yen. This was
attributed to talk of possible intervention by the Japanese to aid
the yen. Also a report of stronger-than-expected housing starts
gave investors little incentive to buy bonds with yields near
record lows.
</P>
<P>
   Traders also said that recent strength in the stock market had
drawn capital away from the government securities market, with the
shorter maturities outperforming the longer-term issues. Hedge
funds are said to be actively going into shorter-maturity bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 99 7/32. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
was also unchanged at 5.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government's report on housing starts in July, said Marilyn
Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, suggests
that construction starts are back to the levels recorded during the
housing boom of the 1980s. Housing starts increased by 5.7 percent
last month, to an annual rate of 1.72 million units, the highest
level since March 1987. Economists had expected a decline in
housing starts.
</P>
<P>
   The low interest rates that have produced strong housing
construction may also help offset the economic slowdown caused by
the Asian financial crisis and decline in demand for U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds did manage to ward off some of the day's weakness when the
Federal Reserve Bank bought $1.023 billion in notes and bonds. The
central bank entered the market as a buyer to add money to the
banking system, which addressed a seasonal shortage of banking
reserves, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Treasury announced that it plans to sell $15
billion of two-year notes next Wednesday. In when-issued trading
ahead of the auction, dealers were offering the notes at a price to
yield 5.31 percent.

FIDELITY NAMES MCGOVERN SENIOR OPERATIONS OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments Wednesday named Gail McGovern, AT&AMP;T Corp.'s
highest ranking female executive, as senior operations officer at
the mutual fund firm's sales and distribution unit for individual
and brokerage clients.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, 46, was executive vice president of AT&AMP;T's consumer
markets division, where she oversaw worldwide consumer sales and
marketing for the telecommunications giant at a time of increased
competition. She faces a similar task at Boston-based Fidelity,
which is working to maintain and build market share amid stiffer
competition in the fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern reports to J. Gary Burkhead, who oversees Fidelity's
Personal Investments and Brokerage Group, the sales and
distribution unit. ``Her first challenge will be to bring new
dimensions to the way we reach, touch, and hold our 6.3 million
retail customers,'' Burkhead said. The group oversees $274 billion
in managed assets out of Fidelity's total $693 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is the latest step by Fidelity, already the
nation's largest provider of employee-sponsored retirement plans,
to court individual customers. Fidelity's marketing head, Stephen
A. Cone, who was appointed in February, is also revamping the
firm's approach to one of its core consumer segments.

A TOUCH OF FAITH AND HOPE... BUT NO SPICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call 'em the anti-Spice Girls. Or the Nice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   With a string of 15 No. 1 hits on Christian radio, Point of
Grace has rapidly become contemporary Christian music's most
popular girl group.
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't call themselves Faith Spice, Hope Spice, Charity
Spice and Chastity Spice. Even though, that is, the foursome's
Heather Floyd has boldly proclaimed on stage, ``I'm 25 and I'm a
virgin. It is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Point of Grace's lush harmonies, pop rhythms and optimistic
lyrics are in evidence on the Grammy-nominated group's fourth and
latest album, ``Steady On'' (Word/Epic), the follow-up to ``Life,
Love &AMP; Other Mysteries.'' The earlier disc sold more than 500,000
copies and is still in the top 20 on Billboard's Top Contemporary
Christian albums chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tragic so many people don't listen to the lyrics
they're exposed to everyday,'' Floyd, now 28, said. ``Lyrics can
have an effect on you. They can sink in. You don't see a lot of
light in the dark world we live in today.''
</P>
<P>
   That spirit is echoed in such new Point of Grace songs as ``Who
Am I,'' ``Drawing Me Closer'' and ``The Song Is Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the group's Shelley Breen says, ``We've always been about
encouragement. We've always been about hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Jones, Terry Jones (no relation) and Floyd have been
friends since singing in church groups in Norman, Okla. They formed
Point of Grace in 1991 with Denise's roommate, Shelley, when all
four attended a small Baptist college in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the approach was hands-on. With Denise as
musical director, Shelley focused on booking, Heather did publicity
and Terry took care of the money. Within three years, they signed
with top Christian label Word Records; their 1993 debut spawned six
No. 1 singles and the press started calling them ``the Supremes of
Christian pop.''
</P>
<P>
   The group appears Sept. 11 at the New Life Clinic's Women of
Faith: Bring Back the Joy conference at the Pond in Anaheim. The
conferences have been likened to a female version of the Promise
Keepers.
</P>
<P>
   Relating to female fans of various ages has become easier this
year for Point of Grace since both Denise and Terry have become
moms. Breen is married, too, while Floyd _ well, things haven't
changed since she made that on-stage declaration of her passion for
purity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want girls and guys to know I'm as normal as the next
person,'' Floyd says. ``I have weaknesses like everybody else. I
know I'm human. But it's encouraging to young people that I can say
I'm 28 and still a virgin. Now, the road to that is not easy. You
have to make the decision early. And you have to be prepared for
the moment when you will be tempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know being a teen in the '90s is even harder than it was in
the '80s. But God never changes and he's the one that gives you
strength. It's an enormous message we want to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not your typical top-40 fare by any means.
</P>
<P>
   Point of Grace has been involved with Mercy Ministries of
America, a nonprofit nationwide outreach program for unwed mothers
and troubled teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dedicated to what we sing about,'' Floyd said. ``We
never try to water down our lyrics. We're about the Lord and if you
want to be encouraged, then great. But we never sit in judgment of
anybody. If there's anything endearing about us, it's that we love
people _ not just Christian people, all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian pop is one of the fastest-growing segments in the
music industry, raking in more than $750 million in record sales
and concert receipts last year.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet's new album, ``Steady On,'' has been called
something of a departure for the group in that it showcases more
personal vocals. The project marks the first pairing of Point of
Grace with award-winning producer Brown Bannister for an entire
album.
</P>
<P>
   Elisa Elder, Word's vice president and general manager, called
the disc ``a giant leap in artistic growth'' for the singers, who
shared an early appreciation for Christian pop superstar Amy Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of music _ classical, reggae, rock _ all
kinds,'' Floyd said. ``But I was listening to Sarah McLachlan and
started really hearing the lyrics for the first time. And they were
horrible. They didn't make me feel good at all. I respect
musicians, but a lot of times people go overboard trying to be deep
and introspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd believes the message of Point of Grace can only become
more widespread as the group grows in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she said: ``God put that in us for a reason.''

U.N. PANEL URGES SEX TRADE BE RECOGNIZED AS THRIVING ECONOMIC
SECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The sex trade is a flourishing economic enterprise, and
should be officially recognized as such, according to a new report
issued Wednesday by the International Labor Organization, the
United Nations labor panel.
</P>
<P>
   The study stopped short of calling for legalization of
prostitution. Its author, Lin Lim, emphasized at a press briefing
that there was a vast difference between adult prostitution and
child prostitution, which the ILO wants eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two different phenomenons,'' she said. ``All child
prostitution is intolerable, but adults choose it for a variety of
reasons. Many choose it as the most viable, lucrative
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The 222-page report, titled, ``The Sex Sector: The Economic and
Social Bases of Prostitution in Southeast Asia,'' surveyed
commercial sex work in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   It found the ``sex sector is not recognized as an economic
sector in official statistics, development plans or government
budgets'' in these countries.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the revenues it generates are crucial to the livelihoods
and earnings potential of millions of workers beyond the
prostitutes themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was researched before Asia's current economic
crisis, the economic and social forces behind the sex trade show no
signs of abating, especially in the face of the region's rising
unemployment, Ms. Lim said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on evidence from the mid-1980s economic recession, she
concluded that ``it is very likely that women who lose their jobs
in manufacturing and other service sectors and whose families rely
on their remittances may be driven to enter the sex sector.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, for example, the ILO found that prostitutes were
sending as much as $300 million to their rural relatives each year.
Based on that figure, the report estimated Thailand's over all
annual income from prostitution to be from $22 billion to $27
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sex industry's revenues in Indonesia was estimated to be
from $1.2 billion to $3.3 billion yearly, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates in countries were based on police, government and
non- governmental organization sources, she said.

COLOMBIA PRESIDENT OFFERS NEW PLAN FOR COCA GROWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE DEL GUAVIARE, Colombia _ The optimism of a fresh start.
The sweet talk of reconciliation. The promise of a respectable way
to make a living instead of growing coca. Dagoberto P. has heard it
all before. And this year, he is not buying.
</P>
<P>
   Dagoberto, who owns some 40 hectares planted with coca,
remembered earlier proposals that went by the names of
``alternative development'' and ``crop substitution'' that never
materialized. Now, Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, is
calling for a Marshall Plan to bring the coca-growing hinterlands
of Colombia into the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't crop substitution at all,'' he recalled of an
earlier administration's pledge. ``It was forced fumigation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still no highway from here to Bogota, a 275-mile
journey that takes a truck eight days, so vegetables rot by the
time they reach market.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's ``Marshall Plan'' is part of an ambitious array of
ideas he has formulated to curtail drug trafficking and recover a
nation reeling from decades of war.
</P>
<P>
   With government coffers empty, the new administration is
proposing a new kind of bond. The bonds would create a fund to
bring electricity, water, roads and technical expertise to
forgotten rural areas where poverty and government indifference
have allowed coca-growing and rebel movements to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the coca-growing heartland of Colombia, where the
U.S.-backed war on drugs is fought with herbicides and helicopter
gunships, coca growers remain skeptical. Any plan's first obstacle
might well lie with the growers themselves, embittered by years of
fumigation and confrontation with government authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way or another, they've been saying that for years, and
we've been asking for it,'' said Antonio R., another coca grower
and father of five. ``But all we've ever had are expectations.''
Like other growers interviewed, he asked that his full name not be
published out of fear for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Pastrana administration is asking for international help,
and U.S. administration officials appear willing to listen. Peter
Romero, acting assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said Washington had ``several hundred million dollars on
the table for Colombia,'' some of which could be available for
alternative development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Colombia has to do is put together a strategy,'' Romero
said on a recent visit here. ``We're just waiting to see that
strategy, to evaluate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has also made a priority of negotiating peace with
rebels who protect coca growers, acceding to rebel demands that
government security forces temporarily leave five municipalities,
covering an area twice the size of El Salvador, as a condition for
beginning peace talks by early November.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, is
believed to number 15,000 combatants and 10 times as many quiet
supporters who provide logistical help. The president vows that he
will personally lead the talks with them.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are suggesting they would be willing to abandon their
drug revenues, which some analysts estimate at $100 million a year,
as part of a peace agreement that would provide other ways for
coca-growing peasants to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are skeptical that the rebels will actually give
up the coca revenues. ``There'd have to be some powerful reward and
punishment algorithm to make that happen,'' Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
the White House anti-drug chief, said earlier this month, just
before Pastrana's inauguration. But Pastrana, who eluded his
security guards to secretly meet the FARC's top commander last
month, seems willing to take the rebels at their word.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially fatal stumbling block lies in the price for
signing a peace accord and pledging to control the drug trade. The
rebels are likely to demand local autonomy and control over the
government budget in their regions.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. officials publicly contend they are interested in
Colombia's civil conflict solely because of the drug trade,
privately they admit they are also concerned about the conflict
spilling over Colombia's borders and causing regional instability.
Officials in Bogota and Washington balk at the notion of funding a
rebel state within the state in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there hasn't been sincerity on the part of either
side,'' said Alejandro Ovalles, a restaurant owner who runs a local
business association. ``War is a business in any part of the world.
There's lots of mistrust on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless people here say that the insurgents are the only
actors with the presence, muscle and local respect who can put a
rapid end to coca growing. They say that at one time the rebels
banned commercial fishing at a local river that was being rapidly
depleted, and fishermen obeyed. Another time, they forbade coca
growers to cut down trees in a part of the rain forest, and again,
nobody dared to defy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about educating people,'' the local Roman Catholic parish
priest, the Rev. Jorge Vargas, said. ``But it's based in fear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though their lives are intimately affected by U.S. policies, the
growers complained of feeling invisible to decision makers in
Washington. When McCaffrey visited the anti-narcotics base here
recently, the town became ``militarized'' and people said they
stayed shut in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the kind of people you like to deal with, but we're
human beings.'' said Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   This year the U.S. has doubled the pace of chemical fumigation
to kill coca crops, but the governor of Guaviare, for one, does not
expect results. ``After seven years of fumigating, there's more
coca than ever,'' said Gov. Hernando Gonzalez Villamizar.
</P>
<P>
   Now growers say they would be eager to give up coca growing if
they could earn a livelihood elsewhere, perhaps here in the city or
even elsewhere in the country. Since many of them started growing
and processing coca here 15 years ago, the cost of processing coca
has soared, while the prices paid for cocaine have stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 55 gallons of gasoline and 110 pounds of cement to
process a kilo of cocaine. Dagoberto said growers collect $1,000
for a kilo. Upon hearing that a gram of cocaine sells for $100 by
the time it reaches New York, he looked at the floor and shook his
head. Here it sells for a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The state secretary of culture, Pedro Arenas, said that the rain
forest could not sustain the estimated 20,000 growers living in it.
The growers, many of whom came here to escape violence and
hopelessness in other parts of Colombia, should be sent back home
and given land, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marshall Plan here would be called agrarian reform,''
Arenas said.
</P>
<P>
   The jungle is scarred, burned and polluted with the astonishing
quantities of cement and gasoline involved in producing the
Guaviare's 240,000 kilos of coca paste each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white man,'' said Dagoberto, ``doesn't know how to live in
the jungle.''

A SIGN OF HOPE? ADAMS AND TRIMBLE ATTEND BOMBING FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ The grieving and angry people of this
town buried their dead Wednesday and heaped scorn on the guerrillas
who caused the killings in a huge car bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of clergymen and politicians sought to encourage
the daunted population that the peace agreement would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the 28 people killed were laid to rest around Omagh,
a mostly Catholic town set in dairy farm country 60 miles west of
Belfast that became the scene Saturday for the worst carnage in 29
years of sectarian violence in Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were three young boys, buried Wednesday in the
town of Bucrana, across the Irish Republic border in County
Donegal. In a rare appearance together, both Gerry Adams, president
of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, and his
adversary David Trimble, the Protestant leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party and First Minister of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, attended the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new and welcome development,'' the Roman Catholic
Bishop of Donegal, Seamus Heggarty, said in his funeral sermon.
``Both of you are very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the peace agreement approved by a large margin in
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in May was ``the only
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has refused to talk to Adams or his Sinn Fein colleagues
in the Assembly, and the two adversaries are likely to clash over
whether Adams gets a post in the new Northern Ireland government.
But the Sinn Fein leader has expressly condemned the Omagh attack,
which claimed both Protestant and Catholic lives, wounded 220
people and has drawn revulsion from many on both sides of the
sectarian divide.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced that the Irish
Republic would take what he called ``draconian'' legal measures to
fight terrorism, saying Parliament would be summoned in two to
three weeks to approve them. The steps, if approved, will make it
easier to convict people of membership in a terrorist organization.
But, significantly, they do not include a renewal of preventive
detention, allowing internment of suspects without trial. Such
detential remains legal but has not been used in years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Britain interned hundreds of IRA suspects, but
this backfired when inmates went on highly publicized hunger
strikes in the early 1980s, becoming internationally known and, in
several cases, dying for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Sands, the sister of the first hunger striker to die,
Bobby Sands, is now prominent in the 32 County Sovereignty
Committee, which vehemently opposes the Northern Ireland peace
agreement. She announced Wednesday that she and her partner,
Michael McKevitt, were quitting their home near Dundalk, in the
Irish Republic a few miles from the border, because they felt their
children were being threatened by angry townspeople who suspected
the family was involved in the attack. British newspapers have
identified McKevitt as the supposed head of the Real IRA, the
splinter group that carried out the bombing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Irish national television, Ms. Sands denied
she or McKevitt were involved in the bombing, but declined to
condemn violence for political ends.
</P>
<P>
   Her tough talk contrasted starkly with the muted outrage on the
streets of Omagh. Wednesday afternoon, on a bridge over the River
Strule, a few hundred yards from the bombing scene, people came to
stare silently at several hundred bouquets and at British soldiers
in full combat uniform guarding the area.
</P>
<P>
   Both Catholics and Protestants here were bitter and cynical
about the cease-fire announced late Tuesday by the Real IRA, which
is made up of about 100 dissidents from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their warnings were false, so their cease-fire is false,''
said a 40-year old man who declined to give his name for fear of
terrorist reprisal. ``They'll carry out their next atrocity under
some other name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA admitted on Tuesday afternoon that it had placed
the bomb and said, incredibly to most people here, that it had not
intended to hurt anyone. It denied that its warning phone calls had
misled the police into moving people toward the bomb instead of
away from it.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA members broke with the main IRA over the Northern
Ireland peace agreement, which was made possible by an IRA
cease-fire now in its 13th month. The agreement included creation
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which is to convene next month to
begin to make changes in the political structure that will give the
province's Catholic minority more power and the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic more influence in northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA rejected the peace agreement because it also leaves
the province as an integral part of Britain and stipulates that the
North may only be subsumed in the Irish Republic if a majority of
the people here consent. The Protestant majority opposes union with
Dublin and is likely to prevail well into the new century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the bridge in Omagh, Graham McClelland, 55, a Protestant and
a government surveyor, noted that the Real IRA had said it was
reviewing its goals. ``It's a pity they didn't review their
position before the carnage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun O'Neill, an 11-year-old Catholic, looked at the bouquets
with his younger brothers, Ryan, 6, and Fergal, 3. ``I can't
believe it,'' he said.'' My mom was getting ready to go shopping
there on Saturday. Then just about 3 o'clock she decided not to
bother. We all were going with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan O'Neill added in a faint voice.``I'm sad.''

VANCOUVER BECOMING DRUG MECCA, AND AUTHORITIES FIGHT BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Fame easily finds a place like
this, with its climate so embracing, its surroundings so inspiring
and its population leavened so liberally with artists and new
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a fortune cookie in one of Vancouver's countless Chinese
restaurants might read, fame is fleeting, and what is fabulous one
day can turn very foul the next.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver is quickly gaining a reputation as a haven for illicit
drugs and those who use them. From the brazen addicts shooting up
and buying heroin and cocaine around the intersection of Hastings
and Main Street to the enormous amount of high-potency marijuana
that is raised, sold and openly smoked on streets and in cafes,
Vancouver's tolerance of drugs is attracting attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that you could smoke and nobody bothered you,'' said
Adam, a lanky 19-year-old from Seattle who came with two friends
for an overnight trip. They easily bought marijuana on the street
around Hastings, then _ somewhat shyly _ entered the Cannabis Cafe,
a marijuana mecca for many West Coast Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While one friend picked at a green salad mixed with a few hemp
seeds, Adam took out a joint and, somewhat uneasily, lit it. Soon
he relaxed. ``It's a good environment, 'cause you can't smoke
cigarettes, you can only smoke marijuana,'' he said. ``You don't
have the smokey bar atmosphere, just a pleasant smell.''
</P>
<P>
   Other customers casually lit up their joints and the smell of
marijuana was as inescapable as popcorn at a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vancouver is the most tolerant spot in Canada when it comes to
different life styles and cultures,'' said Sister Icee, a
38-year-old Toronto woman once known as Shelley Francis who has
owned the Cafe, and the Hemp BC store next door, since April.
</P>
<P>
   Although police have raided the place three times (once since
she took over and twice last year under a different owner) the
Cannabis Cafe still celebrates marijuana. On the wall is a painting
of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint, who stands
serenely in her starred gown, surrounded by tall marijuana stalks.
The menu put together by the chef, Christopher Anstee, features
pasta with hemp pesto, salads with hemp dressing and quesadillas
that use hemp tortillas made by a man named Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no harm in it,'' said Sister Icee. Lighting an
oversized, filtered joint, she said she lived in the West Indies
for most of the 1980s and joined the Rastafarian sect, which gave
her her name and introduced her to marijuana, ``the weed of
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana is a plant,'' she said. ``You can't prosecute people
for smoking flowers. It shouldn't be regulated any more than
parsley or broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vancouver officials, the Cannabis Cafe is a public relations
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like the reputation that things like that bring to
the city,'' said Bruce Chambers, chief constable of the Vancouver
police department.
</P>
<P>
   After the last raid in April, police charged Sister Icee with
selling drug paraphernalia in the Hemp BC store. On a recent visit,
the store carried shoes, shirts and snowboards all made with hemp,
along with pipes, bongs and cigarette rolling papers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city intends to deny Sister Icee the licenses she needs
to run the store and cafe, working through the city council, not
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be toast by September,'' said Vancouver Mayor
Philip Owen.
</P>
<P>
   Cannabis Cafe is only one part of Vancouver's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vancouver has been called Vansterdam, and we're not proud of
it,'' said Ken Doran, an inspector with the police department's
drug unit.
</P>
<P>
   Police have raided and shut down 82 hydroponic marijuana growing
operations this year, confiscating $14 million worth of pot. The
growers use basements, attics, sometimes entire houses to put out
high yield crops, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   Police analysts say the pot is grown under such favorable
conditions that it is high in tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC _ the
chemical compound that gives marijuana its punch. The THC content
is 25 to 28 percent, compared with the 2 percent or less that was
common just a few years ago, police said.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia marijuana has become so popular that U.S.
Customs Service agents have increased patrols to try to slow down
the cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond marijuana, Vancouver estimates that there are as many as
15,000 IV drug users in British Columbia, most of them in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any time, the area around Hastings and Main crawls with
addicts, many drawn by the cheap rooms or the free needle exchange
program that gives out about 2.5 million needles a year in an
effort to fight AIDS. Police say the all-night grocery stores in
the area that carry a few cans of soup and packages of cookies are
just fronts for drug buys.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the province's coroner announced that drugs had
killed a record 201 people in the first half of 1998, the majority
of them in Vancouver. Then a medical report indicated a vast need
for treatment programs and proposed that hard-core addicts be given
free heroin to keep them from robbing to support their habits, a
position that Chambers conditionally supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time somebody steps forward and says the war on drugs is
lost,'' said Chief Coroner Larry Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, is
unwilling to concede defeat. However, Richard Barszczewski, who
heads the Mounties' drug awareness program in British Columbia,
noted that law enforcement alone cannot solve the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   The city itself is divided by the drug problem and unsure of
what to do next. Owen and Chambers say that prosecutors and judges
are just too soft on people convicted of drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give sentences that we believe are appropriate,'' said
Robert Metzger, chief judge of the provincial court, in response to
the criticism. ``People like to point to judges because we're easy
targets. But this seems to be a social and political problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Libby Davies, the member of Parliament who represents the area
around Hastings and Main, calls for more national funds to cope
with Vancouver's drug epidemic. She supports not only providing
free heroin to hard-core addicts, but clinics where they can safely
inject.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davies is not concerned that such programs, already tried in
Europe, might cement Vancouver's reputation as the Amsterdam of
North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation at Hastings and Main couldn't get worse,'' she
said. ``This is not about the city's reputation. It's about saving
lives.''

NAIROBI HOTEL IS FOCAL POINT OF EMBASSY BOMB PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AFRICA-BOMBING) 
(bl) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ A low-cost hotel in a run-down neighborhood of
this capital has become a focus of the FBI investigation into the
bombing at the U.S. Embassy on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning 12 U.S. agents, accompanied by six Kenyan
detectives, sealed off the three-story Hilltop Lodge, a three-story
hotel popular with Muslim executives.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours the agents combed two rooms on the second floor
for forensic evidence. They dusted for fingerprints, searched the
rooms and seized the hotel logbook and copies of bills, hotel
employees said. The FBI also took the hotel manager, James Nganga,
into custody for questioning. He continued to be held Wednesday
night, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon the investigators returned to take pictures
and videotapes of the rooms, a contractor at the hotel said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law-enforcement officials declined to comment on what they
had found or why they had searched the hotel. ``The investigation
is proceeding in a logical manner, and no further comment will be
made at this time,'' FBI officials said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   An unconfirmed report Wednesday morning in The Nation newspaper
quoted anonymous police officials and said that a man arrested last
week in Pakistan in connection with the bombing had told
investigators that the car bomb that destroyed the embassy had been
built in the two hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The blast killed 247 people and injured thousands. A
simultaneous explosion outside the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, killed 10.
</P>
<P>
   The detained man, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 34, was flown here
Friday, after having confessed to Pakistani police that he had
played a major role in planning the attack. When he first came to
the Americans' attention, Odeh reportedly had a slightly different
rendering of his name, Mohammed Sadik Howaida.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the bombings, he was arrested in Karachi on
charges that he was carrying a forged passport, just after he had
arrived on a commercial flight from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The raid on the hotel followed a long interrogation of Odeh by
the FBI and police, law-enforcement officials said. The report in
The Nation, which could not be verified, said Odeh had told
investigators that he and three accomplices assembled the bomb at
the hotel from Aug. 3 to Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that Odeh left Nairobi and flew to Pakistan
on the night of Aug. 6 on a Pakistan International Airways flight,
investigators said. According to Kenyan immigration officials, he
was traveling with a forged Yemeni passport under the name Abdull
Bast Awadah. The passport shows that he had entered Kenya on Aug. 3
at the international airport in Mombasa. It is unclear how he
traveled to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-room hotel is in a seedy downtown section, near bus
companies that travel the route between Mombasa, a coastal port,
and the capital. Owned by a Lebanese family, the hotel is popular
with Arab and Muslim executives from the coast and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Arafad Said Abdalla, whose family owns the hotel, said the FBI
agents did not explain what they were looking for in the rooms,
A107 and B102. The agents dusted for fingerprints on doors,
closets, desks and light switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never told us anything,'' Abdalla said. ``They just took
some fingerprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel employees had cleaned the rooms several times since the
week of the bombing, Abdalla said, and some evidence might be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees said they could recall nothing unusual about
the men in the rooms in the days just before the blast, except that
they appeared to have been Muslims from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Moi, a janitor who cleaned room A107, neat quarters with
twin beds and a desk, said the room was virtually empty each time
when he entered to straighten it on those three days. ``They left
nothing in the room,'' Moi said.
</P>
<P>
   Another janitor, Francis Ishuga, who straightens room B102 each
day, said he saw nothing unusual in the single-bed room in the week
of Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Neither janitor could recall tools, wires, chemicals or any
unusual containers in the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The co-manager of the hotel, Khalid Saleh, told reporters that
he thought that it was highly unlikely that the bomb had been
constructed there. ``That is something that is not really
possible,'' Saleh said. ``They must have assembled it someplace
else. We'd have noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the employees interviewed Wednesday recalled a
Mitsubishi pickup with a covered bed like the one witnesses say
carried the bomb to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   A porter, David Kioko, 27, said he carried several heavy bags
for the three men when they checked out Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just like any other guests,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``We cleaned their rooms every day, and they never tried to
stop us from entering.''

LOBBY (Phoenix) - Arizona Republican leaders have laid out a battle
plan to retain control of the state Senate, giving lobbyists
``marching orders'' to raise money for GOP candidates in three
swing races. The goal, according to sources familiar with the
discussions, was to name coordinators in the lobbying community who
could direct campaign donations and assistance from both lobbyists
and political action committees from the industries they represent.
Critics say the memo obtained by teh Arizona Republic confirms what
many always suspected: That special interests have a stranglehold
on the legislative process in Arizona. By

WITH ADMIRERS LIKE THESE, KOHL NEEDS NO DETRACTORS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ You know that Chancellor Helmut Kohl must be in trouble
when even European intellectuals who say they admire him come to
Berlin for an opposition campaign rally proclaiming the end of an
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a kind of European new deal in all of Europe,'' said
Jack Lang, a French Socialist and former culture minister who saw
no contradiction between his admiration for the chancellor and the
prevailing opinion at Wednesday's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion was that Kohl and his conservative government were
thoroughly burned out after 16 years in office and that it was past
time for a change _ an opinion shared, needless to say, by the
Social Democratic candidate running against the chancellor in the
Sept. 27 elections, Gerhard Schroder, who listened quietly and
applauded from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the greatest respect for Chancellor Kohl and for his
historic accomplishment in the unification of Germany and the
construction of Europe,'' Lang said, ``and I have not forgotten
that he was a loyal and affectionate friend of the late President
Francois Mitterrand, to whom I was very close.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We feel the moment has come, now or never, and
not only in Germany, to give new vitality to this Europe that was
born after World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has never counted the German intellectual community among
his most fervent supporters, but one of his aides, Minister of
State Anton Pfeifer, publicly protested the plans for Wednesday's
opposition rally and accused Schroder, whose lead in public opinion
polls has narrowed in recent weeks, of trying to grab power through
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody who was present saw their presence as a campaign
endorsement. ``I'm not taking sides in this election; I couldn't,''
said Elie Wiesel, who came with a prepared speech titled ``To a
Young German Friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being here, of course, has some implications,'' he said,
before the company moved from Willy Brandt House, a Social
Democratic headquarters in the western part of Berlin, to Bertolt
Brecht's old theater, the Berliner Ensemble, in the eastern part,
for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of us, I came here carried by hope,'' Wiesel, a
survivor of the Nazi concentration camps who has written and spoken
eloquently about the Holocaust, said in his prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   His hope, he said, was ``rooted in a desire to act on history so
that the next century be placed under the sign of human solidarity
instead of violence,'' a sentiment that Kohl has often expressed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, such as writer Gunter Grass, who was not
here Wednesday, neither German nor European intellectuals mobilized
very visibly for Kohl's opponent in the last elections four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   What was different this time, some of them said, was the sense
that Kohl's ideas about building Europe by building a common market
and laying the foundations for a common currency, the euro, to be
introduced on Jan. 1, had taken Germany about as far as they could.
Now, in the view of many here, it was time for something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just talk about the euro or an economic Europe,''
said Klaus Stack, a well-known poster artist whose ``Action for
More Democracy'' group organized the gathering. ``One era is
ending, and a new one is about to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   If the election were held this week, according to a poll by the
Allensbach Institute published Wednesday in the daily Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, the Social Democrats and the Green Party
together, with 43.6 and 7.5 percent, would have enough votes in
Parliament to form a government and relegate the Christian
Democrats and the Free Democrats to opposition status. Kohl's party
was favored by 36.4 percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not all polls show the Christian Democrats so far behind. But
none so far have given Kohl much chance of pulling them ahead in
the month remaining before the election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last Social Democratic Chancellor was Brandt's successor,
Helmut Schmidt, who was ousted in 1982 when the small Free
Democratic Party changed sides and joined forces with Kohl's
Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some intellectuals warned Wednesday against seeing next month's
vote as an ideological choice. ``If we want to build Europe, we
will need to try to separate the left from Socialism,'' said
Bernard-Henri Levy, a French writer and philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   But with center-left governments now in power under Tony Blair
in Britain and Lionel Jospin in France, others saw a chance for
making Europe into something more humane and civilized than a
globalized market currently ridden by double-digit unemployment in
many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the role of leftist governments nowadays to fight against
the kind of propaganda that tells millions of people they are not
needed and have no use,'' said Viviane Forrester, whose writings
about the evils of globalization have made her a best-selling
author in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need conservative intellectuals, too,'' pleaded Peter
Schneider, a German author, before the gathering agreed that a
change in government here would help build ``a democratic, social
and culturally vital Europe.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his six years in Congress, Rep. Paul McHale
developed a reputation as a straight-shooting marine who allows
himself the occasional indulgence of a dramatic gesture.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Democrat from Bethlehem, Pa., was more dramatic
than usual when he became the first and only member of Congress
from his party to call for President Clinton to resign or face
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday in his congressional office, which is
decorated with a gleaming saber and other mementoes from his
service in the Marine Corps, McHale explained that he took his
stand reluctantly after concluding that it would set an ``awful
precedent'' to allow a public official to remain in office after
lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is retiring this year after three terms in the House,
McHale has a degree of political liberty not enjoyed by incumbents
running for re-election. He has taken quixotic stands for political
effect in the past, like his call to reduce the number of House
members by a third to make debate more meaningful. And some
Democrats said privately Wednesday that McHale's comments may have
been influenced by disappointment that he wasn't the
administration's choice to be secretary of the Navy, a charge that
McHale vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   But as a critic of the president, he also speaks with
credibility because he supported Clinton enthusiastically in both
the 1992 and 1996 elections and then voted to support Clinton's
positions about 75 percent of the time in the House, according to
ratings by Congressional Quarterly. His only significant policy
feud with Clinton came three years ago when he opposed the
administration's deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia. His district
office in Bethlehem is festooned with photographs of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no personal animosity toward the
president,'' said McHale, a 48-year-old veteran of the Persian Gulf
War. ``I am someone who believes that the president is a man of
enormous talent, genuine love of country, but who possesses some
tragic and equally large flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale, a lawyer who is regarded as a political centrist, said
that Clinton's admitted inappropriate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern, was ``predatory and
repugnant.'' But he said his call for the president's resignation
was based on legal concerns, not moral ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to successfully pursue justice in our courts, it is
essential that witnesses feel a personal profound obligation to
tell the truth,'' he said. ``Otherwise we might as well return to
litigation by combat. I think the president breached that
responsibility and if he is not held accountable we establish a
precedent that may encourage some future president, someone more
inclined to abuse power than President Clinton, to once again
violate a judicial oath to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition taken in January, Clinton denied under oath that
he had had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He acknowledged
such a relationship to a federal grand jury on Monday and in a
public address that night, although he maintained that his previous
testimony had been ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale, who is retiring, acknowledged that few other Democrats
were likely to join him. But he said that most would agree with his
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if a Republican president had engaged in the very
type of misconduct in which President Clinton apparently engaged,
members of the Democratic caucus would be voicing precisely my
arguments with great passion,'' he said. ``We would not have
accepted this from Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale said he worried that public disgust with the Clinton
scandal would depress voter turnout in the fall, increasing the
chances that he will be succeeded in the 15th District by a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hoped he would have had the courage to take the
same stand if he were running for re-election and needed the
support of his party. ``I'll never know,'' he said. ``But I would
like to think so.''

   MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Undated) A federal appeals panel handed
Microsoft Corp. another victory Wednesday, saying despositions in
its antitrust dispute with the government should be taken without
reporters or the public present. The judges granted Microsoft's
request that they block a court order issued last week, but didn't
yet rule on the merits of the legal dispute. By the time they do,
however, it may not matter _ the depositions may be over and the
trial set to begin, said an attorney for one of the news
organizations that sought access to the depositions. Separately,
Microsoft was hit Wednesday with a new antitrust action, filed by a
Connecticut company that accuses Microsoft of withholding technical
information vital to its business in order to thwart competition
from other operating systems, such as Unix. Microsoft says the
accuser has improperly elevated a contract dispute to the level of
federal court action.

   LOTTERY-BOGUS (Seattle) James Blair Down, the ring leader of a

guilty Wednesday in federal court for fleecing senior citizens of
millions of dollars. Federal agents earlier seized more than $12
million from accounts kept by Down at a Bellevue, Wash., brokerage
house. U.S. postal inspectors identified 880 people with an average
age of 74 who bought lottery chances from Down's companies. Down
was charged with conspiring to violate U.S. gambling laws by
illegally selling chances in international lotteries. He also
allegedly used deceptive practices to get people to buy lottery
tickets when they had no chance of winning. Down's telemarketers
made more than 5 million calls and sent promotional mail targeted
at elderly citizens.

 &HT;    Braves will have powerful obsticles to
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The huge gap has closed. No longer are the Atlanta
Braves far in front as the class of the National League. Several
teams are in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, who begin a two-game series against the
Braves tonight at Turner Field, have emerged as the most likely
threat to Atlanta's long-time supremacy. San Diego began sending
its message to the Braves last week on the West Coast, when it won
two of three games against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten a lot tougher in the league,'' Atlanta
general manager John Schuerholz said. ``When the Astros got Randy
Johnson, they got even tougher. I think San Diego is a really good
club. And you certainly can't count out the Cubs, Mets and
Giants,'' (who are in the wild-card race).
</P>
<P>
   Any among the Padres, Astros, Cubs and Mets could spell trouble
for the Braves during the NL postseason run. And waiting from the
other league could be the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to have your 'A' game ready from day
one,'' Schuerholz said. ``There won't be any slack.''
</P>
<P>
   While it can be said that the Braves are stronger than last
year, with the addition of Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss, other
clubs, especially the Astros and the Padres, have taken huge leaps
through free-agency. The proof is in the playoff chase. Except for
the strike-shortened '94 season, Atlanta has had the best record in
the league starting with the 1991season. But this year, San Diego
is only two victories behind, Houston six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams set their goals to get strong enough to beat us,''
Schuerholz said. ``This is not me saying this, but other clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is playing better this season against winning teams,
30-19 this season, compared with 36-38 last year. But the Braves
have not fared well against Houston and Chicago, two possible
first-round opponents, going 3-6 against the Cubs and 2-2 against
the Astros. Atlanta also faltered against the Yankees (1-3) and Red
Sox (1-2), two of the best teams in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that when we have not played great
baseball, other teams like the Yankees and Red Sox have taken
advantage of that,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``But
hopefully, we will get a shot at one of those clubs in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Tom Glavine cited pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at some of the pitchers we have lost to; how many people
are beating them?'' Glavine said. ``The thing about us is when you
have been this good, people are always going to look for something
that is wrong. ... Every time we go out, somebody is trying to
prove something against us,'' he said. ``They use us as a measuring
stick. It might be some young pitcher whose manager tells him,
'After playing the Braves, we will see where you are at.'''
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle, who pitched against Atlanta while playing in
Pittsburgh, agrees with Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get really excited about playing the Braves,''
Neagle said. ``They were the best, and you know you had something
if you beat them. Now I am on the other side and can see the other
clubs feeling the same way I did when I was in Pittsburgh. You see
other teams wanting to prove something to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz sizzles at the notion that his club wilts against
good teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like those people who said Andres Galarraga couldn't
hit outside Turner Field,'' he said. ``We have beaten good clubs
all year long. We have won more games than anyone else (in the NL),
so that is an inaccurate observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine also said he doesn't think San Diego needs to prove
anything by beating the Braves in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were a good ballclub before we played them last
week,'' he said. ``And I don't think the Padres needed to win two
of three from us to prove to themselves they were a good
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe that is exactly what happened last year when
the Marlins took eight of 12 from the Braves in the regular season
before eliminating Atlanta in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   So who do the Braves want to face in the first round? More
appropriately, who do they want to avoid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone wants to see (Houston's) Randy Johnson in
a short series,'' Glavine said. ``But we're not going to take
anybody lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said: ``We've got a good team, but it's going to be a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Braves on deck: San Diego Padres
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Tonight and Friday at 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV, radio: WUPN-69 will telecast tonight, TBS will telecast
Friday. WSB 750-AM will broadcast both games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP John Smoltz (11-2,
3.32; 12-7, 2.89 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Kevin Brown (15-4,
2.46; 2-2, 2.81 lifetime vs. Braves). Friday, RHP Kevin Millwood
(14-6, 4.41; 1-0, 5.73 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. RHP Joey Hamilton
(10-10, 4.58; 2-7, 5.49 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 271-215 and
is 29-10 at home against San Diego the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Padres took two of three from Atlanta last
week at Qualcomm Stadium on two superb performances by starters
Hamilton and Andy Ashby, who allowed two runs in 14 innings. Only a
shutout by Tom Glavine in the third game averted a sweep. May 7-10,
Atlanta took three of four from the Padres in their first visit to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Padres leaders: Avg. _ Tony Gwynn (.323); HRs _ Greg Vaugh
(40); RBIs _ Vaughn (96); SBs _ Quilvio Veras (21). Wins _ Andy
Ashby (16); ERA _ Trevor Hoffman (1.60). Saves _ Hoffman (40).
Strikeouts _ Kevin Brown (198).
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: The Padres went into Wednesday night's game in
Florida with a 10-6 record this month, but it could be much better.
The pitching staff has yielded an average of 2.6 runs a game. . . .
San Diego is 35-29 on the road. Jockeying for home-field advantage
in the postseason is the only issue in this series and that
advantage would mean more to San Diego. The Braves are 40-22 on the
road this year. . . . While the Pods took two of three from Atlanta
last week, the Braves outhit San Diego 21-16 in that series and
have limited the Padres to a .207 average in their seven meetings
this year. . . . The loss of Tony Gwynn, on the DL since Aug. 13
with a strained left Achilles tendon, has put some stress on the
rest of the Padres batting order, and it has been slow to respond.
Entering Wednesday's game, LF Greg Vaughn had 12 hits in his last
86 at-bats (.140) with 30 strikeouts in his last 20 games. 3B Ken
Caminiti was forced from Monday's game with a recurring lower-back
strain, which affects only his right-handed swing. He will be
facing two righties this series. . . . With Gwynn out, the club is
starting Mark Sweeney against right-handers and either James Mouton
or Ruben Rivera against lefties. . . . The Braves had dodged RHP
Kevin Brown in their first seven games with the Padres. They have
not seen Brown since he was 2-0 against them in October's NLCS. He
is coming off his third shutout of the season in Sunday's 4-0
victory over Milwaukee and has two shutouts in his last three
starts. In his last 57 innings, Brown has struck out 68 and allowed
46 hits and has lost just once in his last 16 starts, dating to May
26. . . . On the DL: Gwynn (strained left achilles), LHP Ed Vosberg
(left shoulder surgery).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: 2B Quilvio Veras is hitting .357 over his last
eight games. RHP Trevor Hoffman is 40-for-41 in save conversions
and leads the majors. San Diego is 158-0 when leading after eight
innings, dating back to July 24, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: Vaughn finally hit his 40th homer Tuesday, after
going 11 games and 40 at-bats without one. He is batting .179 over
the past 10 days. CF Steve Finley has two hits in his last 24
at-bats.

KANSANS CONCERNED OVER IMAGE OF PRESIDENCY AND NATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEOTI, Kan. _ Business talk came first Wednesday in this tiny
rural farm town that people here call the ``middle of Middle
America.'' There were cumbersome export restrictions to discuss and
the need for trains to hustle out crops and wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But just as their congressman, Rep. Jerry Moran, a Republican,
got ready to wrap things up at the town hall meeting, Dorothea
Appl, chimed in: ``Can I ask what your opinions is of our
president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about impeachment,'' Mrs. Appl, a 65-year-old
retired farmer's wife, said sheepishly. ``But if he did lie, there
has to be some form of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As Moran traveled to five counties in this southwestern part of
Kansas Wednesday, conducting one town meeting after the next,
something he does regularly, it was clear that something had
changed in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nobody in this Republican stronghold had paid any
mind, at least publicly, to President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
Now, two days after Clinton admitted an improper relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, it was being mentioned and discussed at just about
every stop he made along this wheat and corn belt. The consensus
here, mostly among Republicans, was that the speech served not to
redeem the president, but sully him further.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers said they worried president had sent out the wrong
message to their children. Farmers in overalls fretted about his
effectiveness as a world leader in the midst of this crisis. Women
talked about plummeting values, and men about America's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The questions they posed to Moran amounted to this: Is this what
we want our country to stand for?
</P>
<P>
   In a place where a disc jockey Wednesday urged parents to pray
for their children as they return to school, residents here reacted
without the customary shrill partisanship that often surrounds the
issue on television. They leveled few angry words at the president
personally, even as some said they believe Clinton should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the concerns centered on how his actions would hurt
America and Americans, as they put it. ``People out there are
laughing at us,'' said Cinda Medina, a 38-year-old mother of two
who returned to Kansas to raise her children. ``I don't think a
citizen has pride in America anymore. Now, every time you turn on
the television there is a comedian joking about the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Holiman, 56, who works in the court building one county
over, said he is stumped about how to explain Clinton's behavior to
children. ``You tell kids, you don't lie, you don't cheat, and then
he turns around and does it,'' he said. ``When you take the highest
job in the land, you have to have some morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they are disturbed by polls that show most people
simply want the story to disappear. It's too late for that now,
they said. ``I don't think it ought to go away,'' said Pam Sourk,
50. ``I think it ought to be very important. It ought to be
investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Without rancor or Republican bravado, Moran mirrored his
constituents' concerns. He bemoaned the repercussions the
president's actions would have on public servants, an already
maligned bunch with considerable image problems. And he predicted
that Congress, while tempted to dodge the politically thorny
matter, would have to deal with it seriously and without political
gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for us to be able to believe our elected
officials,'' Moran said at one town hall meeting Wednesday, his
voice growing hoarser as the day wore on. ``Truth and integrity
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not politics,'' he added. ``This is about governing a
nation. This is not about polls. This is about what makes our
country different from other nations. We have to preserve that
sense that we are unique.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats came up to him after the town meetings, mostly
to say they felt the Lewinsky story was tiresome and the charges
ludicrous. ``Is there anything in the Constitution about sex,''
asked Charles Bosley, a farmer, who pointed out that most of those
doing the criticizing were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But his view was quickly drowned out by those of his neighbors.
At the Chamber of Commerce in Garden City, the third largest city
in Moran's district, Vic Deaver wondered whether Clinton shouldn't
just resign and end the ``whole mess.'' Near him, the chamber's
chairman of the board, Mac Payne, 40, said he hoped the nation's
justice system would be able to safeguard its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put your hand on the Bible and swear to tell the
whole truth, you do that,'' he said. ``And if you don't, there are
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, as Moran headed back to his hotel after a full day
on his ``listening tour,'' as he calls it, it was clear that the
president had stirred people up in this part of the country. The
dribs and drabs of anxiety over Clinton that began to bubble in
January, when the story first broke, had swelled into profound
disappointment, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel bad for the country,'' said Geneva Hineman, 76, as
Moran prepared to leave a senior citizen center in Dighton. ``It
has just hurt everything.''

 &HT;    Q and A with U.S. Ambassador Wyche Fowler
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wyche Fowler arrived in Saudi Arabia not long after a
deadly bombing at a U.S. military facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we bombed Iraq three days after I got there,'' the U.S.
ambassador to the Saudi kingdom said this week.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has gone since the former Democratic senator from
Georgia assumed his post in Riyadh two years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had several major standups and standdowns with Saddam
Hussein since I have been there,'' Fowler said. ``We have a
continuing threat of terrorism. And we always have serious
questions on how to improve the life of our troops there in that
145 degree desert and yet keep them combat ready and secure from
any terrorist attack. So there's never been a dull day. When things
are too quiet, my instinct is to sense a lull before the storm.'
</P>
<P>
   En route to Washington for consultation with government
officials, Fowler talked about his experiences in a posting that
has been intense but always interesting during a brief visit to
Atlanta this week. Here are excerpts from that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has security been heightened at your embassy since the
bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have been on great alert for quite a time because of Osama
bid Laden's public threats againt civilians and the military in
Saudi Arabia, which he issued about two months ago on television
calling for the first time that it was legitimate to kill American
civilians to attack American civilians as well as military. The
Saudis have been extraordinarly cooperative in providing us
external security as well as the shared intelligence to protect
ourselves to the greatest possible extent.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden went further than anyone could have believed when he
publicly urged his followers to declare a holy war against
Americans and specifically included civilians as targets as well as
military. He's thought to be hiding out in Afghanistan but the
investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously because of his proclamation against Americans he is
certainly under suspicion (in connection with the African
bombings). It's unquestioned to all the people in the intelligence
business that if you've got two bombs going off within a minute of
each other in two different countries that that requires a degree
of sophistication that only a handful of terrorist organizations
could probably accomplish. That doesn't mean there is not a new one
that has emerged. But it was a very sophisticated operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update us on the relationship between the United
States and Saudi Arabia and your mission there?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have a unique bilateral relationship with the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia that goes back over 50 years now. We've had a unique
path of development in our relations. It began with the American
companies discovering oil in Saudi Arabia, and it has broadened to
include now most of the American multinational giants doing an
extraordinary amount of trade and business with the Kingdom. As a
result there are over 50,000 Americans working in Saudi Arabia
across the whole gamut of business activitiy, of which the energy
and oil sector has been reduced to well under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We also have between 5,000 and 6,000 American military forces
stationed in Saudi Arabia at a given time, as well as a huge
training mission whereby we train the Saudi military and air force
with sophisticated weaponry that they have bought from us.
</P>
<P>
   And in the political-diplomatic arena, we build on the excellent
relationship that we have had with the Saudi government over the
years. At present there are two major goals: how we finally bring
peace to the Middle East and how we fight terrorism, which is the
present scourge as recent as this month's bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's been most difficult about your job?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because of my responsibility for security of all my people as
well as the security, to the greatest extent I can provide it, of
the Americans working in the Kingdom, it has been a large
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you characterize the level of tension in the Middle
East today?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is undoubtedly in America's interest to have a politically
secure and economically vibrant Middle East. We believe that the
key to that success is a peace process that leads to a final end to
Israeli-Palestinian hostilities. There's no question that the
greatest springboard to economic succss anywhere in the gulf is a
cessation of all hostilities. But there will remain political
instability of some sort throughout the region until those
governments in the gulf have confidence that peace in the region
will be long term.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab states do believe that we have a disproportinate
influence with the Israeli government. But what it is very hard for
any Arab government to understand is the nature of democracy _ that
another country cannot dictate to a democracy what their policies
should be or what security needs they believe are required for
thier own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal should be to not allow ourselves to be isolated with
just one friend but to maintain our historic ties with the nation
of Israel and at the same time by our policies and actions convince
the Saudis and our other allies in the gulf that they are an equal
partner with us on regional interests and global interests.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To what extent must embassies be armed fortresses?
</P>
<P>
   A: Americans are open and we like to think an embassy is an
invitation to foreign citizens to come and learn about America _ as
they do. They come seeking guidance on which colleges they should
go to. They come seeking guidance on business opportunities and how
to find a joint venture partner. They come seeking every kind of
information _ where to find the best stamp collection. It is a
balance and, depending on where you are, you take appropriate
measures to secure your people from harm but without trying to make
that little corner of America look like an armed fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the main things you want to accomplish in Saudi
Arabia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope that first of all, God willing, there will be no
terrorist attack under my stewardship, and we reinvigorate
ourselves every day with fresh eyes to see what can be done to
protect the people and the families who are there, both in the
embassy and the private American community. I hope that we will
succeed in training through our military Saudi armed forces to such
an extent that they can defend themselves without question from any
regional threat, including Saddam Hussein. And of course I hope to
bring to the Kingdom a better understanding of the economic and
political fruits of moving toward democratization and the
unquestioned insurance of human rights.

 &HT;    Braves will have powerful obsticles to
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The huge gap has closed. No longer are the Atlanta
Braves far in front as the class of the National League. Several
teams are in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, who begin a two-game series against the
Braves tonight at Turner Field, have emerged as the most likely
threat to Atlanta's long-time supremacy. San Diego began sending
its message to the Braves last week on the West Coast, when it won
two of three games against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten a lot tougher in the league,'' Atlanta
general manager John Schuerholz said. ``When the Astros got Randy
Johnson, they got even tougher. I think San Diego is a really good
club. And you certainly can't count out the Cubs, Mets and
Giants,'' (who are in the wild-card race).
</P>
<P>
   Any among the Padres, Astros, Cubs and Mets could spell trouble
for the Braves during the NL postseason run. And waiting from the
other league could be the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to have your 'A' game ready from day
one,'' Schuerholz said. ``There won't be any slack.''
</P>
<P>
   While it can be said that the Braves are stronger than last
year, with the addition of Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss, other
clubs, especially the Astros and the Padres, have taken huge leaps
through free-agency. The proof is in the playoff chase. Except for
the strike-shortened '94 season, Atlanta has had the best record in
the league starting with the 1991season. But this year, San Diego
is only two victories behind, Houston six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams set their goals to get strong enough to beat us,''
Schuerholz said. ``This is not me saying this, but other clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is playing better this season against winning teams,
30-19 this season, compared with 36-38 last year. But the Braves
have not fared well against Houston and Chicago, two possible
first-round opponents, going 3-6 against the Cubs and 2-2 against
the Astros. Atlanta also faltered against the Yankees (1-3) and Red
Sox (1-2), two of the best teams in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that when we have not played great
baseball, other teams like the Yankees and Red Sox have taken
advantage of that,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``But
hopefully, we will get a shot at one of those clubs in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Tom Glavine cited pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at some of the pitchers we have lost to; how many people
are beating them?'' Glavine said. ``The thing about us is when you
have been this good, people are always going to look for something
that is wrong. ... Every time we go out, somebody is trying to
prove something against us,'' he said. ``They use us as a measuring
stick. It might be some young pitcher whose manager tells him,
'After playing the Braves, we will see where you are at.'''
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle, who pitched against Atlanta while playing in
Pittsburgh, agrees with Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get really excited about playing the Braves,''
Neagle said. ``They were the best, and you know you had something
if you beat them. Now I am on the other side and can see the other
clubs feeling the same way I did when I was in Pittsburgh. You see
other teams wanting to prove something to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz sizzles at the notion that his club wilts against
good teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like those people who said Andres Galarraga couldn't
hit outside Turner Field,'' he said. ``We have beaten good clubs
all year long. We have won more games than anyone else (in the NL),
so that is an inaccurate observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine also said he doesn't think San Diego needs to prove
anything by beating the Braves in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were a good ballclub before we played them last
week,'' he said. ``And I don't think the Padres needed to win two
of three from us to prove to themselves they were a good
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe that is exactly what happened last year when
the Marlins took eight of 12 from the Braves in the regular season
before eliminating Atlanta in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   So who do the Braves want to face in the first round? More
appropriately, who do they want to avoid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone wants to see (Houston's) Randy Johnson in
a short series,'' Glavine said. ``But we're not going to take
anybody lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said: ``We've got a good team, but it's going to be a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Braves have fared against good teams:
</P>
<P>
   Vs. teams with winning records:
</P>
<P>
   1996 44-31 .587
</P>
<P>
   1997 36-38 .486
</P>
<P>
   1998 30-19 .612
</P>
<P>
   Vs. possible playoff-bound teams:
</P>
<P>
   Padres 4-3
</P>
<P>
   Astros 2-2
</P>
<P>
   Mets 5-0
</P>

 &HT;    Making the adjustment
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ From Little Leagues to college baseball,
players grow up using aluminum bats. But anyone who has hopes of
reaching the big leagues must learn to work with a wood bat as much
as possible. And the adjustment from an aluminum to wooden bat can
be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new experience,'' said North Carolina Wesleyan senior
Andy Jones of his first Coastal Plain League summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is now in his second year with the Rocky Mount Rockfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to hit it on the barrel. I just wanted to try and
make solid contact,'' he said. ``But after the first couple of
weeks, I got used to it. It's just an adjustment to try and hit it
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockfish teammate Jason Dubois seems to have made that
adjustment, having stroked 17 homers and knocked in 51 runs this
summer with the wood bat. Rockfish manager Bob Keller attributes
that to dedication and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is Jason was forced to make a mechanical
adjustment and use his hands more, let the hands, the pitcher and
the ball do the work,'' Keller said. ``He found some success doing
that. One of the biggest mistakes guys get when they get that wood
bat in their hands, they start to over-rotate their upper body and
get a lot of excessive movement, that they have to muscle up a
little more. If you can learn to swing with the hands, you're going
to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If a player can make the adjustment, it can pay off in the long
run, even if he never gets a chance to play professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps a lot, especially for the guys that come out
of this league swinging a wood bat and then go home and continue
it,'' Keller said. ``Swinging that wood bat is going to help them
increase their bat speed. Guys with good bat speed can have more
holes in their swing and get away with it, to a certain amount.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the case for Jones, who started the spring
college season on a hot streak, stroking the ball around the field.
But at the end of the year, his 1998 numbers were slightly lower
than his previous year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a big benefit,'' former Wesleyan coach
Mike Fox said. ``But hitting is such a difficult thing. He started
out real well, but then had some ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed: Using a wood bat helped him early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it really (helped),'' Jones said. ``I felt
like I played in a real solid league. When you come back with the
aluminum, you feel like you can mash. You feel like you've got
unbelievable bat speed. Then after a month or two, it's back to
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The bat or the player?
</P>
<P>
   Players today are getting bigger and stronger. Just a generation
ago, a player as tall as 6-9 J.R. Richard was an anomaly. Now, it's
rare to see any major leaguers shorter than 5-11. In addition,
there's no doubt that today's players are often on a strict
strength program. Mark McGwire's forearms have been measured at 17
inches in diameter. That's larger than the average man's neck size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line,'' Keller said. ``You're starting to look at
a lot of players in the big leagues like McGwire, (Jose) Canseco
and some of these guys that have been on serious weight programs
for years. It used to be in the old days, it wasn't acceptable to
be a baseball player and a guy who lifted weights. Now there's been
a strong trend to that. You have a lot of guys taking weight
protein supplements, creatin, stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, some of the most important coaches in collegiate
athletics are the strength coaches, in every sport. Whether it's
football, baseball, basketball, the strength coaches are some of
the most influential coaches that you have. I know at Georgia
State, we take that guy real seriously and he has our guys on a
strong weight-conditioning program.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubois knows the combination of stronger athletes and lighter
bats has had an effect on the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to get bigger,'' Dubois said. ``But they're
making the bats lighter, so it's more to the hitter's advantage. So
it gives them the upper edge.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how quickly baseball's hitting records would
fall if McGwire or Tony Gwynn were allowed to use an aluminum bat.
It's conceivable that the single-season home run record could reach
100, or hitters might break the .400 mark on a routine basis.
</P>
<P>
   Fans love homers and high-scoring games, but would the prospect
of five- or six-hour slugfests get old in a hurry?
</P>
<P>
   What can be done?
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, along with other organizations, is taking a close look
at the continued development of bats and is trying to bring
aluminum bats more in line with wood.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee is examining the
issue this week. Fox, named head coach at the University of North
Carolina this spring, recently completed a six-year term on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time was spent on bats, `` Fox said. ``I hadn't
given it much thought, but after seeing some video and statistics,
it got me to thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Breidenthal, staff liaison with the NCAA Baseball Rules
Committee, says the committee is looking at a conflicting issue:
trying to ensure player safety while preserving the integrity of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard decision to make,'' Breidenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the NCAA has tried to develop a measurement of
a bat's performance, called a BPF. It's a measure of the rebound of
a ball off a bat shot from a cannon at a set speed. The BPF has
been measured at speeds as high as 110 mph, although the committee
is trying to set a limit of 93 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the National Federation of State High School
Associations announced new guidelines for bat performance, based on
wood bats. The new standards will be announced by Oct. 31 and take
effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   What 1998 Division I batting leaders would have accomplished
with aluminum bats, based on a 162-game season:
</P>
<P>
   Batting average: .464, Pat Magness, Wichita State (major league
record: .426, Nap Lajoie, 1901)
</P>
<P>
   RBI: 295, Damon Thames, Rice (major league record: 190, Hack
Wilson, 1930)

 &HT;    Getting the best bang for your buck
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _It's the ping that makes cash registers ring.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats were first produced in the 1970s as a cheaper
alternative to wood bats. Batmakers promised unbreakable aluminum
bats would last longer than breakable wood, at a reasonable cost.
At the time, the cost savings of aluminum bats allowed youth
leagues, high schools and colleges to save money by making the
switch.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the case any more.
</P>
<P>
   As any parent of a baseball player knows, the price of aluminum
baseball bats continues to rise. The newest top-of-the-line models
easily cost $300. A new Worth bat, which will include piezoelectric
shock absorbers, will retail in the neighborhood of $280.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the current price of wood bats, which retail for
around $20. Of course, the quality of the bat you can purchase at
your local retailer is far from what Mark McGwire is using. But you
can now buy 15 wood bats for the price of some aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest advantages of aluminum bats is that they
supposedly last longer. But as manufacturers have made the walls of
hollow aluminum bats thinner to make the bat lighter, aluminum bats
are cracking and denting much more easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aluminum bats don't last long at all,'' North Carolina
Wesleyan's Andy Jones said. ``They tell you not to hit under 65
degrees. It's worse than a wood bat (in some cases).''
</P>
<P>
   Most companies will allow you to return an aluminum bat if it
cracks or dents. Jones said that sometimes can be as often as every
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some college programs don't purchase bats at all, because of
contracts with aluminum bat companies. Louisville Slugger sponsored
both Arizona State and Southern California, the two teams that met
in the 1998 Division I College World Series final.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason that many college coaches haven't spoken out
about the bat issue. They don't want to bite the hand that feeds
them. But as is the case in most businesses, if somebody's given a
free ride, someone else has to pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston stated in his study on the
difference between wood and aluminum bats: ``If thousands of these
high-performance bats are being given to programs under contract
each year, it is understandable why the price of the bats to
non-contracted programs (college, high school, individuals) has
risen so dramatically in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools with smaller athletic budgets get by because players
often provide their own bats. Former North Carolina Wesleyan coach
Mike Fox said he hadn't bought a large number of aluminum bats for
the Bishops in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is one of the biggest factors for colleges. But is it still
cost effective?
</P>
<P>
   There are now special wood bats which are supposed to be less
breakable. Most are coated with a special fiberglass, or have some
sort of composite material included. The Coastal Plain League has
provided its teams with composite wood bats the past two years, but
most CPL players were still willing to spend $20 on a wood bat of
their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cost is about $100 per bat,'' said Mark Cryan, CPL
director of operations. ``We use about eight to 10 bats per team,
or about $800 per season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cryan said if the league switched to true wood bats, the cost
would be approximately $2,500 per team.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden shift in policy by the NCAA may leave many programs
scrambling to find the funds to purchase wood bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason college favors aluminum bats, like anything else,
money is the big factor, it's the driving force,'' Georgia State
assistant coach Bob Keller said. ``They say money is the reason why
they won't go to wood. There are some ways to get around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are going to break wood bats more, so your turnover ratio
of having to buy bats is obviously going to be more. The problem
you have there is that there are only a handful of programs in the
country that have enough money to go switch over to wood. While
that's nice, there's more programs that are small-time programs
that don't have money to be continually buying wood bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bat manufacturers want the NCAA to fully evaluate the issue
before rushing to any conclusions. Obviously, they don't want to
lose out on the millions of dollars aluminum bats bring in every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston noted that there are several reasons why bat companies
are against reducing the explosive power of metal bats, with
profits coming out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would severely reduce the profitability margin of the
bat,'' Thurston said. ``It allows other bat manufacturers (who
presently don't have the high-tech engineering capacities) to
compete in the market, and reduces sales because the bats would be
more durable and not need to be replaced as often.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   Easton Sports, one of the two major aluminum batmakers, has
filed a $267 million pre-emptive lawsuit against the NCAA, alleging
unlawful restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA this week approved rules changes designed to reduce the
impact speed of aluminum bats by Aug. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let them know that this is a serious change,'' said
Jim Easton, the chairman of Easton Sports, which is one of the two
biggest manufacturers of aluminum bats. The other is Louisville
Slugger, and together the two companies produce about 40 percent of
the 500,000 aluminum bats manufactured annually in the United
States.

 &HT;    Safety issue is paramount
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ The silence said it all.
</P>
<P>
   As Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina lay in front of the mound
earlier this spring, blood gushing from a cut over his eye, his
teammates in the dugout were silent, some weeping. More than 48,000
people in Camden Yards were quiet. Mussina had just been hit in the
face by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Sandy Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Houston pitcher Billy Wagner was hit in the
head by a line drive. After the impact, the ball rolled all the way
to the edge of the third-base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, both Mussina and Wagner suffered only minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case for 17-year old pitcher Julius Riofrir of
Glendale, Calif. He was killed last summer after being hit in the
right temple by a ball hit with an aluminum bat. He was warming up
at the time and suffered a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   In a game where pitchers have less than a second to react to a
line drive, the three incidents clearly show how dangerous the game
of baseball can be.
</P>
<P>
   With aluminum bats being used in college, high school and youth
baseball, fielders seem to be coming under fire more often. Is it
safe to play with aluminum bats?
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers contend they are producing safe bats and the game
is still safe, according to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety issue is a big one,'' Louisville Slugger executive
George Manning said. ``Discussion will continue on the safety of
the bats. But the trend has not been upwards. This issue has been
there all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning says in the pros, a player is hit by a batted ball an
average of once every 25 games. At the college level, it happens
once every 75 games.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA's annual injury surveillance system,
college baseball is one of the safest sports in college athletics.
Over the past few years, the NCAA has conducted random surveys to
gather information on defensive players being struck by batted
balls. Yet, only 14 percent of Division I institutions have
completed that survey.
</P>
<P>
   According to Todd Breidenthal, staff liaison with the NCAA
Baseball Rules Committee, this past season, 150 pitchers were hit
by a batted ball. Of those, between 20 and 25 missed at least one
practice or game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State pitcher Ryan Mills suffered a broken jaw several
years ago by a line drive, and a University of Houston pitcher lost
two teeth. But there have been no fatalities, according to
Breidenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we lucky?'' Breidenthal asked, rhetorically. ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just an issue at the college level. As Mussina's
and Wagner's incidents show, it can happen at the highest levels,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it always takes some serious injury for
(something to be done),'' Georgia State assistant coach Bob Keller
said. ``You'd think that (Mills' injury) would have been enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball finally made batting helmets mandatory
after several horrifying incidents, including Boston's Tony
Conigliaro having his cheekbone fractured by a thrown ball in 1967.
In 1920, Cleveland's Ray Chapman was struck in the head by a pitch
and killed, the only on-field fatality in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 percent of Division I schools not responding to the NCAA
survey, no one knows the exact number of players hurt by batted
balls. But everyone knows it's become more of a problem in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think safety is an issue,'' North Carolina baseball coach
Mike Fox said. ``A lot more get hurt than get reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he doesn't remember a player being seriously hurt by a
batted ball during the 15 years he was at North Carolina Wesleyan.
He considers himself, and his program, to be fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Keller has seen his share of players hit, but not necessarily on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anybody get hit in the face,'' Keller said.
``I've seen pitchers go down, and leave the game taking one off the
ankle, getting hit in the chest and whatever. It's pretty
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the aluminum bat injuries that you see are
(pitchers) getting hurt in the (batting) cage. Because they're so
close and those balls are ricocheting off the poles on the side of
the cage. I know some coaches now that are making it mandatory for
their guys throwing down in the cage to be wearing helmets. Those
cages are so tight and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller recalls a third baseman in Georgia who was hit in the
head last year. He's now blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many incidents is it going to take?'' Keller asked.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from 60 feet, 6 inches, a pitcher usually ends up about
55 feet away from the batter after his delivery. It can be a scary
sight seeing a ball coming at your head. Sometimes you don't even
see it. Virginia Commonwealth sophomore Jason Dubois pitched
against both aluminum and wood this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' Dubois said. ``You're the closest (fielder) to
the plate, and you're throwing the ball and moving in all these
awkward positions. You throw the ball 90 miles per hour, and the
guy hits it, it comes back at about 120. That's got to be the most
frightening thing ever when you're on the ballfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston has studied the statistical
differences between aluminum and wood. Because an aluminum bat is
lighter and a batter can generate more force, Thurston came to this
conclusion: ``If a batted ball is hit at a greater velocity, at the
same distance and hit harder more often, the potential for more
injuries, and more severe injury, is certainly increased.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   NCAA baseball officials have approved rules changes designed to
cut the performance of aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I and II championship baseball committees approved
the changes for next season. The Division III committee - concerned
about the financial impact it would have on its schools - asked
that the implementation date be pushed back seven months to August
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said the amended bats would protect pitchers and
preserve the integrity of the game.

EX-FBI AGENT DEFENDS WARNING INFORMANT ABOUT MURDER THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A former FBI supervisor testified Wednesday that he saw
no contradiction in warning mobster and informant Angelo ``Sonny''
Mercurio that he was marked for murder even as he was on the run
from federal criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Quinn, a retired organized crime supervisor, also
insisted that he ``would have done the same'' for the reputed
gangsters seated across from him in a federal courtroom. That
remark prompted an incredulous smirk from the man on the far left,
New England Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI never told Salemme that it had information in 1989 that
he was being targeted for assassination in a Mob power struggle. He
was shot and wounded outside a Saugus pancake house on June 16 of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Quinn recalled efforts by him and other agents to
warn Mercurio that he had been targeted because his mob cohorts
believed he had tipped off the FBI to an October 1989 Mafia
induction ceremony that the agency secretly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme's lawyer, Anthony M. Cardinale, as well as attorneys for
Salemme's codefendants _ Winter Hill Gang leader Stephen J. Flemmi,
fellow gangster John Martorano, and mob soldier Robert DeLuca _ are
trying to show that the FBI didn't look too hard for Mercurio.
Instead, agents went out of their way to warn him of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio got special treatment, the defense lawyers suggest,
because he had provided the Boston office of the FBI with perhaps
its biggest coup: entree into the secret induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The theory underpins one of the central issues before US
District Judge Mark L. Wolf: whether to drop three-year-old
extortion and racketeering charges against Flemmi because, as he
claims, he was promised immunity from prosecution in exchange for
information he provided the FBI during three decades of sporadic
informing.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi is expected be the final witness when he takes the stand
this morning, detailing his years as a top FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who headed the organized crime squad from 1990 until his
retirement in 1995, said he contacted retired FBI agent John
Connolly, who had been Mercurio's handler, when he learned on July
5, 1991, that Mercurio's life had been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said Connolly was in the best position to know how to get
word to Mercurio. But Quinn testified that he never knew if
Mercurio had been warned.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Cardinale, Quinn rejected the suggestion
that the FBI's actions were contradictory: protecting a fugitive
instead of pursuing him. Another FBI agent has testified that
Mercurio was spotted at a holiday barbeque the day before Quinn
learned of the death threat but was not arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio remained free until 1994, when he was arrested in
Georgia on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn acknowledged that the bureau did not follow up on
information from the US Drug Enforcement Administration that put
Mercurio in Los Angeles as a participant in a cross-country drug
dealing operation in summer 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Flemmi's lawyer, Kenneth J. Fishman, Quinn said he
didn't recall a courtroom encounter with Flemmi after he was
arraigned on extortion and racketeering charges in early 1995.
According to Fishman, Flemmi said to Quinn, ``Hey, how about a
break on bail?'' suggesting that the FBI had agreed to go easy on
him because of his work as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination by Assistant US Attorney Brian T.
Kelly, Quinn said he didn't know anyone at the bureau who had
authorized Flemmi to commit crimes or promised him immunity.
</P>
<P>
   When Flemmi was arrested, ``Did he ask, `What's going on here, I
was authorized to commit crimes?'''Kelly asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Quinn replied.

 &HT;    Falcons Q&AMP;A with Ray Buchanan
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cornerback Ray Buchanan had a lot to do with the
Falcons' improvement in the defensive backfield last year.
Buchanan's five interceptions helped Atlanta improve from last in
the NFL in interceptions with six in 1996 to sixth in the NFL last
season with 17. He and quarterback Chris Chandler were the first
major acquisitions by coach Dan Reeves. Buchanan joined the team
when the Colts refused to match Atlanta's four-year, $13-million
offer. He has 21 interceptions in his 5-year career. Buchanan, a
smooth-talking Chicago native, has made Mr. Blackwell's annual
best-dressed list and is active in local charities. He recorded his
first album during the winter. Buchanan, 26, sat down recently with
Journal-Constitution beat writer Matt Winkeljohn.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: You took offense a couple weeks ago when a caption under
your picture said you were ``burned'' by a rookie receiver in
practice. Do you think media rules are different for star players?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: It seems like (star players) are fair game. If (the
media) attack a star player it will get a lot more attention. Take,
for instance, (quarterback) Chris (Chandler) when he was going
through his (injury) situation. The media was quick to jump on him.
It was something he really couldn't control. But people were
questioning his toughness. How could he control when he's going to
get hit or when he's not?
</P>
<P>
   AJC: But isn't a higher degree of scrutiny a price you expect to
pay as a very highly paid star athlete?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: I believe every athlete who steps on the field should
be accountable for his mistakes; he should be his own worst critic.
We knew what we were getting into as far as the realm of
professional football. It comes with the game . . . . How well can
you handle criticism, and not place blame on someone else? Still,
how could (Chandler) control things when his head gets rapped off
the turf?
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Please elaborate on the importance of self-accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: You've got to take a lot of personal pride in your
job. A lot of guys can't handle pressure and point fingers at
somebody else. I think about 70 percent of the (rookies) are good
enough physically to make it, but . . . do they have the courage?
To me, it's 80 percent mental at this level.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What do you mean mental? Are you talking preparation or
reading keys and such during games?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: Both. You will get eaten up at this level as a
defensive back if you go out thinking you can get by on athletic
skill alone . . . not knowing what the (receiver) can do, what's
he's going to try to do to set you up for later in the game, things
like that.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Given that, how aggravating is it to see teammates with
remarkable athletic abilities who just can't seem to apply them on
the field?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: It's tremendously frustrating. I talk to people who
have the physical talent and just mentally don't get the job done.
The coaches have said something so many times, and then veterans
try to step in, but sometimes it just blows over their heads. You
look at some guys with all the physical tools and say, 'Darn, if I
had that body and my brain, I'd be in the Pro Bowl 13 straight
years.' It seems like kids today can't take getting coached real
hard. When I was coming up, coaches would curse at you, yell, do
anything, and you'd strive not to hear that voice again. Today,
it's like they believe everything they hear, and you have to be
cautious not to say too much because they'll believe they can't do
it. But you don't want to spoon-feed them, either. There comes a
point where you just got to let them go.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Give a quick assessment of 35-year-old free safety Eugene
Robinson and 32-year-old strong safety William White.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: People say they're a couple of old guys, but they're
so smart they put themselves in position where they don't have to
move that much. And they communicate very well, which is a great
thing.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: My car goes into the shop Sept. 8 for repairs. Which one of
yours can I borrow?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: You can definitely have the (Mercedes) 500SL
convertible. It's platinum and silver. It'll be great for you and
your wife to ride around town in with the top down.

 &HT;    Do metal bats take the ballance out of baseball?
 &HT;    By Patrick Brannan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ In 1961, Mike Gillespie scored the winning
run in the College World Series as Southern California defeated
Oklahoma State 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Gillespie coached the Trojans to their 12th CWS
title, he had a little more breathing room as Southern Cal defeated
Arizona State 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 CWS set 13 offensive records as the eight teams
combined to bat .318 and belt 62 home runs, shattering the previous
records of .303 and 48, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So why the explosion of offense at the college level?
</P>
<P>
   Many are pointing to bats as the culprit. New standards may be
set on aluminum bats, while others would like to see the NCAA bring
wooden bats back to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see all of college baseball go to wood bats,''
Georgia State assistant Bob Keller said. ``I've always felt that
way, but even after being here in Rocky Mount this summer and
watching how much crisper the game is, it's played like it's
supposed to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller, the hitting instructor at Georgia State, is the head
coach of the Rocky Mount Rockfish this summer. His experience this
season has strengthened his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With wood bats, you can play percentage baseball and have a
greater chance for success,'' Keller said. ``If we draw the infield
in with a wood bat, and a guy hits a hard ground ball, the chances
aren't as good of it getting through as if it were with an aluminum
bat. That ball is going to come off the bat a lot harder, a lot
faster and might get through the infield. It takes away some of the
strategy from the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, college team batting averages have risen 16 points,
scoring is up 14 percent, and home runs have increased 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, team earned run averages have risen almost a
full run a game in three years.
</P>
<P>
   What's in the bat?
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of differences between aluminum and wooden
bats, besides the sound of the crack or the ping.
</P>
<P>
   The larger the diameter, the bigger the hitting area.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden bat must be solid, and therefore the weight is usually
contained in the barrel. Baseball rules state a bat can not be more
than 2 3/4 inches in diameter at its greatest spot. But most wood
bats never reach that limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are 2 1/2 to 2 5/8 inches,'' Louisville Slugger executive
George Manning said. ``Aluminum bats are 2 3/4 and the weight is
distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most aluminum bats are hollow and extremely light. The NCAA
allows the difference between the bat's weight and length to be no
less than five. For example, a 33-inch bat can weigh just 28
ounces. That limit will be four for the 1999 season and may drop
further if new standards are inacted.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the key, because contrary to popular opinion, it's bat
speed that makes a ball travel farther - the ability to whip the
bat head through the hitting zone with the greatest force.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats also have a greater hitting area, usually called
the sweet spot. Rawlings has developed a metal bat with a 10-inch
sweet spot. Worth is preparing to release a new aluminum bat which
contains piezoelectric dampers to control the amount of vibration
in the bat. The bat is supposed to allow the hitter to hit the ball
harder and extend the sweet spot down into the handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wooden bat has a smaller sweet spot,'' Rawlings wooden bat
marketing director Tom Nailor said. ``But a ball can travel farther
if you hit it just right with a wood bat.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when a batter gets jammed with a wooden bat, he's
more likely to break it, allowing the fielders to react to the
change in the ball's direction. With an aluminum bat, a jammed
batter can still hit the ball hard enough to carry over an
infielder's head.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics don't lie
   Amherst College coach Bill Thurston, the NCAA baseball rules
editor, is involved in a study of college hitters and pitchers who
play in wood bat summer leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston followed 90 Division I hitters with at least 70 at-bats
in the Cape Cod Summer League and 60 pitchers who threw at least 25
innings. The ball used in that league is the same one used in many
college leagues, so he could rule that out as a variable.
</P>
<P>
   He then compared the summer wood bat statistics to each player's
college regular-season numbers with aluminum bats, taking into
consideration the number of games played.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston's study showed batting averages fell 107 points when
batters used wood compared to aluminum. Slugging percentages were
down 226 points. And with aluminum bats, batters hit a home run
every 25 at-bats, compared to every 74 with wood.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the batters in the study hit over .400 with aluminum
bats and 31 more hit at least .350. But not one of those same
players hit over .350 in the Cape Cod League, and only five were
able to bat better than .300.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Thurston found pitchers' ERAs decreased an average
of 2.10 runs per pitcher. Two lowered their ERAs over five points
and seven dropped more than four runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve saw their ERA shrink by three runs. In addition, each
pitcher allowed an average of 2 1/2 fewer hits per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   There are always exceptions to the rule. Rocky Mount Rockfish
outfielder Jason Dubois hit 17 home runs with a wood bat this
summer, after just seven round-trippers as a Virginia Commonwealth
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Dubois doesn't have one answer as to why his numbers have
jumped, though he said he tends to swing a wood bat more during
practice and the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swinging a wood bat helps,'' Dubois said. ``I've been swinging
a wood bat for five years now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he played in a league in which he was allowed to
use either wood or aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used wood most of the time,'' Dubois said, ``until I found
somebody that was throwing mid-90s and then I broke out my
aluminum, just because it was easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like wood over aluminum, because it feels more natural.
You're actually using more power with wood than you are with
aluminum. Most aluminum bats now are so springy, that you hit a
ball and it goes in about a quarter of an inch and then shoots
right off.''

 &HT;    Pittsburgh zone blitz to challenge offense
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Atlanta Falcons set their preseason schedule,
they had no intention of playing the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the
NFL asked kindly if the Falcons would please play them instead of
Tampa Bay. Something about wanting more NFC-AFC matchups.
</P>
<P>
   So Atlanta will travel to Morgantown, W.Va., Saturday to face
one of just three teams in the league that uses a 3-4 alignment as
its base defense. And don't even get offensive line coach Art Shell
started about the zone blitz the Steelers play better than anybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had enough trouble picking up a conventional blitz
Friday against Detroit. And now this?
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come with the zone blitz, the idea is you got to
figure out where they're coming from,'' said Shell, who for perhaps
the first time in training camp got loud Tuesday while working with
the linemen on blitz pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may only bring five people, but where are they coming
from? You got to get your line and your backs coordinated, and your
quarterback has to get the line in the right protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Just facing a three-man front is different enough, especially
when it's not a three-man front. Both outside linebackers are on
the line most of the time, and until the ball is snapped, it's
often unclear which man is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different because you're working against a four-man front
all of training camp, and all of a sudden here comes the 3-4,''
Shell said after a two-hour and 15-minute practice that focused on
special teams and blitz pickups. ``They bring different people, it
might be five, it might be six, they might drop a defensive lineman
in (pass) coverage, they're always slanting somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to get you sometimes because of the way they
slant, but hopefully, sometimes you get them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, this might work out well for the Falcons. They
play another of the teams that relies on the 3-4 next week when the
Bengals come to town, and then they go to Carolina _ the other base
3-4 team _ for the regular-season opener Sept. 6, and the Panthers
come to Atlanta Oct. 4, in the fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice once a day from now on, including a 3
p.m. practice today. Training camp officially breaks today, meaning
veterans no longer are required to stay at the Falcon Inn motel
adjacent to the team's Suwanee headquarters. Rookies, however,
aren't going anywhere. There will be one practice Thursday and
Friday before Saturday's game against the Steelers in Morgantown,
W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was ``On the Border'' night in the cafeteria, as there
was a Mexican-style food line with beef, chicken and shrimp
fajitas, refried beans, rice, salsa and pico de gallo all
complemented with a three-man mariachi band. The players love this,
in part because it signifies the last official day of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler _ Threw in drills, and worked with all three
units.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani _ Threw in drills, and worked with the first two
units. Also had holding duties with placekickers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg _ Same as Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   John Dutton _ Used only in drills.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: In the hurry-up offense drill at the end of practice,
6-foot-7 tight end O.J. Santiago jumped to catch a pass at the left
sideline from Chandler and held on although linebacker Cornelius
Bennett was trying to rip it loose.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: WR Jammi German dropped a nice pass in the left flat from
Chandler in 11-on-11 work.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Rookie reserve left guard Bob Hallen nearly whiffed
completely against defensive tackle Shawn Swayda in one-on-one
drills, as Swayda had an almost clear path to Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ``(Starting right cornerback) Ronnie Bradford. I knew nothing
about him, but I can see he's a real student of the game. He has
the athletic ability to get it done at corner, but one day he is
going to be a free safety, and a very good one. He really works at
understanding everything.'' _ free safety Eugene Robinson, when
asked which member of the secondary has most surprised him since he
joined the team from Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ron Medlin didn't report any new injuries. Here's who
missed practice with old injuries: DT Mark Campbell (knee), DT
William Gaines (back, knee), S Devin Bush (knee), WR Corey Allen
(knee/ankle), DE Barry Mitchell (elbow) and OT Nate Miller (nerve
problem in shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   I've seen you before
</P>
<P>
   There will be several familiar faces on the Steelers sideline,
including rookie receiver Hines Ward, late of the University of
Georgia, and safety Lethon Flowers, formerly of Georgia Tech. The
roster also will include former Falcons K Norm Johnson, TE Mitch
Lyons, TE Troy Sadowski (who also played at Georgia) and RB Richard
Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Ward leads the Steelers in receiving, with nine catches for 99
yards, and he could see more time in the return game Saturday
because of injuries to Henry Bailey and Jahine Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Steelers' offensive coordinator Ray Sherman was the
Falcons' offensive coordinator in 1990.

THE PRESIDENCY WILL SURVIVE REGARDLESS OF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)   (EDs: FIXES quote in 6th graf, adding the word ``innocent.'')  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This summer the most compelling drama in movie
theaters is ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's
excruciating depiction of death on the bloody beaches of Normandy,
while the most compelling drama on the political stage is ``Saving
Bill Clinton,'' the embarrassing saga of sex and the president's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, Ryan survives the brutality of World War II. On
the national scene, Clinton's fate remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The link between these events is the fact that they cast new
perspectives on institutions that have protected liberty and
sustained the republic since its birth _ war and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Spielberg film offers the most graphic and honest
re-creation of the horror of the World War II Normandy invasion
ever shown in a professional movie. The Clinton drama is less
graphic, less honest and, therefore, less persuasive than the tale
of a squad of soldiers trying to find and protect a private whose
three brothers already have been killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Spielberg replaced the glory of war with the gore of
war, Clinton simply sought, in his brief televised address to the
nation after his grand jury testimony last week, to gloss over
incredibly irresponsible actions _ first the sexual encounters with
Monica Lewinsky and then, for seven months, his public denial of
those encounters. He conceded that he had misled the people and his
wife, but he did not really apologize for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   His confession failed to answer key questions about his conduct
and his veracity. And, in a self-serving move, Clinton sought to
blame Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for an investigation that
``has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's contention that Starr's probe now must end sounded
like an echo of Richard Nixon's repeated refrain at the beginning
of 1974 that ``one year of Watergate is enough.'' Investigators
refused to bow to Nixon's plea for an end to the inquiry, and seven
months later he forced to resign the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Clinton did nor reach further back into history and
attempt to picture his labrador retriever Buddy as a reincarnation
of the ``little dog Checkers'' that Nixon described so emotionally
in a 1952 TV appearance. Then, he was defending the fact that
wealthy Californians were providing funds to help sustain him in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There may be ample reason to criticize Starr's investigation,
but Clinton's stonewalling is to blame for much of the length of
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   His confession was far from a total loss, however. Interviews
with people around the nation indicated that a majority of
Americans continue to approve his handling of the presidency
despite the reckless manner in which he conducts his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no matter what happens to Clinton between now and Jan. 20,
2001, the presidency will remain a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, it has survived crisis after crisis. It
was not destroyed by the forced resignation of Richard Nixon, the
assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, the
departure from the White House of Theodore Roosevelt or the death
in wartime of his distant cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson steered the nation safely through the days of
tragedy following Kennedy's death. Gerald Ford accomplished a
similar feat after Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But as an institution, the presidency is stronger than anyone
who occupies the post. Turbulent events or weak and duplicitous
leaders can diminish its authority but only for a brief period. The
right person coming to office at the right time can breathe new
life into the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After the bitter, often violent, division over Vietnam that led
Johnson to reject a bid for reelection in 1968, the Watergate
scandal that forced Nixon's resignation and the Iran hostage crisis
that magnified Jimmy Carter's ineptitude, the presidency was in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some learned Americans wrote books and articles suggesting that
the time had come to reform the office and possibly divide up its
authority. The thinking was that the world was too big and complex
for one person to handle such an all-encompassing post.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronald Reagan sauntered into the White House and
demonstrated that the presidency was as strong and vibrant as it
ever had been. He did so by communicating brilliantly with the
people, exuding self-confidence, enunciating a limited policy
agenda that he could implement and standing firm against the ``evil
empire'' of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Iran-contra scandal of the late 1980s, which led to
critics to suggest his impeachment, failed to diminish Reagan's
standing with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Clinton's presidency is that he had a grand
opportunity to lead a prosperous and peaceful nation triumphantly
into the 21st century. Now that opportunity has faded. Many people
who once trusted him no longer feel they can.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might learn from his friend Spielberg that there is
profit in honesty. With the passage of time, World War II _ the
seminal event of the 20th century _ has become wreathed in
nostalgia that is stripped away in Spielberg's film.
</P>
<P>
   The president also could learn something from the 19th century
French writer Henri-Frederic Amiel: ``Truth is the secret of
eloquence and of virtue, the basis of moral authority; it is the
highest summit of art and of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a good Democrat, Clinton just might ponder some words
uttered in 1932 by Franklin D. Roosevelt: ``The presidency is ...
preeminently the place of moral leadership.''

 &HT;    Road to College Football _ Georgia Southern
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ During a recent Georgia Southern practice, a
man on the senior side of 65 stood in the shadows of a goalpost at
Paulson Stadium chomping on the remains of a cigar and watching
intensely as players moved from drill to drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a pretty good team,'' he told a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Erk Russell, never known to exaggerate or overwork superlatives,
should know a pretty good team when he sees one. After all, he's
coached his share of them, including the 15-0 Georgia Southern
Division I-AA championship team in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, another Russell is on a Georgia Southern staff
expected to return the program to the level of success it enjoyed
in the '80s. Erk's son, Rusty, is the defensive coordinator for
head coach Paul Johnson, who himself was an assistant to the senior
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern is picked as a favorite for not only its second
Southern Conference title in a row but also perhaps a national
championship, largely because of its explosive offense.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Eagles live up to such expectations probably
depends more on how well Rusty Russell and his staff can fashion
this '98 unit into the likeness of its immediate predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Eagles gave up an average of 330 yards in total offense
a game, but the 10-3 team led the conference in scoring defense
(17.6 points a game) and turnover margin.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation took several key components of that defense,
including all-star linebackers Chad Nighbert and D.T. Tanner and
three starters in the deep secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, as it's laid out, we're starting two seniors at
defensive end, and that's it,'' Russell said. ``Everybody else is
an underclassman. So we're not a mature defense right now. We've
got to cover some ground in that area, but we have some talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The experienced part of that talent is in the front line, where
all-star candidate Eric Davis (6-3, 260) and Benjy Harris (6-3,
238) will line up at the ends, with preseason all-conference pick
Voncellies Allen (5-11, 286) somewhere between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can be better than last year, when everything is in
place _ when the younger players learn the system and get used to
the speed of games,'' said Allen, part of a group that managed 30
quarterback sacks last season. ``Until then, it's going to be up to
the three of us to take up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced linebacker is sophomore Daryl Morrell (5-9,
180). Also expected to help at that position is redshirt freshman
Jason Neese (6-0, 213).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're the weak link on the defense, but I will
admit that we lack experience,'' said Morrell, who started eight
games and was involved in 65 tackles last season. ``We still have
people who played, so we know what's going on. In fact, I feel like
this group is faster and quicker, and we'll be able hold our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern hopes that speed can compensate for experience,
especially in the secondary, where Atlantan Earthwind Moreland and
Kilwaukee Thomas of Perry will line up at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Moreland, a junior, has been clocked at 4.31 in the 40-yard
dash, fastest on the team, ahead of Thomas at 4.42. As Georgia
Southern tries to find players to find a tackle, a linebacker and
two safeties, Russell hopes that a standard set last season will be
ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that we established a tradition that we're going to
run to the ball and play harder than anybody we face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern's offense produced 401 yards and 32.5 points a
game last year and is expected to be just as potent _ or more.
Junior quarterback Greg Hill, who rushed for 1,172 yards and 18
touchdowns, should have a greater grasp of Johnson's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can stop our offense,'' Allen said.
``But I'm sure some people will take our defense lightly. Hey, if
they do, that'll just be to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is hoping that the two units will complement each other
enough that Eagle fans will return to Paulson Stadium for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, there were a lot of people who said, ``Let's wait
and see,'' and it'll probably be that way this year,'' Johnson
said. ``But I think the expectation level has risen back to where
it was before. That can be good and bad, but if it will help bring
the fans back, I'm all for it.''

 &HT;    Potential Browns buyers to vie for team until Chicago meeting
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The high-stakes ``Countdown to Cleveland'' started
officially here Wednesday when NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue
announced that the owner of the resurrected Browns franchise will
be selected on Sept. 8 at a special league meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19 days leading to the vote, the level of politicking by
the seven candidate groups that made presentations to the
membership at a hotel near the Atlanta airport could be fierce. And
bids, which can be revised several times during the next 19 days,
figure to start high and grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always worry that someone is going to go crazy on the
price,'' said John Murdough, one of the seven candidates. Another
candidate Dick Jacobs, who also owns the Cleveland Indians, said,
``You can't grow trees through the sky. There's a limit to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't try telling that to incumbent owners Jerry Jones of Dallas
and Tampa Bay's Malcolm Glazer, who still think a $1 billion price
tag is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Their rationale is that the reborn Browns will generate record
revenues and, because of a generous stocking plan approved last
month, be competitive quickly. Although owners have been asked by
the league not to speculate on the franchise fee, the consensus
among those who were asked Wednesday was that it will be between
$600 million and $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Al Lerner, once a minority stockholder in the old Browns and the
unofficial favorite to get the new club, noted that such a fee will
squeeze profits.
</P>
<P>
   The league will present at least two finalists on Sept. 8, and
one of them must be the group with the highest bid. It will take a
three-fourths vote of the membership, or 23 of 30 teams, to select
the owner of the new Browns.

 &HT;    Marcus Giles' big season
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ Marcus Giles, then 11 years old, burst into tears
when older brother Brian wasn't taken until the second day and the
17th round of the 1989 baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so upset I went to my room and cried for a long time,''
the Macon Braves second baseman recalled. ``I couldn't believe no
one saw how good he was. I knew he was going to be a
major-leaguer.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Marcus was eligible for the draft in 1996, Brian had
proved his brother right by making the Cleveland Indians. But
Marcus was about to find out just how fickle, and often cruel, the
inexact process of predicting success in pro baseball can be.
</P>
<P>
   Like his brother a standout at Granite Hills High School in El
Cajon, Calif., Marcus expected to be taken the first day. He
wasn't. Then, he thought he surely would go early the second day.
Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 players were selected before Marcus was finally
picked in the 53rd round by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible few days for the whole family,'' said Monica
Giles, the boys' mother. ``It was always Marcus' dream to play in
the majors like Brian. He was crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marcus didn't cry this time. He decided to get even.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus said he was going to make everyone regret passing him
over,'' said his father, Bill. ``It really became a driving force
for him. He was determined to prove everyone wrong. He still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only 5-feet-8, Giles has hit 35 homers, a Macon record
and five off the South Atlantic League mark. After hitting .348 as
a first-year player last season in the Appalachian League, he is
batting .333 at Macon and has driven in a league-best 102 runs.
Giles' 73 extra-base hits are a league record.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad start for a draft afterthought who wasn't even offered
a contract by the Braves until he completed a season in junior
college. After hitting .489 with 20 homers for Grossmont College,
his stock had risen enough to receive a bonus of approximately
$75,000 to sign just before the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza lasted until the 62nd round in 1988. Giles may be
the biggest goof since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft is a joke,'' said Giles, unable or unwilling to put
the bitterness aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouts disgust me. All they care about is how tall you are or
how fast you can run. What about being a baseball player? Doesn't
that count for anything? The scouts think they have it down to a
science, and they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The last second baseman to hit Macon with such a passion to
prove others wrong was Pete Rose, who wowed fans at Luther Williams
Field with his hustle in1962 before going on to become baseball's
all-time hits leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was willing to put in as many extra hours of batting and
fielding practice as it took to reach the major leagues. So is
Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be 100 degrees out, and Marcus will get here two
hours early to work on ground balls or take extra batting
practice,'' manager Brian Snitker said. ``I had Mark Lemke when he
was coming up, and Marcus reminds me of the Lemmer. He wears us
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially coach Glenn Hubbard, who leaves his Stone Mountain
home shortly after breakfeast many days to put in extra time with
Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck in traffic I hear about it from him,'' Hubbard
said. ``He wants to know why I'm late. And the game isn't for four
or five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Atlanta Brave for10 seasons, Hubbard was one of the
best-fielding second basemen in the National League. His pairing
with Giles didn't come by accident. Who better to take a raw former
outfielder and refine him into a sure-handed infielder?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Marcus, he said, 'I'm horrible. I need your
help,''' Hubbard remembers. ``It's taken a lot of work, but you
won't find a more improved defensive player in the league. He isn't
affraid to have the ball hit to him. He wants it _ even a high
chopper over the mound, which used to give him a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles made 20 errors in the first half of the season. He's made
five since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played them early in the season, he had some glaring
deficiencies, and I thought he might have to change positions,''
said Augusta coach Jeff Treadway, a second baseball with the Braves
and four other teams. ``Now he makes the plays and is as good as
anyone in the league at turning the doubleplay.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles, a muscled 185-pounder who lifts weights six days a week
in the offeason, has dominated at the plate from opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be very tall, but he can hit a ball a long way,''
Snitker said. ``He's hit a couple balls into the light towers. His
home runs are definitely not a fluke. He's a very good hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles won the home-run derby at the South Atlantic League
all-star festivities, then took MVP honors with a game-winning
single. He is one of the leading candidates to be named the league
MVP. Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones are the only two Macon Braves
to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouts miss on some players,'' admitted Paul Snyder, the
Braves' director of scouting and player development. ``Marcus
always had a good bat, but he wasn't as strong coming out of high
school as he is now, and he didn't have a postition. He's put in a
lot of work to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   And Snyder doesn't mind if Giles keeps a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have a little (attitude),'' Synder said.
``Especially when you are his size. That will help you to the major
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where brother Brian is waiting. The two always have been
close, and Marcus would visit Brian regularly as he was working his
way up with the Indians. Brian visited Macon during the All-Star
break but didn't get to see the M-Braves play, because of a
rainout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew he could hit, but you don't ever expect home-run
numbers like this from a second baseman,'' said Brian, who hit 17
homers for Cleveland last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouts wouldn't believe me, but I've always said that Marcus
was a better hitter than Brian,'' their father said. ``That wasn't
anything against Brian. That's just how good I think Marcus swings
the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard agrees. He'll take some of the credit for Marcus'
improved fielding. But not his hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave him a special gift,'' Hubbard. ``I'm not going to do
anything to mess that up.''

 &HT;    Top picks not always instant hits
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ Being a first-round draft choice means instant
riches. But it also guarantees high expectations and extra
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Some players, such as Chipper Jones and Steve Avery, quickly
live up to the advanced billing. Many don't.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Shumate, 22, was Atlanta's first-round pick in 1994. Now
in his fifth season, the right-hander is still in Class A and has
won four games _ one prior to this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has as good stuff as anyone in this league,'' Macon
pitching coach Mark Ross said. ``But you have to be able to throw
the ball over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumate, 3-4 with a 7.71 ERA, finally is starting to do so after
spending two weeks in June working with special assistant Guy
Hansen at Atlanta's complex in Orlando. Mark Wohlers was part of
some of the same sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel more comfortable,'' said Shumate, who
signed for $500,000 but has averaged nearly two walks per inning in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``With someone who can throw like Shumate, you wait as long as
you can and hope something finally clicks,'' said Paul Snyder, the
Braves' director of scouting and player development.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Cameron, the Braves' first-round pick in 1997, also is at
Macon. In his first full season after signing out of high school
for $825,000, Cameron has committed 59 errors _ the most in the
minors _ and struck out 152 times. Better in the field after being
moved from shortstop to third base at midseason, Cameron is hitting
.214 with 19 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough league to play in when you're 19 and only a
year out of high school,'' Macon manager Brian Snitker said.
``Cameron will be all right. Other players have made a lot of
errors in this league, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, for example. He formerly held the Macon record with 56
errors in 1991.

SAUDI MILLIONAIRE SEEN AS CHIEF SUSPECT IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden declared war quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled in his military training compound in the Afghan
mountains, he calmly presented his holy attack on America as a
matter of fact as machine gunfire crackled outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not differentiate between those dressed in military
uniforms and civilians,'' bin Laden told ABC News in June, in a
rare interview with a Western reporter. ``They are all targets in
this `fatwa,''' or death edict.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, when twin bombs exploded near two United States
Embassies in Africa, that message reverberated throughout the State
Department. Bin Laden was an immediate suspect. And with the arrest
of his alleged associate, Mohammed Sadiq Odeh, the bombing
investigation this week focused squarely on the elusive Saudi
Arabian millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of FBI agents into Africa in the wake of the bombing
was but the latest episode in a much longer relationship between
Western authorities and the secretive 41-year-old, whose mythic
rise to power as the ``godfather'' of the radical Islamic world has
caught the attention of intelligence officials for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   He is already considered an unindicted co-conspirator in the
World Trade Center bombing by US officials. He is believed to be
connected with at least three terrorist attacks in Africa and the
Middle East since 1992. In the last six months, he has issued
increasingly alarming decrees to ``evict the Americans'' from the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as April, during a visit to Afghanistan, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, pleaded with
leaders there to ``keep him under wraps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is vitally concerned with trying to do
something about this man,'' said former Central Intelligence Agency
counterterrorism official Stanley Bedlington. ``This shows just how
justified that concern is,'' referring to the African bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban representative at the United Nations offered only a
tepid response. ``He is our guest, with the understanding that he
is not allowed to intiate any political or military action from our
soil,'' said Noorullah Zadran. ``He has been told that quite
clearly. But we really do not check every single day what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's rhetoric comes from the core of the radical Islamic
movement. He has declared that the United States has ``invaded''
the Holy Land and that Americans are ``the biggest thieves in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   His profile as the ``black sheep'' of a prominent Saudi family
and a rich fanatic bent on war against Western culture from his
mountain retreat in Afghanistan has brought him unusual notoriety,
both within the Islamic world and without.
</P>
<P>
   He was born into extreme wealth, one of more than a dozen sons
of Muhammed bin Laden, a Saudi construction mogul rumored to be
worth as much as $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Osama, the youngest son, attended the King Abdul Aziz School for
Economics and Management. He later inherited his $250 million share
of the family wealth, considered the first step toward pursuing the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   His radical departure from his presumed future began at age 21
when, after hearing reports of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
in 1979, he ``became enraged,'' according to past interviews.
Months later he left to join the resistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the time his mission mirrored that of the United States: Both
were fighting to dislodge the Communists from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But bin Laden kept his distance from American support, according
to Vincent Cannistraro, a former CIA counterterrorism chief.
Instead, he ``established moral leadership,'' as a wealthy Saudi
fighting alongside the beleaguered mujahiddin, said Cannistraro.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia, his loyalties
remained with ``his involvement and his connections to the Islamic
militants,'' Cannistraro continued. When the Gulf War broke out in
1990, his anti-Western sentiments ``exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His sympathies were clearly with Iraq,'' said Arnaud de
Borchgrave, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. ``He felt we had entrapped
Iraq. Osama felt this was a stab in the back, that Saudi Arabia
opened up its country to America's war machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cutler, twice ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s,
said: ``He obviously went off the deep end.''
</P>
<P>
   After lambasting both the United States and Saudi Arabia, bin
Laden retreated to the Sudan in 1991. He used his fortune to
establish a legitimate construction company, US experts said. But
he also summoned allies from the mujahiddin to build his operation
and set up at least three terrorist training camps, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, terrorism shook the region, and bin
Laden's profile rose among the suspects for the following acts:
</P>
<P>
   _In December 1992, two bombs exploded in Yemeni hotels, where
American Marines were stationed on their way to Somalia. One person
was killed, but no Americans were injured.
</P>
<P>
   _In February 1993, a bomb exploded at the World Trade Center in
New York, killing six and injuring more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   _In September 1993, an American Blackhawk helicopter was hit
with a rocket-propelled grenade in Mogadishu, Somalia, killing
three American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   _In November 1995, a car bomb exploded outside a US training
camp in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Five Americans were killed; 30 others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   _In June 1996, a car bomb exploded near a US Air Force complex
near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Nineteen Americans died, and another
160 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, evidence linked the perpetrators to bin Laden or his
training camps, yet bin Laden has taken responsibility for none of
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But in a June meeting with ABC News reporter John Miller, who
trekked across the border from Pakistan for the interview, bin
Laden dramatically heightened his rhetoric by vowing to deliver all
Americans out of Saudi Arabia in ``wooden boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We predict a black day for America,'' bin Laden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi government, responding to similar remarks made
earlier, revoked his citizenship in 1994, and diplomatic pressure
in 1996 forced Sudan to expel him as well. Bin Laden returned to
his last safe haven: Afghanistan. He hides there now under the
protection of the Taliban militia, whose radical religious views
are consistent with his own.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year outside concerns about the bin Laden
operation have increased. According to de Borchgrave, he has
fortified his military camps and communications systems, adopted a
network of laptop computers that transmit heavily encrypted
messages by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In February bin Laden also issued his first official ``fatwa,''
against Americans, according to a State Department official. Three
more followed in the months leading up to the attacks in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US took those threats very seriously,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Richardson's requests that the Taliban work toward Bin
Laden's removal from Afghanistan or at least keep him in check, the
source said, ``The Taliban said they would, and then did not follow
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bin Laden has continued solidifying his umbrella
alliance of international terrorist sects, which now includes
representatives of eight countries from Egypt to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Among those believed to be currently with him in Afghanistan is
the leader of the Egyptian Islamic jihad, the successors to the
group that assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Although bin Laden himself has remained quiet since June, his
Egyptian associate, Ayman Zawaahiri, has spoken to the press in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day before the bombings in Africa, Zawaahiri issued a
chilling warning in the Arabic paper Al-Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in briefly telling the Americans that their
message has been received, and that the response, which we hope
they will read carefully, is being prepared,'' he said. ``Because
we _ with God's help _ will write it in the language they
understand.''

`REAL IRA,' UNDER PRESSURE, CALLS CEASE-FIRE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DUBLIN _ Under unprecedented pressure from the Irish government
and its citizens, the dissident republican group responsible for
the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland this century called a
temporary cease-fire Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire, which the Real IRA said it reached after its
bomb killed 28 people in the market town of Omagh last Saturday,
was greeted with widespread skepticism. It came as the reputed Real
IRA leader, Michael ``Mickey'' McKevitt, and his family endure a
campaign of vilification in Dundalk, the town in the Irish Republic
where they live and run a printing shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said his life was being made impossible,'' said a family
friend, Rev. Desmond Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the printing shop was abruptly closed after
McKevitt's 17-year-old daughter, who works there, was threatened,
according to a family friend. People had been passing the shop,
shouting ``Shame!'' and ``Murderers!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Dundalk are appalled at what happened,'' said
John Woods, who is leading efforts to distance the community from
republican extremists, about the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire, and the public outcry that precipitated it,
could be a turning point in Ireland, where the overwhelming
majority of people in the north and south have endorsed new
political arrangements to end a conflict that has killed more than
3,500 people over the last three decades and poisoned relations
between Britain and Ireland for more than three centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the public pressure on the Real IRA and
McKevitt marks an extraordinary change. For the last 30 years,
extremists from both sides of the political and sectarian divide
have intimidated ordinary people. The prospect of ordinary people
doing the same to someone regarded as the leader of an armed and
ruthless paramilitary organization is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Omagh, who attended some of the funerals of 16 of
the victims held Wednesday, dismissed the cease-fire as a cynical
attempt to deflect public revulsion and police attention. The
British and Irish governments greeted the news skeptically, saying
it would not deter them from hunting down the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Irish premier Bertie Ahern Wednesday night unveiled a package of
what he called ``draconian'' laws aimed at crushing the Real IRA
and other dissident groups opposed to the peace process. Under the
new provisons, which Irish lawmakers are expected to pass in a
special session in two weeks, police could hold suspects for
questioning for up to four days, twice the current limit, while a
suspect's refusal to answer questions would be considered
corroboration of a police officer's opinion that they belonged to
an illegal group.
</P>
<P>
   Irish lawmakers will also be asked to pass a law that would
allow the government to seize the property of anyone who knowingly
allows paramilitary groups to use their home or land as a refuge
for weapons or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Farms in the Irish Republic are frequently used as weapons dumps
and safehouses for those on the run. In a country where farmland
remains in families for generations and is considered an integral
part of the nation's cultural identity, the initiative to seize
property represents a major change in Irish thinking and
demonstrates the government's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   A priest in Dundalk, the border town where McKevitt lives with
his wife, Bernadette Sands, the sister of dead IRA icon Bobby
Sands, and their three children, said that McKevitt told him he had
nothing to do with the bombing. The priest, the Rev. Desmond
Campbell, said the McKevitts had fled their home. But friends of
the family dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday night at the printing shop she runs,
Bernadette Sands declined comment. Earlier, she told Irish national
radio that she condemned the bombing and urged anyone still using
violence to use peaceful means to bring about a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Father Campbell said a distraught Sands telephoned him Tuesday
night, asking, ``What is going to happen to my children?'' Campbell
said Sands collapsed in tears and McKevitt then took the phone and
protested his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was a republican, but that he had no hand in the
bombing,'' said Father Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing, the McKevitts have been the object of a
campaign of shunning and vilification in Dundalk, which
traditionally has been known as a place where republican extremists
hide or settle when wanted by the authorities in Northern Ireland.
Many people in Dundalk object to the portrayal of their town as a
terrorist haven and have begun a campaign aimed at driving the
McKevitts out.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Doogan, a family friend, and with Sands a leader of the
32-County Sovereignty Committee which the authorities claim is the
political wing of the Real IRA, accused the security forces of
using the news media to whip up ``mass hysteria'' against McKevitt
and Sands.
</P>
<P>
   Doogan said Father Campbell ``had condemned them from the
pulpit, and Bernie (Sands) rang him and put it on him. He's putting
their lives in danger.'' Doogan said the family was determined to
stay in their home, despite death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie's in the shop today. I think she's shown immense
courage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doogan said the campaign of vilification is part of a wider
conspiracy targeting the 32-County Sovereignty Committee ``because
we are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt is the reputed former quartermaster of the IRA, meaning
he had responsibility over the IRA's arsenal. Sources close to the
leadership of both the IRA and the IRA's political allies in Sinn
Fein, whose leaders are almost exclusively former IRA members, say
McKevitt was the leader of those who quit the republican movement
last year after an aborted attempt to take it over.
</P>
<P>
   These sources say McKevitt, his wife and a group that consisted
mostly of activists from the Irish Republic, led the dissidents who
quit both the IRA and Sinn Fein in protest over what they saw as a
``selling out'' of the republican ideals of forcing a British
withdrawal from Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, supported by the IRA's ruling Army
Council, has led the republican movement to change from the use of
violence to politics to create a united Ireland. But the hardliners
say Northern Ireland is an illegitimate entity, created against the
wishes of the Irish people who voted in 1919 for an all-island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of republicans consider the dissidents to be
unrealistic, atavistic ideologues, incapable of making the
compromises that were central to the Good Friday agreement which
created new political arrangements in the north and south. But
there was a minority of republicans who supported the group and
believes that violence is still justified. Some contend that
minimal support has shrunk even further after Saturday's bombing,
which the Real IRA blamed on the police for not following its
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the warnings were inaccurate and led them to
unwittingly steer large numbers of people near the hidden bomb
while trying to evacuate an area where they were told the bomb was.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern says the Real IRA has no more than 100 members. He has
vowed ``ruthlessly suppress'' what he calls an unrepresentative
group trying to thwart the democratic wishes of an overwhelming
majority of the Irish people who in May endorsed power sharing and
cross-border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, a former IRA leader who is now a Sinn Fein
politician, said the Real IRA has little support. Speaking in Omagh
after the bombing, Kelly predicted, ``They're finished. They spoke
for few people. Now they speak for none.''

U.S. URGES ALL NON-MUSLIMS TO FLEE AFGHANISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also AFRICA-BOMBING) 
(mk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The U.S. Embassy on Wednesday urged all
non-Muslim foreigners working in neighboring Afghanistan to leave
the country because of fears for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, which compounded the fears and tensions generated
by the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
was based on threats in general, officials said, but was considered
serious enough to be announced here well before dawn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in Cairo Wednesday, a coalition of militant Islamic
organizations threatened further attacks on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coming days will guarantee, God willing, that America will
face a black fate,'' a group calling itself the World Islamic Front
for Holy War Against Jews and Crusaders, said in a statement
published in Al-Hayat, the London-based Arabic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The group is part of a far-reaching network run by Osama bin
Laden, the Islamic militant who has publicly threatened a holy war
against the United States. American officials have said that bin
Laden, who operates from bases in Afghanistan, has been a focus of
the investigation into the bombings from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   A senior non-American diplomat here said Wednesday, ``I can
confirm from non-American and non-Pakistani intelligence that he
was involved in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Taliban, the Islamic movement that now controls
about 90 percent of Afghanistan and is the de facto government
there, denied Wednesday that bin Laden had any role in the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban can assure the world, 100 percent, that Osama bin
Laden is not involved in any subversive activity,'' Mullah Muhammad
Omar of the Taliban told the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect arrested in Pakistan and sent back to Kenya for
interrogation, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, told Pakistani investigators
that the operation was the work of bin Laden. Odeh also told
investigators that in 1993, he was sent to Somalia to carry out
operations against American troops there, The News, a major
English-language newspaper here, reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The troops had been sent by President Bush to protect the
distribution of relief supplies, but got caught up in Somalia's
clan warfare. In the statement to Al-Hayat, the World Islamic Front
for Holy War Against Jews and Crusaders said that the bombings were
a response to the American operation there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two embassies, which the Islamic Army for the Liberation
of Holy Shrines bombed, have supervised the killings of at least
13,000 Somali civilians in the treacherous attack led by America
against this Muslim country,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the statement from the Holy War coalition, Al-Hayat
said it received statements from the Islamic Army for the
Liberation of Holy Shrines.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would ``continue shipping more American dead
bodies to their unjust government,'' and that it sought to
``humiliate America's arrogance and roll its dignity in the mud of
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if these statements were the cause of the
American warning to non-Muslims to leave Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   After the warning was quickly disseminated to expatriate
organizations working in Afghanistan, two Americans left and more
are expected to leave on Thursday, American officials said. There
were 15 to 20 Americans working in Afghanistan for various
nongovernmental organizations, along with some 100 other
expatriates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American officials and representatives from nongovernmental
agencies working in Afghanistan asked that the names of the
organizations not be published because of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations reacted to the warning by suspending all
``non-essential'' programs, such as training health care workers,
said a U.N. spokeswoman here, Sarah Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking anybody out who wants to leave,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has 34 foreign employees working in
Afghanistan, with a variety of agencies, including Unicef and the
World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   The most exposed organization is the International Committee of
the Red Cross, which has about 80 expatriates carrying out their
mission in Afghanistan. Traditionally, the Red Cross has been the
first to enter and the last to leave even the most dangerous
places. For the moment, the expatriates have decided to stay,
though they will take precautions, officials with the organization
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the tension and uncertainty here, one said, ``It
might be different tomorrow.''

 McGWIRE (49), SOSA (48) HOMER AS THE MARIS CHASE SPEEDS UP   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The chase to surpass the home run record in baseball,
perhaps the most storied achievement in American sports, took a
dramatic turn on a sun-sweet Wednesday afternoon in Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Three dramatic turns, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   When Sammy Sosa, the Cubs' galvanic outfielder, lined a home run
into the left-field bleachers in the fifth inning, it was his 48th
home run of the season. It put him into the home run lead of the
big leagues, literally and figuratively passing Mark McGwire, the
Cardinals' first baseman, who appeared impassive as Sosa went into
his home-run trot.
</P>
<P>
   The pair has been jockeying at the top for the last couple of
months, and came into this two-game series which began Tuesday
night tied at 47 homers each. It was the first time since mid-April
that McGwire wasn't the top man in home runs. And it moved Sosa one
step closer to Roger Maris, who is the holder of the record, having
belted 61 homers in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   What was McGwire thinking as Sosa cruised by him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing much really,'' he said. ``Just that Sammy's an awesome
player.''
</P>
<P>
   True or not, McGwire was obviously not about to remain dormant.
</P>
<P>
   And Sosa's home run lead was short-lived. McGwire gave him and
the sellout crowd of 39,689 a charge when he not only homered in
the eighth off Matt Karchner to tie Sosa at 48 homers, but hit it
farther, knocking the ball over the bleachers and onto Waveland
Avenue. And he tied up the game, 6-6, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't finished. In the 10th inning, he lined a shot off
Terry Mulholland that cleared the wall in center field, 400 feet
from home plate, and gave him the homer lead at 49. This also gave
the Cardinals the lead in the ball game, one they did not
relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   This dual pursuit of the home run record has been one of the
better shows in sports in some time, and the fans responded to it,
and to the protagonists, often and loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fans came to this exquisite old ballpark in
anticipation of such fireworks, and the possibility of watching
history in the making, or on the road to being made.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 games left on the Cubs' regular-season schedule, and 38
left for the Cards _ who play the Mets beginning Thursday in a
four-game series, a pair of back-to-back doubleheaders _ the drama
heightens.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire was surely very much aware of what the home run
meant, since the national media, dogging his and Sosa's steps have
not let him forget, as they have matched homer for homer for
several months now.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Sosa lined a shot to left field which
looked like it was a home run to almost everyone in the park,
including Sosa, who observed admiringly on his jog to first base.
Alas, the ball hit about three feet from the top of the wall. John
Mabry fielded it, whirled and threw cleanly to second where Sosa,
who realized he'd better start running, was out by so large a
margin he didn't even commit a slide.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa did hit it out of the park, off Kent Bottenfield, it
was his second home run trot of the game, and by far his most
effective. When Sosa returned to the dugout he was cheered so
enthusiastically that he emerged out of the dugout for a curtain
call. He waved his cap, then retreated onto the bench where he
celebrated by pouring a cup of water over his sweaty head.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came to bat in the next inning, exciting the multitude
ever more. Could McGwire answer blow for blow? The crowd treated
McGwire to a loud but mixed bag of cheers, boos and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had loaded the bases with two outs, and were
behind 6-2. Riggleman replaced his starter, Clark, with
right-handed reliever Terry Adams. When Adams got a called strike
on McGwire, the fans cheered. But a passed ball allowed in a run,
sent runners to second and third and left first base open, with a
2-2 count. Adams walked him, which was the sensible thing to do
under the circumstances. The boos cascaded from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The game began for the sluggers with McGwire hitting a towering
fly ball to left field, which Henry Rodriguez caught with his back
against the ivied wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa struck out looking in his first at-bat. In the third
inning, McGwire popped out to third base.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire was walked on a 3-2 pitch in the fifth inning, boos
rang from some precincts of Wrigley Field. Fans want to see the
march to history, and feel deprived when the slugger is not
permitted to swing _ sluggers, actually, because when Sosa and Ken
Griffey Jr., the other contenders for the record, are walked in
enemy ballparks, the home-team pitchers are routinely being booed.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Croushore got the same medicine when he walked Sosa in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   What did McGwire and Sosa talk about on first base? ``We talked
about building a golf course together,'' McGwire said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is equally coy about what the homer record means to him.
``Our team is in the middle of a pennant race,'' said Sosa. ``If we
won and I didn't hit a home run I would be more satisfied than I am
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was Sosa thinking in right field when McGwire passed
him with his 49th home run. ``I'm thinking, `He's the man,''' said
Sosa, who has been saying for months that he is rooting for McGwire
to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Sosa and McGwire collectively went 0-for-9 and
struck out six times. Perhaps a little breeze toward the outfield
didn't hurt, and maybe some of the pressure was off just a bit,
since the two may have released some of it the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was a thrilling one, with the Cubs loading the
bases in the bottom of the 10th, before Manny Alexander popped to
second base to end the game and give the Cardinals an 8-6 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cardinals, who are out of the flag race, the joy of
knocking off the Cubs, a wild-card contender, was pleasurable,
along with sharing McGwire's return to the lead in the homer race.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that home runs were also hit in the game by
four other players, Henry Rodriguez and Jose Hernandez of the Cubs,
and Delino DeShields and Ray Lankford of the Cards. But no one's
paying much attention to that.

ASIA CRISIS CUTTING INTO CHIP MAKER PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: budgeted earlier as LSI-OUTLOOK) 
(nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two computer chip makers said Wednesday that
they expected sharply lower quarterly results because of Asia's
economic crisis, and a third said its quarterly net earnings fell
81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings from LSI Logic and National Semiconductor, coupled
with the results from Analog Devices Inc., suggested that any talk
of a recovery in the chip manufacturing industry might be
premature. Chip companies are finding that they are much more
vulnerable to Asia's problems than they had thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like Asia happens, it doesn't really matter how
good your products are or how well managed your company is, you're
going to feel it,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen &AMP;
Company.
</P>
<P>
   LSI, based in Milpitas, Calif., specializes in custom
semiconductors and so-called system-on-a-chip devices used in
products ranging from networking equipment to video game players.
Analog Devices, of Norwood, Mass., makes chips that combine analog
and digital signals, which are commonly used in cellular
telephones, modems and small appliances. National Semiconductor,
based in Santa Clara, Calif., straddles the two other companies'
chip lines.
</P>
<P>
   LSI and Analog both attributed their revenue and earnings
situations largely to Asia. National Semiconductor cited weakness
in overall semiconductor demand, but has singled out the Asian
crisis before.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of LSI Logic closed Wednesday at $15.8125, down $2.4375,
or 13 percent, while shares in Analog Devices dropped $2.75, or 11
percent, to $21.50, both on the New York Stock Exchange. National
made its announcement after the market closed; its shares finished
down 56.25 cents, at $13.625, also on the Big Board.

   LSI's announcement marked the second time in a month that it had
warned investors about financial results. While Analog Devices had
warned of a weak quarter, its results came in below most analysts'
revised estimates. National has disappointed analysts the last two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices said revenue from its analog integrated circuits
had declined for the first time in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended on Aug. 1, Analog earned $8.8
million, or 6 cents a diluted share, compared with $46 million, or
27 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter 1998 earnings
include a $17 million restructuring charge and a $3.6 million
equity loss, equivalent to 9 cents a share. Revenue dropped 7
percent to $294.9 million from $318.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Analog Devices to report earnings of 19
cents a share, excluding the charges.

<P>
   ``We are part of an industry that began 1998 with an expectation
of 15 percent year-over-year revenue growth, only to see that
expectation reduced every month since then,'' Jerald G. Fishman,
Analog's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
``Currently, the industry expects to finish 1998 down 10 percent
from the previous year.'' He said the company still expected to
grow 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because that expectation is far below original estimates of 20
percent growth, Analog has started cutting its work force by 5
percent, resulting in the restructuring charge. It is also planning
a series of factory shutdowns during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   LSI's earlier guidance had been to expect flat revenue and
earnings per share in the third quarter. But it said Wednesday that
unexpectedly low orders in the first six weeks of the third quarter
would result in a 5 percent to 10 percent decline in revenue and
that earnings per share would be in the ``low-to-mid teens.''
Analysts had expected 23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slowdown of the global semiconductor industry is now
completing its third year, which is the longest slow period
experienced in this industry,'' Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI Logic's
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.``We expect
supply and demand to come together in the next 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   National said sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter,
which will end on Aug. 30, and second quarter, ending on Nov. 29,
might fall below the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, which ended in
May. Excluding one-time charges, National had a loss of $69.3
million on sales of $510 million in that quarter. The company said
it now expected sales for the first quarter to drop 8 to 10
percent, with a resulting larger loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of a very narrow area, semiconductor demand remains
very depressed and at this time there are no data points to suggest
that will change this year,'' Peck of Cowen said. ``These companies
are fairly good representatives of what is going on in the industry
as a whole, and that's not anything good right now.''

ANALYSIS: WHITE HOUSE PLACING HOPE ON PUBLIC SENTIMENT TO `MOVE
ON'
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-VINEYARD, CLINTON-HEARTLAND,

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside Washington, pundits and editorial writers
rail on about a destroyed presidency. Republicans whisper, some
loudly, about impeachment hearings or resignation. Some Democrats
are putting distance between themselves and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Washington, most people tell pollsters that they are
tired of hearing about Monica Lewinsky. They want the country to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   It is that schism between the real world and the self-styled
political elites that White House officials say is their best hope
for Clinton to withstand the Lewinsky debacle. They figure that
members of Congress, ever mindful of popular sentiment, will not
want to prolong an unpopular inquiry or press for impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly similar to the '95 State of the Union,'' said
one of Clinton's closest aides, referring to how the president's
interminable address that year was panned by pundits but won raves
from ordinary Americans. ``Reaction inside the Beltway is quite
different from out in America. I think on the numbers, we should be
encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while it may take days, or even weeks to shake out,
initial polls show that, overwhelmingly, people want the country to
put the sex scandal behind it, even if they are disappointed in
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials are not gleeful.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some of the president's advisers expressed concern
that Clinton's address on Monday only enraged many of the elites,
who thought he was too combative and not adequately contrite. That
opens the possibility that days of scathing commentary from
Washington insiders _ and snippets on television of Clinton lying
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky _ will finally penetrate
the public's hitherto intense resistance to examine the tawdry
details and cause Americans to rebel against the president and his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger for the president is that members of Congress do
not always take their orders from the latest opinion surveys.
Sometimes they lead, though it has proven easier for them to block
measures that the public wants than to initiate laws against the
will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, for example, Congress reinstated the draft, despite
widespread isolationist sentiment in the country. The Senate
ratified the Panama Canal Treaty in 1978 in the face of vociferous
public opposition. And if lawmakers responded only to the polls,
tougher gun control and campaign finance laws would be on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Republicans are calling on their colleagues to
ignore the polls. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma said that once
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, sends a report
to Congress, then it will be time for Congress to make a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that time comes,'' Inhofe said, ``it will be important
for members of Congress to put aside the public opinion polls and
remember their ultimate duty to protect the Constitution and
preserve the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The critical question for the White House is how many lawmakers
will take Inhofe's position. For now, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and some of his colleagues are taking a wait-and-see approach,
waiting for more follow-up polls, and for Starr's report. Their
calculation is that Clinton has messed things up already without
their help, and that it would be better for Republicans not to be
viewed as having egged it on if the impeachment process goes
forward.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the harsh remarks this week by some of Clinton's
most loyal allies, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California,
some Democrats may be unwilling to help push the scandal aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave a speech that in my opinion should have been given
six-and-a-half months ago,'' said Rep. Jim Maloney, D-Conn. ``The
American people were entitled to the truth six-and-a-half months
ago.'' Calling Clinton's behavior ``reprehensible,'' he said
Congress should wait and see what Starr's report says. ``To fulfill
our duties,'' he said, ``that's what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Wisconsin, said Clinton should not assume that
members of Congress will stick with him if his job approval ratings
stay high. For lawmakers, he said, a president's approval rating
``is such a general indicator, and not a very clear indicator, of
awards or punishments for them at election time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The great imponderable for dealing with any of this
is Starr's report. You can't imagine that public opinion is going
to stay the same in the face of new information.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House has moved aggressively to build, or
at least hold on to, political support beyond Washington insiders.
In the events surrounding his grand jury testimony, Clinton was
clearly playing to the Democratic base: Women who are sympathetic
to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and blacks who noted that the Rev. Jesse
Jackson played a pivotal role in consoling the Clintons over the
weekend. And the second half of Clinton's public address was
clearly intended to embolden Democrats who think Starr is on an
unbridled partisan vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later, one side will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either elites will shape public opinion over the next several
months and bring the public to the view that the president must
go,'' said Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the Brookings
Institution here, ``or the elites will discover the wisdom of the
public's continued support of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the Democrats who this week scolded Clinton for his
personal behavior and for deceiving the nation sounded like they
were reading the polls when they laced their comments with pleas
for the country to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polling has indicated that two-thirds of the American people
now just want to get this whole thing behind us,'' said Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, ``and get on with the very important domestic and
international matters that directly affect every family in the
country. I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., derided Clinton's behavior as
``inappropriate, irresponsible, reckless.'' But, she added, ``In
traveling around my district, the feeling by an overwhelming
majority is: Let's go on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, many Republicans in particular have made clear that
they do not want to go on with it.
</P>
<P>
   Told that his call for Clinton's resignation seemed at odds with
the polls, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip in the House,
said on Wednesday evening: ``What matters is right and wrong. I
think, frankly, the polls are a joke.''

ADVERTISING: NOT SO HAUTE COUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is high fashion trying to speak to the masses? Flip through the
September issues of fashion magazines, and there appears to be a
subtle shift in the sensibility of fashion advertisers this fall
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion advertising _ especially in the all-important fall
season, a sort of Christmas for publishers of such magazines _ has
almost exclusively used images of fantasy. But there are signs that
fashion is trying to add a little realism.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few trendlets noted in advertisements in the
September issues of Elle, Marie Claire and Vogue:
</P>
<P>
   REAL PEOPLE: The most obvious way to connect a product to its
potential buyer is to show people who look as if they might
actually use it. While this theory works for soap and soda, fashion
has rarely bought into it. The idea instead is generally to create
a world where an 87-pound woman appears to be mildly distressed by
the great many men who pursue her in her high-end dress.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, real women populate the ads. Anne Klein's
campaign features a dancer, a venture capitalist, a radiologist and
a mother among other women who do not model professionally. The
fall Dockers campaign for Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. relies on women in
film, like the actress Rosie Perez, and an advertisement for Timex
watches features the faces of three sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan's fall campaign uses professional models, but one of
them is older than 40 and no longer works regularly. The press
release for Calvin Klein's new ad for a men's fragrance boasts that
the model is a father of three and hints that the fact he is
drop-dead gorgeous and pitches in at home makes him, to use Klein's
favorite buzzword, very ``modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Klein pioneered the reality effect with his earlier
advertisements that featured unscrubbed, anti-model characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put model, a fantasy and fashion all together, it can
get to be too overpowering,'' said Tom Julian, a trend analyst for
Fallon McElligott's New York office. ``The fashion industry has
started to realize that if you make fashion acceptable on all
levels, you get more people to buy in.''
</P>
<P>
   BLACK AND WHITE ALL OVER: There are so many black-and-white
advertisements in the fall magazines they almost resemble
newspapers. In the 568 pages of Elle, 26 fashion houses use
black-and-white photography for their fall campaigns, or nearly
half the fashion ads. From Calvin Klein to Halston to Gucci to
Eileen Fisher, the color of newsprint is throughout.
</P>
<P>
   True, fall's palette _ grays, dark greens and beige _ lends
itself to black and white. But many of these ads resemble a
documentary. The photos tie together a narrative seemingly plucked
from real life, as in the Ralph Lauren advertisements for the
Romance fragrance line, which features four distinct images of a
couple falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and white does seem to be the color of the moment in
fashion ads,'' said Donny Deutsch, chairman and chief executive of
Deutsch Inc. in New York. ``Black and white stand for reality,
which is ironic because life of course is not in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   BABY AS ACCESSORY: Fashion rarely evokes family life: Sippy
cups, bath time and play dates are hardly the stuff of a Seventh
Avenue fantasy. This season, however, it seems that babies are as
important as the right handbag. Elle, Vogue and Marie Claire all
feature cute babies in their fashion editorial pages, egged on, its
seems, by Isaac Mizrahi, who recently featured rain slickers and
evening gowns with matching baby carriers in his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director, said her magazine's
decision to run an entire photo feature titled ``Insouciant au
pair'' was inspired by current fashion trends and baby adoration
among her readers. ``There was a feeling this fall in fashion that
was very schoolgirl-like, a fresh innocence, from pleated skirts to
flat shoes,'' Ms. Hopper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is also a sort of intimacy that is very in for fall,
and babies connect up with that. Baby boomers are still having
babies, and fashion is sort of returning to family values, with all
its hope for the future and good feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian of Fallon McElligott said: ``In the '80s, it was the dog.
In the '90s, it is the wedding ring and the children. It makes a
customer think, `Oh, this fits into my life.' There is a certain
reality factor there, and it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are only so many reality factors that a reader
of fashion magazines can take. A Bergdorf Goodman advertisement
features a woman in a Guy Laroche dress and coat, walking a llama
down a New York sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to position ourselves as a little less serious,''
said Michael Calman, senior vice president of marketing for the
retailer, a unit of the Neiman Marcus Group. ``We want to show we
can appeal to a younger audience, and that is generally not how we
are perceived.''

COMMENTARY: CLINTON ON THE WIRE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one is ever better on the high wire,'' said former White
House press secretary Dee Dee Myers in a television appearance
before Bill Clinton's address to the nation on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems is that the president takes so many people
up on the high wire with him. If he falls it's a catastrophe. On
Monday night, not long after Ms. Myers' comment, Clinton lost his
balance. But he didn't fall. His performance is shakier than ever,
but he's still up there.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why the president feels the need to take such
foolish risks in the first place, risks that put him and so many
others in jeopardy. Is it all a game? Or is it a kind of sickness?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a chance to climb down from the wire on Monday. The
public has made it overwhelmingly clear that it is sick of the
sordid Lewinsky melodrama. The Republicans in Congress have no
stomach for impeachment, and there has been no evidence disclosed
as yet that would warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
offered Clinton an out and practically begged him to take it. In an
appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' early this month, Hatch
said: ``If he comes forth and tells it and does it in the right way
and there aren't a lot of other factors to cause the Congress to
say, `This man is unfit for the presidency and should be
impeached,' then I think the president would have a reasonable
chance of getting through this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think the American people would breathe a sigh of
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a serious olive branch. It should not have been
difficult to accept. Close friends and aides to Clinton, finally
aware, like most Americans, that the president had been lying all
along, were saying the same thing. They urged him to help put the
matter to rest by telling the full truth and offering a sincere
apology to the nation for the grief and the harm he had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wobbling on the swaying wire, shook his head. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on television and offered defiance where so many had
hoped to see contrition. He never admitted that he had lied at all.
He never apologized. And he angrily attacked Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel. Starr is certainly vulnerable to
attack, but most of Clinton's advisers felt that Monday night's
address to the nation was not the place to do it. All you had to do
was look at Senator Hatch's response to the president's four-minute
speech to see why they felt as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just gonna blow my stack,'' said Hatch on NBC. Change the
channel. ``I'm just gonna blow my cork,'' said Hatch on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not helped to put the matter to rest. The sense of
betrayal among the president's supporters, which was inevitable, is
mixed with the horrifying suspicion that he is in no way
remorseful, that he couldn't care less about the friends and the
aides who put their credibility on the line for him, the colleagues
whose legal bills in some cases have left them close to bankruptcy,
the ardent followers whose trust he has squandered like a
compulsive gambler feeding borrowed money into a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   The president remained silent for more than half a year,
allowing people who cared deeply about him to submerge their
reputations in his lies. And, true to a decades-long pattern, he
would still be promoting those lies and playing the American people
for fools if he hadn't been confronted by what appears to be a
mountain of virtually irrefutable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval ratings remain extremely high. The public
does not want him to resign or be impeached. Among other things, it
does not want Kenneth Starr deciding who will be president.
</P>
<P>
   The high poll ratings may actually encourage in Clinton a giddy
sense that he can get away with anything. Behind the numbers,
however, is the widespread realization that this is a man who has
disgraced himself and his office and who cannot be trusted, even by
his closest friends. That view will be reinforced by each new and
dismaying revelation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a story that can be wished away. When the president
has a problem we all have a problem. We are all on the high wire
with him.

BRUINS BRIM WITH GREATER EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The freshmen reported Monday. The veterans arrive
this morning, and Saturday the UCLA Bruins begin their third
training camp under coach Bob Toledo _ one that differs from its
predecessors in attitude and expectation, if not personnel.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1989, UCLA is a preseason top-10 team.
And for the first time in the Toledo era, the No. 7 Bruins
seemingly have more answers than questions.
</P>
<P>
   They have a Heisman Trophy candidate at quarterback and an
established offensive system. They have a heralded freshmen class
expected to produce several impact players. Their schedule is
challenging but not overwhelming. Their health is good.
Summer-school grades are due Friday, but Toledo said he does not
expect any problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will practice twice Saturday at Spaulding Field,
beginning a grueling stretch of 23 workouts in 15 days. Toledo's
points of emphasis will include:
</P>
<P>
   __ Evaluate the young defense. The Bruins have just four
returning starters and a new system under first-year coordinator
Nick Aliotti. In contrast to Rocky Long's unconventional 3-3-5
scheme, Aliotti will implement a traditional 3-4 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to reintroduce them to (the defense),'' he said. ``It
was taught during the spring, so their recall ought to be pretty
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two players, outside linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo and
strong safety Larry Atkins, are established. With a large freshman
class and so many starting spots in doubt, the Bruins will
scrimmage more than training camps past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have some 10-play scrimmages with the young guys to see
which of them can help us,'' Toledo said. ``That's the only way to
find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo and Aliotti will pay particular attention to the
defensive line, where junior Pete Holland and sophomore Kenyon
Coleman are the ``veterans,'' and to free safety, where Eric
Whitfield, Tod McBride and Jason Stephens are competing to replace
Shaun Williams.
</P>
<P>
   __ Find some scorers. While much of the offense returns, the
Bruins must replace tailback Skip Hicks and receiver Jim McElroy,
who combined for 37 of UCLA's 60 touchdowns last season.
</P>
<P>
   There are several talented receivers of varying experience _
Danny Farmer, Brad Melsby, Brian Poli-Dixon, Freddie Mitchell, Cody
Joyce _ and tight end, for the second year in a row, is the team's
deepest position.
</P>
<P>
   But tailback is a concern. Jermaine Lewis, Keith Brown and
freshman DeShaun Foster will compete for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if one came forward,'' offensive coordinator
Al Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Identify the best freshmen. Together, they were considered
the nation's No. 1 recruiting class. But beginning Saturday, their
paths diverge. A handful figure to contribute immediately. Most
will redshirt. Attrition might claim a few.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is seven or eight will play this season: Foster,
for sure; at least one offensive lineman (probably Mike Saffer); at
least one defensive lineman (perhaps Ken Kocher); linebacker Robert
Thomas, a potential starter, and defensive back Lovell Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also have two junior college transfers, offensive
lineman James Ghezzi and tight end Randy Hakes. Ghezzi is expected
to join the rotation immediately.

guided a V-formation of lesser candidates across a sun-crisped lawn
in a section of town called Idiots Hill, so named, residents
explained, because it was once so far from downtown that people
thought only an idiot would live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for governor against George Bush,'' Mauro, 50,
said when Dan Leavitt came to the front door. ``I'll beat that guy
if you'll help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, the state land commissioner and Democratic nominee for
governor, stood there in a red tie, khaki pants and blue
button-down shirt, his back a Rorschach test of perspiration. In
his left hand was a leaflet and a bumper sticker, in his right a
rubber mallet for hammering yard signs into the baked ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've knocked personally on nearly 7,000 doors and my
supporters have hit more than 300,000,'' Mauro told Leavitt. ``This
is my 73rd neighborhood walk, maybe 74th, I can't remember anymore.
We're going to hit a million doors by Labor Day and that's just the
beginning. I'm going to win this election car by car, house by
house, neighborhood by neighborhood. Can I put a bumper sticker on
your car? How about a sign in your yard?''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt thought that, no, that would not be such a good idea,
but he promised to keep an open mind. ``Fair enough,'' Mauro said,
turned and stalked up the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty strong Bush supporter,'' said Leavitt, a
Christian religious counselor, after the candidates had left. ``My
big thing is issues of morality, and the governor stands for more
of what I consider family values. But I do appreciate him coming
here.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Garry Mauro is in an uphill struggle
against an enormously popular incumbent who is, not incidentally,
also often mentioned as one of the Republican Party's front-runners
for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent non-partisan Texas Poll, released in
mid-June, Gov. George W. Bush led Mauro 70 percent to 17 percent.
Mauro challenged the validity of those figures and said his own
surveys, which were being conducted by Mark Penn, one of President
Clinton's pollsters, showed him trailing by only 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans are not focusing on the governor's race yet,'' Mauro
said. ``They're more interested in the hot weather than they are in
the hot governor's race. Once they start paying attention, in late
September or early October, and realize that we are right on the
issues, the numbers are going to begin to shift.''
</P>
<P>
   At every meeting and on every doorstep, Mauro punches the four
campaign points that came out of six months of research, mall
surveys, focus groups and polling that preceded his announcement of
candidacy Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said his ``Texas Families First'' campaign favors a
$5,000-$6,000 raise for the state's public school teachers and an
infusion of $2 billion in state funds to build more classrooms, an
end to the sales tax on cars, trucks and vans, a Patients' Bill of
Rights to guarantee some degree of doctor choice for those in
health maintenance organizations and an infusion of state funds to
put 10,000 more police officers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his television campaign last week with a pair of
commercials _ one stressing ethics and accountability, the other
promising a commitment to public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have our share of 30-second TV commercials,'' Mauro
said. ``But we won't put them on until the last four or five weeks
of the campaign. Until then, we're going to go door to door. I
truly believe that there is magic in knocking on doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mauro worked with Bill Clinton on George McGovern's
presidential campaign in Texas in 1972 and also has a close
relationship with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, some have wondered whether he might be undertaking a suicide
mission to try to inflict damage to one of Gore's potential
opponents in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro said he is in the race because Bush can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that Bush has a glass jaw,'' he said. ``Among
Texas voters, there is no real loyalty to him, no real
understanding of who he is. I truly believe that 10 to 15 percent
of the population thinks that his father is the governor.'' Bush is
the son of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he said, Texas' surging economy has built a $7
billion state budget surplus, which could well grow to $10 billion
if trends continue. Now, he said, is the time to use that money to
reshape the state. ``I really believe that this is a historic,
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' he said. ``Being elected governor
this year is really going to mean something. I had to run. It was
too ripe an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Rogers, Mauro's campaign manager, acknowledged that the
campaign has received advice and encouragement from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the vice president and the first lady have been
extremely helpful to this campaign,'' he said. ``President Clinton
hosted a fund-raiser recently in Washington. Gore hosted one in El
Paso. The first lady came to Texas in February. The help we've
received has been tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've received no money from the national party and only
some from the Congressional Campaign Committee,'' Rogers said.
``About 98 percent of our money has been raised in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   As of the last reporting period, in June, the Mauro campaign had
raised about $4 million, the Bush campaign more than $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, Rogers said. Texas has a history of upsets in
races for governor, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Democrat Mark White came from behind to beat Republican
incumbent Gov. William Clements. In 1990, Democrat Ann Richards was
trailing incumbent Republican Gov. Clayton Williams by 33 points in
the summer. ``There was never an independent poll that showed Ann
ahead, never, and she won that race,'' Rogers said. And then, of
course, Bush upset Ms. Richards in 1994 ``even though she was ahead
in the polls until the very last week of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   In campaign speeches, Mauro rails against ``Austin insiders'' in
the state capital and stresses his own Texas roots and middle-class
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of us had the opportunity to go to a Connecticut
boarding school or to Yale University like Gov. Bush,'' he told a
small gathering in Cleburne last week. ``I went to high school in
Waco and to Texas A&AMP;M _ that's right, I'm an Aggie _ and I know
what ordinary Texans think. George Bush is a nice guy, but he's
like his father. He's just a little out of touch with ordinary
Texans.'' (The term ``Aggie'' refers to a student or graduate of
Texas A&AMP;M, which in some eyes involves a stereotypical lack of
sophistication.)
</P>
<P>
   Members of Mauro's team say they believe that Bush's campaign,
basking in national media attention, has become cocky and
complacent and may be providing them a much-needed opening.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor
``is taking nothing for granted. This is evidenced by the fact that
he still meets with hundreds of Texans every week. He is traveling
all over the state. Four days this week he's been traveling,
talking to Texans. There's nothing complacent about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's re-election committee will happily provide a list of the
108 Democratic officeholders who have endorsed the Republican
incumbent over Mauro, including the retiring lieutenant governor,
Bob Bullock, once Mauro's employer and the godfather of one of his
two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot said about Democratic officials supporting
George Bush,'' Mauro told supporters in Granbury last week. ``Well,
there are 3,300 Democratic officials in Texas and he's got the
support of 105 or so of them. I'm an Aggie, but even I know that he
can have 105 if I can keep 3,200.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun was already set to broil in a cloudless sky when Mauro
made his way up to yet another doorstep, this time one in a small,
working-class subdivision in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw you on TV last night,'' Angela Wineinger said as one of
her three children peered around the doorframe. ``I told my husband
that if you knocked on our door I was going to vote for you.''
Mauro beamed. There had been some good coverage on the local
station the night before, and several residents had mentioned it.
The welcomes had been warmer, and already the block was flecked
with Mauro yard signs and bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bush, I guess,'' Ms. Wineinger said after the candidate
had left. ``I've heard a lot about him. But I think it's impressive
that Mauro came to my neighborhood. That really impresses me. I'm
going to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro slid into the back seat of his campaign car and slammed
down half a bottle of icy mineral water. A good morning, he said,
but he was disappointed by the lack of television cameras for the
neighborhood walk. A campaign workers explained the problem: Every
camera in town had been sent out to the Dallas Cowboys' training
facility in town.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro finished off the water. ``We can beat George Bush,'' he
said, ``But we can't beat the Dallas Cowboys.''

CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES FLOODED WITH CALLS ABOUT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Telephones have been ringing incessantly on Capitol
Hill since Monday, as many hundreds of angry callers have flooded
congressional offices with opinions _ often rather loud ones _
about President Clinton, congressional staffers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers' offices report as many as 200 calls a day _ some
callers asking for the president's impeachment or resignation,
others saying leave the man alone already _ in response to
Clinton's confession of an inappropriate relationship with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Republican senators' and representatives'
staffers were particularly eager to discuss the calls pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are outraged. They're upset that the president lied in
the first place, and many want him impeached,'' said a staff member
for Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham's Washington office has received more than 200 calls
since Monday night, and another 200 callers have reached the
senator's Michigan offices. Most callers have suggested Clinton
should be impeached or resign, the staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional staffers, who requested anonymity for
themselves and the lawmakers they work for, reported between 100
and 200 calls daily about the president's speech concerning his
relationship with the former White House intern. Still more said
they received a dozen to 50 calls a day. Letters, e-mail,
telegrams, and faxes also have rolled in.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sullivan, press secretary for Representative Ron Paul, a
Texas Republican, said his office has taken between 100 and 150
calls daily, most critical of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been near unanimous in terms of the calls and e-mail,
with people saying to get rid of the guy, get him out of office,
impeach him,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers for Democrats were more tight-lipped about calls coming
in, but those who would speak said they did not have as many calls
about Clinton as Republicans had.
</P>
<P>
   Many such staffers reported about 50 calls a day, with about
half supporting the president and half wanting him removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   David Williams, chief of staff for Representative John Tierney,
the Massachusetts Democrat, said the office has fielded only about
25 calls about Clinton, and opinions ``run the gamut.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the 30 calls to the office of Representative
Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the president
should resign or be impeached, said spokesman Bill McCann. McCann
pointed out that many of the callers were not from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some calls are kind of vulgar. Most are yelling,'' McCann
said. ``You get the sense that these people really have a very deep
resentment for President Clinton that, if anything, has increased
with this situation but was more than likely there before anyway.''

AUTHORITIES CRACK DOWN ON BROKERS WHO `FLIPPED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Securities authorities sought Wednesday to shut down
the Boston office of Joseph Charles &AMP; Associates and revoke the
licenses of two of the firm's brokers for ignoring their clients'
requests to sell stocks in order to increase their own commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the firm's ``flipping'' policy, brokers don't receive
sales commissions when customers buy shares in initial public
offerings and then sell them quickly for profit.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed by the Massachusetts Secretary of
the Commonwealth's securities division, the policy at Joseph
Charles ``encouraged its Agents to engage in unethical and
dishonest as well as fraudulent conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Broker Christopher Esposito illegally cold-called investors,
placed unauthorized trades, misrepresented facts, and failed to
honor investors' wishes to sell securities, according to the
complaint. Esposito's boss, Michael Ferraro, also named in the
complaint, allegedly promoted the illegal activity and failed to
reasonably supervise the broker.
</P>
<P>
   In one case outlined in the filing, Esposito bought 4,000 shares
for a customer, James Smith, who claimed to have wanted only 2,000
shares. When the customer discovered the error, he immediately
called Esposito and ordered him to sell the extra stock. Esposito
refused, the complaint alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks, Smith allegedly called repeatedly, but
Esposito refused to take his calls. The customer finally faxed the
brokerage asking ``any authorized trader'' to sell the stock.
Esposito said, ``It's all taken care of. I sold your stock,''
according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he'd only sold half the stock, the complaint alleges.
When Smith discovered that fact, he again repeatedly called
Esposito, but the broker refused to come to the phone. Only after
someone else at the firm mediated a conversation between Esposito
and Smith were the remaining shares sold.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito _ who had been the subject of six prior customer
complaints for misrepresenting facts, churning, and making
unsuitable recommendations _ last year signed a consent order with
state securities regulators agreeing not to violate securities
rules again.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's filing calls for an administrative hearing to review
whether Esposito violated the terms of that order.

SURVEY FINDS LAYOFFS SLOWED IN LAST 3 YEARS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most comprehensive survey of permanent layoffs in America
finds that in the last three years, a smaller percentage of workers
were downsized than in any other period in this decade. But the
layoff rate is still significantly higher than in the 1980s, and
women now get pink slips almost as often as men.
</P>
<P>
   These were two major findings in Wednesday's release of the
latest job displacement survey from the Labor Department, covering
the years 1995 through 1997. Eight million people were pushed out
of their jobs involuntarily, or one out of every 15 adult
jobholders. That was down from 8.4 million in the previous
three-year period, or 1 in 12 workers, the decade's worst
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing the normal cyclical behavior of the labor force
reflected in these numbers,'' Henry Farber, a Princeton economist,
said of the strong economic growth in 1996 and 1997 and the falling
unemployment rate. ``The puzzle is why has it taken so long to get
the layoff rate down this far and why is it not even lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Downsizing is still occurring at a greater rate than in the late
1980s, the last time an economic expansion had lasted as long as
the current one. Then the displacement rate was 1 out of every 18
jobholders 20 years old and over.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics began its
biennial ``job displacement'' surveys in 1984, when widespread
permanent layoffs were just becoming an issue. Those surveys found
that downsizing fell back quickly after the 1981-1982 recession.
The 1990s were different. Permanent layoffs rose in the 1990-1991
recession and then failed to fall back. They even kept rising
despite the recovery. The pattern remains the same when the Labor
Department's figures are adjusted, through the use of a moving
average, to reconcile overlapping annual numbers from different
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Labor economists offer various explanations for the persistent
downsizing. The phenomenon spread in the 1990s from blue-collar to
white-collar workers, and from manufacturing to service industries.
Growing competition has also played a role, and so have corporate
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``American companies are much more concerned than in the past
about labor fat in their organizations,'' said Jared Bernstein, a
labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
``Some of that has to do with a heightened emphasis on short-term
profits, achieved in part through labor-cost cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the latest survey brought a bright side. While layoffs
have risen among white-collar workers and women, job losers found
themselves re-employed quickly. Seventy-six percent of the 2.4
million full-time workers laid off in the latest three-year period
found themselves re-employed in full-time jobs by the time of the
survey, which was conducted last February. The rest were still
among the unemployed or had dropped out of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   But that 76 percent was up from 72 percent in the mid-1990s and
69.6 percent in the late 1980s. What is more, the median period
between jobs fell to 4.1 weeks from 5.1 in the 1993-1995 period,
and 6.1 weeks in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   When part-timers are added to the mix, then the rate of
re-employment falls and the average wage for those who are
re-employed also falls. It is 10 percent or more below the earnings
in the old job, according to a recent study by Farber. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics does not include such data in the published
results of its surveys. But among the full-timers who were
re-employed in full-time jobs, 55 percent earned as much or more in
their new jobs as they had in their old ones, the bureau said. That
was up from 48 percent in the previous survey, but down from 60
percent in the late 1980s, also boom years.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, seeking to highlight its assistance
programs for dislocated workers, focused on the 24 percent of
full-time workers who were re-employed in full-time jobs by the
time of the survey, but in jobs with salaries that were 20 percent
or more below their old wages.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``why the department's programs and grants to assist
dislocated workers are so important,'' Secretary of Labor Alexis
Herman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics also compiles job displacement
numbers for people laid off after having held jobs for three or
more years, a figure that most labor economists consider less
important than the broader category. The trend for the
longer-tenured jobholders was roughly the same, although the
decline sharper _ 3.6 million displaced workers in the 1995-1997
period, compared with 4.2 million in the 1993-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey also documented trends in downsizing that have
characterized the 1990s. The job loss rate for women is now nearly
as high as the one for men: 6.5 percent of all adult women employed
versus 6.7 percent for men. Whites, blacks and Hispanics are also
gradually converging, with the white displacement rate at 6.1
percent in the latest survey, blacks at 7.1 percent and Hispanics
at 8.8 percent. The spread was twice as great in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And since the last survey, in 1996, the layoff rate among
manufacturing workers has declined slightly, while that for service
workers has edged up, continuing trends that go back to the 1980s,
when they were much more pronounced. Still, blue-collar workers are
more likely to be laid off, with 1 of every 20 blue-collar workers
losing jobs in the latest three-year period, compared with 1 in
every 22 white-collar workers.

BODY FOUND IN CONCRETE MAY BE MISSING WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.C.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There is a final photograph of Kimberly Magnarelli in
her final hour: dressed in a dark party dress, standing with her
live-in boyfriend at the UMass prom.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was taken May 22, eight days before the graduation
ceremonies that Magnarelli had worked toward for eight years. Now
the snapshot is a crucial piece of evidence in a gruesome murder
case that apparently began that very night, when Magnarelli was
seen alive for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip Wednesday, police discovered what appears to be
the body of the college senior, wrapped in black plastic and sealed
in concrete steps beneath her Holbrook, Mass. home. State police
detectives are now on a hunt for her boyfriend, Heath W. Saffores,
who they believe fled the country shortly after his girlfriend
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to characterize Mr. Saffores's conduct as
flight,'' said Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey Locke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Magnarelli, 25, and Saffores, 24, met as students at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston, Locke said. A university
spokewoman said Magnarelli was majoring in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   They had only been dating a short time when Saffores, from North
Carolina, moved in with Magnarelli sometime within the past nine
months. Police conducted a search of their home at 11 Orchard Place
in May, after a relative reported Magnarelli was missing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At the time, police brought in body-sniffing dogs and a team
of investigators but found only the dress she had worn to the prom,
hanging in a closet. It was not until Tuesday night, after a tip
from a friend of Saffores, that troopers returned to the house and
found the bags that appear to contain Magnarelli's corpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very deliberate effort to conceal this burial site,
and it did so,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   After Magnarelli was reported missing, Saffores returned to
Marshville, N.C., his hometown, in early June with Sven Diemer, a
close friend who is from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Saffores stopped to visit relatives, and even indicated that he
might remain in North Carolina for good, according to Angela K.
Saffores, who was married to his father, Skip Saffores, for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `So, Heath, you've come to join the farm again,' and
he said, `Yes,' '' his former stepmother recalled. ``I asked him
did he want me to find him a girlfriend, and he said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Saffores added, ``He never mentioned the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that Saffores and Diemer then fled the country.
Saffores never returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Diemer came back to North Carolina earlier this week,
prompting authorities there to contact Norfolk County authorities.
Investigators flew into town to interview Diemer, and quickly
learned the whereabouts of Magnarelli's body.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, a team of two detectives, a police
photographer and DA Locke returned to the Holbrook home.
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour, investigators had discovered an apparent
hideaway in a flight of wooden steps in the basement, covering a
slab of relatively new concrete.
</P>
<P>
   After chipping away at the concrete, Locke said, he and the
other investigators were able to see ``some shape of the
wrappings.'' A team of crime scene specialists returned Wednesday
to continue the excavation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of steps that we have to go through before
we declare that Kim Magnarelli has been found,'' Locke said. After
the body has been removed, Locke said, it must be postively
identified through dental records and an autopsy will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Locke said the murder appeared to be connected to
domestic violence, a former employer of Magnarelli said that when
Saffores occasionally visited her at work, there seemed to be no
tension between the two.
</P>
<P>
   But Brad McMenimon, owner of the Flying Locksmiths, the
Randolph, Mass. business where Magnarelli worked for about five
years as an office manager, said she had seemed annoyed at the
presence of Diemer, a native of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to stay for one night, and he stayed for two
months,'' McMenimon said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said Diemer _ who came to Boston in January _ is not a
suspect, and is not in custody.

CLINTON TURNS 52 IN SECLUSION WITH FAMILY, JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ After a quiet day spent only with his family,
President Clinton celebrated his 52nd birthday Wednesday night with
his informal counselor, golfing buddy and locker-room confidant
Vernon Jordan Jr., resuming a close association interrupted by the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his wife and their daughter spent the evening with
Jordan and his wife, Ann, at the Jordans' borrowed home here on
Martha's Vineyard, where the first family is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   The informal birthday dinner, shared by no other guests, gave
Clinton and Jordan their first extended time together since Jordan
was subpoenaed in January by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel. Jordan appeared several times before Starr's
grand jury to explain his role in helping find Monica Lewinsky a
job before she gave testimony in Paula Jones' sexual misconduct
suit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said after his grand jury appearances that he had
testified truthfully about his efforts on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf and
that he remained a close and loyal friend of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what loyalty is,'' he said at the time. ``And I'm not a
fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is one of a handful of friends with whom Clinton feels
completely at ease talking about policy, politics or intensely
personal matters. Jordan has described their conversations over the
years as ranging from discussions of political strategy to
``locker-room talk'' about their shared appreciation for attractive
women.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Clinton and Jordan engaged in any
soul-searching discussion of the Lewinsky matter Wednesday night,
given the presence at the Jordan house of their wives and Chelsea
Clinton. But Jordan has continued to be a friend and ally of the
president, even as Starr's investigation has forced a separation
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the White House press secretary, said Clinton
and Jordan had seen each other at several events this year,
including a state dinner and a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware that they've had any long conversations,''
McCurry said, ``but I think the president will enjoy spending this
time with his friend on his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry shed little light on the family ``repair work'' that he
said Clinton was determined to do on this 12-day island sojourn. He
said all three of the Clintons slept late Wednesday and had
breakfast and lunch together. They read and walked around the
property of their temporary home, owned by Richard Friedman, a
Boston developer and major Democratic contributor.
</P>
<P>
   As for the efforts at familial ``healing,'' McCurry said, ``I
think that's a private matter, and if they choose to say anything
publicly about that, that will be their choice, not my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed criticism of the president's conduct from
several members of Congress and calls from some for his
resignation. There is no chance of Clinton's stepping down, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president is confident that he enjoys the trust of
the American people, who elected him,'' McCurry said, ``and he will
continue to do the work he was elected to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took several congratulatory calls on his birthday from
members of his family, including his brother, Roger, and Mrs.
Clinton's brothers, Hugh and Tony. But several friends of the
president who are on the island said they intended to grant him the
privacy he seemed to want.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist William Styron, who along with his wife, Rose, is
among the leading social lights of the island and has given
numerous parties for the Clintons in the past, said he would wait
for them to call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much to say,'' Styron said. ``They're obviously
in a kind of seclusion at the moment. I probably will see them at
one point or another. I don't think people want to intrude on their
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prominent Boston lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who vacations on
Martha's Vineyard and has seen the Clintons socially over the
years, said most of the couple's friends were reluctant to initiate
social contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we all think they need to have time to themselves
and they should not be put under pressure,'' Dershowitz said. ``If
they get a call from a big giver, they may feel an obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonist Jules Feiffer, who had a biting cartoon about the
president in The New York Times Wednesday, said Clinton friends _ a
circle in which he does not include himself _ were hanging back
because of the situation's awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion _ based on nothing, not having spoken with anyone
_ is that people are rather embarrassed and don't know how to
react,'' Feiffer said, ``because the ones who are supporters and
like the fact he comes here and like to hang out with him, while
appalled by Ken Starr, are equally appalled by the president, so
that there are no heroes here, there are no good guys here.''

NEGOTIATIONS COULD LEAD TO SECOND-LARGEST PAGING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign that the paging industry is consolidating amid
falling prices and increased competition from wireless phone
services, Arch Communications Inc. says it is negotiating to buy
MobileMedia Corp. and to take the New Jersey company out of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In a complex deal, Arch will pay $479 million in cash and stock,
and assume $60 million in MobileMedia debt.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were still being negotiated late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the merger would create the nation's second
largest paging company, behind Paging Network Inc. of Dallas, with
more than seven million customers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Arch, of Westborough, Mass., provides paging services mostly
to small businesses in small- and medium-sized markets, while Fort
Lee, N.J.-based &UR;  &LR; MobileMedia, through its MobileComm subsidiary,
concentrates on big customers accounts in major cities.
</P>
<P>
   C. Edward Baker, chairman and chief executive of Arch, said the
deal would not only expand Arch's current customer base, but also
would give it the resources to satisfy customers' demands for more
advanced services, such as two-way messaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are becoming more discerning and more demanding,''
he said in an interview. ``They want more out of their paging
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Paging has been affected by the growing popularity of wireless
telephones, especially those with digital Personal Communication
Services features that allow customers to receive text messages on
their telephone handset. That has led many industry observers to
predict that basic pagers will soon be as obsolete as rotary
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Customers may not want to carry two electronic devices when they
can get all the functions they need with one.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker calls that a misconception. ``There's absolutely no
evidence at all to suggest that the paging business is being
pinched by digital PCS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp./LINK of Framingham, Mass. tends to
agree that people aren't going to toss out their pagers any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent IDC survey, more than two-thirds of respondents &UR;  &LR; 
said they would not stop carrying their pagers even if their
wireless phone provided short messaging service.
</P>
<P>
   IDC/LINK analyst Callie Pottorf said paging customers find their
pagers less intrusive than wireless phones and prefer the extra
battery power and wider coverage area that pagers offer.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he believes paging services will soon allow users to
not only send and receive text messages from the tiny box on their
hip, but also to read e-mail or log into the Internet or their
company's corporate Intranet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What paging and messaging devices do,'' he said, ``is untether
people from their e-mail and the Internet the way wireless phones
have untethered people from their voicemail and their wireline
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Arch already provides some two-way messaging service through a
reseller agreement with SkyTel, another paging company, but plans
to use licenses controlled by MobileMedia to eventually build its
own two-way paging network, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved by Arch shareholders and various
regulatory agencies, it would get MobileMedia out of bankruptcy
court. The company sought bankruptcy protection from creditors in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also has financial benefits for debt-laden Arch and its
shareholders, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of heavy spending on transmission towers and a
string of acquisitions, Arch currently has $1 billion in debt.
Based on its operating cash flow, that's a debt burden far above
industry norms, Baker said. As a result, credit rating agencies
have rated Arch's bonds below investment grade, or ``junk'' status.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with MobileMedia will actually improve Arch's
debt-to-cash flow ratio even though the combined companies' total
debt will mushroom to $1.35 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Under the proposed terms of the deal, Arch will pay
MobileMedia secured creditors $262 million raised from the sale of
new bonds and $217 million in proceeds from newly issued shares and
stock-purchase rights. The new stock will be given to unsecured
MobileMedia creditors, who will end up owning 66 percent and 69
percent of the combined company. Existing Arch shareholders will
own the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   MobileMedia shareholders would get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still faces several hurdles, including approval by Arch
shareholders, by the Federal Communications Commission by the
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   The news lifted Arch shares and bonds. Arch stock rose 7/16 to 3
7/8 Wednesday, and its 10 7/8 percent bonds due 2008 rose to 60
cents on the dollar from 54, traders said.

SWISS JUDGE URGES INDICTMENT OF BHUTTO FOR MONEY-LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A Swiss investigating magistrate said Wednesday that he
had amassed enough evidence, including the purchase of a diamond
necklace, to indict former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
on money-laundering charges tied to contracts with two Geneva-based
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate, Daniel Devaud, decided not to bring the charges
against Mrs. Bhutto in Switzerland, but rather to ask Pakistani
authorities to indict her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not able to leave the country to defend herself, so I
have asked Pakistan to bring the charges,'' Devaud said. Mrs.
Bhutto was forced from office in November 1996 amid corruption
charges and has since been under travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva magistrate has been conducting a wide-ranging inquiry
seeking to account for more than $13.7 million frozen by Swiss
authorities last fall. The money was allegedly stashed in Swiss
banks by Mrs. Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari.
</P>
<P>
   Devaud, who indicted three others related to the case in June,
also asked Pakistani authorities last month to indict Zardari on
similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is unclear if or how soon Pakistani government
investigators would act on the Swiss request, or even whether Mrs.
Bhutto could be tried for a breach of Swiss law in a Pakistani
court.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss request _ which concerns a relatively small portion of
the vast wealth the Bhuttos have amassed _ may be relatively far
down on the list of concerns for the Pakistani investigators. Only
last week, they brought the first criminal charges against Mrs.
Bhutto in their long efforts to track down what8they estimate is
$1.5 billion the couple received in bribes, kickbacks and
commissions in a variety of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Devaud said that part of some 150 pages of evidence sent to
Pakistan officials by the Swiss included documentation of the
purchase of a $188,370 diamond necklace. That money, he emphasized,
was only a small part of the funds his investigation has uncovered.
He declined to give an exact figure, but said the amount was in
excess of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money, investigators say, came from payments made by Societe
Generale de Surveillance Holding SA and Cotecna Inspection SA, two
of the world's leading goods inspections companies, to a Bhutto
family lawyer, who deposited them in off-shore accounts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since freezing the Bhutto accounts last fall, Swiss authorities
have cast a wide net for criminal wrongdoing. This spring, federal
officials disclosed that they had been investigating whether any
money in the Swiss accounts came from drug trafficking as well.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss federal prosecutor Carla del Ponte asked the country's
banks to review their records to match accounts with a list of
Pakistani nationals. The list included the names of some 350 people
or organizations, including high-ranking military officers,
politicians, government officials and close advisers to Mrs.
Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks had until the end of May to respond, but the
findings are confidential, the prosecutor's office said. Canvassing
the banks, argued Mrs. Bhutto's lawyer, Dominique Poncet, is
``completely unfounded.'' Mrs. Bhutto has denied corruption
charges, calling them a political vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall, Devaud says he has found additional Bhutto
accounts, but has released no official overall amount held in them.
Pakistani investigators insist that some $500 million has been
uncovered in 19 Swiss bank accounts. The proceeds, they say, are
from Mrs. Bhutto's cuts on government contracts and drug deals,
however this has not been confirmed by the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's anti-corruption team, headed by Saifur Rehman, has
been focusing on money and property that Mrs. Bhutto and her
husband stowed abroad in their names or that of Mrs. Bhutto's
mother, Nusrat Bhutto. In addition to Swiss accounts, six
properties and seven bank accounts in Britain have been located,
Rehman said, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mrs. Bhutto and her husband, the three others
indicted include a Bhutto family lawyer, Jens Schlegelmilch, and
two top executives of the goods inspections companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Devaud, the indictments center on the commissions
paid by the companies for Pakistan's inspection business. One
company, Societe Generale de Surveillance, has been embroiled in a
long-running dispute with Pakistan following the cancellation of
its contract.
</P>
<P>
   One of those indicted on money-laundering charges is former head
of government contracts for the company, Hans Fischer.
Investigators allege that he paid money to Mariston Securities, an
offshore company controlled by Zardari, as commissions or kickbacks
for contracts awarded.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents made public by Pakistani investigators,
Societe Generale de Surveillance and Cotecna, its subsidiary at the
time, pledged to pay commissions to off-shore companies
incorporated in the names of Zardari and Nusrat Bhutto. The
commissions or fees ranged between 3 percent and 6 percent. From
1995 to 1997, the two cargo review firms inspected more than $15.4
billion in imports into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale de Surveillance officials have defended
Fischer, and said the company ``was not used as a laundering
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted was Cotecna head Robert Massey. He maintained in
an interview that his family company, which operates in 50
countries worldwide, acted legally. ``We don't pay any bribes and
we never will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear whether charges based on violations of Swiss
law could be tried outside the country, winning any such conviction
will depend on a successful criminal case against Mrs. Bhutto and
her husband in Pakistan. This is because Swiss money-laundering law
requires that the underlying legal offense, usually corruption or
bribery, be proved in the country in which it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't launder money unless it's a result of a crime,''
said Schlegelmilch.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss, moreover, do not recognize bribing foreign officials
as a crime. In fact, Swiss law permits commissions to be paid to
foreigners, including bureaucrats, to obtain a contract, and such
sums are tax deductible.

MANTRAS FROM THE TUNA MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Most of the people here gained access to this
small room by using a secret code and waiting for a secured door to
open. There are others, nonmembers, who had to pound on the forest
green door and wait for an insider to appear. But everyone is here
for the same reason. We have come to hear the tangential riffs of
the Tuna Man, the football mystic.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who pack all their belongings in
bumper-stickered Volkswagens and follow bands such as Phish across
North America. There are also men and women who sit down daily for
30 minutes _ at least _ and listen to New York Jets coach Bill
Parcells preach sports at Hofstra University.
</P>
<P>
   Notice we didn't say football. It's not just football with this
man. This is part religion. Part philosophy. Part Language of Bill,
filled with symphonies of ``you knows'' and ``OKs.'' He talks about
everything, but it is understood that we are all gathered because
we love sports. Some of us are worse off than others. Which leads
me to this full disclosure: I need help; I miss the man who for
four years held his sacred sports talks in Foxborough, Mass., as
coach of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your position is on the Bob Kraft-Parcells
divorce, didn't Parcells always make you look at football and
sports differently?
</P>
<P>
   He enters the room. Same as usual. Very large khaki shorts, a
Jets T-shirt, white socks slightly rolled toward his sneakers, and
the famous Tuna waddle. In the next 40 minutes, he will look at his
watch a few times and say he will leave soon. But he can't. Not
yet. For all the bluster, it is obvious Parcells enjoys his
listeners as much as they enjoy him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has asked him about old-school uniforms and logos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a traditional guy; that's one of my problems, I guess,''
he says. ``And that's not conducive to the marketing end of
everything. I am in no way attempting to diminish the importance of
that, you understand? But, you know, the greatest-looking uniforms
in sports are the ones that have kind of stood the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of sports talk. Who has the nicest uniforms?
What's your favorite number? Who are the three best basketball
players from the West Coast? Parcells is right. He is a
traditionalist. He happens to be coaching in an era in which the
most basic sports trait has been whittled away: talking about past
and present players _ of all sports _ and putting them in a larger
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the Yankees uniform, the Dodgers uniform, the
St. Louis Cardinals baseball uniform,'' he says, pausing briefly.
``Look at the Steelers, the Packers, Kansas City ... teams that
have been the same for many, many years. I'm not saying there isn't
a place for change or difference but I just, you know, when you see
those Yankee pinstripes, you know what you're looking at. Nobody
has to tell you what that is. Or the Red Sox. Teams that have a
good, traditional, nice uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand this about football coaches: Ninety-five percent of
them don't talk like this. Many of them are perpetual conspiracy
theorists. You're out to get them, aren't you? They need to
(itals)watch the films(unitals). They need to (itals)put some
points on the board(unitals) (where else are they going to go?).
They need to (itals)focus(unitals). Bill Parcells rambles. This is
good. He is the coach who isn't ashamed to say what most coaches
are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   His Jets play the Giants tonight in East Rutherford, N.J.
Someone in the front of the room is anticipating that game. Even
mentions something about bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Parcells smirks, ``two minutes after it's over, nobody
is ever going to talk about it anymore. It's another preseason
game. Bragging rights are overrated. Who you braggin' to? It's
preseason. You braggin' to somebody in preseason? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   On and on it goes. It is never boring. Few people leave. Even
Kraft can tell you this. He used to be a regular at these Parcells
retreats. The Packers' LeRoy Butler said last year that Parcells
took too much credit for the Patriots getting to the Super Bowl. He
said many of the Patriots felt the same way and were scared to say
just that to the coach. Maybe they should have spoken up. He said
he doesn't mind someone getting in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if anybody shouts back at me, as long as they
know what they're talking about,'' he is saying. It is getting
late. He looks at his watch. He keeps talking. ``I've never cared
about that. I tell 'em, `Say what you want to say.' Hey, if some
guy is shooting his mouth off and doesn't know what he's talking
about, then he's the same as any other guy in this business: You
tell him to shut up until he finds out what's going on. You know?
If someone knows what's going on and they've got some points to
make and just happen to do it vocally, that doesn't bother me. I
don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember: He talks about everything.
</P>
<P>
   As he talks, you begin to see how his stories fall into place.
Have you ever had a teacher who, you thought, didn't like you? Ten
years later, you find out that you were the teacher's favorite.
Contemporary players are like that with Parcells. He talked fondly
of the Giants when he was in New England. He talks fondly of the
Patriots now that he is back in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his favorite fullbacks, he talks about Jets running
backs coach Maurice Carthon, a former fullback, and adds, ``Mo
could always see it and know what to do. And then he taught that to
(Sam) Gash, and that's how Gash got to be a great blocker. Those
kids don't get to be great by accident. There's a whole
chronological path that they have to take to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Armstrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these offensive linemen that you've seen be successful
for so long, you know, Bruce Armstrong is a good example. He knows
how to do it. It's not tedious anymore. Sure, when it's 104 and you
have to do a drill, it's not fun. But mentally, you are not
destroyed by your occupation. 'Cause you know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He glances at the watch again. He says he needs food. A piece of
fruit or something. He also says he likes Glenn Foley at
quarterback for many reasons, one of which is ``I'm half Irish, if
that means anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But we are here to listen to Bill. He talks about
everything. Almost. A local paper's headline blares, ``Liar,
Liar,'' referring to President Clinton and his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. But this Bill doesn't want to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about her?'' he says rhetorically of Lewinsky. ``Oh,
don't get me in that one. I'll let the other guy handle that one.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves. He'll be back tomorrow.

   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TANGLEWOOD-FESTIVAL (Lenox, Mass.) _ Tanglewood is, to be sure,
many things: first and foremost, a festival and retreat of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra here in the idyllic Berkshire Hills. So
when several respected teachers at the orchestra's venerable
training institute, the Tanglewood Music Center, loudly and angrily
resigned late last year in response to a redirection of the
center's activities by Seiji Ozawa, the longtime music director of
the Boston Symphony, it was not clear how much the average
festivalgoer's experience would be affected, if at all. By James R.
Oestreich. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STUPID-KIDS-THEATER (New York) _ Written by John C. Russell, who
died of AIDS in 1994 at the age of 31, ``Stupid Kids'' opened Off
Broadway in June to a shaky start at the WPA Theater, where it
received several mixed reviews, with some critics complaining of a
thin story. Still, the 80-minute play, directed by Michael Mayer,
seemed to be finding its legs just as it closed in July. Now it has
been given another chance. It begins a commercial run on Tuesday at
the Century Theater with a gilt-edged pack of producers behind it.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TEA-WITH-MUSSOLINI-FILM (Rome) _ ``Tea with Mussolini,'' which
is being directed by Franco Zeffirelli this summer in Rome and
Florence, is based on his memories of wartime and the years just
before, when he was an illegitimate, motherless young Florentine.
It's a homage to a group of eccentric English ladies who
essentially adopted him, and who tried to preserve their own
civility and Florence's treasures as war closed in around them. By
Alessandra Stanley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-CRITICS (Undated) _ For better and worse, critics find
themselves integral to the process of promoting movies, and there
are times when we gratefully seize that opportunity. Consider
``Western,'' a beguiling, offbeat French film that I adore. By
Janet Maslin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-PLACE (Undated) _ If home is indeed where the heart is,
then the repertory in which a musician feels most at home may have
more to do with aptitude and sympathy than with where that musician
was born or lives. Yet sometimes a relationship between geography
and music holds true, and two new piano recordings, by Stephen
Hough and Leif Ove Andsnes, make a persuasive case for the power of
place. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RAKE'S-PROGRESS-OPERA (Undated) _ Igor Stravinsky was a slow
worker. He produced, on average, one major composition, or an
equivalent number of smaller ones, per year. Of course, he lived
many years, from 1882 to 1971, and produced many works, about 100,
though only a handful run longer than a half-hour. The longest by
far is his only full-length opera, ``The Rake's Progress.'' Each of
its three acts took a year to compose. By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ELLIOTT-SMITH-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Everybody's dying just to get
the disease,'' sang Elliott Smith about the perils of fame in
``Pictures of Me,'' one of the most memorable pop songs of last
year. It appeared on ``Either/Or,'' Smith's third album, and it was
a startlingly advanced report of dissaffection sung in a high voice
by a slouchy 27-year-old Beatles fan from Portland, Ore., with a
pallid, wounded demeanor. By Ben Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   LAURYN-HILL-MUSIC (Undated) _ On her solo debut album, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' the rapper, singer and visionary
artist Lauryn Hill imagines herself as part of a very old story. It
transcends her own 23-year-old life, as stimulating as that may be
with the success of her hip-hop group, the Fugees, her highly
promising career as a musician and producer and her personal
happiness mothering a baby boy. By Ann Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRINCESS'S-PEOPLE-TV (Undated) _ With Britain bracing itself for
a relentless barrage of Princess-Diana-related television
programming in the next few weeks, it is not surprising that ``The
Princess's People,'' one of the shows on offer, has generated a bit
of unflattering advance publicity. Maybe because it shows, among
other things, Londoners swearing at the television set during the
broadcast of the Princess of Wales's funeral last year. By Sarah
Lyall. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  MIND-TRAVELER-TV (Undated) _ A four-part PBS series called
``Oliver Sacks: The Mind Traveler,'' begins Tuesday at 8 p.m. _
stories of people with autism or total color-blindness or Usher's
syndrome, another rare genetic condition, in which a person is born
deaf and then gradually goes blind in young adulthood. By Natalie
Angier. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DAILY-SHOW-TV (Undated) _ ``The Daily Show,'' is America's most
perfect rendering of comedy post-modernism. Running, well, nightly
at 11 p.m. on cable's Comedy Central, ``The Daily Show'' is what
happens when you give the kids who used to make fun of you their
own television show. By Jeff MacGregor. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BAY-BRIDGE-ARCHITECTURE (San Francisco) _ When it comes to bridge
designers practicing in the world today, there's the Spanish
architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava and there's everyone
else. Isn't that awful? This fact has certainly lent an air of
independence, if not futility, to San Francisco's search for a new
design for the Bay Bridge. Why should Bay area residents settle for
genius and deprive themselves of the freedom to choose something
second rate? By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>

COMMENTARY: CLINTON ON THE WIRE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to add `CLINTON' to slug)   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one is ever better on the high wire,'' said former White
House press secretary Dee Dee Myers in a television appearance
before Bill Clinton's address to the nation on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems is that the president takes so many people
up on the high wire with him. If he falls it's a catastrophe. On
Monday night, not long after Ms. Myers' comment, Clinton lost his
balance. But he didn't fall. His performance is shakier than ever,
but he's still up there.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why the president feels the need to take such
foolish risks in the first place, risks that put him and so many
others in jeopardy. Is it all a game? Or is it a kind of sickness?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a chance to climb down from the wire on Monday. The
public has made it overwhelmingly clear that it is sick of the
sordid Lewinsky melodrama. The Republicans in Congress have no
stomach for impeachment, and there has been no evidence disclosed
as yet that would warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
offered Clinton an out and practically begged him to take it. In an
appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' early this month, Hatch
said: ``If he comes forth and tells it and does it in the right way
and there aren't a lot of other factors to cause the Congress to
say, `This man is unfit for the presidency and should be
impeached,' then I think the president would have a reasonable
chance of getting through this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think the American people would breathe a sigh of
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a serious olive branch. It should not have been
difficult to accept. Close friends and aides to Clinton, finally
aware, like most Americans, that the president had been lying all
along, were saying the same thing. They urged him to help put the
matter to rest by telling the full truth and offering a sincere
apology to the nation for the grief and the harm he had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wobbling on the swaying wire, shook his head. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on television and offered defiance where so many had
hoped to see contrition. He never admitted that he had lied at all.
He never apologized. And he angrily attacked Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel. Starr is certainly vulnerable to
attack, but most of Clinton's advisers felt that Monday night's
address to the nation was not the place to do it. All you had to do
was look at Senator Hatch's response to the president's four-minute
speech to see why they felt as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just gonna blow my stack,'' said Hatch on NBC. Change the
channel. ``I'm just gonna blow my cork,'' said Hatch on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not helped to put the matter to rest. The sense of
betrayal among the president's supporters, which was inevitable, is
mixed with the horrifying suspicion that he is in no way
remorseful, that he couldn't care less about the friends and the
aides who put their credibility on the line for him, the colleagues
whose legal bills in some cases have left them close to bankruptcy,
the ardent followers whose trust he has squandered like a
compulsive gambler feeding borrowed money into a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   The president remained silent for more than half a year,
allowing people who cared deeply about him to submerge their
reputations in his lies. And, true to a decades-long pattern, he
would still be promoting those lies and playing the American people
for fools if he hadn't been confronted by what appears to be a
mountain of virtually irrefutable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval ratings remain extremely high. The public
does not want him to resign or be impeached. Among other things, it
does not want Kenneth Starr deciding who will be president.
</P>
<P>
   The high poll ratings may actually encourage in Clinton a giddy
sense that he can get away with anything. Behind the numbers,
however, is the widespread realization that this is a man who has
disgraced himself and his office and who cannot be trusted, even by
his closest friends. That view will be reinforced by each new and
dismaying revelation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a story that can be wished away. When the president
has a problem we all have a problem. We are all on the high wire
with him.
</P>

FOR COWBOYS' OFFENSE, IT'S AWFULLY LATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ From all corners of the Valley Ranch locker
room, the same concerns could be heard yesterday from a multitude
of voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time. ... it's time. ... it's time.'' That was the echo.
</P>
<P>
   NFL clocks normally aren't ticking in mid-August, particularly
at the Cowboys' compound, where for years the prevailing pompous
attitude was, ``We turn it on when we're ready to turn it on.''
</P>
<P>
   And once-upon-a-dynasty, they could.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the '96 season, which unfortunately, was followed
by the '97 season. And that handy turn-on switch was never located.
Bad play in August exhibitions signaled an NFL disaster about to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And if what has been on display thus far this month is any
barometer, a bad team in '97 is about to become worse. Is it too
late to apply for membership in the Big 12 South?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously then, it is time. Time to stop being embarrassed over
being inept the last few weeks. And there was no locker-room denial
yesterday. Fact-facing was prevalent, mainly because that Mexico
City mess was still a stinging memory.
</P>
<P>
   Which sets up something different for the Cowboys' venture into
St. Louis on Saturday night. Even in August, here's a game that
will have some high-level intensity attached to it, at least for
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darn right, there's got to be concern about not putting the
ball in the end zone, and about how we're playing,'' offensive
tackle Larry Allen said. ``Putting something together as a unit,
that's very important to us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, of course, is one of the few remaining individual Cowboys
who carries no question mark. He's young, healthy and one of the
best at his profession in the NFL. Young, healthy and proven is a
rare trifecta at today's Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Allen, however, the Dallas offensive line is lowly
regarded in NFL circles. And even with the teams' other glaring
questions, if the Cowboys unravel this season, look for the dam to
first burst in front of Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In January, in the Cowboys' positional grading-out process
following 6-10, the finger of failure was pointed mostly at the
offensive line. It graded the lowest of any area, even defensive
line, running back and quarterback. And the offensive line, trying
to adjust to Chan Gailey's new offense, has thus far severely
flunked August.
</P>
<P>
   But after first-quarter cameo appearances in three exhibition
games, the starting units will have at least a first half of duty
on Saturday night. And it's not like three quarters, or even four,
isn't needed. Forget injury worries. Try scoring a couple of
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones admits the organization's top screw-up of 1997 came
in the offensive line _ trying to milk one more season from Mark
Tuinei's knees; trusting Nate Newton to be fit; pushing a
lightweight prospect like Clay Shiver into a starter's role;
keeping George Hegamin and John Flannery as backups.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, Gailey, line coach Hudson Houck _ they all expect
this to be a much-better group. Shiver has added 20 pounds and
endured a season of hard knocks. Newton lost about 800 pounds.
Everett McIver was signed as a free-agent guard. Allen is Allen,
and while Erik Williams will never be as good as he once was
(despite the annual training camp claim that Williams is again
all-world), he's a competent right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones said in Wichita Falls, ``We thought adding McIver was
all we needed. We could have spent more money (on upgrading the
offensive line) but we didn't think it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the first quarter in Mexico City, when Troy
Aikman found himself on his butt five times in seven pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, McIver looked like a guard who shouldn't have
missed 10 days of practice, two exhibition games and a scrimmage.
He needs work. But McIver also didn't need a 2-inch gash on his
neck either.
</P>
<P>
   If McIver is any good, why did The Jimster let him walk in
Miami? Nate is already limping and it's only August. Are Flozell
Adams and Tony Hutson a better pair of guards? How iffy is Shiver?
</P>
<P>
   Mid-August is a tad late to be asking such things. But based on
the early returns, here's one more thing to ask. How long do Aikman
and Emmitt survive?
</P>
<P>
   It's time for answers/results. See you in St. Louis.

WORDING CHANGE SKEWED POLL AFTER CLINTON SPEECH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A small change in the wording of a poll question by The Gallup
Organization led to a significant overstatement of the drop in
President Clinton's personal favorability rating after his speech
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a 20-point drop in personal favorability, reported by
Gallup and picked up by several news organizations, including The
New York Times in both its news and editorial pages, the actual
drop now appears to be considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's survey, taken after the president's speech,
respondents were asked: ``Now thinking about Bill Clinton as a
person, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him?''
That elicited responses from the public that were 40 percent
favorable and 48 percent unfavorable. In previous Gallup polls, the
wording was: ``Now I'd like to get your opinion about some people
in the news. As I read the name, please say if you have a favorable
or unfavorable opinion of this person.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, that traditional wording resulted in public
impressions of Clinton that were 60 percent favorable and 38
percent unfavorable. Thus, it appeared on Monday that there had
been a 20-percentage point drop in Clinton's personal ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll on Tuesday, however, Gallup used the traditional
wording and measured 55 percent favorable views of Clinton and 42
percent unfavorable.

ANTICIPATED DYNASTY TRAGICALLY CRUMBLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ As they assembled on a sideline in Miami in late
January 1995, preparing for the opening kickoff, the San Diego
Chargers couldn't help but think their future was gleaming
brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   They had just reached their first Super Bowl in franchise
history and they had done so with a roster loaded with youth.
</P>
<P>
   Reality struck them like a forearm to the chops, though, and it
was to transcend the day's result _ one of the AFC's requisite
blowout losses to the San Francisco 49ers, this time by 49-26.
</P>
<P>
   The team headed promptly for the tank, from 11-5 in its Super
Bowl season to 9-7 the next year, then 8-8, and, finally, 4-12 last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Its roster was dismantled. Today, a mere 3{ years since the
Super Bowl visit, only 11 players who appeared in the title game
have served continuously with the Chargers since. Among those 11
are only two players who started in the game: cornerback Dwayne
Harper and linebacker Junior Seau. Even in the NFL's world of free
agency and salary caps and attrition, that is alarming turnover for
an AFC champ.
</P>
<P>
   And the Super Bowl visit was marred by tragedy. Three members of
that Chargers team are dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came off that Super Bowl year, we thought we could
build from there,'' Seau said. ``We had a young team. But it just
didn't fall together, whether it was (a lack of) maturity, the
decision-making, whether it was just the talent we had on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the '94 Chargers can be viewed as a team that
transcended its minimal ability levels and simply put together a
magical season. According to insiders, various egos began to
inflate immediately afterward, and soon discord was taking root on
the team. General manager Bobby Beathard cited defensive end Leslie
O'Neal, now with Kansas City, ``as one of the biggest culprits in
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the tragic ends.
</P>
<P>
   __ Linebacker David Griggs died in a car accident in Miami in
June '95.
</P>
<P>
   __ Running back Rodney Culver and his wife were victims of the
ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades in May '96.
</P>
<P>
   __ Linebacker Doug Miller was struck by lightning _ twice in a
span of a few minutes _ while on a camping trip in Colorado last
month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's happened recently at Netscape Communications,
Apple Computer, Bay Networks, Oracle, Best Buy and Oxford Health
Plans, among others. The company's stock plunges, and its board of
directors immediately acts to reduce the price at which employees
can buy shares through the stock option program. A new, lower
exercise price, the company argues, keeps workers from abandoning
ship to a competitor. In a tight labor market, anything that keeps
employees happy is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   But as more companies choose to reprice their option plans,
criticism of the practice grows increasingly vocal. Shareholder
activist groups say option repricings are inherently unfair. Why
should one set of shareholders be able to reduce the cost of
getting into the stock while others cannot?
</P>
<P>
   Now, a tentative decision reached by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board last week may be the beginning of the end of
repricings. ``If the decision stands, it would more than likely end
repricings as we know them,'' said Robert Willens, partner in tax
and accounting at Lehman Brothers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision on Aug. 12, the board took the first
step toward forcing companies that reprice their options to
consider as an operating expense the difference between the new,
lower price and any subsequent increase in the share price. The
board did not act to quash the repricing tactic. It simply moved to
make the practice too expensive for many companies to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Even though stock options could easily be considered an employee
expense like a salary or bonus, under current accounting rules,
companies issuing option grants are not required to consider any
part of them a cost of doing business. Instead, according to
Statement 123, companies simply must flag, in footnotes to the
financial statements, the effect that stock options would have had
on their earnings had they been recognized as a compensation
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's decision came as the accounting board set about to
clear up a continuing cloud over how companies account for stock
issued to employees. Given the increasing devotion to stock options
by American companies, and the heavy toll that expensing them would
take on corporate earnings, the accounting decision is certain to
be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compensation consultants are apoplectic,'' said Patrick
McGurn, director of corporate programs at Institutional
Shareholders Services in Bethesda, Md., a shareholder activist
group. ``They're going to try to gin up some opposition pretty
quickly, especially in Silicon Valley. It's something they're
likely to get pretty exercised about.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the money at issue makes the accounting move plenty
compelling. Consider what expensing the cost of its repriced
options would mean to Netscape, which in January reduced the price
on an 8.6 million-share option grant to workers, but not to top
executives. The shares, repriced at $16.8125 from a variety of
higher prices, fetched $30.875 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between those prices multiplied by the 8.6
million shares comes to about $121 million. If this were a business
expense, as the accounting board has tentatively concluded, it
would be among Netscape's largest. Research and development at the
company totaled $130 million last year. To put it in even greater
perspective, $121 million is equal to almost 27 percent of the
company's gross profit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Netscape reprice so many shares? ``We did it because
we'd like to attract and retain employees,'' said Chris Holton, a
Netscape spokeswoman. ``We had a lot of employees that were under
water, and we felt it would be a big benefit for all employees to
reprice the stock. Our employees are very happy with where the
stock is today.'' Outsiders who paid more than $50 a share for
Netscape last year are undoubtedly not so happy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the shares had fallen after the repricing, the
company would receive a credit, instead of an expense, the
accounting board has concluded. If the stock price were unchanged,
there would be no financial consequences. The company would report
the charge or the credit every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Because option repricing usually follows a precipitous decline
in a company's share price, the practice will probably become even
more prevalent after the market swoon this summer. Matt Ward, chief
executive officer of WestWard Pay Strategies, a compensation
consulting firm, said that he counts at least 30 companies that
have repriced their option grants so far this year. That is roughly
equal to the total that repriced their option grants in all of
1997, by his count.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's numbers are by no means comprehensive. Companies that
choose to reprice option grants do not usually publicize the
decision. Information about option repricings is typically buried
in financial statements and found by only the most vigilant
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder activist groups like McGurn's are among the few who
see the escalation in option repricing and deplore the trend. These
groups find repricings inherently unfair since the practice allows
some shareholders _ employees, in this case _ to get their stock at
much diminished prices while outside shareholders do not. This is
particularly troubling when a stock rebounds quickly after an
option program has been repriced, rewarding management and
employees, while other shareholders simply get back to even.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it is a major concern for investors, if not the No. 1
concern,'' said McGurn. ``The real fear is that all participants in
the plan do is profit from volatility in the stock.'' McGurn
reports that he has had more phone calls regarding stock option
repricings in the last 2 weeks than he had received in the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason to object to option repricings is that they can
carry a substantial but largely imperceptible cost to shareholders.
That cost comes in the dilution that large option programs bring to
existing shareholders' stakes. According to Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners,
a compensation consulting firm in New York, shares authorized for
management and employee equity incentive plans at the 200 largest
U.S. companies almost doubled in the last eight years. Last year,
the options in these plans amounted to 13.2 percent of the weighted
average of shares outstanding at these companies. As additional
shares covered by options programs are added to the whole, existing
shareholders' stakes are worth less.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any option plan dilutes existing shareholders'
stakes. But option plans that are repriced add insult to injury by
letting insiders take advantage of a plummeting stock to increase
their potential profits.
</P>
<P>
   Why did accounting rule makers single out repriced options as a
cost to the income statement? The decision goes back to a 1972
accounting rule that distinguished between fixed option plans and
so-called variable plans. Known as APB Opinion 25, it stated that
while fixed option plans did not need to be considered a business
expense, variable plans did. In the accounting board's opinion,
applying a new price to an option grant program automatically makes
it a variable plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is consistent with the basic logic of APB 25,'' said Tim
Lucas, director of research and technical activities at the
accounting board in Norwalk, Conn. ``The measurement is the known
number of shares and known price. Once you change it, there's some
variability involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas went on to explain that although the board's conclusion on
this matter was unanimous, it is a first step. The board hopes to
finish a so-called exposure draft on this and related matters by
the end of the year, after which it would ask for public comment on
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll receive letters, we'll review them. Perhaps we'll have a
public hearing,'' he said. After deliberating again, the board
would then issue a final statement. When would the proposal become
effective? Lucas said: ``If all goes according to plan, it is
unlikely before Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas does not expect a bruising battle over the proposal. ``I
expect some people would prefer another answer,'' he said. ``We'll
hear from them. That's what the comment period is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Others expect corporate America to fight the proposal hard. ``I
think the reaction will be harsh,'' Willens said. ``They will argue
that repricing options is an important tool. To take away their
ability to readjust their sights based on market performance
undermines their ability to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   But any debate is unlikely to be as bloody as what the
accounting board endured several years ago when it considered
making companies expense all stock option programs. Then, companies
blasted the proposal, claiming that having to expense stock option
costs would be so detrimental to American business as to make it
uncompetitive. The very existence of the accounting board was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the board is careful to point out that it is
simply interpreting what's already on the books about repriced
options. Willens said: ``FASB will be able to make a principled
argument, `Look, you wanted us to adhere to original accounting in
this, you urged us to retain that literature as a guide for option
accounting. And that very document that you embrace requires us to
treat repricing in this manner.' It's a reasonably hard argument to
refute.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Willens says the language in the existing rule is not
ironclad. And even if the rule makers effectively shut down the
repricing practice, corporate America is sure to work overtime to
find other ways to compensate employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder groups like McGurn's are not waiting for the
accounting board to act. They are making their own waves about the
repricing practice. McGurn's company advises 500 large
institutional shareholders on how to vote on such issues as
executive compensation and stock option plans. He said he is going
to begin to add the cost of option repricings into a formula that
he uses to decide whether a company operates in a
shareholder-friendly manner.
</P>
<P>
   McGurn also would like to see a cooling-off period between the
time a share price declines and the company chooses to reprice its
options. ``All too often the board's reaction has become
knee-jerk,'' he said. ``As soon as its stock price drops, there's
immediate discussion of repricing.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Ward at WestWay Pay Strategies advises his clients
considering an option repricing to follow several fairness
guidelines, beginning with prior shareholder approval. ``My view on
repricing is it should never be afforded to top management and
never on a one-for-one basis,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should always be an economic tradeoff, so a repricing
should always involve fewer shares.'' He thinks a repricing should
also involve a change in the vesting rules. For example, if an
employee were halfway vested in a four-year program, a fairer
repricing might extend the vesting by another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those tweakings have been lessons learned from repricings
gone bad,'' Ward said. &QL;

RUSSIA CAUGHT IN FINANCIAL QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also DEVALUE-ECONSCENE) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Russian leaders, struggling to bail out
their nation's banks from billions of dollars' worth of currency
and bond deals with Western financial institutions, find themselves
caught in an excruciating dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The plans that government leaders first announced on Monday
could cost foreign lenders billions of dollars, a move that could
shred Russia's lingering credibility in global financial markets.
But if the government defers to foreign lenders, as it suggested on
Tuesday, Russia's banking system would veer closer to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   These equally scary outcomes were reflected Wednesday in another
stampede out of the Russian stock market, a barometer of foreign
investor confidence. The dollar-denominated Russian RTS index fell
9.42 percent, its third consecutive tumble, leaving it at a record
low of 90.19. It has fallen nearly 40 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Western banks are under way in Moscow, and no
solution is expected until next week. But in the meantime, two
problems stand out in particular, Western bankers and financial
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that Russian banks have entered more than $10
billion worth of currency deals with foreign lenders. If the
contracts are honored by the Russian banks _ an outcome that
remains in question _ and the Russian ruble continues to lose
value, the Russian banks would stand to lose billions. If the
contracts are not honored, though, Western banks would be stuck
with the losses.
</P>
<P>
   A second problem, according to Western executives, is that many
Russian banks are thought to have bought $4 billion to $6 billion
worth of Russian government Eurobonds with borrowed money, and the
market value of the bonds has plunged by about 50 percent in the
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues came to light when the Russian government announced
its original emergency plan on Monday, which included a 90-day
moratorium on repaying foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the headlines this week have focused on Russia's
devaluation of the ruble, Western investors were far more shocked
by the moratorium, which appeared calculated to rescue Russian
banks from an enormous financial squeeze at the expense of foreign
lenders. Beyond costing money, the move angered Western
institutions because it was the first instance of the government of
President Boris Yeltsin being willing to break standard financial
contracts in midstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a fundamental decision today that they were going to
save their local banks from insolvency and to disenfranchise
foreign lenders,'' said William Browder, head of the Hermitage
Fund, based in Moscow, one of the biggest Western mutual funds
devoted to Russian stocks. ``Foreigners have no value to them
unless they bring capital, and they haven't been bringing in any
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   One provision of the moratorium would have frozen payments on
``forward currency contracts.'' At issue was more than $10 billion
worth of currency agreements that foreign lenders had bought from
Russian banks to insure themselves against a devaluation of the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The currency contracts allowed foreign investors to buy tens of
billions of rubles' worth of Russian bonds, known as GKOs and OFZs.
These bonds have paid sky-high interest rates but are paid in
rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McGovern, head of Merrill Lynch's research on
emerging-markets debt, said this week that Russian banks would face
a huge squeeze in October. That is when about $5 billion worth of
currency contracts are scheduled to come due, which means the
Russian banks would have to buy billions of rubles at prices that
could be far above market value.
</P>
<P>
   The October contracts are particularly worrisome, McGovern said,
because they were entered before the Asian financial crisis had
reached full strength. As a result, the contracts were priced to
reflect what have now proved to be wildly naive expectations about
the ruble's stability.
</P>
<P>
   The new moratorium was like ``a bomb had gone off,'' McGovern
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision bails out Russian banks that bought
dollar-denominated Russian government bonds. The Russian government
issued about $10 billion in new Eurobonds over the last two months,
and financial executives said that Russian banks bought a big share
of these.
</P>
<P>
   But many banks bought the Eurobonds on credit. The value of
those bonds plunged by about 50 percent in the last month amid
escalating panic about Russia's financial condition. Russian banks
must come up with much more money to cover the lost market value,
much as stock speculators have to make new margin payments when
they buy shares on credit and the shares' value falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a bit of sympathy for the government,'' said Sally
Wilkinson, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, the European arm of
Daiwa Securities. ``The alternative would have been to let the
banks fall, which would have led to the whole house of cards
falling.''

CLINTON CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY IN SECLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton's 52nd birthday arrived
Wednesday at the start of a vaction devoted more to mending his
marriage than to celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than raucous parties and star-studded musical tributes as
in years past, Clinton spent his birthday in seclusion with his
family. They later ventured out for a small birthday dinner with
Clinton's longtime pal Washington power broker Vernon E. Jordan and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was the first time the Clintons have left the
Edgartown estate of Boston businessman Richard Friedman since
arriving Tuesday evening for a planned 12-day vacation on the
island of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Michael D. McCurry said the
Clintons' slept late and spent the day reading and lounging. They
had both breakfast and lunch together, and walked around the
beachfront estate, as the Clintons seek to repair their marriage
strained by the president's public acknowledgement of a
relationship that was ``not appropriate'' with former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's not as joyous a birthday as he's had in the
past,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner at Jordan's house was another reminder here of the
controversy endangering the Clinton presidency. Jordan has
testified numerous times before a federal grand jury investigating
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky. It was Jordan who helped
Lewinsky line up a job offer after she left the White House, and
investigators have been looking into whether that help was an
attempt to keep Lewinsky silent about her relationship with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's friendship with Clinton has since been the subject of a
guessing game in Washington, a town intently interested in the
status of who's in and who's out, as the two men who've often
golfed together, vacationed and dined together have limited their
public contact in the seven months of independent consel Kenneth W.
Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, Jordan was the first to greet the Clintons
on the tarmac at Martha's Vineyard airport. ``He's spending his
birthday evening with his friend,'' McCurry said. ``That's all I
would read into that.''
</P>
<P>
   This birthday was different for Clinton, who, when he reached
the half-century mark, led a party hosted by Whoopi Goldberg at
Radio City Music Hall. That bash was beamed by satellite to 20,000
people gathered at 76 locations around the country to raise $10
million for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the president celebrated his birthday at a clambake
at the Vineyard farm of actor Ted Danson and his wife, actress Mary
Steenburgen.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Clinton aides have urged the president to make more
public appearances during this vacation and project a stronger
image in an attempt to stave off calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But others said there were no immediate plans for the president
to play a more public role. ``He's on vacation, and the best way he
can spend his time right now is to be with his family,'' said a
senior adviser. ``That's where he belongs. We're not ready for a
road show right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Hackney, who with his wife Lucy, often spend time with
the Clintons on the Vineyard and are expecting to this time, said
of Clinton's birthday: ``It's not one ending in zero. It's not an
existential self-examination probably going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Clintons probably will venture out more after a few
days of downtime, and he predicted that the president will get in
his usual rounds of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Of the president's current predicament, Hackney said, ``The
pressure must be intense, and I think it was telling in his face by
the time he got here. One thing the Vineyard can do is restore some
perspective as well as some rest.''

PAST JONATHAN SWIFT TO LINDA TRIPP _ YEAH, WHATEVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 (Jeff Macgregor worked in the television industry for 20 years)  
 By JEFF MACGREGOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I watch a lot of television in the summer, a bad
habit from my childhood. My therapist would tell you that it was a
strategy for defending my then-tenuous self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   I was a chubby little monkey and often stayed indoors rather
than suffer the pokes and taunts of the slenderer neighborhood
children. My therapist would tell you that these children were
simply projecting and neutralizing their own insecurities, that
their thin sarcasms were manifestations of their own psychic pain.
</P>
<P>
   She would tell you that we were thus caught in conflicting
systems of pre-emptive self-avoidance and fear management, all of
which hardened into the pathologies of our emotional adulthood. My
therapist would tell you all this, but she can't right now because
she's on a Boogie board somewhere in the Fire Island surf with a
blender drink jammed into each fist and cannot be reached, so I'm
watching a lot of television again this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite entertainment discoveries of the season so
far is a commercial for the YMCA. It features the usual
public-service-announcement style footage of happy multiculti
kiddies running and jumping. What distinguishes it from a thousand
other dimly earnest spots of the same kind, though, is its audio
track: a sound-alike version of the Village People hit ``Y.M.C.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers rewrote the lyric from ``It's fun to stay at the
YMCA.'' to ``It's fun to play at the YMCA.'' Sort of misses the
point. It doesn't really change things any if you understood the
goofy heterosubversiveness of the original, and further, however
unintentionally, it leaves one to picture a vigorous playground
dodge-ball game that might be supervised by a cowboy clad in a gun
belt and bicycle shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Weirdly, I found this little nugget of oblivious anti-irony
embedded in an afternoon rebroadcast of ``The Daily Show,''
America's most perfect rendering of comedy postmodernism. Running,
well, nightly on cable's Comedy Central, ``The Daily Show'' is what
happens when you give the kids who used to make fun of you their
own television show.
</P>
<P>
   It is a not-quite parody of a not-quite newscast. The Dan
Aykroyd and Jane Curtain ``Weekend Update'' sketches on ``Saturday
Night Live'' (circa late '70s, post-Chevy Chase) were a parody of a
newscast. A thing done in character with the intention of mocking
the absurdities of the genuine article.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Show,'' however, is a thing in itself, a comedy show
built on the premise that the day's headlines and their sidebars
can be made funny. While borrowing the trappings of a newscast (the
I Like Ikea rosewood and stainless set, authoritative desk, zippy
graphics, etc.), the show doesn't present itself as a comment on
television news so much as an ironic adjunct to it. A much hipper,
completely ironic adjunct.
</P>
<P>
   The content of each show varies in proportion, but the main
ingredients seem to remain these: four or five lead stories
headlined at the top of the show, an offbeat videotape package, a
live interview with a visiting celebrity, a few quick-hitting trims
and ends, quirks of the kind that used to be found filling up the
last inch or two of column space in a newspaper. All of which are
read, wrangled or introduced by Craig Kilborn, the show's anchor.
</P>
<P>
   The way the lead stories get handled doesn't much vary. Imagine
the three cruelest, cleverest things you could ever say about Linda
Tripp on the day she appears to defend her, um, appearance, for
example, and those will be the three jokes that accompany the photo
of her that hovers over Kilborn's shoulder as he attacks her
appearance, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's like making fun of the people in line at Epcot: too easy,
but darned satisfying when you're cranky. Again, the stories derive
from the news of the day, so Clinton and Starr get a consistent
working over, as do Ms. Tripp, Monica Lewinsky and all the other
folks currently mired in our national infotainment hog wallow.
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn delivers this material with the requisite smirks and
deadpan charm that it needs, helped in no small measure by the fact
that he is blond and boyish and perhaps innocent-looking enough to
be the male host of ``A.M. Norway.'' Coincidentally, Kilborn shares
the stylish cowlick-conk Huck Finn hairdo first popularized by
NBC's Conan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   This was, apparently, incentive enough for CBS to hire Kilborn
recently to replace the departing Tom Snyder. Conan and Craig will
go forelock to forelock in late night, beginning early next year.
Replacing Kilborn will be Jon Stewart. Clear?
</P>
<P>
   The show's correspondents, notably Beth Littleford and Stephen
Colbert, likewise present their taped features with the stoicism
and affectless expressions that we require of our big-time news
reporters or our comedy straight men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Littleford, who possesses a remarkable resemblance in looks
and bearing to the actress Joan Allen, is especially gifted when it
comes to the timely cocking of an eyebrow or the grave nod of the
head so integral to all television news interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The packages themselves are devious little concoctions wherein
the central characters seem to have no idea that they'll be savaged
when the piece is edited, their interviews rejiggered to suit a
rewritten set of questions, their sincerity juxtaposed against the
comic premise of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's much like any videotaped network news feature, a
manipulation through misrepresentation, except that it's
intentionally funny. A recent piece, slugged ``Grandfatherland,''
drew a smart comic parallel between the growth of the Leisureworld
retirement community and the expansionism of Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The on-set chat with the daily celebrity done by Kilborn is a
similarly cockeyed few moments of re-engineered television
boilerplate. He does his best, it would seem, to make his guests
uncomfortable: asking questions that stump or incriminate them,
awkwardly goading them to play along with his not-so-respectful
assessments of what has happened to their careers lately, posing to
each a list of five questions that often have no real answer but
are vaguely referential to the celebrity on the hot seat (e.g., to
Yasmine Bleeth, Dairy Council swimsuit pinup and actress, ``Other
than chocolate chip, what cookie goes best with milk?'').
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn's disappointment when a guest turns out to be less of an
idiot than he hoped is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem. In the world inhabited and delineated
by ``The Daily Show,'' everyone is an idiot. There's no denying
that the show is smart and often funny, but in an annoyingly
self-conscious way that constantly sets out to reaffirm its own
moral and intellectual superiority.
</P>
<P>
   It has about it the glib, tinny ring of a college lampoon in
which the sophomore writer's cleverness is deployed in service of
nothing grander than impressing the writer's freshman friends.
Bereft of an ideological or artistic center, the show is precocious
but empty.
</P>
<P>
   That it mistakes irony for an end rather than a means is a
distressing reflection of where we find ourselves. Irony was once a
comic device, a delivery system for a reformative idea, a challenge
to the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks and Shakespeare and Jonathan Swift and
Voltaire and Lenny Bruce all understood that the joke was simply
where you kept the idea hidden from the authorities. That idea in
most cases being one of human betterment, that we could improve
ourselves and our world if we all realized the truth about our
common condition, that we were stuck in this together. Instead
``The Daily Show'' looks at the world, shrugs and says,
``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of hollow, self-heroic irony is a product of the same
us-vs.-them postmodernism that gave us unreadable metafictional
novels and the zany architecture of the uninhabitable. I don't
recall asking for office buildings that looked like glass grain
elevators with exoskeletons, but for a while that's what I got,
because that's what architects thought was hip.
</P>
<P>
   Same with music, dance, poetry and anything else you could study
in graduate school. Having expanded and then deconstructed the
possibilities of creative expression to the point of absurdity,
though, the great cycle of common sense seems to be leading us back
to lyricism and story and little brick houses.
</P>
<P>
   Show business is slow on the uptake, however, as always, and the
grim wisecracks of Comparative Hip are still the vogue. A couple of
notable exceptions: ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' succeeds in part
because she's goofy, self-deprecating and unironic. And the
summer's hottest comedy film, ``There's Something About Mary,'' has
been systematically overpraised by critics for two reasons: Its
best moments are simple slapstick, and it has a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that David Letterman was our national barometer
for pained expressions of ironic futility. Every quip is still a
cry for help, certainly, but he at least understands that there's a
world outside his studio, even if he hates living in it.
</P>
<P>
   Television's latest generation of comic emcees _ Bill Maher,
Dennis Miller, John Henson et al. _ make their bones by
reconfiguring the common wisdom in a vacuum, in a way that's almost
entirely mean-spirited and self-referential. Comedy like this, at
its worst, is supercilious and uncharitable and airless, finally
institutionalizing our sense of civic paralysis with its underlying
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Show'' isn't really to blame for any of this, of
course. It does what it can to eke out a few laughs in a time and
place that is at once ridiculous and tragic. That it does so
without sweetness or hope or a sense of humor about itself has more
to do with the futility we all feel lately about our future than it
does with anything else.
</P>
<P>
   This is the comedy of fear, the comedy of the insecure, the
comedy of the powerless. When you're scared, your first impulse is
to hurt someone else. To mock that which you are most afraid of
becoming. Which, if I recall correctly, is where I came in.

 &HT;    Electronic union warns GM: protect Ohio jobs
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The International Union of Electronic Workers is
warning the General Motors Corp. that it will be ``vigilant'' in
protecting blue-collar jobs once the automaker spins off the
world's largest auto parts company.
</P>
<P>
   National leaders for the IUE, which represents 11,000 GM workers
in the Miami Valley, said GM hasn't provided the union with ``all
the details'' of how their members would be affected after Delphi
Automotive Systems becomes an independent company next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that the spinoff has the potential to open new
opportunities that could benefit everyone involved, but to realize
these opportunities we truly believe that IUE must be involved in a
meaningful way,'' said Ed Fire, president if the International IUE.
</P>
<P>
   ``We join with the leaders of our local unions to let GM and
Delphi know that we will be vigilant in protecting the rights,
jobs, wages and benefits of our members as the spinoff moves
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IUE and GM leaders are meeting in Cleveland this week to discuss
the spinoff and other issues, including the financial losses that
continue to threaten the survival of Delphi's suspension parts
plant in Kettering, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Delphi officials believe an independent Delphi could mean
more business for local plants that supply parts to most of the
world's automakers.
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders, including the United Auto Workers, aren't
sure if the spinoff is a good move for Delphi's hourly work force.
</P>
<P>
   Like the IUE, the UAW vowed to protect jobs in a statement
following GM's decision to spin off its parts unit.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Delphi officials said they will work closely with the
UAW, the IUE and all their labor unions during the spinoff
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't respond to the UAW's statement either and won't
respond to the (IUE's spinoff comments),'' said GM spokesman Gerry
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the spinoff is complete, the Moraine Truck Assembly plant
will be the only factory out of nine local plants operating solely
under the world's largest automaker. A new diesel engine plant in
Moraine is expected to be a joint venture between GM and Isuzu
Motors. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IUE continues its struggle to keep a suspension
parts factory in Kettering operating under Delphi. The plant, which
employs about 3,000, has lost more than $50 million over the past
two years and is in danger of being sold before the spinoff unless
its financial problems can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from several automotive suppliers are interested in
buying the Kettering plant and have been touring the factory this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   IUE Local 755, which represents the Kettering plant, has already
accepted a three-tier wage scale at the Kettering plant that pays
new workers about $8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its recent strike settlement with the UAW, GM
promised not to sell or close two Delphi brake plants in Dayton
before January 2000. But the Kettering plant doesn't have the same
promise.
</P>

Y2K: YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) It's 500 days until the dawn of the year 2000, and
only recently has the general public begun to comprehend the
magnitude of the potential computer problem posed by the looming
zeros.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the mention of the so-called Y2K challenge to
computer systems brought puzzled looks from most people. Nowadays,
concern over the general chaos that 2000's arrival may bring seems
to rank right up there with fear of a stock market collapse.
Wherever thoughtful people gather, a frequent question is, ``What
do you think will happen when 2000 arrives?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Nobody knows; nor do they have any way of knowing.
The evolving high-tech world of the last half of the 20th century
leaves humankind in uncharted territory. Computer programmers have
routinely economized on memory space by abbreviating year dates
with only the last two digits. Thus, the fear is that 2000 will be
misread as 1900 and cause massive systemic failures.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to predictions of everything from global financial
system meltdown to airplanes falling out of the sky shortly after
the clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31, 1999. It has also led to
predictions that Y2K alarms are merely scams perpetrated by those
who stand to profit handsomely from dealing with a nonproblem.
</P>
<P>
   The reality probably lies somewhere between the panic of the
doomsters and the denial of the unconcerned. While it's difficult
to imagine the chaos envisioned by some, it's reasonable to expect
at least temporary disruptions in both our personal and commercial
lives. How extensive these disruptions will be is anybody's guess,
but pretending there won't be any seems folly, because computers
are critical to most normal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is likely to slow, but whether it will lead to a
recession depends on how severe the disruptions become. While some
economists warn that an economic downturn is a very real
possibility, the good news is that any recession is expected to be
relatively short, followed by a solid recovery.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 2000 bomb's effect on investments, the cost of fixing
the problem will be a drag on profits for the next few years for
many corporations. This no doubt means some companies will see
their stock prices diminished by this extraordinary hit to
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   On the more personal and mundane level, you might experience
problems getting your government check, money from an ATM, or
credit card transaction approval. Your electric power and phone
service might be disrupted, your auto may perform erratically or
not at all, and your VCR may go on the blink, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Computer dependency is more ubiquitous than most people
realize. This is why nobody can say with certainty how bad the 2000
bug hassles will become.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the enterprises that haven't begun to work on the
problem probably can't resolve it between now and Jan. 1, 2000,
even if they start today. Moreover, those who've had the foresight
to prepare for 2000's coming will in many cases find themselves at
the mercy of those who haven't. Even those best prepared for
disaster will become hapless victims of those who've procrastinated
for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any help from Uncle Sam, either. For the first time
since the federal government came to be perceived as the country's
primary problem-solver, government will find itself as vulnerable
to this threat as companies and individuals.

 &HT;    Analysis: Clinton defender Begala 'disappointed'
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving on (a) general news and (w) washington wires.)
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even for Paul Begala, Bill Clinton's heat shield,
this has been the week from hell. While he's made defending Clinton
almost an art form, he'd done it in the belief that Clinton was
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission Monday that he had 'misled' people, that he
really did have a relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, had to be a cruel slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I was disappointed that a
story I was told, and I believed, and I repeated, was not true,''
said Begala, counselor to the President. But he added that the
President's sin involved his private life, not public, and he had
at least finally come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Begala, 37, a former University of Texas at Austin student
president, took the heat because he's a believer. It may sound
corny, but it's true: He believes in democracy, in people, in good,
in the truth, in public service _ all with a passion that is
electric and contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rent you our heads, but we throw in our hearts for free,''
Begala and political mentor James Carville are fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Eller, formerly Clinton's director of media affairs, said
that when Begala commits to a candidate, ``it's almost like a
religion.'' ``He has a very strong faith in God to start with, and
that sort of translates into the strength of faith with the
candidates he works for and the issues he believes in,'' said
Eller, who joined Public Strategies Inc., an Austin business
consulting firm in 1994, a few months before Begala.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton finally admitted Monday that he'd misled his wife
and daughter about his behavior, that also meant he'd also broken
the faith with Begala.
</P>
<P>
   The good though wounded soldier, while admitting his
disappointment Tuesday, dutifully tried to put his boss in as
positive a light as possible. Begala praised Clinton for finally
admitting he'd ``misled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   Begala is no stranger to defending Clinton. He began learning to
do it in 1991 and especially 1992, when he and Carville were
running Clinton's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Begala was a chief defender of Clinton in February 1992, when
allegations about Clinton's sexual relationship with Gennifer
Flowers almost buried Clinton's presidential campaign in the snows
of New Hampshire. After the election, Begala was a consultant for
the President on the staff of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, when Clinton began to listen more to former
consultant Dick Morris than the team that had got him to the White
House in the first place, Begala returned to Austin. He worked for
Public Strategies headed by Jack Martin, who in the 1980s was
former U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's chief political guru.
</P>
<P>
   And Begala and I co-taught a class on politics and the press for
two semesters at The University of Texas at Austin, where his
passionate declaration to students that ``this (stuff) matters''
was almost a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is a genius when it comes to communicating with large
numbers of people,'' Martin said Wednesday. ``In addition, his
passion for his beliefs and convictions is very refreshing in
today's environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Morris resigned from Clinton's employ in mid-1996 in
the wake of revelations he had a long-term relationship with a
prostitute in Washington, the President's SOS for political savvy
reached Begala in Austin. In the summer of 1997, Clinton asked
Begala to come back as a top adviser. And Begala did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was motivated to return to Washington by a real
old-fashioned sense that he was serving his country,'' said Martin.
Steeped in political loyalty and public service from his own days
with Bentsen, Martin watched Begala go back to the White House with
a mixture of understanding and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an enormous sense for me, both personally and
professionally, that I had lost not only a valuable asset of our
firm, but a dear friend,'' Martin said. ``Paul could light up a
room with his intellect and enthusiasm like few people I ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala's goal was to help Clinton make his final term one of
pushing through some vital programs to help people, and
particularly children, in areas like education, health and others.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, the Lewinsky bombshell hit. Begala, who learned
of it when he picked up his newspaper on his front lawn in
Virginia, was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting hit in the head with a two-by-four,'' he
told a reporter a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   He went for his morning run that day, but he also went on the
offensive for Clinton. He went on talk shows. The True Believer
vociferously attacked the special counsel, Kenneth Starr, for an
``out of control'' investigation. ``There are serious questions of
wrongdoing here,'' Begala said in February on the NBC TV show
``Meet the Press,'' ``and I think we need a truly independent
investigation of the investigation itself, so that we can know
who's behind these lies, who is behind these leaks, and let the
investigation continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala's warlike approach didn't surprise Eller. ``What that
sort of true-believer mentality also means is that Paul can be very
tough when he's defending his candidates,'' Eller said. ``He can be
partisan. He can be personal at times. But he can be very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala and his friend and former co-worker at Public Strategies,
Mark McKinnon, cut their political teeth with Carville on Lloyd
Doggett's 1984 U.S. Senate campaign. McKinnon said back in January
that Begala was as good as they come in terms of loyalty and quick
wisdom under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in that situation, the one guy I would want to have
right beside me is Paul Begala,'' said McKinnon, who has since
signed on as media consultant for Texas' Republican Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   What about what's happened now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has a truly unique characteristic,'' said McKinnon
Wednesday. ``He goes to extraordinary lengths to see the good in
people. And sometimes that means overlooking flaws that may be
glaring to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when Paul said that he believed the president, I know he
actually believed the president. Some would say that that's naive,
but you have to know Paul to understand that his beliefs hinge on
an absolute devotion to the person or cause he's serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul will seek and find shreds of light even in the darkest of
circumstances. He's a true believer and the ultimate soldier. He
stays in the foxhole when everyone else retreats. And so it's
painful to watch as he's betrayed by his own commander and hit by
friendly fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala in January: ``I've been through a lot with this guy; I've
worked for him off and on for six years. I believe him completely,
and I know he's telling the truth. There is an investigation. It
will clear the president.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as Friday, Begala still hadn't heard directly from
Clinton that he had lied about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   What about Begala now?
</P>
<P>
   Begala is unlikely to follow the lead of some of the president's
former advisers, such as George Stephanopoulos or Dee Dee Meyers,
and trash Clinton on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt in my mind that Paul would be troubled
by some of this, but there's even less doubt that Paul would talk
about it in any way that would come across as non-professional,''
said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Begala repeated the question put to him by an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I think now? I think, you know, like (former
University of Texas football coach) Darrell Royal used to say, 'You
dance with them that brung you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never knowlingly mislead anyone,'' Begala said. ``But
I felt like I owed, and I feel I owe the President a debt of
loyalty, based on the job he's done for the country, but also how
much he's helped me in my career. ``So if the worst thing that can
be said about me is that I was loyal to someone who had been good
to me, I am comfortable with that. But again, I would be lying if I
said I was not disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eller thinks Begala's soft-pedaling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's incredibly disappointed in the President,'' Eller
said. ``Paul is the most loyal person you'd ever want to have on
his staff _ a guy who, once he believes, it takes a tremendous
amount to shake it. And I think he's had his faith shaken, and his
heart broken.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Begala plan to do? Well, while the President and
First Family are vacationing at Martha's Vineyard on the East
Coast, Begala will be some distance away. Today is the first day of
a two-week vacation for Begala, his wife Diane, and their three
young sons, in the mountains of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going fishing,'' Begala said. ``I'm getting my boys and
going off into the mountains and catch me some big ole brown trout,
and maybe a few rainbows. Wet a line.''

<P>
   If you're like me, you probably buy hazelnuts once a year for
holiday baking.
</P>
<P>
   Not Laura Barton.
</P>
<P>
   She freely admits to a year-round hazelnut obsession. So much
so, in fact, her office mates have nicknamed her the ``Hazelnut
Poster Child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love hazelnut butter,'' she says. ``I can eat it with a
spoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton is international trade manager for the Oregon Department
of Agriculture's agricultural development and marketing division.
Oregon grows 98 percent of the hazelnuts grown in the United
States. The state produced 40,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
   On her many travels, Barton has collected hazelnut food products
from around the world and displays the packaging in her office. In
Europe, where chefs are especially fond of the hazelnut's sweet,
creamy flavor, she found hazelnut M&AMP;M's and a hazelnut-flavored
Kraft brand cake mix.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, more hazelnut-flavored products are making
it to supermarket. Pepperidge Farms sells two types of hazelnut
cookies. Godiva uses hazelnut butter and paste in some of its
chocolate candies. Ben &AMP; Jerry has a hazelnut ice-cream flavor
called Totally Nuts-Dilbert Ice Cream.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for growers has been to produce value-added
products such as butters, pastes, oils and even chopped nuts sold
under such labels as Blue Diamond to encourage Americans to eat
more hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't sit by the fire and crack nuts anymore,'' Barton
says of the nut's seasonal aura.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelnuts are also grown in Turkey and Italy, but the Oregon
nut, called the Barcelona, is larger than its European cousin.
</P>
<P>
   An English sailor is reported to have planted the first hazelnut
tree in the United States back in 1858. Sometimes referred to as a
filbert, hazelnuts are a valuable source of protein and vitamins B,
C and E.

   In Oregon, the nuts are mechanically harvested and dried in
kilns for a cleaner product with less field debris. ``We've
cultivated the nuts so they grow up into a big canopy,'' Barton
says.
</P>
<P>
   Roasting the nuts brings out their flavor, according to Lucy
Gerspacher, the Oregon-based author of the Hazelnuts &AMP; More
Cookbook (Graphic Arts Center Publishing Co.).
</P>
<P>
   In a preheated 275-degree oven, spread shelled nuts in a shallow
baking pan and roast 20 to 30 minutes, until the skins crack and
the meat turns a light golden color. You can roast them at
350-degrees 7 to 8 minutes, but watch closely to be sure they don't
burn. In the microwave, roast on high power 3 to 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To remove skins, pour hot nuts in the center of a clean,
terry-cloth kitchen towel. Pull the towel up around the nuts and
twist lightly, making a hobo pack. Let stand to steam about 5
minutes. Vigorously rub the warm nuts in the towel until most of
the skins are removed. Don't be concerned if some of the skins
cling to the nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Store them in a freezer in plastic bags or an airtight
container. They will last up to two years.

 &HT;    Analysis: Clinton defender Begala 'disappointed'
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving on (a) general news and (w) washington wires.)
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even for Paul Begala, Bill Clinton's heat shield,
this has been the week from hell. While he's made defending Clinton
almost an art form, he'd done it in the belief that Clinton was
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission Monday that he had 'misled' people, that he
really did have a relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, had to be a cruel slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I was disappointed that a
story I was told, and I believed, and I repeated, was not true,''
said Begala, counselor to the President. But he added that the
President's sin involved his private life, not public, and he had
at least finally come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Begala, 37, a former University of Texas at Austin student
president, took the heat because he's a believer. It may sound
corny, but it's true: He believes in democracy, in people, in good,
in the truth, in public service _ all with a passion that is
electric and contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rent you our heads, but we throw in our hearts for free,''
Begala and political mentor James Carville are fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Eller, formerly Clinton's director of media affairs, said
that when Begala commits to a candidate, ``it's almost like a
religion.'' ``He has a very strong faith in God to start with, and
that sort of translates into the strength of faith with the
candidates he works for and the issues he believes in,'' said
Eller, who joined Public Strategies Inc., an Austin business
consulting firm in 1994, a few months before Begala.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton finally admitted Monday that he'd misled his wife
and daughter about his behavior, that also meant he'd also broken
the faith with Begala.
</P>
<P>
   The good though wounded soldier, while admitting his
disappointment Tuesday, dutifully tried to put his boss in as
positive a light as possible. Begala praised Clinton for finally
admitting he'd ``misled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   Begala is no stranger to defending Clinton. He began learning to
do it in 1991 and especially 1992, when he and Carville were
running Clinton's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Begala was a chief defender of Clinton in February 1992, when
allegations about Clinton's sexual relationship with Gennifer
Flowers almost buried Clinton's presidential campaign in the snows
of New Hampshire. After the election, Begala was a consultant for
the President on the staff of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, when Clinton began to listen more to former
consultant Dick Morris than the team that had got him to the White
House in the first place, Begala returned to Austin. He worked for
Public Strategies headed by Jack Martin, who in the 1980s was
former U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's chief political guru.
</P>
<P>
   And Begala and I co-taught a class on politics and the press for
two semesters at The University of Texas at Austin, where his
passionate declaration to students that ``this (stuff) matters''
was almost a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is a genius when it comes to communicating with large
numbers of people,'' Martin said Wednesday. ``In addition, his
passion for his beliefs and convictions is very refreshing in
today's environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Morris resigned from Clinton's employ in mid-1996 in
the wake of revelations he had a long-term relationship with a
prostitute in Washington, the President's SOS for political savvy
reached Begala in Austin. In the summer of 1997, Clinton asked
Begala to come back as a top adviser. And Begala did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was motivated to return to Washington by a real
old-fashioned sense that he was serving his country,'' said Martin.
Steeped in political loyalty and public service from his own days
with Bentsen, Martin watched Begala go back to the White House with
a mixture of understanding and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an enormous sense for me, both personally and
professionally, that I had lost not only a valuable asset of our
firm, but a dear friend,'' Martin said. ``Paul could light up a
room with his intellect and enthusiasm like few people I ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala's goal was to help Clinton make his final term one of
pushing through some vital programs to help people, and
particularly children, in areas like education, health and others.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, the Lewinsky bombshell hit. Begala, who learned
of it when he picked up his newspaper on his front lawn in
Virginia, was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting hit in the head with a two-by-four,'' he
told a reporter a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   He went for his morning run that day, but he also went on the
offensive for Clinton. He went on talk shows. The True Believer
vociferously attacked the special counsel, Kenneth Starr, for an
``out of control'' investigation. ``There are serious questions of
wrongdoing here,'' Begala said in February on the NBC TV show
``Meet the Press,'' ``and I think we need a truly independent
investigation of the investigation itself, so that we can know
who's behind these lies, who is behind these leaks, and let the
investigation continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala's warlike approach didn't surprise Eller. ``What that
sort of true-believer mentality also means is that Paul can be very
tough when he's defending his candidates,'' Eller said. ``He can be
partisan. He can be personal at times. But he can be very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala and his friend and former co-worker at Public Strategies,
Mark McKinnon, cut their political teeth with Carville on Lloyd
Doggett's 1984 U.S. Senate campaign. McKinnon said back in January
that Begala was as good as they come in terms of loyalty and quick
wisdom under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in that situation, the one guy I would want to have
right beside me is Paul Begala,'' said McKinnon, who has since
signed on as media consultant for Texas' Republican Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   What about what's happened now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has a truly unique characteristic,'' said McKinnon
Wednesday. ``He goes to extraordinary lengths to see the good in
people. And sometimes that means overlooking flaws that may be
glaring to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when Paul said that he believed the president, I know he
actually believed the president. Some would say that that's naive,
but you have to know Paul to understand that his beliefs hinge on
an absolute devotion to the person or cause he's serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul will seek and find shreds of light even in the darkest of
circumstances. He's a true believer and the ultimate soldier. He
stays in the foxhole when everyone else retreats. And so it's
painful to watch as he's betrayed by his own commander and hit by
friendly fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala in January: ``I've been through a lot with this guy; I've
worked for him off and on for six years. I believe him completely,
and I know he's telling the truth. There is an investigation. It
will clear the president.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as Friday, Begala still hadn't heard directly from
Clinton that he had lied about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   What about Begala now?
</P>
<P>
   Begala is unlikely to follow the lead of some of the president's
former advisers, such as George Stephanopoulos or Dee Dee Meyers,
and trash Clinton on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt in my mind that Paul would be troubled
by some of this, but there's even less doubt that Paul would talk
about it in any way that would come across as non-professional,''
said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Begala repeated the question put to him by an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I think now? I think, you know, like (former
University of Texas football coach) Darrell Royal used to say, 'You
dance with them that brung you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never knowlingly mislead anyone,'' Begala said. ``But
I felt like I owed, and I feel I owe the President a debt of
loyalty, based on the job he's done for the country, but also how
much he's helped me in my career. ``So if the worst thing that can
be said about me is that I was loyal to someone who had been good
to me, I am comfortable with that. But again, I would be lying if I
said I was not disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eller thinks Begala's soft-pedaling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's incredibly disappointed in the President,'' Eller
said. ``Paul is the most loyal person you'd ever want to have on
his staff _ a guy who, once he believes, it takes a tremendous
amount to shake it. And I think he's had his faith shaken, and his
heart broken.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Begala plan to do? Well, while the President and
First Family are vacationing at Martha's Vineyard on the East
Coast, Begala will be some distance away. Today is the first day of
a two-week vacation for Begala, his wife Diane, and their three
young sons, in the mountains of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going fishing,'' Begala said. ``I'm getting my boys and
going off into the mountains and catch me some big ole brown trout,
and maybe a few rainbows. Wet a line.''

BRUINS OWNER MAKES CASE FOR CLEVELAND BROWNS OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs made his pitch to own the Cleveland
Browns Wednesday in front of National Football League owners, but
his bid may ultimately require him to choose between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs received strongly positive reviews from various sources
Wednesdayfor his presentation in Atlanta, which included a
statement from Bruins president-general manager Harry Sinden, who
traveled with him. Among those praising the effort was an important
member of the NFL's Expansion Committee, Patriots owner Robert
Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and the committee are now charged with whittling the
Jacobs proposal and six others presented Wednesday to a final group
of two or three before presenting them for a final vote by all 30
owners Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jeremy and his people did very, very well,'' Kraft
said. ``Indeed, the best thing that happened today is that after
the disaster that occurred in Cleveland three years ago, with the
team leaving a great football town, we now know that we really have
some good proposals to choose from. All of the groups did very
well, along with Jeremy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs may face a choice of his own: Does he want to own an
NFL franchise in Cleveland or a National Hockey League franchise in
Boston?
</P>
<P>
   A league rule prohibits anyone from owning an NFL team who
already owns a team in another sport in a market where there is an
NFL team. The so-called cross-ownership rule would, for example,
prohibit owners of the Red Sox, Celtics, and Bruins from owning an
NFL team because of the presence of the Patriots in their market.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is in place, and favored by many of the more veteran
NFL owners, because it discourages owners from competing with each
other for sponsorship money, for fan support, and potentially on
some provisions of television contracts. Other potential conflicts
the rule seeks to avoid are stadium financing and siting issues
within the same market.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Jacobs expressed confidence Wednesdaythat he
can manage to work around the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL will tell you for the record that the rule exists and
everyone must abide by it,'' he said. ``But we think there are ways
of dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the source added, ``if owning the Bruins prohibits
him from owning the Browns, he is going to keep the Bruins. The
Browns would definitely be out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was not available for comment. FleetCenter president
Richard Krezwick, who also traveled with Jacobs and participated in
the presentation, said Jacobs's sympathies are strongly with the
Bruins _ one of the ``Original Six'' NHL franchises, which he has
owned for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told everyone Wednesday that he loves the Bruins,''
Krezwick said.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the Bruins are considered by observers to be
among the most profitable of NHL teams, NFL franchises are almost
always more profitable. And the Browns franchise is a particularly
handsome opportunity, with a new stadium under construction and
paid for and a solid base of rabid football fans in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are considered so attractive, in fact, that some NFL
owners say they could ultimately attract a bid as high as $1
billion, and there is general agreement that they will eventually
be sold for at least $500 million and approach the record price tag
for a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who owns the Delaware North Companies, is said by
observers to be worth about $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   But others vying to own the Browns have similarly deep pockets,
and most have substantial contacts with Cleveland, including
enlisting former Browns players to be a part of their ownership
teams.
</P>
<P>
   While Delaware North's Sports Service concession company
provides concessions at Jacobs Field for the Cleveland Indians,
Jacobs's only other boast of roots in Cleveland appears to be that
his companies' headquarters is about 170 miles away, in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Others vying to own the Browns are: Bertram Wolstein, a suburban
Cleveland real estate developer who has been joined by former
Browns superstar running back Jim Brown as a consultant; Cleveland
lawyer Larry Dolan and his brother Charles, the chairman of
Cablevision Systems, one of the largest cable providers in the
country; businessman and banker Alfred Lerner; Richard Jacobs, who
owns the Indians and is no relation to Jeremy; Cleveland area toy
retailer Thomas Murdough; and New York real estaste developer
Howard Milstein.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said the next step in the process will be for owners on
the Expansion Committee to review the relative financial strengths
of the proposals, with strong guidance from Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me feel very good about this meeting today was that
we are left with very strong alternatives,'' Kraft said. ``When the
Browns left the league and the commissioner set out to form a very
strong private-public partnership between the civic leaders and the
business community, that has resulted in really putting the Browns
back into business.''

KABILA SEEKS FOREIGN SUPPORT TO REPEL CONGO REBELS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ As rebels closed in on this capital on
Wednesday, President Laurent Kabila scrambled to secure foreign
military support to repel a final assault.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe announced Wednesday night that it was immediately
sending aircraft, weapons and other support for the embattled
government. Kabila also won pledges of military support from Kenya
and Angola against the two-week rebellion, which is led by ethnic
Tutsi from eastern Congo, and reportedly being backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts increased pressure on the rebels to capture Kinshasa
quickly, before the government gains reinforcements. But Kabila was
unable to gain the larger political cover of a group of 14 African
nations. One leading member, South Africa, dismissed the idea of
sending arms.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's support was the first real fruit of intense efforts
by Kabila, who has become known for a lack of diplomatic skill, to
obtain outside support for his weakened and disorganized army. It
followed contradictory statements made by governments whose support
he had sought.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, of defense
ministers from the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community, the region's main political and economic organization,
Zimbabwe said, though prematurely, that the group as a whole would
supply arms and men to Kabila's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to respond positively in a manner that will help
the government of President Kabila to restore peace and
stability,'' said Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe. In a
separate statement, Mugabe's defense minister, Moven Mahachi, told
the BBC on Tuesday that Zimbabwe would immediately begin sending
airplanes and other assistance to the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, in a statement that revealed a rift in the
regional organization, South Africa, the head of the group and a
sometimes diplomatic rival of Zimbabwe, rejected weapons shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is clear,'' Nelson Mandela, the South African
president, said Wednesday. ``We are not going to make the situation
worse by sending a military force. We are for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Late on Wednesday the mounting regional support for Kabila
brought about a seeming concession from rebel leaders who told
journalists at a news conference in the eastern Congolese city of
Goma that the rebellion would consider negotiations with the
government. Until now, talks with Kabila had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels now control a huge eastern swath of Congo and much of
the territory southwest of Kinshasa, a critical region for
transportation and power to the capital. It was unclear Wednesday
night how significant the help from individual countries would be
and whether it would arrive soon enough to stop the rebels, who
tore through military lines southwest of here and deepened the
disarray among government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of confusion in Kabila's government was underscored by
a senior official who, in a briefing with reporters, used the past
tense to assess Kabila's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at a map of the country bearing its former name of
Zaire, the official at first said that the government defense line
lay in the city of Songololo, about 130 miles southwest of here;
then, after inching his finger eastward, he agreed that the line
was most likely in Kisantu, just 75 miles from this city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny kind of war,'' he said finally. He added, ``If
Kinshasa falls, it's absolutely the end.'' The official said he was
pessimistic about Kabila being able to effectively continue the war
from his southern redoubt of Lubumbashi, where he was staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to continue the war with what means?'' he asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government's desperate need for military resources also
arose indirectly during a television interview that Didier Mumengi,
the information minister, held late Tuesday with friendly local
reporters. Mumengi said the government had been dropping bombs on
rebel areas in the southwest, after which one reporter replied;
``But Mr. Minister, we don't have an air force.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have used the local newspapers and
television stations to present a rosy, and often misleading,
picture to Kinshasa's 5 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the propaganda campaign, the government has been
overwhelmed with bad news. On Monday, the rebels recaptured the
huge hydroelectric dam in Inga, about 200 miles away on the Congo
River; they shut off the power supply to this region, leaving
Kinshasa in the dark, as well as Brazzaville, across the river in
the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The outage added to the city's edginess. Gunfire could be heard
throughout the night, and some shots rang out during the day.
Residents near the main prison of Makala said that a riot took
place inside the facility, and that shots were exchanged between
guards and prisoners, including former military officials of Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment in Kinshasa has turned against the Rwandans who at
first helped Kabila come to power. ``We are against these
aggressors,'' said Jeremie Kimbanzia, 43, who was sharing beers
with five other men in La Cite, a gritty residential area, after
the rebels cut off power on Monday. ``Because of them, we don't
have power, and it was difficult to find bread this morning. We
will oppose them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're devils,'' said Jose Mbele, 44.

U.S. AND AFGHAN OFFICIALS DISCUSS AFRICA BOMBING SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AFRICA-KENYA-HOTEL) 
(bl) 
 This article was reported by Steven Erlanger, James Risen and Tim
Weiner. It was written by Risen.  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As U.S. officials focus on a Saudi exile, Osama bin
Laden, as a prime suspect in the embassy bombings in Africa, they
are discussing strategies for how they might negotiate his capture
with the Taliban, the group that controls Afghanistan, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, a high-ranking official of the Taliban opened
the door Wednesday to such discussions. Since 1996, the Taliban has
sheltered bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi whom the United States calls
one of the world's leading financiers of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil, the spokesman for the Taliban and the
second-highest ranking official in the Taliban's Supreme Council,
said in a telephone interview from Afghanistan that if the United
States provides hard evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the
bombings, the Taliban would be willing to meet with U.S. officials
to discuss what to do about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that the U.S. is continuing to
investigate this matter, and there isn't any solid evidence of his
involvement,'' Mutawakil said. `If you call someone a terrorist,
you must have proof. If there is proof, we will certainly sit down
and talk to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mutawakil's comments served more to raise difficult
questions for U.S. policy-makers than to open any immediate
prospect of a resolution to the investigation of the twin bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is no way for U.S. officials to be certain that
Mutawakil speaks for a unified Taliban, or that the organization
would ultimately be willing to deliver bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal would be complicated _ or shortcircuited _ by
Washington's other longstanding complaints with the Taliban. Those
include its harsh treatment of women and other human-rights
questions and its involvement in narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be a good time to negotiate with the Taliban.
Having nearly defeated their internal opposition, the Taliban is
desperate for international recognition and economic support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any deal for bin Laden would almost certainly also have to
involve Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's cooperation with the bombing
investigation in recent days, U.S.-Pakistani relations remain
complicated following Pakistan's nuclear test earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. officials are deliberating whether they can provide
incentives to the Taliban win their cooperation in helping to bring
bin Laden to face any charges that may be filed against him in the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   No such charges have yet been brought, but senior Clinton
administration officials say that he is their leading suspect.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials reacted cautiously to Mutawakil's statement,
noting that they are not yet ready to open talks with the Taliban
concerning bin Laden. ``If we get to that point, then we'll deal
with it,'' a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had discussions with the Taliban in the past about bin
Laden. And if we were to establish information that shows he did
not live up to his obligations as a `guest' in Afghanistan, then we
would provide it to the Taliban, and certainly take up'' this
suggestion of direct talks on bin Laden, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been conflicting statements from the Taliban's
leadership in recent days about their willingness to deal with the
United States on bin Laden. Mutawakil's statements came on the
heels of hard-line comments made earlier Wednesday by other senior
Taliban officials, including the fundamentalist group's leader,
Mullah Mohammad Omar, vowing to protect bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Omar, insisting that bin Laden was not involved in the
bombings, vowed to the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press that
``even if all the countries of the world unite, we would defend
Osama with our blood.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that such contradictions may signal a split
within the Taliban leadership over their relationship with bin
Laden, a Saudi exile who helped finance the Afghan rebels in their
war against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Some U.S. officials
believe that there is a faction within the Taliban that sees him as
a liability that they inherited from the previous Afghan
government.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberate how to approach the Taliban in the future,
U.S. officials said flatly that they would not trade bin Laden's
capture for U.S. recognition for the Taliban's de facto government.
But they said the administration is now weighing other ways to
convince the Afghan movement to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy may be the only answer, since several U.S. officials
said that a military or covert operation to capture bin Laden is
unlikely or impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the United States is considering a
military operation against his compound, despite rumors to that
effect in Pakistan. The U.S. ambassador in Pakistan, Thomas Simons,
has dismissed the possibility that the United States would use
Pakistan as a staging ground for a military assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shoot a Tomahawk at Kandahar from some ship in the
ocean,'' said one diplomat in the region. ``It would take
infantry.'' Any land-based military operation would almost
certainly have to be launched from Pakistan, whose interior
minister, Shujat Hussain, flatly ruled out such a mission
Wednesday. ``We cannot be a party to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A covert mission to flush bin Laden out of hiding is
conceivable. Last year, the CIA and FBI lured Mir Amal Kansi, the
convicted killer of two CIA employees, out of hiding in Afghanistan
to a hotel in Pakistan, where he was arrested after a
four-and-a-half year manhunt. But bin Laden has much greater
financial and political resources than Kansi, and is far less
likely to succumb to trickery or fall into a trap laid by U.S.
intelligence operatives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A senior diplomatic official familiar with the Taliban's
leadership said: ``If bin Laden is involved, they've got a big
bargaining chip,'' one that they might use to negotiate for the
international recognition they strongly desire.
</P>
<P>
   `We may be on the verge of a new relationship of Taliban to the
world, and if they insist on calling themselves a government they
may have to act more like a government, with international norms
and responsibilities,'' another senior U.S. official added. ``That
includes restraining terrorism, which touches on the issue of his
residence in Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, visiting the bombed U.S. embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright first raised the issue
of the Taliban's turning over bin Laden when she said that the
Taliban would improve its chances for international recognition if
it stopped sheltering known or suspected terrorists like bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet U.S. officials have been frustrated in their previous
attempts to win the support of the Taliban leadership in curbing
terrorism. In April, in fact, Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, met with Taliban leaders in Afghanistan to
discuss bin Laden, but Taliban leaders rejected his request that
they extradite him.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Africa bombings, the United States suspected bin
Laden had also been involved in the bombings of U.S. military
facilities in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have told State Department officials that Bin Laden
has guaranteed them, after Saudi Arabia demanded such a guarantee,
that he will not conduct terrorist activities from inside
Afghanistan; this is thought to be an empty promise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bin Laden is thought to pay the Taliban for this
sanctuary, in part out of his profits from his legitimate
businesses and, allegedly, narcotics dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Any U.S. negotiations with the Taliban will have to involve
Pakistan. While Pakistan has close military and intelligence ties
to the United States _ ties that have proved crucial in the
spreading investigation of the embassy bombings _ Pakistan's rulers
are furious over U.S. sanctions imposed on the country after it
tested a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A bargain with Pakistan could bring Washington's goal of
non-proliferation _ stopping the spread of nuclear weapons _ in
conflict with its counterterrorism goals.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and other U.S.
diplomats will meet with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shamshad Ahmad
next Tuesday in London. U.S. efforts to get Pakistani and Indian
cooperation to halt new tests and the weaponization of their
nuclear knowledge are high on the agenda. So are the Taliban and
bin Laden.

APPEALS COURT CLOSES MICROSOFT INTERVIEWS TO PUBLIC, NEWS MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. won another victory in its antitrust battle
Wednesday when a federal appeals court ruled that chairman Bill
Gates and other executives may give pretrial depositions without
reporters or the public present.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said it will issue a final decision in the
matter sometime after Sept. 29, three weeks after the antitrust
trial is scheduled to begin, although that Sept. 8 date could also
be moved back.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company was ``gratified'' by the
ruling, and that it ``will allow depositions of its executives to
move forward without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for news organizations that sought to attend the
depositions expressed dissapointment, saying the judges gave too
little weight to the public's right of access to testimony as it is
given, without delay. They also warned that the question could be
moot if the judges don't settle it for six weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they hear it, much of this may already be under
the bridge,'' said Josh Koltun, one of the news organizations'
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to start Sept. 8, but that could change
at a conference this morning with U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson. Both Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice
have asked Jackson for a two-week delay, in part because of delays
in taking depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the judge reluctantly granted the news organizations'
motion to open the depositions, saying he had little choice given
the plain language of the 1913 statute on which they based their
request. He ordered the participants to work out the details of how
to conduct the sessions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft immediately appealed, saying it feared the disclosure
of sensitive business information if reporters and the public were
allowed to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued trial procedures have changed since the 1913
law requiring openness in depostions in antitrust cases. In 1937,
new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, governing such
proceedings as gathering testimony in depositions. Those rules
appear to conflict with the 1913 law.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel didn't rule Wednesday on the legal issues.
Instead it gave the participants until Sept. 29 to finish filing
the documents it will consider in its decision.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the case moving forward, it said the Microsoft
executives could be questioned under the normal procedures for
legal depositions. The two sides agreed earlier on rules for
restricting access to sensitive information gathered in closed
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to let the depositions proceed, the panel said the
``balance of harms'' favors Microsoft. If they were taken in public
and the company later wins its appeal, ``the disclosure could not
be undisclosed,'' they wrote. But if Microsoft loses, the text and
videotape of a private deposition can then be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves claims by federal and state antitrust
regulators that Microsoft has illegally forced computer makers to
accept its Internet browsing software if they also want its Windows
operating system for personal computers, for which they have no
real alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's actions have been harmful to competition, and
particularly to its main rival in the browser market, Netscape
Communications, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it has integrated the two software products _ the
browser and the operating system _ in ways that benefit consumers.
A June ruling by the appeals court in a related case supports that
view, Microsoft said recently when it asked Jackson to issue a
summary judgment to end the case _ a move not considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Microsoft was hit Wednesday with a new antitrust
lawsuit by a Connecticut company that accuses it of withholding
technical information vital to its business in order to impede
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology of Danbury, Conn., makes software that
converts Windows programs to run on other operating systems, such
as Unix. In 1994 it signed an agreement that it says entitles it to
detailed technical information known as ``source code'' from
Microsoft to make its own products work better, as well as advance
warning if Microsoft planned to change the source code.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after ``creating a dependency'' on that information for
Bristol and its customers, Microsoft is withholding it, the company
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol is very disappointed that it was necessary to sue to
obtain what Microsoft has said all along it would provide us,''
said Keith Blackwell, the company's chairman and president.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan dismissed Bristol's claim as
``wholly without merit,'' saying it was trying to elevate a
``routine business negotiation'' into a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have been negotiating terms of a new license
agreement, Cullinan said, but Bristol broke off the talks ``without
any prior notice to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have accepted the same license terms that
Bristol rejected, he said.

BARNICLE RESIGNATION MET WITH SADNESS, RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Like a defeated figure in one of his own columns, Mike
Barnicle resigned the only newspaper job he said he ever wanted
Wednesday _ a decision met with relief, glee, and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   When Globe Editor Matthew V. Storin announced the newspaper's
top columnist's resignation during a late-afternoon newsroom
meeting, there was pin-drop silence followed by some stone-faced
head-shaking _ and some wide smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just two months after another of the paper's Metro
columnist, Patricia Smith, was forced to resign for the same
offense _ mixing fiction with fact _ most Globe staffers seemed
eager to write the epilogue to an embarrassing episode that had
stirred a national debate about journalistic ethics and had become
grist for local ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' said David Armstrong, a reporter at the Globe
for five years. ``I remain angered by the great harm both of these
cases caused to the reputation of all honest reporters and editors
at the Globe, but at least we can now go about the business of
repairing the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's resignation capped two weeks of unusual tumult at the
newspaper, which found itself defending charges of a
double-standard after it first called for, and days later,
rescinded a call for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   His departure Wednesday was cheered by some community leaders,
who met last week with top Globe officials to discuss how the
newspaper deals with and promotes its minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to keep him at first, the Globe management was
putting out a fire with gasoline,'' said the Rev. Jeffrey Brown,
chairman of the Boston Ten Point Coalition. ``I'm hoping this is a
step in the right direction in terms of the Globe not only
addressing its journalistic integrity, but also addressing issues
of diversity at the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Washington-based Center for
Media and Public Affairs, called Barnicle a tragic figure out of an
old-school newsroom that has little place in modern-day journalism
whose standards, he said, are increasingly unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to recognize that there's more to journalism
than printing the facts,'' Lichter said. ``There is catching the
flavor of a city and connecting with ordinary people. And in that
style of journalism, there were those who took some liberties with
the facts to make that connection. You can't justify it. And, yet,
it's sad to see it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran Globe staffers were sad to see Barnicle, who some
said was synonymous with the Globe among the newspaper's
readership, forced from the most conspicuous job at the paper after
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a tragedy,'' said Stan Grossfeld, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographer and associate editor at the paper. ``I'm
really saddened by it. It's bad for the paper and the readers and
all of us. He's been the subject of a witch hunt. He's been a
franchise player for this paper and I'd like to hear from him what
he has to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian McGrory, who covers the White House for the Globe, called
Barnicle's resignation an ``incredibly sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who laughs or cheers about this doesn't understand the
institution, the business, or what we mean to the community and
what Barnicle has meant to the community for a quarter of a
century. This is nobody's victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after Storin's unusual decision last week to retain
Barnicle after he confessed to being lazy and sloppy for allowing
jokes from a George Carlin book to appears in an Aug. 2 column,
about 50 staffers signed a petition disagreeing with that decision,
saying it sent the wrong message about the newspaper's standards.
</P>
<P>
   And, they said, any applause in the Globe's newsroom was for a
reaffirmation of those standards and not for downfall of a
long-time Globe employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I still strongly disagree with the Globe's decision to
simply suspend Barnicle initially, I am very pleased that the
newspaper acted quickly to seek his termination after learning
about this latest outrageous episode of fabrication,'' said Diego
Ribadeneira, a 12-year veteran and the paper's religion writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It restores some of my faith in the standards that this paper
claims to embrace,'' he said. ``I hope the Globe continues to
investigate and make public all allegations regarding Barnicle's
work that continue to stream in. Barnicle apparently is incapable
of doing his job honestly and with integrity. Someone like that _
no matter his name recognition, popularity with readers or the
clout he enjoys with the white establishment media _ has no
business working at this newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kurkjian, an investigative reporter and editor at the
Globe for 30 years, said that once the Barnicle furor subsides and
newsroom divisions heal, he hopes people will recall the voice the
columnist gave people from Beacon Hill to Roxbury Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he got too stretched from all his other outside
obligations that he couldn't maintain the past quality of his
columns; maybe he became alienated from others who work so hard
around here to make the paper compelling and straight as it is, and
forgot the rules we all operate under,'' said Kurkjian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the specific reasons for his failings but I do
know that he was not a fraud or a trimmer. Any police reporter
working a major crime story could attest to that. Tipped off to the
tragedy by some pal in the police department, Barnicle was
inevitably there with his notebook out, and the information that
filled it _ whether observations or quotes from cops, eyewitnesses
or family members _ he never hesitated to share with any Globe
reporters who asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, who had promised to reduce his outside appearances
after his suspension was rescinded last week, was not left
unemployed by the Globe's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at WCVB-TV, Channel 5, where Barnicle works as a
member of its magazine show, ``Chronicle,'' said it is keeping him
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point of view is that in the 15 years that Mike has been
on our air, we have found one three-second transgression,'' said
Elizabeth Cheng, the station's programming director. ``The nature
of newspapers and television are very different. One person can't
get a story on the air. It takes a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Zachary R. Dowdy, a Globe reporter and president of the Boston
Association of Black Journalists, said he is relieved that the
controversy is finally over, ``putting several months of racial
tension in the city and the journalism world behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the Globe asked for Barnicle's resignation because of
fabrications mirrors the punishment given to Patricia Smith, which
also obliterates the appearance of the double standard that
surfaced a week ago when the Globe flip-flopped on its decision to
release him.''

EX-KLANSMAN TESTIFIES ON HOW FATAL FIREBOMBING WAS PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ In the vernacular of the White Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi in the violent 1960s, a ``No. 1''
was a cross burning, and a ``No. 2,'' a whipping. A ``No. 3'' was a
firebombing, and ``No. 4,'' the most severe punishment of all, was
killing. Only the highest-ranking Klansmen could order a No. 3 and
No. 4, said Billy Roy Pitts, a foot soldier in the White Knights in
the winter of 1965-66.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Bowers was the only man who could order a No. 3 and No. 4
in the White Knights in the state of Mississippi,'' Pitts testified
here Wednesday in Bowers' murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, a 73-year-old former Klan leader being tried for the
fifth time for ordering the death of Vernon Dahmer, a civil rights
leader killed by the firebombing of his home on Jan. 10, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, now 54 and serving time for his part in the killing, told
the jury that he gathered with other Klansmen that winter in a
farmhouse near Laurel, Miss., for a special meeting _ special
because Bowers, the Imperial Wizard who led the Mississippi White
Knights, had come to see them in person, to order Dahmer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts testified that Bowers ordered the murder of Dahmer because
he had worked to register blacks to vote in Forrest County.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said Bowers was visibly angry at the meeting because the
Forrest County Klan had been lenient, doing nothing to silence
Dahmer, the respected merchant, farmer and local NAACP official who
offered his small store in the Kelly Setttlement community outside
Hattiesburg as a place blacks could pay their poll tax.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said Bowers, a businessman in Laurel, later told him:
``Don't worry. No jury in the state of Mississippi is going to
convict a white man for killing'' someone black.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bowers presided over other meetings where Klansmen
planned the firebombing of Dahmer's home and store, and that the
lawyer who is defending Bowers' in this trial, Travis Buckley, also
attended discussions of the plot to firebomb the house.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an outburst from Buckley, who demanded a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so inflammatory,'' said Buckley, who was indicted in the
Dahmer case three decades ago but was later cleared of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecuting attorney, Robert Helfrich, said his office had
filed a motion before the trial pointing out a possible conflict of
interest if Buckley tried the case, but that Bowers insisted that
Buckley serve as his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come up again that Mr. Buckley was there, by
this witness and other witnesses,'' said Helfrich.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard McKenzie denied the mistrial motion but told the
jury to disregard what they had heard about Buckley. When asked if
they could do that, the jurors _ six blacks, five whites and one
Asian-American _ nodded.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the most lively exchange in a day of courtroom
activity that opened up the Klan's strategy in the 1960s. When
another former Klansman, T. Webber Rogers, refused to tell the
court where he lived, the judge asked him if he did so because he
was afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah,'' blurted Rogers, who said he has been shot at
since testifying against the Klan in previous cases. The judge then
admonished him for using such language in court.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom laughed at that, but there was only silence as the
former Klansmen explained how the killing was planned and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the information coming out of this trial seems new in
1998, it is hardly so. Bowers has been on trial in the Dahmer
murder four times before, always walking free after deadlocked
juries of white males. He did serve time _ six years in connection
with one of the killings of the three civil rights workers in
Neshoba County in 1964 _ but no prosecutor has ever successfully
linked him to Dahmer's murder.
</P>
<P>
   As Bowers sat in the courtroom in his off-white suit, seeming
uninterested, Rogers described how angry a younger version of the
defendant had been on a winter night years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to know why that job down south hadn't been done,''
said Rogers. ``He wanted it done, and he wanted it done right. He
said it should have been done two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and other Klansmen took part in what Bowers called a
``dry run,'' piling into cars and driving past the Dahmers' house.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers is not accused of being at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he also did not take part in the actual killing. But
Pitts admitted being there. He told a story he has told before, in
trials that led to the convictions of four other men in Dahmer's
murder, of how eight men in two cars, the trunks loaded with
shotguns and 12 gallons of gasoline, rumbled toward the Dahmers'
home.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped at a black cemetery near there, and one of the
Klansmen urinated on a grave. Then, the others did, too.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bowers had sent him along as a guard, armed with a
pistol, to watch over the others. But as Dahmer, his body on fire,
fired a shotgun over and over from a window to give his wife and
children time to escape, Pitts said he dropped the pistol, unfired.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could hear Dahmer calling from inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer, his lungs seared by the flames, died in a hospital 12
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man's life was taken and I was part of it,'' Pitts said.
``It's something I can't get out of my mind. I wish to God I had
never been a part of it . . . I destroyed a family.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving a short federal sentence for his part in the
killing, Pitts was supposed to serve a life sentence in Mississippi
state prison. But, probably because he cooperated in the
investigation, he never actually did time in state prison. Pitts
said he was told by authorities he did not have to, but he was
never officially pardoned. In January, The Jackson Clarion-Ledger
reported that fact, and Pitts is now serving that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who has argued that his client is the victim of a
federal conspiracy, asked Pitts if the federal government gave him
money for his girlfriend in the 1960s. Pitts was married at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said federal investigators did give him about $8,000 over
time _ informants are often paid money _ but that money went to his
wife and children, not his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you're gettin' at and I'll save you a lot of
time,'' said Pitts to Buckley, when the lawyer first mentioned the
woman's name. ``I told you before, I ain't no saint.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he used the money to relocate his family, because he
feared the Klan would harm them.

BRISTOL TECHNOLOGY FILES ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., Wash.)  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 (af) 
By STEVE LOHR  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has a fresh antitrust challenge on its hands
from an unlikely source _ a small software supplier in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in broad terms the suit filed late on Tuesday by Bristol
Technology Inc. echoes the themes of the broad antitrust complaint
against Microsoft, which was filed in May by the federal government
and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases contend that Microsoft has violated the Sherman Act
by illegally seeking to protect and expand its monopoly in the
market for desktop software for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology has hired lawyers who are veterans of the IBM
antitrust wars, just as the Justice Department has done. And while
Bristol Technology's antitrust case is a private suit, it is
seeking the enlist the support of the government and states.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is one of the states suing Microsoft, and Richard
Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, said Wednesday
that the accusations in the Bristol Technology case appeared to be
consistent with the view of the government and states that
Microsoft is given to predatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the type of conduct that prompted the state to
sue Microsoft, which we believe has abused its monopoly power,''
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology's executives and its lawyers said they had
scheduled a meeting later this week with officials of the Justice
Department in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that the private antitrust suit, like the
government's case, is groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is trying to elevate a routine business
negotiation into a federal case,'' said Greg Shaw, a Microsoft
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology of Danbury, Conn., makes software tools that
enable programs originally written to run on Microsoft's Windows
operating system to run also on other operating systems, including
Unix, a powerful operating system widely used on engineering work
stations, and OS/390, the dominant operating system for mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, filed in federal district court in Bridgeport,
Conn., Bristol Technology accused Microsoft of ``entangling Bristol
in a charade to stifle competition from other operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology's programming tools are sold in the business
market to allow corporations to run many different kinds of
software. It was in 1991, according to the suit, that Microsoft
first approached Bristol Technology. That was two years before
Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system, Windows NT, was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Microsoft was pleased to support a software
company that enabled more Windows-based applications to be used in
the corporate market, a stronghold for Unix work stations and Unix
computer networks. After lengthy negotiations, Microsoft and
Bristol Technology signed a three-year agreement in September 1994,
under which the Connecticut company licensed the programming code
for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the so-called source code helped Bristol Technology
improve its tools, so Windows applications ran smoothly on Unix
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last couple of years, Windows NT has become a
mainstream operating system for corporate work stations and
networks, often replacing Unix systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the licensing agreement expired last September, Keith
Blackwell, president of Bristol Technology, said that Microsoft
offered only drastically altered terms _ a fivefold price increase
and restricted access to the Windows NT source code.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that the conditions under which it licenses its
intellectual property to others is up to Microsoft and that at
least one other software supplier has recently agreed to its new
terms.
</P>
<P>
   At Bristol Technology, however, the shift in contract terms is
seen as an effort to speed the shift to Windows NT and away from
rival Unix systems. ``It looks as if Microsoft is trying to force
people to switch to NT,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also contends that the Windows code is an ``essential
facility'' to a company like Bristol Technology, and it quotes from
a Microsoft document saying that Microsoft is committed to
providing its licensees ``with future versions of Windows family
source code.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology contends that Microsoft has now abandoned
that promise. ``Microsoft set out to invite this use of its
intellectual property,'' said Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny
&AMP; Myers, an antitrust litigator who represented IBM in several
private suits. ``And Bristol, while a tiny company, has a gateway
technology that helps to preserve competition between Windows and
Unix.'' &QL;

FACED WITH MORE QUESTIONS, BARNICLE RESIGNS FROM BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>

resignation, and GLOBE-COLUMN, a reprint of the 1995 Barnicle
column that prompted the latest inquiry into Barnicle's reporting.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight days after salvaging his career at The Boston Globe,
columnist Mike Barnicle resigned Wednesday, at the newspaper's
request, after editors could find no evidence that two young cancer
victims described in a 1995 column ever existed.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle told his editors Tuesday that he had been given the
story by a nurse whose name he could not recall. He also said he
had never tried to contact the boys' families.
</P>
<P>
   Globe Editor Matthew Storin said in a statement Wednesday: ``In
light of his failure to follow the most basic reporting
requirements as well as the duplicitous way in which the story was
written, it is clear that Mike Barnicle can no longer write for The
Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt end of Barnicle's Globe career was perhaps the final
act in a wrenching summer at the newspaper, which has now lost two
of its most popular metropolitan columnists, a lyrical black woman,
Patricia Smith, and a rough-edged white man, Barnicle, to charges
of journalistic malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Storin had been alerted to the 1995 column on Monday by Kenneth
Tomlinson, a retired editor of Reader's Digest. Tomlinson, whose
own son had survived a spinal tumor, was moved when he read the
Oct. 8, 1995, column and sought to reprint it.
</P>
<P>
   But fact-checkers from Reader's Digest, who contacted Children's
Hospital and checked various cancer societies, could find no
evidence of the boys' existence. Eventually, Tomlinson said
Wednesday, he decided the column was fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, in a statement that was by turns gracious and
resentful, said Wednesday that he felt consumed by a ``media
feeding frenzy,'' with his work of 25 years _ some 4,000 columns _
under scrutiny. ``Just in the last 24 hours, I was asked to explain
circumstances and columns written in 1973, 1981, 1986 and 1995 and
was given 24 hours _ a single day's news cycle _ to rebut all the
allegations at once,'' Barnicle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this is not what I want to do with my life. And it is
hurting the paper I love. This burden has made it impossible for
Matt Storin and the editors of the Globe to publish the terrific
product they put on the street each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he had come to write the column on the young cancer
victims, Barnicle said a nurse had told the story to a telephone
operator at the Globe who then told it to Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed the story to be true and I wrote it after talking
to the nurse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone operator, Rose Berry Devine, an old friend of the
columnist's, Wednesday agreed with Barnicle's account, saying that
she remembered that the call came in from a nurse's aide who was
suffering from AIDS and has since died.
</P>
<P>
   The column, which is littered with details like the corporate
downsizing that cost the black youth's father his job at a
high-tech company, begins with a description of the black child's
mother getting a $10,000 check from the white family:
</P>
<P>
   ``She opened the letter as she strolled up the driveway from the
mailbox. As she finished the first paragraph, she stopped in her
tracks, unable to focus because of the tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few seconds, she lifted her head toward the perfect
sky and, for a brief, wonderful moment, she could hear her son
singing his favorite song.''
</P>
<P>
   The column goes on to quote her husband saying, ``There really
is a God.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the questions raised by Tomlinson, who was drafting
an article about the cancer-victim column for The Weekly Standard,
a Washington-based magazine, The Boston Phoenix, the city's
alternative weekly, had prepared a piece showing strong
similarities between the writer A.J. Liebling's biography of
Louisiana's Earl Long and a 1986 column by Barnicle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday why he had not alerted the Globe to his
suspicions back in late 1995, Tomlinson said it was because, in
part, he had assigned one of his own reporters to do a piece on how
a column can be fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get a lot of interest going,'' he said. ``It was
one of those good ideas that fell by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   When he read about Smith's forced resignation, and the Globe's
decision to vet some of Barnicle's past work, he said, ``I thought,
`Any examination by the Globe will turn this up.'' But that
examination of Barnicle's work since January 1996 turned up no
problematic columns, according to Globe editors.
</P>
<P>
   Then two weeks ago, when The Boston Herald disclosed the
similarities between Barnicle's Aug. 2 column of jokes and musings,
and jokes in a 1997 book by comedian George Carlin, Tomlinson said
he thought that Barnicle's career would be over. ``I thought it was
a foregone conclusion he was going down and his sins had caught up
to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the massive pressure brought to bear on the
Globe to keep him,'' Tomlinson added, referring to the support of
popular radio talk-show host Don Imus and other prominent
journalists, as well as a major Globe advertiser and hundreds of
Globe readers who deluged the newspaper switchboard with protest
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Storin reversed his initial decision to ask for
Barnicle's resignation for misleading the Globe about the Carlin
situation did Tomlinson send a fax to Storin questioning the
cancer-victim column.

SEVEN GROUPS VIE FOR RIGHT TO BUY NEW CLEVELAND BROWNS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One after another Wednesday, the seven groups vying to
buy the new Cleveland Browns presented their case before National
Football League owners. Game faces on, members of each group
emerged more hopeful than ever that theirs would be the lucky one
chosen to pay a record price for a sports franchise, a sum expected
to exceed $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus went a kind of double jeopardy round of the unprecedented
sweepstakes to bring the Browns back to Cleveland after a
three-season hiatus caused when Art Modell took the former Browns
to Baltimore in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saved the best for last and I think they were rewarded,''
said a beaming Howard Milstein, the New York real estate developer,
whose group features two former Browns, Paul Warfield and Calvin
Hill, as well as several elite Cleveland-area business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Dolan, whose brother, Charles, the chairman of
Cablevision Systems, is bankrolling a family bid, said: ``That was
a tense little situation, and I didn't fall down.'' Dolan was also
representing two star limited investors: Don Shula, the former
Miami Dolphins coach, and Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Another group was represented by Thomas Murdough, chairman of
the Step 2 Company, a Cleveland-area manufacturer of products for
children.``We told them, `Give us the ball, we're ready to go,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Carmen Policy, former president of the San Francisco 49ers
and now chief executive of a group headed by Alfred Lerner, a
billionaire credit-card executive, said: ``Having been on the other
side, I'd fall madly in love with the Lerner-Policy group.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the seven groups got up to 30 minutes to tell the 30 NFL
owners why its bid was more qualified than the last because of deep
pockets, business acumen and Cleveland civic involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the principal spokesman or main financier for each
group, several stars spoke. They included Shula, Hill, Warfield and
Jim Brown, the Hall of Fame Cleveland running back. Brown is
supporting a bid by Bart Wolstein, a Cleveland real estate
developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'm interested in winning championships, making sure
the bid is inclusive and the fans get a hard-hitting football
team,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly daylong process did not entail heavy questioning from
the owners; two groups left without being asked a question.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jacobs, who paid $46 million to buy the Indians in 1986,
ticked off his reasons for why he wants to own the Browns in 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lunchtime,'' he said. ``I heard stomachs growling.''
</P>
<P>
   All seven groups will now head to the next level: each will
submit a ``final'' bid to Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company, the league's
financial adviser. After those offers are made, Eric Grubman, a
managing director at Goldman, Sachs, will orchestrate still higher
bids, a process that is expected to force some groups to rethink
the prospect of a mammoth offer.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8 in Chicago, at least two bidders who have signed
definitive agreements to buy the Browns will go before the 30
owners. If all seven groups survive the auction process, all could
be presented at this meeting, but that is considered unlikely. The
group that receives 23 of 30 votes will win the prize: the most
expensive team ever, which will play in a new $270 million
lakefront stadium and receive $70 million a year in television
money.

<P>
   ``It could be a very long meeting,'' Paul Tagliabue, the NFL
commissioner, said. ``It could go to Sept. 9, Sept. 10, Sept. 11.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the seven, who could be joined by still other bidders,
sounded as if they intended to exit any time soon. Murdough, for
example, is lining up extra investors. ``As the number goes
higher,'' he said, ``we want to be prepared to make an aggressive
bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Some spokesmen indicated there is a price at which owning the
Browns is ridiculous, but none would specify it. Alan Spitzer, a
limited partner in Wolstein's group, said: ``We've looked at the
cash flow and we have to decide what works for us and how little
return is acceptable. Hopefully, it's not below zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said: ``Do you think I can get all the way up to just a
little return?''
</P>
<P>
   League rules that were passed last year prohibit members from
owning teams in competing markets. Dual ownership of major sports
franchises is permitted, but only when they are in the same, or
neutral, market. Milstein has already said he will sell his nearly
half-share in the Islanders if he buys the Browns. Jeremy Jacobs,
the owner of the Boston Bruins, said he would not sell the hockey
team as a condition of owning the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Bruins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision owns the Knicks and the Rangers, but Lawrence Dolan
insisted that the way he and his brother have structured their
group, they would not have to sell the two New York franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a personal, private matter,'' Dolan said, adding that
his enormously wealthy brother ``is not the general partner'' of
their Browns venture. ``I am.''

WHITE HOUSE MEMO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT GORE'S ACCOUNT OF
FUND-RAISING CALLS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department investigators have obtained a
November 1995 White House memo with hand-written notations that
appear to contradict Vice President Al Gore's account of his
fund-raising phone calls during President Clinton's re-election
campaign, government officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not describe the notations on the memorandum
in detail, but said they had been written by an unidentified senior
aide to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The notations indicate that at a meeting on Nov. 21, 1995, Gore
and several campaign officials discussed how a slice of large
contributions raised by the vice president to be used only for
general party purposes would be diverted to what are known as
``hard money'' accounts to directly finance the Clinton-Gore
re-election effort, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has said that telephone
solicitations for hard money by the president or vice president
were subject to federal campaign finance laws and could be illegal.
Last December, she absolved Gore of wrongdoing on the issue of the
phone calls, based on what she said was the absence of evidence
that he had raised funds for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Gore's fund-raising telephone calls is significant
because it has emerged as a focal point of debate at the Justice
Department in recent weeks, after Reno decided to reconsider
whether to seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to
investigate fund-raising abuses during Clinton's re-election
campaign, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a spokesman for Gore would not comment on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, the officials said Reno's advisers
are divided about the significance of the notations on the Gore
memo and some said they doubted that the memo _ by itself _ would
lead to the appointment of an independent prosecutor. But the
document, along with a lengthy confidential report sent to Reno in
late July by the former head of her campaign finance unit, have
re-energized the long-running Justice Department debate about
referring the case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   That report written by Charles La Bella, who last month returned
to his prosecutorial job in San Diego, urged Reno to send the case
to an independent prosecutor. He based his conclusions on a review
of the massive array of evidence collected during the Justice
Department's criminal grand jury inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the month, Reno opened a formal 30-day
review of Gore's phone calls, the first step toward deciding again
whether to seek an independent counsel. Under the statute, Reno has
until the end of the month to extend the investigation by ordering
a 90-day preliminary inquiry into the vice presidential phone
calls. After that investigation, Reno must decide whether to seek
an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the officials said, Reno has been unable to decide
whether to advance the Gore phone call issue to the 90-day review.
Reno's efforts to reach a decision are said by officials to be
painfully labored even by the standards of the protracted
decision-making that has become a hallmark of her tenure as
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he believed his solicitations were lawful and
intended to raise what is known as ``soft money'' to be used only
for general party purposes. Officials would not explain how the
notations on the memo, according to people who have seen it since
it was obtained last month, show what Gore knew about plans for his
fund-raising calls.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-level Democratic National Committee officials
attended the November 1995 meeting, including Donald Fowler, the
committee chairman, and Marvin Rosen, the finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's fund-raising phone calls have been under
scrutiny before. Reno cleared him in the earlier investigation by
saying evidence showed that he made calls to raise money
exclusively for generic party purposes, a category of funds which
are largely unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some memos about Gore's fund-raising activities also surfaced
during these investigations. Last year, his aides disclosed a memo
by Ronald Klain, the vice president's chief of staff, which was
given to Gore before he met with President Clinton and other chief
fundraising officials in February 1996.

ITALIAN INSURER AGREES TO PAY $100 MILLION IN HOLOCAUST SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Italy's largest insurance company, Assicurazioni
Generali, told a U.S. judge Wednesday night that it would pay $100
million to Holocaust survivors and the heirs of victims for life
insurance and annuity policies that it refused to honor after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to release documents that are expected
to help in recovering claims from other European insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached in the office of Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., York, after eight hours of talks involving the
company, lawyers for the claimants, insurance regulators and the
World Jewish Restitution Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was presented to Judge Michael Mukasey in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan, who would formally have to approve it.
The Generali board is scheduled to approve the agreement when it
meets Aug. 28, said Robert Swift of Philadelphia, a lawyer for the
nine named plaintiffs in the class-action suit against Generali and
14 other European insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will bring justice for Holocaust survivors with
the other insurance carriers,'' D'Amato told Mukasey.
</P>
<P>
   In breaking ranks with the other insurance companies and
settling, Generali gained for itself a relatively small monetary
cost and the enmity of the others.
</P>
<P>
   When a Generali lawyer, M. Scott Vayer, and its vice director
general, Guido Pastore, entered Mukasey's courtroom they were met
with scowls and cold stares from lawyers for the other 14
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Vayer convinced the other parties that the majority of
obligations for policies that it wrote in Eastern Europe before the
war were now the responsibility of companies created there by
postwar communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million that Generali is paying is roughly the amount
that it received in settlement from the communists for seizing
Generali assets, three people involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The documents detail how the Nazis liquidated the policies of
Jews who were sent to death camps, how they funneled the money to
Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and other banks and how, after the
war, the Italian government made payments to Generali and other
Italian insurers that the companies kept without telling
policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Generali will also turn over detailed information on what share
of the market each European insurer had before the war and other
corporate documents that will shed light on how the Nazis worked
closely with insurance companies to loot Jewish assets to finance
the war and the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Generali documents are the key we need to get the other
companies to settle,'' said Ed Fagan, who filed the suit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan and the other lawyers are expected to turn their focus to
Allianz AG of Germany, the biggest insurance company in the world,
and its Italian subsidiary, Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta. Riunione
also received payments from the Italian government after the war,
Linda Gerstel, a plaintiff's lawyer, said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz executives held high posts in the Third Reich, and the
company had the contract fire and casualty insurance at the death
camps.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Allianz, Christopher Worthley, said Wednesday
night that he expected Allianz would soon reach a settlement on
Holocaust claims.
</P>
<P>
   An important sticking point in talks Wednesday was the
insistence of state insurance regulators that they be involved in
recovering money from the insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Generali signed a separate agreement that gives a 12-member
panel, including three insurance regulators from the United States,
complete access to its files, so that claims can be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Insurance Superintendent Neil Levin said,
``Generali's agreement to sign the memorandum of understanding is a
constructive and meaningful step toward the resolution of all
Holocaust-era claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million is not all that Generali will pay. It has
already agreed to create a $12 million humanitarian fund in Israel.
The memorandum also obligates it, and any other company that
settles, to pay all administrative costs of investigating claims,
to contribute money to pay for policies of defunct insurance
companies and to contribute to two other humanitarian funds.

CHEVALIER'S CHALLENGE AT CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andre Chevalier had an impact at Cleveland High in
the San Fernando Valley. You saw it on the faces of his players.
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier looked at those faces last month, faces that seemed so
familiar he thought he was looking at himself 10 years earlier. The
eyes on those faces welled with tears as Chevalier was leaving
Cleveland to become an assistant basketball coach at Cal State
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier always felt his work was meaningful at Cleveland. But
now, as he stood before his players and asked them to understand
why he was leaving, he realized it went much deeper than that. He
had connected with these kids and in many cases he made a
difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the reason I came to Cleveland in the first place,''
said Kent Dennis, who transferred last year from Bell-Jeff. ``I
understand why he left because it was important for him to take
that job. But it was so hard for me.... He was like a big brother
to me, so it hurt when I found out he wouldn't be there for my
senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier looks back on that day with a mixture of heartache and
pride. Their reaction proved his two years at Cleveland were more
than a step up the coaching ladder. He left his mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional meeting,'' Chevalier said. ``Some guys
were upset, some guys were happy for me. Fortunately, they all
understood. But it was definitely emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Making the choice
</P>
<P>
   Andre Chevalier is on the fast track. Eight years removed from
Cleveland High himself and four years after his record-breaking
playing career at CSUN, he has become a Division I assistant coach.
At Northridge, Chevalier will spend his first year concentrating on
recruiting and the players' academic development. Chevalier is
affable and people-oriented; he is expected to have a significant
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he expected any of this so soon. When he took over at
Cleveland, Chevalier hoped to return the Cavaliers to the
prominence they enjoyed a decade ago. They were on their way after
making the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when Braswell, his former high school coach, called to offer
the CSUN job, Chevalier accepted with little hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be five or six years before I'd get an
opportunity like this,'' Chevalier said. ``That's why I just feel
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who know him well, the surprise in minimal. Chevalier
overcame long odds to carve out a memorable high school career,
then even longer odds to become the Matadors' career scoring leader
_ even though no other school offered him a scholarship out of high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Born with only a thumb and two fingers on his left hand and
minimal eyesight in his right eye, Chevalier did not let his
limitations affect his play or the confidence it took to succeed in
college. Chevalier experienced other hardships, once living in a
car with his mother for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Chevalier prevailed, even flourished. Maybe
that's why he earned his players' respect so quickly. He wasn't a
coach who pretended to appreciate the obstacles kids face today.
Chevalier understood. More importantly, he knew what it took to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just always admired him for the way he played and all the
stuff he's overcome,'' Dennis said. ``He's somebody I look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Overcoming hardships
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate Chevalier's quick ascent, you must first
understand where he's been. And to admire all that he's survived,
it's essential to acknowledge the most important influence in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier readily admits that none of this, not the CSUN job,
his indifference toward adversity nor his will to overcome would be
possible without his mother, Shirley, who reared Andre by herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their story has been well-chronicled. They spent the first 12
years of Andre's life living in a public housing project in
Maryland. Then when Andre was a senior at Cleveland, Shirley lost
her job and eventually her home. For six months, she and Andre
spent their time staying with different friends. Although they
weren't on the streets, they were homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley landed back on her feet, but the Chevaliers' troubles
were not over. In 1994, both Andre's apartment and Shirley's home
were destroyed by the Northridge Earthquake. They spent two weeks
living in a hotel before moving into an apartment in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the misfortune, Andre leaned heavily on his mother.
In turn, she relied on Andre. Their bond has strengthened through
the years. Shirley admires her son for his fortitude. Andre
appreciates his mother's determination and the resolve she passed
on to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a very strong person, so she's been my role
model,'' Chevalier said. ``All her life she's been able to beat the
odds and do the things she's wanted to do. No doubt, that's where I
get that fight from.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley looks at Andre and sees much of herself. That he's grown
to be his own man and find his own solutions brings her great joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been determined to overcome obstacles and be a
winner,'' she said. ``That's why I'm not surprised that he's moved
up so quickly as a coach. But it wasn't just that he did well as an
athlete, I'm just as proud with what he's done academically and how
he's developed as a person.''

SPORTS COLUMN: UNDER TORRE, YANK BUBBLE IS UNLIKELY TO BURST  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Torre can peek into the opposing dugout Friday night in
Texas and easily recognize his rival, Johnny Oates, the Rangers
manager. Their mental scraps are always intense but friendly. Their
respect is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Oates owns thoughts of Torre that linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``First thing, when I think of Joe Torre, I think of spring
training last year when he asked me to be one of his coaches for
the All-Star Game,'' Oates said when the Rangers came to Yankee
Stadium last weekend. ``Heck, if a coach asks you, it's usually in
late June, a week or two before the game. Joe was asking in spring
training! That shows a meticulous mind. It gave me time to prepare
and to get my family situated for the trip. I'll always remember
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates also remembers the 1976 World Series, Cincinnati versus
the Yankees, and how he was a contestant in a bubble-gum-blowing
contest. It was two catchers, Oates of the Phillies versus Gary
Carter of the Expos, before Game 3 of that World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big deal, on TV and all, and the idea was to take
five or six sticks of bubble gum and blow the biggest balloon, the
biggest bubble you could,'' Oates said, chuckling. ``Joe Torre was
the official scorer. We'd blow in front of him, and my bubble
covered the top of my head all the way down to my belly button. Joe
was to take the tape and measure the bubbles. I won that contest
with a bubble of 21 inches. But you were talking about some real
pressure on Joe. He had to get real close to measure, and the last
thing he wanted to do was to pop your balloon or bust your bubble.
That would have been a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre did not pop the bubble then.
</P>
<P>
   He is not popping it now.
</P>
<P>
   No, Joe Torre is riding the edge of this big bubble the Yankees
are creating, this season of records falling and opponents wilting
and championship anticipation growing, with deftness and with
grace. He is being selfless and is exhibiting character at every
turn. He is pulling out his tape measure and tinkering with the
Yankees, and they have now become a true reflection of him. All
team. All business.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up near St. Louis, I remember watching Torre hit .363 to
swipe the National League batting title in 1971. I remember those
muggy summer nights when Jack Buck, with a cool voice over the
radio, would describe how Torre would nestle in at the plate and
rock those knees and squeeze that bat and hammer another one to
left. Or how he might hit the ball the other way or even sacrifice
to give his team the best chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   During his playing career, Torre hit behind Hank Aaron in
Atlanta. He moved from catcher to third base in 1970 and then later
to first base. He was a player-manager for the Mets in 1977. His
resume is full of giving of himself in various ways for his team.
</P>
<P>
   Of respecting the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost as a player, you respect people who have
been through what you are going through,'' said Paul O'Neill, the
Yankees' right fielder. ``Joe played for 18 years. He knows the
grind, and that's a word he uses a lot. He expects his players to
do the little things and to play the game right.''
</P>
<P>
   Each and every game, whether it is against the worst or the
best. Maximum effort. And the Yankees do that. In Torre's first
season as manager, after he was dismissed in St. Louis the year
before, they won 92 games and the World Series, and they won 96 the
next year. This season they are on pace to win a league-record 122
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left St. Louis for the Rangers,'' Texas shortstop Royce
Clayton said, ``people back there said Joe was too lax on his
players. They brought in Tony La Russa and he was supposed to be
all about discipline. You notice La Russa, but the team is still
struggling. The greatest thing I can say about Joe Torre is that
you notice his players. You notice how professional they are. Joe
just blends in.''
</P>
<P>
   In a league where managers are routinely defensive, critical,
obstinate, egotistical and stubborn, this is no ordinary Joe.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his players. He has a human touch. He is not
overwhelmed by New York. He has fashioned a team in his image to
play in his style. New York reporters who cover his team daily
marvel and write glowingly about its manner and its output. In this
gorilla market, that is no small feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams are remembered by good managers,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Torre are proving him right.

LEWINSKY TO BE ASKED TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky, making a return grand jury
appearance Thursday, may be asked more precise details about her
relationship with President Clinton so prosecutors can determine if
Clinton's earlier denial of a sexual affair was ``legally
accurate,'' as he told the nation Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   While independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's office has said the
Clinton investigation is not about sex, the definition of sexual
relations has become significant because the president said he did
not commit perjury in January by denying he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton did commit perjury in his Jan. 17 deposition in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, a number of congressional
Republicans have said the president should resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said the president did not commit perjury
because the types of sexual contact he had with Lewinsky were not
included in the definition used by Jones's lawyers. However, a
source close to Lewinsky has said the former White House intern did
have a type of sex that fell within the definition.
</P>
<P>
   A legal source said Wednesday that the bulk of the grand jury
questioning centered not on issues of obstruction of justice, but
on the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky. That
source, who is familiar with the proceedings, said little time was
spent actually pursuing lines of questioning on allegations that
Clinton suborned perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also abruptly halted questioning shortly
before 6:30 p.m., as Starr and his subordinates continued to hammer
away on sex issues. Starr requested more time for the testimony and
was denied by one of Clinton's lawyers, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   That source, who talked only on the condition of anonymity, also
confirmed that Clinton began the session by reciting a statement to
the grand jury acknowledging an inappropriate and intimate
relationship with Lewinsky. Under questioning, Clinton broadened
that description to include oral sex, but declined to provide any
more details as he faced rapid-fire questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jones deposition, Clinton was asked whether he had sexual
relations with Lewinsky, under this definition: ``When the person
knowingly engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia,
anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an
intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky may also be asked about a news report that she gave the
president six ties, one of which Clinton wore when she first
testified before the grand jury. Clinton reportedly was asked in
his grand jury testimony whether he wore the gold-and-navy tie on
Aug. 6 as some kind of signal to Lewinsky. However, Clinton's
public appearance that day was for a Rose Garden event at 11:06
a.m., more than an hour and a half after Lewinsky entered the grand
jury room, so it unlikely she saw him wearing it beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will also be the first time grand jurors apparently
will have a chance to question Lewinsky directly. Prosecutors had
questioned her two weeks ago. In addition to questions about the
physical contact between Clinton and Lewinsky, the grand jurors may
also ask why she initially swore in an affidavit that she did not
have sexual relationship with the president and now has changed her
story. Lewinsky was granted full immunity by Starr before she
agreed to testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit for the Jones case, Lewinsky said: ``I have
never had a sexual relationship with the president, he did not
propose that we have a sexual relationship, he did not offer me
employment or other benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship,
he did not deny me employment or other benefits for reflecting a
sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked in his Jones deposition if Lewinsky's
affidavit was accurate. ``That is absolutely true,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are examining whether this and other statements by
Clinton amount to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors are expected to ask whether Clinton or anyone
else urged her to deny having a relationship with the president,
which could be an obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on what kind of sex Clinton had with Lewinsky has
become necessary because it has become the cornerstone of Clinton's
defense. Clinton said his January denial of having sex with
Lewinsky was ``legally accurate,'' but he has not publicly
explained how this could be possible. Nor has Clinton said why it
was legally accurate to say that he did not have an affair with
Lewinsky or that he couldn't remember he was ever alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats and legal analysts have said that although
Clinton appears to have lied in the Jones deposition, he may have
avoided committing perjury because his comments about Lewinsky were
not material to the Jones case, which was brought by a former
Arkansas state worker who alleged she had been sexually harassed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission that he had an inappropriate relationship
with Lewinsky has given new life and perhaps credibility to
accounts by a number of women who have maintained they had sexual
contact or relationships with Clinton. Jones, whose lawsuit was
dismissed, is launching an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Kyle Browning, who has alleged a longtime relationship
with Clinton that sometimes included sex, on Monday filed a
defamation lawsuit against Clinton, alleging that the president
made untrue remarks about her in a memorandum Clinton co-wrote that
became an exhibit in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Browning's lawyer, Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch, said
Clinton's admission on Monday has ``bolstered the credibility'' of
Browning and other women who have said they had sexual
relationships with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman said he will use the Browning lawsuit to investigate the
Lewinsky matter, enabling him to demand documents and depositions
under the ``discovery'' process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our case opens the discovery Pandora's box,'' Klayman said.

WITNESS DESCRIBES KLAN RAID AGAINST BLACK LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Note strong language used in some quotes.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ A penitent witness who took part in a
murderous raid against a black leader 32 years ago gave a modern
audience at the trial of Mississippi Ku Klan Klan ruler Sam Bowers
an extraordinary account Wednesday of the operations of the
underground group that once terrorized the state.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in a series of trials three decades ago, former
Klansman Billy Roy Pitts testified that Bowers informed his
followers in late 1965 that he had been called to appear before the
old House UnAmerican Activities Committee and instructed the Klan
unit to eliminate Vernon Dahmer, the president of the Hattiesburg
chapter of the NAACP, ``to show the people in Washington that the
South means business'' in its resistance to civil rights
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, 54, said Dahmer's death ``was bothering me bad'' when he
decided to tell authorities of his participation in the firebombing
of Dahmer's house on Jan. 10, 1966. He was also prompted to become
a witness, he said, because he had heard Bowers ``believed I was
talking to the FBI and wanted to annihilate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts's appearance came on the third day of Bowers's trial for
murder. The 73-year-old Bowers's three previous trials in state
court ended in mistrials in the 1960s, but the case was revived
over the past year after new witnesses came forward to corroborate
Pitts's story.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Klan's power has virtually disappeared here, the
organization's reputation as an intimidating force was dramatized
during the testimony of T. Webber Rogers, another former Klansman
who has testified before. Rogers followed Pitts to the stand and
recalled that Bowers once told a Klan meeting: ``Something's got to
be done about that damned nigger down south,'' referring to Dahmer,
who lived 35 miles south of the meeting site.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers did not go on the raid and said he quit the Klan shortly
after the attack on Dahmer. He said he did not want to say where he
now lived ``for my safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you received threats?'' asked Circuit Judge Richard
McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yes,'' said Rogers. Admonished by the judge for
``cussing,'' Rogers bowed his head and said, ``I didn't want to
have to go through with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Pitts, who was 21 at the time of the Dahmer attack,
detailed the culture of Bowers's White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the Dahmer family watched from a balcony rail
above Bowers, Pitts told how he was initiated into the Klan under
an oath that required obedience to the ``superior officer.'' The
penalty for defying orders ``would be death,'' he said. Asked to
name his superior officer, Pitts answered: Sam Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts recalled a Klan meeting at a farmhouse in neighboring
Jones County where he exercised his rank as the Klan's ``inner
guard'' to provide security for Bowers, the statewide leader of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bowers took charge of the speaking,'' Pitts said. ``He was
fixing to go to Washington and there was one back project that
needed taking care of.'' It was, he said, the ``Dahmer project,''
which demanded, in Klan language, the application of Codes 3 and 4.
Code 3 called for the burning of a building; Code 4 called for
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Bowers was the only one who could order a Code 3 or Code 4
for the White Knights of the Invisible Empire of the Ku Klux Klan
in Mississippi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts identified about a dozen men who were on hand, but when he
mentioned the name of Travis Buckley, who is representing Bowers,
the defense attorney bolted to his feet and called unsuccessfully
for a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors led him through his testimony, Pitts said Bowers
had declared the NAACP and ``communist organizations'' as mortal
enemies. ``It was our sacred duty to try and stomp them out.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 9, 1966, Pitts said the ``exalted
cyclops'' of the Klan, Cecil Sessums, came to Pitts's home. Sessums
invoked the word ``kenny,'' Pitts said, which was ``a Klan code
word which meant we were obligated to come along and do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair went to John's Cafe in Laurel, where Bowers often held
court with members of the Jones County Klan, Pitts said. Sessums
conferred with Bowers, his chief, and then took Pitts to Sessums's
house, where they were joined by six other Klansmen wielding
shotguns and ``pistols strapped to their sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They filled a dozen plastic jugs with gasoline and drove south
in two cars to inspect the Dahmer home in a rural area outside
Hattiesburg, Pitts said. After midnight, the Klansmen
reconnoitered, Pitts said, at a black church with a cemetery.
``Sessums went and urinated on a grave,'' Pitts recalled.
``Everyone thought it was pretty funny, so we all done it. Sessums
made a statement: `The only good nigger is a dead nigger.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sessums also delivered instructions, Pitts said. One carload
would firebomb Dahmer's store. At Dahmer's home next door, Pitts's
group was told to fire at the gas tanks of Dahmer's cars and to
shoot out the front window while Sessums flung the gasoline and a
torch into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, who was carrying a .22 caliber pistol in a ``quick draw''
holster, said he was told to provide cover for Sessums. Pitts said
he crouched against the house, and after the flames broke out, he
heard the cries of a man inside.
</P>
<P>
   As the group fled, one of the cars' headlights came on against
orders. One of the nightriders ``thought it was a trap'' and opened
fire on the auto, flattening two tires. The car had to be
abandoned. Pitts said he realized a further peril to the group. He
had dropped his pistol at the scene. After daybreak, authorities
found it.
</P>
<P>
   After the eight men escaped in the remaining car, Pitts said he
slept a few hours, then was reprimanded by Bowers for losing the
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said Bowers added: ``Don't do any talking. No jury in the
state of Mississippi is going to convict a white man for killing a
nigger.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The way Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes sees it, Rob Peters had the
second-best position in the world. If serving as a weatherman in
West Texas might finish first, life as Zebbie Lethridge's backup
was a close second.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If I die and there is such thing as reincarnation, I want to
come back as second-team quarterback or weatherman,'' Dykes said.
``How do you lose a deal like that? `The jet stream will dip a
little bit, and there is a chance it's going to rain.' You can't
miss. It's the same thing with the second-team quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the honeymoon is over now. Matt Tittle is the name they
want to know now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Peters, a junior from Katy whose role at Tech had been about
as tough as predicting heat in the summer or wind in the spring,
will have to do considerably more for the Red Raiders this season.
After four seasons in which Lethridge made 44 consecutive starts
and threw more passes than any other quarterback in Tech history,
Peters takes over having registered more positions (nine) than
completions (six).
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is a great athlete,'' Dykes said. ``He was a great high
school basketball player in a program with a great high school
basketball team. He's a guy our guys can rely on. He can do a great
job. Rob is probably as well thought of by his teammates as anyone
we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that goes back to Peters' academic success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made one B while at Tech,'' Dykes said. ``I told him I
made one B when I was in college. Of course, the rest of his are
A's.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters' popularity with teammates also no doubt lies with his
willingness to play all those positions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Peters' teammates know they will need their
quarterback to complete passes, and his popularity might not help
much in that area. There seems, however, little doubt about his
ability to fill the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more confidence in Rob than ever,'' receiver Tim Baker
said. ``He hasn't played that much, but when he's played, he's
proven himself. He can throw as well as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is more of a pure passer. He's the kind of guy that's
going to drop back in the pocket and wait for the receivers to get
open. Zebbie is more of a scrambling quarterback. Rob can scramble,
too. He's got some speed, especially for a big guy (6-3, 237
pounds). But I think he'll be more steady in the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Donnie Hart, Tech's All-Big 12 receiver, Peters
also might have more of a deep touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understands more about throwing to the open area
and putting a little more air under it,'' Hart said. ``He and
Zebbie both have strong arms. They can really zing it in there. But
Rob puts more air on the deep ball. I look forward to running under
lots of touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lethridge threw 42 touchdown passes during his Tech
career. Peters has thrown one. He showed his athleticism as a
fullback and receiver last season and again with a 64-yard
touchdown run in Tech's spring game. But there are different
pressures, far greater demands, on a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played all that much, so there's a lot of question
about what I can do,'' said Peters, who also has dabbled in defense
and special teams. ``The big question mark for this team is the
quarterback position. I've got all the confidence in the world in
myself. My teammates have confidence in me. Now, it's just a matter
of me doing what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What he can do, Peters said, is about the same thing done by
Lethridge, Robert Hall and Jamie Gill, all running the schemes
former offensive coordinator Dick Winder (now the Tech receivers
coach upon his return from Oklahoma) installed more than 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do about the same thing we did in the past,''
Peters said. ``I'm a little bigger than (Lethridge and Hall), so
everybody thinks we're going to change the offense up. I don't
think that's the case. I think we'll see the same kind of thing,
and hopefully I'll have the same success they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were such good athletes. Zebbie was an amazing
athlete. This year, we'll probably do more conventional drop-back
passing. That fits my mold a little bit better. But I can still do
the bootleg stuff and the quick drops and the option offense. We'll
be able to mix the two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders don't seem too concerned about any differences
or similarities. Peters might have lost the understanding of the
public that is afforded backup quarterbacks. But there seems little
concern he'll need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a new quarterback in the spring, and he looked great,''
Hart said. ``Rob is a great athlete, and now we expect a lot out of
him. We're certainly not going to go into the season thinking,
`We've got a new guy back there. We'll struggle on offense.' We can
move the ball right now. I know he can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run. He's got a real strong arm. He's a big
quarterback. He's smart on the field and off. He's a good leader.
And when he comes into the huddle, he takes over. It's his
ballclub.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: RUSSIA DEVALUES ITS WAY TOWARD A MARKET ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reaction in the West this week to Russia's decision to, in
effect, default on some loans and devalue the ruble has been one of
fear mixed with disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that a Russian financial debacle would spread elsewhere
has so far proved exaggerated. Russia's nuclear arms cache might
intimidate faraway places, but its Netherlands-sized economy does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment may also prove unwarranted. Though a policy of de
facto default-with-devaluation solves no long-term problem, it
could serve as a clever device by which the government, led by the
boyish-looking prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, puts pressure on
an obstinate parliament to pass its economic reform package,
designed to tackle Russia's many structural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's nearly seven-year trek toward markets has been
grudging, incomplete and riven with corruption. Its tax code drives
companies to hide profits, while helping insolvent ones stay in
business. Huge swaths of the economy operate through barter
transactions controlled by insiders rather than by impersonal
market forces. Barter deprives workers of cash wages and the
government of tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's tight monetary policy has created relatively stable
prices and exchange rates, but this week's devaluation will undo
some of the good by driving up the price of consumer imports and
erode confidence in the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The current financial crisis was partly caused by steep drops in
world oil prices that eroded dollar earnings from exports. Those
dollar losses, and possible fallout of the Asian financial crisis,
fueled fears among foreign investors that President Boris Yeltsin's
officials would be unable to prop up the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began to flee, further depleting dollar reserves and
adding to the fears of investors left behind. The turmoil hit banks
hard because they hold lots of ruble-denominated bonds and other
assets. When investors turned skittish and dumped ruble assets,
driving down their price, the value of the bank-owned assets
shriveled. Many banks stopped lending money or completing currency
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Rudiger Dornbusch of MIT points out a somewhat odd
consequence of the government's collecting too little tax revenue.
It not only lacks enough dollars to pay foreign creditors, but it
also lacks enough rubles to pay domestic creditors. Of course,
Russia could print rubles to pay its loans, but that would reignite
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kiriyenko asked the International Monetary Fund to
chip in emergency funds on top of the more than $20 billion it
pledged last month. The IMF refused. So he seized an alternative:
de facto default.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he placed a 90-day moratorium on repayments by
banks and private companies to foreign creditors and froze
government repayment on domestic loans. Russia is expected to press
creditors to replace short-term loans with longer-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to ease the government's financial plight
by rebuilding cash reserves. Some of the extra cash will come from
the freeze on loan repayments to domestic creditors and from taxing
the extra profits that oil exporters will earn as the value of the
ruble falls.
</P>
<P>
   But cash infusion is at best a stopgap measure. De facto
default-with-devaluation does nothing to end confiscatory business
taxes, create a workable bankruptcy code, balance the budget or
approve production-sharing agreements that would attract foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Tax reform is key not only because it would raise desperately
needed money, but also because it would drive businesses to replace
barter arrangements with cash deals. Kiriyenko has proposed laws
along these lines, but parliament has so far refused to approve all
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing possibility is that the prime minister can
exploit what will surely be furious opposition by investors to a
government-imposed debt moratorium to press parliament to take the
corrective action that would render the moratorium superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiriyenko's plan does not go nearly far enough. Professor
Marshall Goldman of Harvard University cites a need to back venture
capitalists _ small-scale operations that provide organized crime
no large target.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Arbess, a venture capitalist operating in Russia,
emphasizes the need for Russia to move to a cash-based economy.
Toward those ends, he would require Gazprom, which supplies energy
to businesses, to sell energy strictly for cash.
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, would strip away support for insolvent
enterprises and force Russian companies to abandon barter
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko's plan could easily backfire. The central bank could
lift its tight hold on the money supply, allowing devaluation to
escalate inflation. Partial default and debt restructuring could
scare off foreign investors, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation could provoke domestic opposition, perhaps leading
to Yeltsin's downfall. Whether the plan succeeds will depend more
on Kiriyenko's political skills than his economic acumen.

   ``Happy to see you

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The words, addressed to the audience in the opening
number of ``Cabaret,'' will have a whole new meaning when the show
reopens Thursday night at the Kit Kat Club on West 43rd Street, in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For four weeks, the theater has been shuttered and dark as a
result of the scaffolding collapse a few doors away at the Conde
Nast building. Four weeks of wondering if the show would ever
recoup its losses _ $2 million in ticket sales, rent, salaries and
other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks of not being able to bump and grind and belt out such
critically acclaimed numbers as the sinister yet seductive opening,
``Willkommen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, all those fears seemed to be falling away as the
cast stretched and vocalized on stage, preparing to restart a run
that was one of the most successful on Broadway last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely thrilling,'' said Blair Brown, who was about
to take over the role of Fraulein Schneider from Mary Louise Wilson
when the show shut down on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a sense of suspense about ``Cabaret'': Would it
reopen? If so, where? Would Natasha Richardson ever get to properly
finish her run as the lost, magnetic Sally Bowles? Would her
replacement, Jennifer Jason Leigh, ever make her Broadway debut?
</P>
<P>
   Despite these unknowns, Todd Haimes, the artistic director of
the Roundabout Theater Company, which produced ``Cabaret,'' said
there was never a question that the show would return _ it was just
a question of when and where.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout has continued to keep the actors on full salary,
Haimes said, as well as some members of the production staff. He
said he hoped that the Roundabout's insurance, as well as
compensation from the construction company involved in the
accident, would cover a substantial amount of the company's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Richard, the company's general manager, said she would
meet with an adjuster at Liberty Mutual, the Conde Nast project's
insurance carrier, about filing a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said he harbored no hostility toward the construction
project. ``The city and the Buildings Department and the Office of
Emergency Management have been fantastic,'' he said. ``I never felt
they didn't care about `Cabaret' or about our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   When the production was suspended, Ms. Brown said there was
initially a sense of being all dressed up with no place to go. ``I
was ready,'' she said. ``I was just nervous enough; everything was
just right.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had spent the four weeks rehearsing and
distractedly doing other things _ trying to read, for example, and
not being able to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the sense that I was always supposed to be
somewhere,'' she said, ``and that place was barricaded.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday, members of the cast and crew said it
felt good to be back in the cool dimness of the theater after their
enforced vacations. But Ms. Leigh, the film actress who takes over
Thursday night as Sally Bowles, said she had welcomed the extra
time to prepare. While other actors took time off, Ms. Leigh
rehearsed every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like, `This is grace for me,''' she said Wednesday,
seated in the theater's empty balcony with her hair cut in a Sally
Bowlesish bob. ``This is a luxury because I'm going to have more
time to rehearse and to get it inside my body.''
</P>
<P>
   The new cast members are starting out in a heavier publicity
glare than usual. Typically, actors have the chance to hone their
performances in the relatively protected atmosphere of previews.
But because of the accident, the show has attracted as much press
attention as if the reopening were a premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said she did not mind the scrutiny, having hungered
for the heady perils of performing before an audience. ``We need
that feedback,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cast and crew members agree that the presence of Ms. Leigh and
Ms. Brown make the reopening feel very much like a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Sam Mendes, returned to help the two women step
into their roles, and both said they were unconcerned about filling
the shoes of their predecessors, both of whom were nominated for
Tony Awards (Ms. Richardson won). ``We're utterly different in
every way,'' Ms. Leigh said of herself and her predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is any good to be gleaned from the trials of
``Cabaret,'' Haimes said, it is that things can only get better
from here. ``It certainly puts other problems in perspective,'' he
said. ``Now whenever anything happens that upsets me, I'll just
think, `But a building can fall on my head.' ''

 UNDATED: about it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That evidence is varied. Allen Phillips, a photographer, used a
computer to line up facial features of five later images of Lincoln
and easily ``dissolved'' or ``morphed'' the daguerreotype image
into the last known photo of him, taken in April 1865, the month he
was shot. Albert Harper, a forensic anthropologist, measured such
things as forehead height, nasal height, mouth contour and other
facial elements and found matches with later Lincoln portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Buberger, a dealer in antique photographs and the
daguerreotype's most ardent champion, traced the travels of
itinerant photographers in 1843 and found at least two who visited
Springfield, Ill., where Lincoln lived that year. Buberger, who
helped the Hoffmans and who, some experts said, harbored hopes that
he would sell it for them on commission, even called in Dr. Henry
Lee, the forensic scientist whose testimony helped acquit O.J.
Simpson. Lee agreed with those who think the portrait is genuine. (
Hoffman said that all the experts volunteered their expertise. ``No
one ever charged us or anyone else for the research,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   The vein analyses, on the other hand, were mixed. Dr. Ralph
Leonard, a medical professor at Wake Forest University, concluded
that the vein patterns in the daguerreotype did not match
Lincoln's. But Dr. Blaine Houmes, the deputy medical examiner in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a Lincoln photo collector, said they did
correspond.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing the consignment, Christie's relied most heavily on
the work of Lewis Sadler, the head of the Biomedical Visualization
Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Sadler
developed an identification process that feeds mathematical
``facial maps'' into a computer model and sifts the data for
matches. To test the daguerreotype, he mapped it and three other
Lincoln images and mixed them with 300 other facial maps of white
males. He got three matches _ with the three other Lincoln
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have observed this type of clustering only in cases where we
had photos of the same individual and in the case of identical
twins,'' Dr. Sadler wrote. ``I would have to conclude that there
was nothing to indicate that this was not a photo of Abraham
Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny that,'' Wester of Christie's said. ``Everything
else is human opinion.'' Believers are also buoyed by the
daguerreotype's provenance, which shows a strong yet circuitous tie
to Lincoln. The Hoffmans bought the image from George Feeley, an
antiques dealer in Caledonia, N.Y., shortly before he died in 1993.
Feeley, Hoffman said, was the private liquidator for the Wadsworth
family. Senator James W. Wadsworth Jr. was married to Alice Hay,
who was the daughter of John Milton Hay, Lincoln's private
secretary (and later Secretary of State under Presidents William
McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt).
</P>
<P>
   Hay and Lincoln were close. During the Civil War, Hay moved into
the White House, and Hay, some historians say, was the only person
there who referred to Lincoln by his first name. Documents show
that the Lincolns gave Hay many artifacts, including a lock of the
president's hair, letters and two copies of the Gettyburg Address,
as well as a scrapbook of Civil War news clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants also say that they recall seeing the daguerreotype
in the Wadsworth household.
</P>
<P>
   To which Ostendorf said, so what? ``Everybody has pictures of
family and friends. If that's convincing provenance, I'd like to
see unconvincing provenance.'' Scholars said many look-alikes sent
Lincoln and his family their own pictures, and Hay might have had
one of those.

 WASHINGTON: February 1996.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At that meeting, Gore did not use the talking points, which show
him actively involved in the formulation of fund-raising strategy
and in the fund-raising effort. In contrast to the image of a vice
president detached from the day-to-day details of fund raising, the
memo showed him deeply involved in the effort to reach the
Democrats' $108 million goal, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella found that the effort to re-elect Clinton rested on an
aggressive but legally dubious attempt to evade the federal laws
designed to limit campaign contributions, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's independent counsel review reflects a deep split among
senior law enforcement officials. La Bella and FBI Director Louis
Freeh have each recommended appointment of an independent counsel,
but some of Reno's closest advisers have been opposed, These
include Lee Radek, the head of the Justice Department's public
integrity unit, and Jo Ann Farrington, a senior career lawyer who
has become a chief interpreter of the independent counsel statute,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal warfare over the appointment of an outside
prosecutor has been fought on at least four separate occasions.
Each time, Reno has rebuffed the lawyers who favor an independent
prosecutor. But officials said that this time the arguments seemed
especially intense, suggesting to some officials that Reno may be
slowly shifting her position. Although resistant to outside
campaign finance inquiries, Reno has referred more issues to
independent prosecutors than any other attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlines of the independent prosecutor statute are not the
only weight bearing down on the attorney general. Reno has been
cited by a congressional committee for contempt of Congress for
refusing to turn over reports by La Bella and Freeh. She has told
lawmakers that she would review La Bella's report by the end of
this week although officials said they do not know when she will
conclude those deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   That report, which is said to pose an embarrassingly direct
challenge to Reno, did not refer to the newly found Gore memo, but
assembled previously known evidence in the case to argue that the
fund-raising activities in behalf of the Clinton-Gore campaign
amounted to a conspiracy to evade the country's federal campaign
laws, the law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, La Bella is said to have argued that the case raised
such serious issues that Reno had no alternative but to seek an
independent counsel and said that she had misinterpreted the law in
her decisions rejecting the appointment. Like Freeh, La Bella said
that the totality of the evidence provided sufficient grounds for
an appointment under the statute.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, Reno has refused to examine campaign fund-rasing
abusesexcept in a limited way. Her critics inside the Justice
Department say that her decisions have created the impression that
she has twisted the independent counsel statute to protect Clinton
and Gore as confidence in her and the Justice Department have
eroded.

MAN ACCUSED OF INFECTING WOMEN WITH AIDS VIRUS INDICTED ON FELONY
CHARGE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a rare prosecution relating to exposure to the
AIDS virus, Nushawn Williams was indicted Wednesday in the Bronx on
a felony charge of reckless endangerment and accused of having
unprotected sex with a teen-age girl months after he learned he was
infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury indictment of Williams, 21, appeared to mark the
first time in New York City that a reckless endangerment charge had
been brought in an AIDS-related case, Bronx prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who became the subject of a national furor in 1997
after he was accused of infecting more than a dozen women and girls
in rural Chautauqua County in upstate New York, was accused of with
having sex with the 15-year-old girl in the Bronx in May 1997. The
authorities said Williams had received counseling about HIV and its
dangers in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, would not say
Wednesday whether the girl had tested positive for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was also indicted on charges of attempted assault,
sexual misconduct and endangering the welfare of a child. Bronx
prosecutors said Wednesday that they are continuing their
investigation against Williams and are pursuing additional charges.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyer, William Cember, said his client had pleaded
not guilty to the charges in the Bronx case.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Williams had been charged only with the
statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in Chautauqua County.
Prosecutors there have not filed any charges related to Williams'
HIV status. However, the Chautauqua County district attorney, James
Subjack, has said that he would pursue assault charges against
Williams in those instances in which the suspect knew the risk
before he had sex.
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua County investigators have identified 48 sexual
partners of Williams. In addition to the 13 women and girls who
tested positive, 28 have tested negative and 7 have not been
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has told health officials that he had sex with 50 to 75
women in New York City, but in many instances could not provide a
name or address so officials have been unable to trace many of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams left upstate New York in early 1997, after living there
for more than a year. He moved back to New York City, where he grew
up, and was arrested in September 1997 in the Bronx for selling
crack cocaine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a number of states, reckless endangerment and assault laws
have been used to prosecute people who knowingly or negligently
expose or transmit HIV to others.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 HIV related bills were introduced in the last
legislative session in New York. One proposal, which is vehemently
opposed by advocates, would impose criminal penalties on a person
with HIV who failed to warn an uninformed partner. The advocates
say existing reckless endangerment and assault laws are adequate to
cover crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Girese, the counsel to the Bronx district attorney, said
Wednesday that an HIV-specific statute would make it easier to
prosecute cases like Williams', but such laws might also carry the
controversial ramification of casting too wide a net on people who
might be charged.
</P>
<P>
   With the reckless endangerment charge, Girese said prosecutors
will have to prove that Williams' conduct created a grave risk of
death and that he was aware of that risk. ``That's a fairly high
burden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of HIV cases in Chautauqua County also prompted a
flurry of proposals in state legislatures for tougher laws. Some
proposals call for more aggressive efforts to test and disclose the
status of infected people, while others make it a crime to transmit
or expose others to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, many advocates for people with AIDS and health
experts say the Williams case played a role in the passage earlier
this summer of the new HIV partner notification law. Lawmakers
voted by a wide margin in June to require that the names of HIV
positive people be reported to the state and that government
workers ask infected people to name their sexual partners so they
can be notified that they are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of lawmakers had been known to favor the
measure. But the bill passed after the Assembly's Democratic
leadership, which had resisted the concept for years, dropped their
opposition. Some Assembly members said public pressure on them to
act intensified after the widespread publicity generated by the
Williams case.

BARNICLE RESIGNATION MET WITH SADNESS, RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds Patricia Smith no comment.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Like a defeated figure in one of his own columns, Mike
Barnicle resigned the only newspaper job he said he ever wanted
Wednesday _ a decision met with relief, glee, and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   When Globe Editor Matthew V. Storin announced the newspaper's
top columnist's resignation during a late-afternoon newsroom
meeting, there was pin-drop silence followed by some stone-faced
head-shaking _ and some wide smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just two months after another of the paper's Metro
columnist, Patricia Smith, was forced to resign for the same
offense _ mixing fiction with fact _ most Globe staffers seemed
eager to write the epilogue to an embarrassing episode that had
stirred a national debate about journalistic ethics and had become
grist for local ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   (Reached in Austin, Texas, yesterday, Smith declined comment
when told of Barnicle's resignation.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' said David Armstrong, a reporter at the Globe
for five years. ``I remain angered by the great harm both of these
cases caused to the reputation of all honest reporters and editors
at the Globe, but at least we can now go about the business of
repairing the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's resignation capped two weeks of unusual tumult at the
newspaper, which found itself defending charges of a
double-standard after it first called for, and days later,
rescinded a call for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   His departure Wednesday was cheered by some community leaders,
who met last week with top Globe officials to discuss how the
newspaper deals with and promotes its minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to keep him at first, the Globe management was
putting out a fire with gasoline,'' said the Rev. Jeffrey Brown,
chairman of the Boston Ten Point Coalition. ``I'm hoping this is a
step in the right direction in terms of the Globe not only
addressing its journalistic integrity, but also addressing issues
of diversity at the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Washington-based Center for
Media and Public Affairs, called Barnicle a tragic figure out of an
old-school newsroom that has little place in modern-day journalism
whose standards, he said, are increasingly unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to recognize that there's more to journalism
than printing the facts,'' Lichter said. ``There is catching the
flavor of a city and connecting with ordinary people. And in that
style of journalism, there were those who took some liberties with
the facts to make that connection. You can't justify it. And, yet,
it's sad to see it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran Globe staffers were sad to see Barnicle, who some
said was synonymous with the Globe among the newspaper's
readership, forced from the most conspicuous job at the paper after
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a tragedy,'' said Stan Grossfeld, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographer and associate editor at the paper. ``I'm
really saddened by it. It's bad for the paper and the readers and
all of us. He's been the subject of a witch hunt. He's been a
franchise player for this paper and I'd like to hear from him what
he has to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian McGrory, who covers the White House for the Globe, called
Barnicle's resignation an ``incredibly sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who laughs or cheers about this doesn't understand the
institution, the business, or what we mean to the community and
what Barnicle has meant to the community for a quarter of a
century. This is nobody's victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after Storin's unusual decision last week to retain
Barnicle after he confessed to being lazy and sloppy for allowing
jokes from a George Carlin book to appears in an Aug. 2 column,
about 50 staffers signed a petition disagreeing with that decision,
saying it sent the wrong message about the newspaper's standards.
</P>
<P>
   And, they said, any applause in the Globe's newsroom was for a
reaffirmation of those standards and not for downfall of a
long-time Globe employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I still strongly disagree with the Globe's decision to
simply suspend Barnicle initially, I am very pleased that the
newspaper acted quickly to seek his termination after learning
about this latest outrageous episode of fabrication,'' said Diego
Ribadeneira, a 12-year veteran and the paper's religion writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It restores some of my faith in the standards that this paper
claims to embrace,'' he said. ``I hope the Globe continues to
investigate and make public all allegations regarding Barnicle's
work that continue to stream in. Barnicle apparently is incapable
of doing his job honestly and with integrity. Someone like that _
no matter his name recognition, popularity with readers or the
clout he enjoys with the white establishment media _ has no
business working at this newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kurkjian, an investigative reporter and editor at the
Globe for 30 years, said that once the Barnicle furor subsides and
newsroom divisions heal, he hopes people will recall the voice the
columnist gave people from Beacon Hill to Roxbury Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he got too stretched from all his other outside
obligations that he couldn't maintain the past quality of his
columns; maybe he became alienated from others who work so hard
around here to make the paper compelling and straight as it is, and
forgot the rules we all operate under,'' said Kurkjian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the specific reasons for his failings but I do
know that he was not a fraud or a trimmer. Any police reporter
working a major crime story could attest to that. Tipped off to the
tragedy by some pal in the police department, Barnicle was
inevitably there with his notebook out, and the information that
filled it _ whether observations or quotes from cops, eyewitnesses
or family members _ he never hesitated to share with any Globe
reporters who asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, who had promised to reduce his outside appearances
after his suspension was rescinded last week, was not left
unemployed by the Globe's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at WCVB-TV, Channel 5, where Barnicle works as a
member of its magazine show, ``Chronicle,'' said it is keeping him
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point of view is that in the 15 years that Mike has been
on our air, we have found one three-second transgression,'' said
Elizabeth Cheng, the station's programming director. ``The nature
of newspapers and television are very different. One person can't
get a story on the air. It takes a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Zachary R. Dowdy, a Globe reporter and president of the Boston
Association of Black Journalists, said he is relieved that the
controversy is finally over, ``putting several months of racial
tension in the city and the journalism world behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the Globe asked for Barnicle's resignation because of
fabrications mirrors the punishment given to Patricia Smith, which
also obliterates the appearance of the double standard that
surfaced a week ago when the Globe flip-flopped on its decision to
release him.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Wednesday ordered that
pretrial questioning of Bill Gates and 16 other Microsoft Corp.
executives be taken behind closed doors, overruling a lower court
judge who had ordered lawyers to take public depositions in the
government's antitrust case against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is temporary, pending
a hearing in September, a ruling in the appeal will not be rendered
until after the depositions have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court judges noted that because the
questioning would be videotaped, it could be shown to the news
media and the public later if mandated by the final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the
government's antitrust case against Microsoft in U.S. District
Court here, reluctantly ruled that a U.S. antitrust law left him no
alternative but to force the depositions to be open to the news
media and to the public. That ruling had been sought by three news
organizations _ The New York Times, The Seattle Times and the cable
television and online news units of Ziff-Davis, a computer trade
publisher owned by Softbank Corp. Their filing was joined by two
news services, Reuters and Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the appellate judges were considering Microsoft's appeal
of Jackson's ruling, lawyers for Microsoft, the Justice Department
and the news media were drafting recommendations for Jackson on how
a public deposition in a federal case would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had argued that taking the depositions with reporters
present would create ``a carnival atmosphere'' that would
``seriously interfere with Microsoft's ability to prepare for trial
in the short time remaining.''
</P>
<P>
   The depositions of Gates and the other executives are being
taken in preparation for a trial, which is scheduled to begin Sept.
8. Both Microsoft and the Justice Department, however, have asked
the U.S. District Court for a two-week postponement, largely
because of delays that are anticipated for arranging and taking
public depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The judges issuing Wednesday's order, Stephen Williams, Douglas
Ginsburg and David Sentelle, set out a schedule in September for
hearing full arguments on Microsoft's appeal. Their order reasoned
that ``the balance of harm favors the appellant,'' Microsoft,
because the pretrial interviews would remain private if Microsoft
eventually won the appeal, yet could be made public by means of the
videotape if Microsoft lost.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday evening, Microsoft said it was
``gratified by today's decision, and we will move ahead to schedule
the remaining depositions as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who will preside over the trial next month, scheduled a
hearing for Friday morning to determine how the pretrial
preparations should now proceed, and whether the trial can begin on
time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, Jackson ruled that an obscure 1913 law left him no
choice but to open the pretrial depositions to the news media and
the public. The law states that in civil antitrust actions brought
by the federal government, the taking of depositions ``shall be
open to the public as freely as are trials in open court, and no
order excluding the public from attendance on any such proceedings
shall be valid or enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not rule on the applicability of that law
to this case; that is what it will decide after the hearings in
September. The court simply ordered the depositions to proceed in
private, pending its decision next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Levine, the lawyer representing the news organizations,
said: ``I'm certainly disappointed, but we're not dead yet. At the
very least, we have a shot at getting the videotapes.'' Still, he
added, ``I think the public interest here is diminished to a degree
that the statute did not contemplate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had sided with the news organizations but
on Wednesday said, ``The order is clear, and we will comply with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jackson had refused Microsoft's request that the
depositions be allowed to proceed in private while the company
appealed his decision.
</P>
<P>
   But no depositions have been taken in the meantime because the
judge also ordered the parties to set out elaborate, detailed rules
for taking the depositions in public. Those rules, filling a
10-page legal brief, were delivered to the court Wednesday
afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The following column, which ran in The Sunday Globe of Oct. 8,
1995, prompted the latest Globe inquiry into Mike Barnicle's
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

By MIKE BARNICLE &QL; 
THROUGH PAIN, A COMMON BOND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Note to readers: The following is an OJ-free column. It does not
contain a single reference to the violent, wife-beating stooge who
has dominated our lives and the news for too long.
</P>
<P>
   She opened the letter as she strolled up the driveway from the
mailbox. As she finished the first paragraph she stopped in her
tracks, unable to focus because of the tears in her eyes. After a
few seconds, she lifted her head toward the perfect sky and, for a
brief, wonderful moment, she could hear her son singing his
favorite song.
</P>
<P>
   In the house, she put the mail down and called her husband at
the store where he works to tell him what had just arrived. At
first, he was speechless, trying awkwardly to collect his emotions
and having some difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it to me,'' the husband said.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke softly and slowly, savoring each word. When she
finished, neither said anything for a long time until, finally, the
husband declared: ``There really is a God.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago, they were living at Children's Hospital in
Boston. Their 9-year-old son had been diagnosed with cancer. And
the father had just been laid off by one of these high-tech
companies that survives only by ``downsizing,'' a '90s word for
unemployment, the type of management move that has brought economic
death-sentences to so many households. His wife was a library
clerk. In addition to their son, there were three other children,
girls ages 7, 5 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer is the greediest of diseases. It consumes the cells of a
victim's body without discrimination. It has no conscience either,
striking the very young and the very innocent as well as those a
lot older who at least have managed to see and taste a larger slice
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, both parents took turns at the hospital with
their sick boy. The doctors and nurses were wonderful and heroic as
they managed to evoke smiles and optimism from those so wounded by
the bitter reality of their illness.
</P>
<P>
   Their son struck up a friendship with another boy on the floor,
a 10-year-old who _ like him _ loved baseball. And on those dreamy
summer nights when the Olde Towne Team was home, the two of them
would sit by a window on an upper floor in a hospital ward and
listen to games on the radio as they looked at the lights of the
ballpark off in the distance, washing across the July sky like some
brilliant Milky Way all their own.
</P>
<P>
   These two sick children became thick as thieves, joined by their
passion for the Red Sox along with the anchor of their cancer.
Naturally, their parents became friends, too.
</P>
<P>
   The other boy was from Connecticut. His parents were trust-fund
wealthy but even their affluence could not insulate them from the
cargo of grief that attaches itself to anyone with a wounded child.
</P>
<P>
   So, this boy's mother and father were deeply touched when the
parents of the 9-year-old presented both boys with Red Sox jackets
and two baseballs signed by Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great, generous country. We are capable of doing so
much good it can make you dizzy. Along with prejudice and division,
we are also a land of miracles and progress but none of it can
impede the nearly inevitable curse of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that the 9-year-old died on a clear, crisp fall
day when his favorite game had long fallen silent from a strike.
The combination of hospitalization and unemployment had nearly
bankrupted the family, yet they had to fight on for their three
surviving children.
</P>
<P>
   But every day was like carrying a load of bricks up some steep,
never-ending hill. The only job the father found was at a variety
store while his wife simply could not return to work.
</P>
<P>
   And on the morning she stopped in her tracks, letter in hand,
their home was on the verge of foreclosure as she read that first
paragraph: ``We will never forget the kindness you showed our son
at Children's. God moves in mysterious ways. We are so fortunate.
(Boy's name) is doing well. We heard about your difficulty from (a
nurse) and want you to accept what we have sent. Your son gave a
lot to (our son). We think about him every day and we still hear
his beautiful voice singing his favorite song, The Star Spangled
Banner, when we watch the Red Sox. You gave to us. Now it is time
for our family to give in return. May God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   They had enclosed $10,000. It is the kind of generous gesture,
one wounded couple to another, forged forever at the edge of a
gentle sadness. Not that it matters, but the people from
Connecticut are white while the parents who lost their 9-year-old
boy are black. And in their common voyage, there might be an
American verdict we can admire.

MILLIONAIRE PLEADS GUILTY IN LOTTERY CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Canadian millionaire pleaded guilty Wednesday to
conspiring to violate U.S. gambling laws for his role in selling
chances at foreign lotteries to hundreds of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 800 lottery customers prosecutors
identified were elderly. Some lost their life savings after buying
the telephone pitch to invest thousands of dollars at a chance to
win millions in lotteries in Spain, Australia or Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers never got a ticket, merely a share in blocks of numbers.
Some people did win, but hundreds lost millions of dollars. The
worst case found by prosecutors was a person who lost $329,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his guilty plea, James Blair Down, 55, of
Vancouver, B.C., also agreed to surrender $11.7 million that
federal agents seized last year from Down's stockbrokers, Smith
Barney in Bellevue. Much of that money will go for restitution for
people who bought lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea represents the first U.S. prosecution of foreign
lottery sales, said U.S. Attorney Kate Pflaumer. It also culminated
five years of investigation across different continents. But it may
not be the last prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Pflaumer said U.S. and Canadian authorities will continue to
crack down on the lottery sales, and she cautioned U.S. consumers
against such schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Many other companies also continue to operate around Vancouver,
Montreal and Toronto, selling the idea of winning millions in an
offshore lottery to Americans, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out: Blair Down isn't the only person out there offering
gold at the end of the rainbow,'' said Gerald Miera, agent in
charge of Seattle's postal inspectors. ``What they are offering is
baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven people indicted last year with Down have yet to be
extradited to the United States to stand trial. One defendant has
reached a plea agreement, which has been sealed.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from prosecutors came too late for Monte Opsata, 94.
The Seattle area man spent $70,000 to $80,000 on lotteries after
getting calls from Down's telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a wheelchair waiting for the court proceedings to
begin Wednesday, Opsata described himself as a ``sucker'' who
bought ``wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan was never to give you something,'' he said. ``The
plan was to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   He described how he was convinced that by cleaning out his bank
account and betting on the foreign lotteries he could become a
millionaire. His problems only came to light when he asked his
granddaughter Virginia Guy for a loan of $40,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guy and her husband made repeated trips to Vancouver,
confronting employees in basement of a parking garage where the
calls were made. Finally, they were given $42,000 for Opsata and
asked to keep quiet, Guy said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, both watched as federal marshals led a handcuffed
Down, dressed in a blue business suit, into the courtroom. He was
named with nine others last year in a 145-count indictment, then
arrested in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first U.S. court appearance Wednesday. He agreed to
a plea bargain and admitted to the conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
   He could face five years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed
to recommend six months. Down may get to serve that sentence in
Canada. Prosecutors will drop all charges against his wife, Joan
Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's getting off easy,'' Opsata told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said their attempts to get Down to face trial in
the U.S. would have taken years. One Canadian court has overturned
that nation's laws that outlaw foreign lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian courts typically won't extradite someone to the U.S. to
stand charges for something that is not a crime in Canada. So
higher Canadian courts would have to resolve the question before
extraditions could take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many of our victims would be dead by the time the
extradition process was completed,'' said Peter Mueller, who
prosecuted Down.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors now hope that restitution can be made in the next
six months. People who believe they were victims of Down's should
ask for a claim package by writing to U.S. v James Blair Down
Restitution Fund, P.O. Box 2328, Seattle 98111-2328.
</P>
<P>
   Down's attorney handed out a statement that said that Down
pleaded guilty ``in an effort to bring closure to this matter and
to ensure that restitution is made to aggrieved persons entitled to
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they warned Down as long ago as 1992 that
selling foreign lotteries in the United States was against the law.
</P>
<P>
   Federal sources said the $12 million that Down surrendered
represents perhaps a third of his wealth. He maintains large homes
in Vancouver and on the Caribbean island of Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard Troberman said Down conducted his business
openly and legally in Canada. He noted that Down did not admit
guilt to nor was ever charged with fraud. ``Those people who
purchased lottery tickets received the full value of their
purchases, and, in many instances, had winnings which were paid,''
Troberman said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller and Plfaumer, however, described a different business
that preyed upon the vulnerable elderly and made
misrepresentations.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Down's companies marked up the lottery chances
500 to 600 percent, Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   What people bought weren't lottery tickets, but an interest in
the lottery. Instead of tickets, they got sheets with numbers on
them.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1995, the companies made 5 million calls to the
United States, Pflaumer said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some winners, including anyone who spent $100,000,
Pflaumer said. ``They could have a TV set or a VCR or a check for
$5,000,'' Pflaumer said. ``They could get their picture taken and
say how happy they were to participate in the lottery.''

NASCAR RECORD FOR GORDON IS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having already established himself as the driver to beat this
season, Jeff Gordon has a chance to preserve his place in Nascar
history this weekend with a fifth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   A triumph by Gordon at Bristol, Tenn., on Saturday would set a
record for consecutive victories in modern Nascar Winston Cup
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Six other drivers _ Mark Martin, Bill Elliott, Harry Gant, Dale
Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip and Cale Yarborough _ share with Gordon
the record of four straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to dominate in Nascar,'' Earnhardt said. ``But
Gordon and his team are certainly doing that. We did the same thing
in 1987 when everything went our way and we won 11 races. You can't
explain it, the cards just fall your way. Right now, the No. 24
bunch is head and shoulders above the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon wins for the fifth straight time this weekend it will
be his ninth victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The string of victories began last month at Pocono, where the
efficient work of his pit crew late in the race put him out front
for good.
</P>
<P>
   The streak continued in Indianapolis six days later.
</P>
<P>
   After Dale Jarrett ran out of gas, Gordon drove away from the
field to become the first two-time winner of the Brickyard 400. He
collected a prize package, including a bonus from Winston, of more
than $1.6 million, the largest in American motorsports history.
</P>
<P>
   The week after that, Gordon ran down Mike Skinner at Watkins
Glen, N.Y., taking the lead with only five laps remaining as
Skinner was forced to slow and conserve fuel.
</P>
<P>
   That third straight victory was also Gordon's third won from the
pole position.
</P>
<P>
   The streak, however, appeared in jeopardy last weekend at
Brooklyn, Mich. Gordon was in position to finish high, but had not
led a lap all day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, once again, he benefited from the wizardry of his pit
crew.
</P>
<P>
   He came into the pit in third place late in the race, left in
second place, and drove by Martin a few laps later to take his
fourth straight checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records are great because when your career is over you can
look back and say that was cool you did that,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   A victory on Saturday would be the 38th of Gordon's career.
</P>
<P>
   During his streak, Gordon has started from the pole once, the
outside of the front row once and from inside the second row. He
has led by as few as nine laps (Michigan) and as many as 154 of 200
(Pocono). Over all, Gordon has run up front for 325 of the 650 laps
in the four races.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Gordon's favor this weekend is the location of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol is a track where he has enjoyed much success. He has won
four times at the short track, which resembles a bowl because of
the high-banked turns, and was victorious there last spring. But
should he win on Saturday, it will be his first triumph under the
lights at Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bristol a lot, but it's been up and down for me there
for the night race,'' he said. ``We're excited about it because we
know it is a good track for us, but we have to have some luck too,
some of that luck that we had at Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   His excellent starting positions, Gordon said, have had much to
do with his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to try to go in there, qualify up front and
do what we've been doing,'' Gordon said. ``We have a 97-point lead,
but all it takes is a 40th-place finish and that lead is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his opportunity to set a record, Gordon said his focus,
and that of his team, remains on the championship.
</P>
<P>
   He leads Martin by 97 points. But it was at Bristol last season
when Martin trailed Gordon by 99 points, only to emerge 13 points
in the lead after a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six drivers who share the modern-day record for
consecutive victories with Gordon, Waltrip came closest to making
it five, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his bid at Atlanta when Neil Bonnett edged him at the
finish line by less than two feet. Waltrip was in the lead when the
white flag was waived, but Bonnett pulled even with him on the
backstretch and beat him by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our careers parallel each other so well,'' Waltrip said.
``From the success I had in the early 80's to the success he's
having right now. I was just like he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the right car, the right team, the right driver, the
right sponsor and the right time, and that's just where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Waltrip added, ``Bristol is a difficult track to run
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cale Yarborough and Harry Gant also came close to recording
a fifth straight victory. But Yarborough finished second to Donnie
Allison at Charlotte in 1976, when Allison took the lead from
Yarborough on the 308th of 334 laps. And Gant was passed by
Earnhardt with eight laps to go at North Wilkesboro in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt was passed by Davey Allison with 10 laps to remaining
at Talladega in 1987 in his bid for a fifth straight victory, and
Martin dropped to sixth after dominating most of the race at
Richmond in 1993, when he went for a fifth consecutive triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott was the only driver with four straight victories
not to have at least a chance at capturing his fifth race in row.
He had mechanical trouble at Bristol in 1992, wound up 30 laps down
and finished 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Should Gordon set the record at Bristol, it would seem that
Richard Petty's streak of 10 straight victories, which came during
Nascar's pioneer era up until 1972 when the series staged about 50
races each season (there are now about half), might even be in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   After Bristol, Nascar goes to New Hampshire and then to
Darlington, N.C., tracks where Gordon has been dominant in the
past.

SMOKE AND MIRRORS AND CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some members of Arizona's congressional delegation are so upset
with President Clinton they believe he should be impeached and
removed from office. Like many other fair-minded justice-loving
citizens, I'd be more than willing to go along with that _ right
after we indict the chairman of R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the top bosses of Philip Morris, U.S. Tobacco,
Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco and
American Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon said after Clinton's Monday night speech, ``I
personally believe he lied under oath . . . and as I recall, the
perjury laws provide no exemption for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He's correct. The law is the law. Perjury is perjury. Members of
Congress, who swear to uphold the law, do not believe in special
treatment or exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're testifying about tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, seven top executives of the nation's largest
tobacco firms appeared before a committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives and stated _ under oath _ that they believed
nicotine was not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants of death also swore _ under oath _ that they
``weren't sure'' whether cigarette smoking causes disease.
</P>
<P>
   So far as I know, none of them has been charged with a crime. &QL; 
Accepted tobacco money &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, back in the 1980s and early '90s, Rep. Salmon was
among the thousands of American politicians accepting fat campaign
contributions from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   So was Salmon's fellow Republican from Arizona, Rep. John
Shadegg, who also suspects Clinton of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these politicians takes tobacco money now.
</P>
<P>
   When the public opinion polls started going against
cigarettemakers, Salmon, Shadegg and many others ran for the hills.
(Which they could do, being non-smokers.)
</P>
<P>
   But near as I can tell, none of the politicians now condemning
Clinton has suggested the big boys of tobacco also be indicted for
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton, we're talking about misleading people over some
hanky-panky with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   With the other guys, it's misinformation about a product that
kills 435,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's deception took place during a deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case. Lying to Congress is worse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Michael Deaver, a former top White House aide and
friend of President Reagan, was found guilty on three charges of
lying under oath to a grand jury and to a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those charges carries a penalty of up to five years in
prison and thousands of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, while speaking under oath, the head of one tobacco
firm compared smoking cigarettes to eating sweets. &QC; 
Equal treatment? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if members of Congress treated Clinton the way
they treat Joe Camel, they'd not only ignore the president's lies,
they use tax dollars to subsidize his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And they'd pulverize anybody who tried to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of the way they killed Sen. John McCain's plan to cut
teenage smoking by giving the government authority to regulate
nicotine and increasing the tax on tobacco by $1.10 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other senator, Jon Kyl, who piously has stated that
he, too, was ``offended'' by Clinton's speech, was among those who
voted to kill McCain's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy, like nicotine, is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The president deceived us about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky for something like seven months. With the tobacco
companies, it's been generations.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington lawmakers, it's ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one example. While cigarettes turn good people to
ash, politicians blow smoke about Clinton. I'm no surgeon general,
but that's got to be bad for your health.
</P>
<P>
   Try not to inhale. &QL;

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some members of Arizona's congressional delegation are so upset
with President Clinton they believe he should be impeached and
removed from office. Like many other fair-minded justice-loving
citizens, I'd be more than willing to go along with that _ right
after we indict the chairman of R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the top bosses of Philip Morris, U.S. Tobacco,
Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco and
American Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon said after Clinton's Monday night speech, ``I
personally believe he lied under oath . . . and as I recall, the
perjury laws provide no exemption for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He's correct. The law is the law. Perjury is perjury. Members of
Congress, who swear to uphold the law, do not believe in special
treatment or exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're testifying about tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, seven top executives of the nation's largest
tobacco firms appeared before a committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives and stated _ under oath _ that they believed
nicotine was not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants of death also swore _ under oath _ that they
``weren't sure'' whether cigarette smoking causes disease.
</P>
<P>
   So far as I know, none of them has been charged with a crime. &QL; 
Accepted tobacco money &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, back in the 1980s and early '90s, Rep. Salmon was
among the thousands of American politicians accepting fat campaign
contributions from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   So was Salmon's fellow Republican from Arizona, Rep. John
Shadegg, who also suspects Clinton of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these politicians takes tobacco money now.
</P>
<P>
   When the public opinion polls started going against
cigarettemakers, Salmon, Shadegg and many others ran for the hills.
(Which they could do, being non-smokers.)
</P>
<P>
   But near as I can tell, none of the politicians now condemning
Clinton has suggested the big boys of tobacco also be indicted for
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton, we're talking about misleading people over some
hanky-panky with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   With the other guys, it's misinformation about a product that
kills 435,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's deception took place during a deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case. Lying to Congress is worse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Michael Deaver, a former top White House aide and
friend of President Reagan, was found guilty on three charges of
lying under oath to a grand jury and to a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those charges carries a penalty of up to five years in
prison and thousands of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, while speaking under oath, the head of one tobacco
firm compared smoking cigarettes to eating sweets. &QC; 
Equal treatment? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if members of Congress treated Clinton the way
they treat Joe Camel, they'd not only ignore the president's lies,
they use tax dollars to subsidize his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And they'd pulverize anybody who tried to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of the way they killed Sen. John McCain's plan to cut
teenage smoking by giving the government authority to regulate
nicotine and increasing the tax on tobacco by $1.10 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other senator, Jon Kyl, who piously has stated that
he, too, was ``offended'' by Clinton's speech, was among those who
voted to kill McCain's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy, like nicotine, is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The president deceived us about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky for something like seven months. With the tobacco
companies, it's been generations.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington lawmakers, it's ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one example. While cigarettes turn good people to
ash, politicians blow smoke about Clinton. I'm no surgeon general,
but that's got to be bad for your health.
</P>
<P>
   Try not to inhale. &QL;

people, sitting snugly in inner tubes - across a flat,
1,300-foot-long surface. Water gets sucked into grates positioned
every couple of hundred feet along the floor of the river, where it
travels via large pipes to one of three pumping stations in the
park. (Maxine Hicks/New York Times Photo)

High-definition TV sets at a Matsushita plant in Tijuana.
Manufacturers say some of the components used to build these sets
cost more than they had anticipated. Despite the high price, and
despite the fact that most of these televisions will be huge
rear-projectors that will dominate almost any room in which they

most of the world's consumer-electronics manufacturers have

at Six Flags Magic Mountain outside Los Angeles is controlled by a
special computer system, operated out of this dingy, unfinished

CIR-ROLLER-COASTERS-1, 8-19 -- The technology that operates rides
like Riddler's Revenge has largely removed the risk of human error
from roller-coaster control. As riders are whipsawed around a track
in apparent pandemonium, it is machines and not people that insure
that the cars whiz down the track at the right speed, do not
collide and do not hit obstacles that block the route. (Chris

</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if members of Congress treated Clinton the way
they treat Joe Camel, they'd not only ignore the president's lies,
they use tax dollars to subsidize his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And they'd pulverize anybody who tried to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of the way they killed Sen. John McCain's plan to cut
teenage smoking by giving the government authority to regulate
nicotine and increasing the tax on tobacco by $1.10 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other senator, Jon Kyl, who piously has stated that
he, too, was ``offended'' by Clinton's speech, was among those who
voted to kill McCain's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy, like nicotine, is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The president deceived us about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky for something like seven months. With the tobacco
companies, it's been generations.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington lawmakers, it's ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one example. While cigarettes turn good people to
ash, politicians blow smoke about Clinton. I'm no surgeon general,
but that's got to be bad for your health.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign that prosecutors are dissatisfied with
President Clinton's limited admission of an intimate relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, they demanded Wednesday that he provide a
sample of his genetic material to establish forensic proof that the
relationship was sexual.
</P>
<P>
   The move strongly suggests that the FBI crime lab has determined
that a dress turned over to prosecutors by Lewinsky contained DNA
from semen. One person familiar with the findings said the lab
technicians had found semen on the dress. Prosecutors are trying to
determine whether Clinton stained the dress in a sexual encounter
with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The request by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr came on
Clinton's 52nd birthday, which he marked privately with his family
during a vacation on Martha's Vineyard. It signaled that
prosecutors do not plan to soften their aggressive tactics after
Clinton's admission to a grand jury Monday that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's team had believed that the results of testing on the
dress were mooted by the president's admission, as well as by a
brief speech he gave Monday night calling the relationship ``not
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said any sample turned
over to the FBI would be obtained from the Bethesda Naval Hospital,
where Clinton undergoes annual physicals and where supplies of his
blood are stored.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known how Clinton's lawyers would respond
to the request. It came a day before Ms. Lewinsky, who was said by
friends to feel hurt by the president's terse public description of
their relationship, is scheduled to appear for a second time before
the grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's request suggested that he is determined to learn what
specific type of sex Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had. But such an
effort could work to the president's political benefit as Congress
weighs conducting impeachment hearings, some of his advisers
believe. They think it could make prosecutors appear sex-obsessed,
even as most Americans tell pollsters that they already know more
than they would like about lies, betrayal and sexual indiscretion
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is clearly dissatisfied with the president's
testimony. Clinton refused to give prosecutors a detailed
description of his sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky, after reading
a statement admitting the affair at the beginning of his four-hour
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been seeking to determine if Clinton committed perjury
in January, when he denied any sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky during a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
suit.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Clinton argued that the type of sex he
had with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the definition of sex used by the
Jones lawyers. Although he rebuffed prosecutors' questions about
his sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky, he did answer a series of
questions about what types of sex he considered to be covered by
that definition, one Clinton adviser said Wednesday. The president
said that oral sex, among other acts, was not covered by the
definition, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser to Clinton said the president did not
acknowledge having oral sex or any other type of specific sexual
contact with Ms. Lewinsky, instead referring prosecutors back to
his initial statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and over, he said, `I've already said that it was
improper,' '' said the adviser, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Because Starr has asked the president for a DNA sample, it is
highly unlikely that he had not been told what was found on the
dress.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr chose to wait to ask for a sample of the president's
genetic material until after Clinton completed his grand jury
testimony. Law enforcement officials dismissed the possibility that
Starr would have asked the president for a sample in an attempt to
``bluff'' him.
</P>
<P>
   A careful vagueness about his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky is
central to the president's legal and political strategy, his
advisers say, since it may help deflect a possible perjury charge
while also walling off seamy details from an already queasy public.
Clinton was even more vague in his four-minute address Monday night
than in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   That speech was watched by 67.6 million people, Nielsen Media
Research said Wednesday. Some 53 million viewers watched his
far-longer State of the Union Message, delivered shortly after
Clinton was first accused of having an affair with Ms. Lewinsky and
covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers have said that Clinton answered every question
put to him that did not deal with sex. That position is also
central to the president's political defense: If Starr demands
further testimony, the president's team would like to be able to
argue that prosecutors are intent on grilling him only about
intimate matters. ``We want to make the argument that Starr's
investigation is just about sex,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private attorney, did not agree to
extend his testimony more than a few minutes beyond the four-hour
time limit, even though prosecutors had more questions. Starr said
that he might subpoena Clinton for further testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not confirm the request from Starr's
office. It released a two-sentence statement: ``On Monday night the
president acknowledged an improper relationship and apologized for
that. The president also said it's time to reclaim his privacy, and
we will respect that by not commenting on every leak generated by
this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recalling Ms. Lewinsky, who testified to the grand jury
August 6, Starr is seeking to determine if there are
inconsistencies between her account and Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Lewinsky prepared to testify again, she was said by
friends to be unhappy about Clinton's speech Monday night. Ms.
Lewinsky, her friends said, was dismayed to hear what she regarded
as a romance with Clinton _ a lengthy relationship that included
gifts of poetry and neckties _ acknowledged as merely an
inappropriate dalliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an older man who made all the instances and
references to a younger woman that this relationship was not just
about sex,'' one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's friends said that she had always intended to tell
the truth before the grand jury, so her feelings would have no
impact on her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Since the president acknowledged an intimate relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky on Monday night, White House advisers and prominent
Democrats have been disclosing their wounded feelings over the
intimate revelations of recent days. Some appear to be bidding for
public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Others are just downright mad. Among them is Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who said Tuesday that her trust in Clinton's
credibility had been ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days just after the Lewinsky accusations were disclosed
last January, Clinton sought to reassure Feinstein by privately
telling her that Ms. Lewinsky had had to be transferred from the
White House because she was fantasizing about him, and ``on the
verge of stalking him,'' a person close to Ms. Feinstein said
Wednesday. Friends said that helped explain Ms. Feinstein's strong
statement of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   On vacation at a borrowed Martha's Vineyard estate, Clinton
celebrated his 52nd birthday on Wednesday night with Vernon Jordan,
his friend and confidant. It was the first extended time that the
two men and their families spent together since Jordan was
subpoenaed by Starr to explain his role late last year in helping
Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York. He has denied any effort to
help hide her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton awoke Wednesday to calls for his resignation from some
editorialists and Republican congressmen. His advisers dismissed
such statements as the chattering of Washington elites, saying that
the public had heard more than it wanted to hear about the Lewinsky
investigation, and was anxious for the federal government to turn
to matters of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime Clinton allies argued that Starr was seeking to
make crimes out of private indiscretions. ```I think the
criminalization of bad sexual judgment is something we ought not to
be doing,'' said James Carville, Clinton's former campaign manager.
``It's just loony.''

TRIAL ENDS FOR BUSINESSMAN ACCUSED IN NAZI WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The civil trial of Jack Reimer, the retired
businessman accused of concealing his role in Nazi war crimes,
ended Wednesday after two weeks of anguished courtroom
recollections from Holocaust survivors and numbingly detailed
descriptions of how a Nazi training camp worked.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be several months, however, before Judge
Lawrence M. McKenna of U.S. district court in Manhattan rules on
the Justice Department's request to have Reimer, 79, stripped of
his United States citizenship, a first step toward his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would hold open the already-voluminous court
record to accept further evidence while three more potential
witnesses are sought by Reimer's lawyers. McKenna gave no deadline
for finding the witnesses, who are elderly German war veterans and
may have known Reimer at Trawniki, a training facility for Nazi
guards and a concentration camp, in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that Reimer, who was born in the
Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union and served in the Soviet
Army until his capture by the Nazis, helped train guards at the
camp and led his units on duty that involved killing Jewish
prisoners and liquidating Jewish ghettos. He came to the United
States in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Stutman, a Justice Department lawyer, said that
although Reimer began his service for the Nazis as a Soviet
prisoner of war at Trawniki, he ultimately became a favored and
trusted officer with all the privileges of leave, salary and
commendations from the German command.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has given contradictory statements about what he
did, Reimer told McKenna that he trained only one group of men at
Trawniki, never entered any ghetto, never killed anyone and served
most of his time at the camp as its paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   As his civil trial wound down, he made one more protest against
the government's charges and the shouts of ``Nazi'' from some
spectators at the trial. ``I just can't stand it when they call me
that,'' Reimer told the judge. He added, ``They always have the
attitude: You were there, so you must be guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenna said that before ruling on the crux of the case, he
would determine the admissibility of crucial documents submitted as
evidence, as well as testimony referring to those documents. The
record includes German wartime archives, interviews with former
Russian prisoners of war who had served at Trawniki, and
self-incriminating statements made by Reimer during a 1992
interview with government lawyers that he later asserted were
coerced.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself a ``child of the Cold War,'' the judge said he
had questions about the reliability of some of the Russian material
_ mainly the statements given by Russian witnesses to investigators
right after the war, when Stalin was shipping Russians returning
from prisoner-of-war camps to Siberian labor camps as traitors, and
to the KGB in the mid-1960s, when the Communist regime embarked on
a fresh campaign to root out Nazi collaborators and publicize Nazi
war crimes in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In previous cases to revoke the citizenship of people accused in
war crimes, Soviet-era evidence has been ruled admissible, said a
Justice Department lawyer involved in such cases, who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, documents from the archives of the
former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries have played an
increasingly significant role in the Justice Department's hunt for
Nazi war criminals who slipped through the postwar immigration
screening procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Reimer, such archive material could prove pivotal
because it contains some of the only witness accounts of people who
placed Reimer at certain events and, in one case, identified him as
a Nazi officer who pushed Jews into a pit for massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The main government evidence from Soviet files is a set of 1964
interviews by the KGB with two Russian war veterans, both of whom
had been captured by the Germans and transferred to Trawniki in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   English-language translations of the KGB records show that both
men identified Reimer as a junior officer, and as entering the
Lublin ghetto at the time of its liquidation and assisting in
killing several dozen people in a pit in a forest outside Lublin.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer has denied ever having been in a Jewish ghetto, much less
having participated in rounding up Jewish prisoners for dispatch to
the Nazi death camps or participating in the Lublin-area murders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian evidence may also prove problematic. Justice
Department lawyers traveled to northern Russia in January to
interview one of the war veterans in person. But the man, Nikolai
S. Leontev, now 86 and half-blind from a war injury, gave them an
ambiguous and decidedly more befuddled account of what he saw
Reimer do during the war, according to transcripts of the
government's interviews with Leontev.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts revealed, for example, that Leontev said he
exaggerated some figures in his account to the KGB 34 years
earlier. Pressed for details about the activities of his unit,
which he had said served under Reimer, he protested repeatedly that
he could not remember, the transcripts showed.
</P>
<P>
   He contradicted some of his earlier testimony, specifically
concerning whether Reimer had ever entered the Lublin ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally said he remembered Reimer, according to the
transcript, Leontev described him as ``a nice fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the type to hand out punishment,'' Leontev told his
American visitors. ``He never said an unkind word.'' &QL;

INTERNET RULING A BLOW TO LOCAL PHONE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet service providers won a major victory Wednesday when an
appeals court upheld the Federal Communications Commission's
decision to exempt Internet service providers from paying local
phone companies the access fees that the Bells are allowed to
charge long distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a blow to local telephone companies that had
argued that Internet service providers, like long-distance
companies, use local phone lines to connect users to global
networks and thus should have to pay the same fees. In fact, the
Bells argue that on a per-customer basis, Internet users tend to be
a greater drain on local phone networks than long-distance callers
are because Internet connections frequently last for hours, while
most long-distance calls are measured in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on local access fees was handed down by the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis as part of a broader
opinion that ruled on a number of issues stemming from portions of
the 1996 Telecommunications Act, in which Congress attempted to
encourage cuts in long-distance rates.
</P>
<P>
   In another setback for the Bell companies, the judges also
upheld FCC regulations intended to reduce the $23 billion that
local phone companies collect from long distance carriers by $1.7
billion. The commission estimated the savings would be worth about
$2 a month to the average long distance customer.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption for Internet service providers was especially
controversial because so much had changed since it was implemented.
More than a decade ago, long before the Internet was a mass medium,
the FCC defended the exemption from access charges for the
fledgling data communications industry on the grounds that
assessing the same fees exacted from long-distance companies would
stifle the young industry's growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed in the case ruled on Wednesday, BellSouth Corp.
and Bell Atlantic argued that times and the data services industry
had changed. Describing the exemption as a ``new, implicit and
discriminatory subsidy'' for the Internet service providers, they
contended that the rise in Internet usage was overburdening their
systems and forcing the Bells to make huge investments in
additional capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Phone networks were originally designed to handle only 10
percent usage, meaning that no more than one in 10 phones would be
in use at one time. With the increasing growth of Internet users
who spend infinitely more time online than traditional telephone
callers, Bell companies maintain they are the ones shouldering the
burden.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel ruled that the FCC's exemption did not
discriminate in favor of Internet service providers because such
companies did not use the services and facilities of the local
phone companies ``in the same way or for the same purposes as other
customers who are assessed per-minute interstate access charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike long-distance companies, which charge users per minute,
most Internet service providers offer unlimited access for a flat
monthly fee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted that if the Bell companies won, online
services would have to raise their rates and might be forced to
abandon the flat-rate pricing that had helped propel the rapid
growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling maintains the status quo,'' said Scott Cleland, a
telecommunications analyst in Washington for Legg Mason Precursor
Group. Referring to Internet service providers, he added, ``This is
a win for ISPs.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the largest Internet provider in the country,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Local phone companies argued that the access fees subsidized
phone service for poor people or people living in rural areas or
other places where the cost of building and maintaining a telephone
infrastructure would otherwise be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance carriers maintained that the access charges were
still too high because they ``are set at billions of dollars more
than what it cost the Bells to provide the service,'' said Peter
Lucht, a spokesman for MCI. Still, he said, ``the FCC's decision
last May to reduce access charges was at least a step in the right
direction, and the court was right to uphold it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same decision, the court also upheld another FCC decision
to increase the federally mandated ``subscriber line charge'' for
businesses and residences that have multiple phone lines.

BRUINS OWNER MAKES CASE FOR CLEVELAND BROWNS OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs made his pitch to own the Cleveland
Browns Wednesday in front of National Football League owners, but
his bid may ultimately require him to choose between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs received strongly positive reviews from various sources
Wednesdayfor his presentation in Atlanta, which included a
statement from Bruins president-general manager Harry Sinden, who
traveled with him. Among those praising the effort was an important
member of the NFL's Expansion Committee, Patriots owner Robert
Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and the committee are now charged with whittling the
Jacobs proposal and six others presented Wednesday to a final group
of two or three before presenting them for a final vote by all 30
owners Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jeremy and his people did very, very well,'' Kraft
said. ``Indeed, the best thing that happened today is that after
the disaster that occurred in Cleveland three years ago, with the
team leaving a great football town, we now know that we really have
some good proposals to choose from. All of the groups did very
well, along with Jeremy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs may face a choice of his own: Does he want to own an
NFL franchise in Cleveland or a National Hockey League franchise in
Boston?
</P>
<P>
   A league rule prohibits anyone from owning an NFL team who
already owns a team in another sport in a market where there is an
NFL team. The so-called cross-ownership rule would, for example,
prohibit owners of the Red Sox, Celtics, and Bruins from owning an
NFL team because of the presence of the Patriots in their market.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is in place, and favored by many of the more veteran
NFL owners, because it discourages owners from competing with each
other for sponsorship money, for fan support, and potentially on
some provisions of television contracts. Other potential conflicts
the rule seeks to avoid are stadium financing and siting issues
within the same market.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Jacobs expressed confidence Wednesdaythat he
can manage to work around the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL will tell you for the record that the rule exists and
everyone must abide by it,'' he said. ``But we think there are ways
of dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the source added, ``if owning the Bruins prohibits
him from owning the Browns, he is going to keep the Bruins. The
Browns would definitely be out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was not available for comment. FleetCenter president
Richard Krezwick, who also traveled with Jacobs and participated in
the presentation, said Jacobs's sympathies are strongly with the
Bruins _ one of the ``Original Six'' NHL franchises, which he has
owned for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told everyone Wednesday that he loves the Bruins,''
Krezwick said.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the Bruins are considered by observers to be
among the most profitable of NHL teams, NFL franchises are almost
always more profitable. And the Browns franchise is a particularly
handsome opportunity, with a new stadium under construction and
paid for and a solid base of rabid football fans in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are considered so attractive, in fact, that some NFL
owners say they could ultimately attract a bid as high as $1
billion, and there is general agreement that they will eventually
be sold for at least $500 million and approach the record price tag
for a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who owns the Delaware North Companies, is said by
observers to be worth about $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   But others vying to own the Browns have similarly deep pockets,
and most have substantial contacts with Cleveland, including
enlisting former Browns players to be a part of their ownership
teams.
</P>
<P>
   While Delaware North's Sports Service concession company
provides concessions at Jacobs Field for the Cleveland Indians,
Jacobs's only other boast of roots in Cleveland appears to be that
his companies' headquarters is about 170 miles away, in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Others vying to own the Browns are: Bertram Wolstein, a suburban
Cleveland real estate developer who has been joined by former
Browns superstar running back Jim Brown as a consultant; Cleveland
lawyer Larry Dolan and his brother Charles, the chairman of
Cablevision Systems, one of the largest cable providers in the
country; businessman and banker Alfred Lerner; Richard Jacobs, who
owns the Indians and is no relation to Jeremy; Cleveland area toy
retailer Thomas Murdough; and New York real estaste developer
Howard Milstein.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said the next step in the process will be for owners on
the Expansion Committee to review the relative financial strengths
of the proposals, with strong guidance from Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me feel very good about this meeting today was that
we are left with very strong alternatives,'' Kraft said. ``When the
Browns left the league and the commissioner set out to form a very
strong private-public partnership between the civic leaders and the
business community, that has resulted in really putting the Browns
back into business.''

DELTA AIR'S PILOTS THREATEN ITS DEAL WITH UNITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The grand alliance between United Airlines and Delta Air Lines
may be threatened by a labor dispute at Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilots union, which has the power to veto the most
critical part of the link with United, said Wednesday that Delta's
decision not to give the union a voting seat on the board
effectively ended the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them that we are ceasing our consideration of the
alliance and that is what we have done,'' said Karen McGuffey, a
spokeswoman for the Air Line Pilots Association. ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delta apparently is not getting the message. ``We hope that
ALPA will go forward with its consideration of the alliance,'' said
Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictory statements go beyond the all-too-common
miscommunication between labor and management to disclose the weak
foundations of the three alliances that have swept up the six
largest domestic airlines this year. The announcement by Northwest
Airlines in January that it was buying a controlling stake in
Continental Airlines set off a mad scramble among the other major
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a Northwest-Continental combination would attract
their passengers, United and Delta formed an alliance, while
American Airlines joined with U S Airways Group.
</P>
<P>
   Each pair of airlines agreed to combine their frequent-flyer
programs, but Northwest and Continental and United and Delta also
said they would code share, or sell seats on each other's flights.
</P>
<P>
   United and Delta say that their alliance will bring them $600
million in additional revenue every year. But that assumes that the
other airlines do not go ahead with their alliances. If all three
deals are implemented, the competitive landscape remains unchanged.
``It's a zero-sum game,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest-Continental deal is now in limbo, awaiting
approval from the antitrust division of the Justice Department. A
decision is not expected until next month at the earliest, analysts
said. Until then, the pressure on United and Delta is off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Northwest and Continental begin code sharing, that will put
pressure on Delta to find a new avenue to approach the pilots,''
said Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York.
``Right now there is no urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Delta announced its decision Monday, seemingly
scuttling the alliance, shares of both Delta and United rose.
Murphy said that investors have not even factored the alliances
into their buying decisions. ``People know that the announcement by
Northwest and Continental is not a sure thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots at both Delta and United have clauses in their
contracts giving them the right to veto code-share agreements with
other airlines. But United's pilots also have a full seat on the
airline's board of directors, while Delta's pilots only have a
non-voting representative.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta pilots held up the announcement of the alliance in
April when they insisted on full board representation. The deal
only went ahead after the union agreed to give Delta management
until Sept. 30 to convince the company's board to give them a vote.
But Monday, Delta chief executive Leo Mullin said the board had
rejected the idea because ``an independent board best serves Delta
and its constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that it would go ahead with its plans to
combine its frequent-flyer program with United's beginning Sept. 1,
a move that does not require pilot approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that the pilots will have little choice
but to bend if the other alliances are poised to siphon off Delta
passengers, reducing their flying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   So is the alliance over? As Buttrick of Paine Webber, put it:
``It's over until it begins again.''

EX-HUSBAND FILES WRONGFUL PREGNANCY SUIT AGAINST CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a case that could set precedent in the burgeoning
world of reproductive science, an ex-husband is suing a Boston
clinic for wrongfully impregnating his former wife with frozen
embryos fertilized with his sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gladu has filed a lawsuit alleging breach of contract
and medical malpractice against Boston IVF and Dr. Selwyn P.
Oskowitz for implanting an embryo that resulted in the birth of a
baby girl without his permission. When his former wife filed for
child support for the couple's three children, Gladu objected to
being held financially responsible for a baby produced without his
consent.
</P>
<P>
   In what Gladu's lawyer, Ernest Murphy, is calling a ``wrongful
birth'' action, Gladu is asking for $3 million in damages from
Oskowitz and Boston IVF, the clinic that performed the procedure on
Meredith McLeod, Gladu's former wife, in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gladu, a Wayland firefighter who says he loves his
daughter, is charging that as patient of Boston IFV, he should have
been notified by the agency of the procedure, and was shocked to
learn his then-estranged wife had gone behind his back to have a
baby he did not want.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the birth, Gladu claims in his lawsuit filed at
Middlesex District Court, he has endured ``the infliction of severe
and continuing emotional distress'' which will require ``medical
and psychological treatment therefor (sic) indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels his embryo _ his property _ was stolen, and his right
to be a knowing parent was stolen,'' said Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   This case offers its own factual twist to a chain of actions
around the country concerning the unusual status of frozen embryos.
With steadily increasing numbers of couples using the procedure,
unimplanted embryos often end up in the freezers of fertility
clinics, where they can remain viable _ and sometimes fought over _
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, he volunteered to go under this program, and he
assumed some risk that everything was not going to work out,''
George Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston
University School of Public Health, said of Gladu. ``You can argue
contracts. But you can't treat those like a typical commercial
deal. Children aren't products. They dynamics of having a baby are
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Annas said that parents usually are reluctant to file suits over
in vitro procedures, because ``these are very personal family
matters, and they're mostly not winners unless there is something
wrong with the child,'' indicating possible malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Gladu and McLeod, who also have an older adopted daughter and a
four-year-old son conceived by consensual in vitro fertilization,
were separated but not divorced at the time of the second
pregnancy. They divorced in 1997, and McLeod received custody of
the three children.
</P>
<P>
   Gladu, who earns $40,000 per year, according to Murphy, was
ordered to pay McLeod $1,000 per month in child support _ a sum
that he found financially crippling. The portion of the amount to
cover the baby's upbringing, which his lawyer estimates to be $350
per month, was enough to drive him into financial ruin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really financially in dire straights right now and I don't
see any vast improvements for the foreseeable future,'' said Gladu,
who claims he has had to sell his Wayland home and move into an
unheated cottage in Dennis in order to make ends meet. ``I'm no
crusader, but I don't want this to happen to any loving father
again. I should have had a choice. This has turned my life upside
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladu claims his former wife, a nurse, went ahead with the
pregnancy on her own as a last-ditch effort to save their marriage.
McLeod, who has not been named in the lawsuit, could not be reached
for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Donnelly,, an attorney for Oskowitz, issued a statement
without making further comments: ``We have looked into the
circumstances of this matter and found that Dr. Oskowitz acted
appropriately and within the highest standards of care.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Murphy responding to the suit and filed in
court, Donnelly wrote that Gladu had signed a statement agreeing to
have remaining embryos ``returned to the body (womb) of the female
spouse so named on (the form) within three years from the date of
embryo freezing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implicit if not explicit in these options selected by Mr.
Gladu is the request that the embryos be maintained for transfer to
Ms. McLeod unless certain specified contingencies arise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``contingencies'' were not specified.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly's letter also said that Gladu and McLeod had
contracutally agreed to inform Boston IVF if their marriage were to
dissolve, but the couple had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, however, claims the contract said no such thing. He
claims that, according to a document Gladu and McLeod signed with
Boston IVF in April of 1993, when they were undergoing medical
procedures to have their 4-year-old son, all embryos not used in
that procedure would be discarded or donated to another couple.
</P>
<P>
   Five embroys were fertilized, two were used to conceive their
son, and the remaining three were frozen but, apparently, not
discarded or donated. McLeod announced her pregnancy to Gladu in
January, 1996, when the couple was separated, but still living
together and going through counseling.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, a stunned Gladu called Oskowitz to
inquire how this happened without his knowledge or permission, and
Oskowitz replied that a mistake had been made and he should get to
the clinic right away.
</P>
<P>
   Gladu maintains he was duped by his ex-wife and by Boston IVF,
who did not hold to their contract or inquire why he had not
participated in the second procedure at all, when he was completely
involved in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can imagine, in your wildest dreams, someone sticking a
baby in your hands and saying, `This is yours, it's your natural
child and you must support it for the next 18 years and put it
through college, how would you feel?'' said Murphy. ``Everytime he
(Gladu) holds that child he has feelings of ambivalance. He loves
the girl. He just hates the way she came to him and someone must
pay for that.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gladu admits that pursuing the lawsuit could have
a devastating affect on his daughter someday. He insists he has
loved her from the first time he held her when she was three days
old. Still, he knows his fight may ultimately cost him his
daughter's love in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I going to explain this to her?'' said Gladu. ``There's
no book on the subject. It's very gut wrenching for me. I know this
will be a story that people carry with them and she'll find out.
But I think, I hope, there is a way I can explain it to her so she
understands someday.''

APPEALS COURT CLOSES MICROSOFT INTERVIEWS TO PUBLIC, NEWS MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. won another victory in its antitrust battle
Wednesday when a federal appeals court ruled that chairman Bill
Gates and other executives may give pretrial depositions without
reporters or the public present.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said it will issue a final decision in the
matter sometime after Sept. 29, three weeks after the antitrust
trial is scheduled to begin, although that Sept. 8 date could also
be moved back.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company was ``gratified'' by the
ruling, and that it ``will allow depositions of its executives to
move forward without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for news organizations that sought to attend the
depositions expressed dissapointment, saying the judges gave too
little weight to the public's right of access to testimony as it is
given, without delay. They also warned that the question could be
moot if the judges don't settle it for six weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they hear it, much of this may already be under
the bridge,'' said Josh Koltun, one of the news organizations'
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to start Sept. 8, but that could change
at a conference this morning with U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson. Both Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice
have asked Jackson for a two-week delay, in part because of delays
in taking depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the judge reluctantly granted the news organizations'
motion to open the depositions, saying he had little choice given
the plain language of the 1913 statute on which they based their
request. He ordered the participants to work out the details of how
to conduct the sessions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft immediately appealed, saying it feared the disclosure
of sensitive business information if reporters and the public were
allowed to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued trial procedures have changed since the 1913
law requiring openness in depostions in antitrust cases. In 1937,
new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, governing such
proceedings as gathering testimony in depositions. Those rules
appear to conflict with the 1913 law.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel didn't rule Wednesday on the legal issues.
Instead it gave the participants until Sept. 29 to finish filing
the documents it will consider in its decision.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the case moving forward, it said the Microsoft
executives could be questioned under the normal procedures for
legal depositions. The two sides agreed earlier on rules for
restricting access to sensitive information gathered in closed
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to let the depositions proceed, the panel said the
``balance of harms'' favors Microsoft. If they were taken in public
and the company later wins its appeal, ``the disclosure could not
be undisclosed,'' they wrote. But if Microsoft loses, the text and
videotape of a private deposition can then be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves claims by federal and state antitrust
regulators that Microsoft has illegally forced computer makers to
accept its Internet browsing software if they also want its Windows
operating system for personal computers, for which they have no
real alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's actions have been harmful to competition, and
particularly to its main rival in the browser market, Netscape
Communications, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it has integrated the two software products _ the
browser and the operating system _ in ways that benefit consumers.
A June ruling by the appeals court in a related case supports that
view, Microsoft said recently when it asked Jackson to issue a
summary judgment to end the case _ a move not considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Microsoft was hit Wednesday with a new antitrust
lawsuit by a Connecticut company that accuses it of withholding
technical information vital to its business in order to impede
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Technology of Danbury, Conn., makes software that
converts Windows programs to run on other operating systems, such
as Unix. In 1994 it signed an agreement that it says entitles it to
detailed technical information known as ``source code'' from
Microsoft to make its own products work better, as well as advance
warning if Microsoft planned to change the source code.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after ``creating a dependency'' on that information for
Bristol and its customers, Microsoft is withholding it, the company
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol is very disappointed that it was necessary to sue to
obtain what Microsoft has said all along it would provide us,''
said Keith Blackwell, the company's chairman and president.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan dismissed Bristol's claim as
``wholly without merit,'' saying it was trying to elevate a
``routine business negotiation'' into a federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have been negotiating terms of a new license
agreement, Cullinan said, but Bristol broke off the talks ``without
any prior notice to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have accepted the same license terms that
Bristol rejected, he said.

EX-MIAMI COMMISSIONER GETS YEAR IN JAIL FOR VOTER FRAUD COVER-UP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A former Miami City commissioner was sentenced Wednesday
to a year in jail, the maximum penalty, for trying to cover up
voter fraud in last November's election. Humberto Hernandez, until
recently one of the city's most powerful politicians, had been
convicted last week on a misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
   The jury last Friday found Hernandez, 35, guilty of being an
accessory after the fact to a conspiracy to cover up the fraudulent
absentee votes cast by a former City Hall secretary and her
husband, a Miami police officer. The scheme was part of a pattern
that, prosecutors alleged, enabled Hernandez to clinch a
comfortable victory in his district in last November's citywide
elections.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquitted of more serious charges, including conspiracy
and fabricating evidence. On Monday, however, Gov. Lawton Chiles
removed Hernandez from his post as commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez appeared to choke back tears Wednesday, his head bent
forward, as Judge Roberto Pineiro meted out the sentence with a
stern lecture.
</P>
<P>
   `'I cannot envision a more felonious misdemeanor than the one
you were convicted of,'' Pineiro said. `'Our elections must be
fair, free and untainted by even the hint of fraud to insure the
continued existence of that democracy. You sought to destroy all
this simply for your political advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's legal troubles are not over, however. Since late
May, he has been in custody awaiting trial on federal charges of
mortgage fraud and money laundering. His father and his former
chief of staff, who are behind bars, face similar charges. That
trial is scheduled to begin late next month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that Hernandez would have to serve his misdemeanor
sentence separately, in a county jail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hernandez had close ties to Xavier Suarez, who won last
November's mayoral election. However, Suarez was removed from
office earlier this year after Joe Carollo filed a civil suit
alleging that the election was invalid because it was tainted by
widespread voter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, lawyers for Carollo, who narrowly lost the
election, charged that hundreds of absentee ballot votes cast in
favor of Suarez were either invalid, cast by people who gave false
addresses or, in one case, cast in the name of a person who was
dead. In early March, a judge voided the election and later ruled
that Carollo should assume office.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the son of Cuban immigrants, was known for his charm
and good political connections. He enjoyed a large following in the
Little Havana district.
</P>
<P>
   His tangles with the law have been regarded as the ultimate
symbol of justice officials' fight against wrongdoing by powerful
politicians in this scandal-ridden city of 360,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest piece of evidence against him was a series of tape
recordings in which he is heard discussing ways to tackle the fact
that a City Hall secretary, Evelyn Herbello, cast her ballot using
a false home address. Ms. Herbello became a witness for the
prosecution after her name appeared in a local newspaper in
connection with investigations of widespread voter fraud, and
agreed to wear a wire.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Hernandez's lawyers maintained that the former
City Commissioner was being penalized for the actions of aides and
friends who had committed fraud without his knowledge. Hernandez
even lashed out at his detractors on Spanish-language radio
stations here accusing them of targeting him because he is of
Hispanic descent.

CLINTON KEEPS LOW PROFILE, SPURNS CALLS FOR RESIGNATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton spent his 52nd birthday with
family and close friends in Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday as
details emerged from his grand jury testimony, including reports
that he admitted engaging in specific sexual acts with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, independent counsel Kenneth Starr reportedly has
secured an agreement from the president to provide a blood sample
that can be genetically compared to a stain found on a dress
Lewinsky told prosecutors she wore during a sexual encounter with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House intern, spent part
of the day with Starr's deputies preparing for her return visit
with the grand jury Thursday to respond to questions growing out of
Clinton's unprecedented testimony. Linda Tripp, whose secret tapes
of Lewinsky's telephone conversations with her triggered the
investigation, also was summoned to appear before the grand jury
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's appearance comes three days after Clinton answered
some questions from prosecutors, refused to answer others, then
went on national television to confess to an improper relationship
and to misleading the public about it for the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton remained out of the public eye Wednesday,
through a spokesman he dismissed calls for his resignation, a
chorus that included House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At Martha's Vineyard, an island off the Massachusetts coast,
presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton ``is confident he
enjoys the trust of the American people who elected him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry reported that the president, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, spent most of the day to
themselves. The president took birthday calls from his brother, his
brothers-in-law and his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the first family celebrated the
president's birthday at the vacation home of Vernon Jordan, a
Washington power broker who helped Lewinsky find a job as she was
being summoned to testify in a sexual harassment lawsuit against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was among 70 witnesses summoned before the federal grand
jury since January, when Starr expanded his investigation of
Clinton's Arkansas business dealings to include whether the
president or his associates obstructed justice by trying to cover
up his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first president to testify in a criminal
investigation of his actions, appeared by closed-circuit television
before the grand jury Monday afternoon and read a statement
admitting an 18-month relationship with Lewinsky, according to
sources knowledgeable about his testimony. Clinton's statement
included admissions that the relationship was inappropriate and
included intimate, physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors pressed for additional information, and Clinton
initially balked, then reportedly acknowledged specific sexual
encounters in which Lewinsky performed oral sex. When Starr and his
deputies pushed for a more detailed accounting of the trysts,
Clinton declined to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Clinton's refusal to answer all their questions,
Starr and his deputies reserved the right to again issue a subpoena
for the president's testimony, a summons they earlier served, then
withdrew after he agreed to testify voluntarily. If the subpoena is
reissued, it could lead to a lengthy court fight that would further
delay Starr's plan to issue a report to Congress early this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall,
acknowledged the impasse saying the questions were ``highly
intrusive'' and ``to preserve personal privacy and institutional
dignity (the president) gave candid, but not detailed, answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with Clinton's testimony said that before the 5
1/2-hour session ended he denied trying to hide his relationship
with Lewinsky. Clinton told the grand jury he did not ask Lewinsky
to lie under oath in Paula Jones' sex harassment lawsuit against
him. He also did not ask Jordan to find Lewinsky a job to buy her
silence and did not ask her to hide gifts from him, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours after his testimony, the president went on national
television and acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with
Lewinsky. He also assured the nation that his denial of engaging in
sex with Lewinsky when questioned in the Jones lawsuit was
``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the definition approved by a federal judge overseeing the
Jones case, sexual relations occur when a person ``knowingly
engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned Jan. 17 by Jones' lawyers about whether he
engaged in sexual relations with Lewinsky, Clinton was shown the
definition, then responded: ``I have never had sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who issued a similar denial in an affidavit submitted
to Jones' legal team in January, changed her story early this month
after Starr agreed not to prosecute her in return for her
cooperation in the investigation of a possible cover-up. On Aug. 6,
Lewinsky met with the grand jury and reportedly testified that she
performed oral sex on the president and that they engaged in
telephone sex and manual stimulation.

 &HT;    Wohlers' return brings with it another decision
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Wohlers is expected to rejoin the Braves Friday,
which begs the question: Then what?
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, it means the demotion of a bullpen member,
which will probably be rookie Adam Butler, heading back to Class
AAA Richmond. Though right-hander Russ Springer is also eligible to
come off the 15-day disabled list Friday, the club is still
undecided on sending down another pitcher to open a second roster
spot, particularly if the Braves want to give veteran left-hander
Norm Charlton a fair chance to show he can still pitch. And with a
run and three hits allowed in 2 1/3 innings, Charlton has yet to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   But those decisions only foreshadow the bigger ones the Braves
must make by Aug. 31, when postseason rosters must be established
come midnight. Every year, the Braves drop a pitcher from their
11-man staff for October and add a 15th position player. Manager
Bobby Cox drops to a three-man rotation for the five-game Division
Series and then a four-man rotation for the seven-game LCS, meaning
fifth starter Kevin Millwood moves to relief duty.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers returns to Atlanta as he left last week _ as the staff's
11th man _ and barring a miraculous turnaround, he will not be
included on the postseason roster (though he and anyone in the
system as of Aug. 31 would remain eligible for the October roster
in case of injury to one of the first 25).
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz, who spoke with Wohlers
Wednesday, maintains the club has not yet determined how it will
proceed, but it is clear it will need Wohlers' roster spot on the
31st (though he can immediately rejoin the club as a September
call-up). Wohlers will again have to accept an optional minor
league assignment, since the Braves cannot force a player with his
service time off the 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the issue that he's a five-year man and in order for
him not to be on our (25-man) team, he has to be in the minor
leagues,'' Schuerholz said. ``And in order for him to be in the
minor leagues, he as to give his permission to go, which he has
done twice. I can't imagine he'd not do it a third time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he declines?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask him. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffy to Richmond
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 19 weeks after tearing his left quadriceps, shortstop
Rafael Belliard accepted a rehab assignment to Richmond, where he
has roughly 10 days to show the club he can still help. Since going
on the 60-day injured list, Belliard's spot as reserve shortstop
has been taken by Ozzie Guillen but because Belliard can also play
second base, he does provide a defensive option, should the team
wish to go that way with a postseason roster. He will be in uniform
today against Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' said Cox, ``we have to see if he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 200 Club
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a player reflects the day after he reaches a
milestone, when he has had the chance to put the last game behind
him. The day after his career 200th victory, Greg Maddux could not
do that, simply because Maddux refuses to reflect on anything,
which may help explain some of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual stuff is nice,'' he said, ``and I'm real proud
of it. But it's important not to lose sight of what it's all about,
and right now, that's trying to finish up our division and get
ready for the postseason and get ready to make a good run through
the playoffs. What I really want is the ring. I'm glad to get to
200, but I really want a ring.''

Stubblefield, Wilkinson give Redskins' run defense a big-time boost
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Free agency in the NFL is a crap shoot, but the Washington Redskins
believe they hit the jackpot when they stole defensive tackle Dana
Stubblefield from San Francisco to improve a run defense that
ranked 28th in the NFL last year. In his final season with the
49ers, Stubblefield registered 15 sacks and was named the league's
Defensive Player of the Year.

   Just to make sure they solidified the weakest area on the team,
the Redskins traded for Cincinnati defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson,
who signed a new multimillion-dollar contract. Now, Stubblefield
and Wilkinson take up more room in the middle than a duplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard we got both of them, I was in shock,'' cornerback
Darrell Green said. ``Any time you bring in two guys like them,
you've really upgraded your team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins hope Stubblefield and Wilkinson have upgraded the
team so much that they win the NFC East for the first time since
1991, when they won their last Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants are the defending champion, but Washington
plans to dethrone them in coach Norv Turner's fifth season. If they
do not at least make the playoffs, Turner's job could be in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the division's wide-open until someone knocks
off the Giants,'' Stubblefield says. ``They're the division champs,
and everyone wants to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this: There's no limit to how good we can be.
We've got so many good defensive players. There's no limit to what
this defense can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have compiled winning records the last two years,
the Redskins haven't reached the playoffs since 1992, Joe Gibbs'
last season as coach. After the Redskins finished 8-7-1 last year,
Turner and general manager Charley Casserly identified the areas
that needed to be improved in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Turner had hired Mike Nolan as his defensive
coordinator, and the defense improved from 28th to 16th. The
Redskins were third in pass defense without much of a rush from the
defensive linemen. What hadn't improved significantly was the run
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that could be traced to the season-long holdout of
defensive tackle Sean Gilbert. The Redskins refused to give in to
what they thought were preposterous demands, and he sat out the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 30th and 28th in run defense the last two years, and
we knew we had to get better,'' Casserly says. ``A lot of defensive
tackles were available in free agency, so this was the time to make
the move. Our division's going to be a dogfight again, and we think
we've improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we were only going to get one, but the more
we thought about it, the more we thought we could get two to do
this right. The owner made the (financial) commitment to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner John Kent Cooke gave his braintrust the millions it took
to sign Stubblefield. When Gilbert, the franchise player, signed
with Carolina, the Redskins received two No. 1 picks in return.
Knowing they would have the Panthers' draft choices, Casserly dealt
picks, including this year's No. 1, to the Bengals for Wilkinson,
who was the first player selected in the 1994 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was a young guy (underclassman) coming out of college, and
we thought he played better with the Bengals than people gave him
credit for,'' Casserly says. ``Bringing him here and surrounding
him with good players, especially good veteran players, should help
him improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking Dan to be the guy. We just want him to be
part of this defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, who grew up in Ohio and played at Ohio State, never
lived up to the high expectations the Bengals had for him. The
Redskins are hoping the change of scenery will be ideal for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fired up from the first day they traded for me,''
Wilkinson says. ``When I first visited with the Redskins, they told
me they were going to try to sign Dana, and they did a couple of
weeks later. I was fortunate they were able to trade for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization's ready to win right now. Not many teams
would have put up that kind of money for two tackles. That reflects
on the organization and their commitment to getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson had only five sacks last season when he was forced to
move outside in a three-man front and back inside in a four-man
front. But there is far less pressure on him in Washington compared
to Cincinnati. He is expected to share the load, not carry it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for me to play next to an All-Pro
like Dana,'' Wilkinson says. ``He makes a lot of plays. I'm
learning a lot from him. The communication and awareness are
getting better as time goes on. We'll have everything ironed out
and be on the same page by the first regular-season game.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, in his 16th season, is the senior member of the team. He
also is Washington's best recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dana at the Pro Bowl about coming to Washington,''
Green says. ``My wife hosted his wife when they visited. When he
signed, we were real excited because we felt part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I really like about Dana is the leadership he's
showing the young defensive linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins aren't quite sure what to expect from offenses now
that they have Stubblefield and Wilkinson in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role can vary depending on how offenses play me and Dan,''
Stubblefield says. ``Are they going to double-team me or
double-team him? Are they going after the linebackers right away
and let us through? It just depends on how offensive coordinators
scout us and play us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Redskins wanted to improve the pass defense, so
they signed cornerback Cris Dishman to pair with Green. The pass
defense improved from 20th to third, and Green and Dishman were
considered the best pair of corners in the league.
</P>
<P>
   All the defensive backs should be able to breathe a little
easier if Stubblefield and Wilkinson stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference to have them, let me tell you,''
Dishman says. ``When the quarterback walks up to the line of
scrimmage and sees Dana and Dan, there's got to be a fear factor.
Both of them can rush the passer, and they're good run stoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is 38 and Dishman 33, so they know they better take
advantage of every opportunity. They don't want to waste the
decision to sign Stubblefield and trade for Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hell of a lot of potential on this team,'' Dishman
says. ``This is probably the best defense in the league on paper,
but if we don't perform on Sunday, it won't mean anything.''

IN ITS SECOND SEASON, WNBA TAKING HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jody Conradt probably knows a little bit about the appeal of
women's basketball, having coached her Texas Lady Longhorns playing
before more than a few raucous crowds.
</P>
<P>
   And being a face in the crowd during her numerous visits to
Houston Comets games this season has enabled Conradt to witness how
this summer league known as the Women's NBA is catching on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been really impressed with how involved the crowds are,''
Conradt said. ``They're really participating in the event, and that
gives it even greater hope for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The future seems bright for the WNBA, which concluded its second
regular season last night. The league generated a reported average
attendance of more than 10,000 fans per game this season, something
the NBA needed 29 years to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings have dropped from 1.9 to 1.6 per game on NBC
and less on the other two networks that televise games. ESPN is at
.65 after a .84 last season; Lifetime is at .49 after a .56 last
season. The rating is the percentage of television households in
the nation tuned to a program, and each point for a broadcast
network represents 980,000 homes. Each point for a cable network
represents fewer homes since not all home with televisions have
cable. But scoring in the league is up, turnovers are down and the
game is popular enough that the team with the worst record, the
Washington Mystics, has the league's best attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fan response has been terrific to our game, and I'm very
excited,'' WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman said. ``But I still
believe we have a long ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that this is going to be a long process.
But it's hard not to be encouraged when we've made that much
progress in just two seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into last night's regular-season finales, 69 of this
season's 146 WNBA games drew crowds of at least 10,000 fans.
Attendance at WNBA games this season was up more than 11 percent
from last season. The league was averaging 10,729 fans this season
after pulling in 9,669 last season.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Los Angeles and Sacramento are the only members of
the WNBA's eight charter franchises that failed to increase
attendance this season. But two first-year franchises _ Washington
and Detroit _ acquitted themselves well.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last night's game against the Charlotte Sting,
Washington led the league in attendance with 15,721 per game.
Detroit, which closed the season at home against the New York
Liberty, was averaging 9,799 fans per outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people said this wouldn't work,'' Conradt said. ``But
I think, logically, it had every chance to work, because there is
not anything to really be passionate about in the summer months
except baseball. And that doesn't appeal to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's second season seems to have generated some passion,
or at least drama. Going into the final night of the season,
Charlotte, New York and Phoenix were battling for the final two
playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   And the league does have a budding marquee attraction in the
defending champion Comets, who ran off a 26-3 season, and their
star triumvirate of Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a Chicago Bulls in the WNBA right now, it's
certainly Houston,'' Ackerman said. ``They've got a great core, and
in every respect it's become our glamour team. They've been fun to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have they had a great impact in Houston with
attendance up this year in Houston in large part because of the
great success they've had on the court. But I think it's clearly
helped create additional recognition for the league to have a team
with such star power.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston has increased its scoring from 71.1 points per game to
78.9 and cut its turnovers from 19.6 to 14.9 per game. Eastern
Conference champion Cleveland, the only WNBA team to win a game in
Houston this season, has also increased its scoring, as have
Phoenix and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman's long-range goal is to have a WNBA team in each of the
29 NBA cities. Also, next season the league will play its first
all-star game, and increase the regular-season schedule from 30 to
32 games.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ackerman will like to move to a 40-game schedule.
For that to happen, she said the season would have to start
earlier, because she doesn't want the WNBA to compete against the
NFL or college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the summer months they can attract families that are
vacationing, and they can attract kids who don't have to worry
about it being on a school night,'' Conradt said. ``I think all of
us believe that the WNBA _ with the support it has from the NBA and
the kind of marketing effort that they've made _ is going to be
something that's going to be long-term.''

<P>
   A crucial part of the U.S. innovation system is the ready
availability of venture capital to back startup companies in
high-tech fields. The venture markets have been roaring in recent
years _ pouring private money into fledging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data from a variety of sources show that 1997 was a
banner year for new private investment, particularly in information
technology companies _ and that 1998 looks like another winner.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, says Pat Gray, a managing partner at Price
Waterhouse, are particularly ``heartening'' because they point to
investments in a diverse mix of businesses and for companies at
different stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   Investment growth, he says, ``was pretty broad-based, except in
biotech. Software and communications hit the cover off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   These optimistic sentiments are based on numbers from several
sources. Price Waterhouse, the New York-based consulting firm, says
venture capital investments climbed to $12.8 billion in 1997, up 34
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company's numbers show that most of the money _ about $8.5
billion _ went to high-tech businesses, such as Internet services,
software companies, and computer firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that track venture investments paint a similar
picture. Private investments have nearly doubled during the past
three years, says Rolf Selvig, director of business development at
San Francisco-based VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   If private investment is a crucial part of the innovation
system, so is the next step in the process: the initial public
offerings (IPOs) that bring public money into the startups. And
there the picture isn't quite so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs for venture-backed companies slowed dramatically in 1997.
After a record year in 1996, the number of IPOs for startups
dropped 41 percent in 1997 and the amount of money raised plummeted
by 43 percent to $5.4 billion, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the slowdown in IPO markets, there's lots of
venture money available.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says, Clinton Harris, an investment advisor at Grove
Street Advisors in Lexington, Mass., for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists, ``it's a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harris raises a cautionary note. ``If you're an
investor it may be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes the danger is that the success rate of
venture-backed companies will drop. While the supply of money is
growing, he says, ``the availability of high-quality investments is
not changing as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the natural lag time in venture markets, says
Harris, ``if there is too much money now, it will still be two to
three years before the returns drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it looks as though the venture capital cog in
the innovation system is turning at a high rate. &QL;

<P>
   Sometimes it seems as though the Internet had been invented to
foster manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   There's the glee of finding information in a few seconds. Then
the head-banging frustration of waiting as an image fills the
screen pixel by excruciating pixel.
</P>
<P>
   Most home Net users, in particular, sip data through modems
operating at 28.8 kilobits per second. The newest modems offer 56
kilobits per second _ not an overwhelming boost.
</P>
<P>
   But home Internet users may soon have available to them the Net
equivalent of lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this year, phone companies will begin to offer a
technology called ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) that
will bring fast network access through the copper wires that still
connect virtually every home to the phone network.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone within a few miles of a phone switching center can get
the benefits of ADSL _ connection rates exceeding today's fastest
modems by some 20-fold. And an ADSL connection is like an
electrical socket: It's always on.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL works because most households need high-speed connection in
only one direction. ADSL grants the high downloading speed by
splitting the information stream in two _ a low-frequency channel
for voice and a high-frequency one for data.
</P>
<P>
   This separation allows the copper to carry data at speeds of up
to 7 megabits per second in one direction without interfering with
the voice conversations that occupy the same wires.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ADSL is not new. But phone companies have until now
treated it as an exotic service, and it has required installing an
electronic filtering device, or ``splitter,'' at each home.
</P>
<P>
   To accelerate ADSL's penetration into the consumer market, a
host of computer and telecommunications companies have joined
forces to push for a new standard that would eliminate the need for
the splitter _ although by limiting data rates to less spectacular
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``universal ADSL'' would permit downloads at 1.5
megabits per second and upstream transmission at 500 kilobits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the drive for universal ADSL is a coalition of three

KOHLBERG KRAVIS TO ACQUIRE PAINT COMPANY IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. said Wednesday that it
would buy Herberts, a German paint company, for $1.7 billion in a
deal that represents the American buyout firm's growing ardor for
buying, revamping and selling companies in Europe the way it has at
home since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis will join with Herberts managers to acquire all
of the company from Hoechst AG, the German conglomerate, which is
seeking to shed some holdings that do not complement its core drug
operations. Herberts ranks as Europe's largest supplier of paints,
with annual sales of $1.5 billion and 7,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   European investors, especially in Britain, have long used
private capital to buy companies. But the large-scale leveraged
buyout is much rarer there than in the United States. In such
transactions, private financiers use borrowed funds to take control
of a company, including some that are publicly traded, with the
idea of remaking its operations and selling it off again.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis and other leading United States buyout firms,
including Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst and Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice,
have all recently stepped up their presence in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Industry specialists say they hope that Europe will prove to be
fertile ground for American-style, finance-driven reorganizations.
Such opportunities in theory will arise more as companies there go
through the painful adjustment to global competition that United
States companies went through in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have invested a lot of time and know-how in Europe,'' said
Scott Stuart, a Kohlberg Kravis general partner. ``We feel that the
market is finally breaking the way we wish it had a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after more than a decade of sniffing around for deals in
Europe, Kohlberg Kravis has announced several successful buyouts
recently. Last month the New York-based firm announced that it
would buy the British-based insurance broker Willis Corroon Group,
a deal valued at $1.5 billion. Kohlberg Kravis officials said the
Willis purchase is the first leveraged buyout of a publicly owned
European company.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis previously bought Newsquest, a British regional
newspaper publisher, and Rhine Re, a Swiss reinsurance company. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   European conglomerates that once branched out into many
different areas are increasingly streamlining operations and
selling parts that do not make strategic sense. That pries open the
once-cloistered market, buyout specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``European economies are about where the U.S. was in the
mid-70s,'' said Jack D. Furst, a partner in Dallas-based Hicks,
Muse. ``Conglomerates need to focus on core niches. That creates
wonderful opportunities for new capital to enter the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse made its first stand-alone acquisition in Europe
just last week, agreeing to buy Glass' Group, a closely held
British automobile information company, for $205 million.
</P>
<P>
   The European deals come at a time when the United States market
has become less friendly to buyout firms. Company stock market
valuations are near all-time highs and easy revampings are past
news.
</P>
<P>
   Some buyout firms have become accustomed to earning returns of
30 percent for their investors annually, attracting record sums of
investment capital. But now, more funds are chasing fewer deals.
</P>
<P>
   For big buyout deals _ those valued at $500 million or more _
firms on average paid 7 times earnings in 1994. So far this year
they are paying closer to 8.5 times earnings, according to
Portfolio Management Data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make straight buyout deals in the U.S. these
days,'' said Josh Kosman, associate editor of Buyout Newsletter, an
industry journal. ``You pay too much for the company to make it
work.'' He added that the average European buyout is done for a
much lower price, relative to earnings, though figures for
transactions there were not available.

CHARGERS OVERHAUL OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In the heyday of Air Coryell, when the San Diego
Chargers delighted their fans with a point-a-minute offense _ and
dismayed purists with a defense that nearly matched that pace _ a
joke used to run through the organization as the annual NFL draft
neared:
</P>
<P>
   The only way to keep coach Don Coryell from using up all the
high picks on flashy pass-catchers was to prepare for the draft's 8
a.m. start _ and tell Coryell it was getting under way at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly two decades later, the Chargers seem to have
revived their fascination for stockpiling offensive players _ but
with a notable exception. This time, as the team attempts to climb
out of the dregs of a 4-12 finish in 1997, some of the prominent
newcomers weigh in at 305, 297, 297, 248 and 245 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty much our plan,'' said Bobby Beathard, who
gained fame as a general manager for constructing a system at
Washington in which a jumbo running back battered opponents behind
a line that came to be called the Hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as if we didn't need anything defensively, but we
felt our shortcomings were more on the other side of the ball _
quarterback being the main thing, then the offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, let's not forget that quarterback, another critical
acquisition. San Diego this year was forced to replace an
established quarterback, as Stan Humphries, at age 32, heeded
doctors' advice and retired after suffering two major concussions
in an 18-day span last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers maneuvered into position to select towering,
strong-armed Ryan Leaf of Washington State second overall. They
named him the starter before they even played an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the support staff was already firmly in place.
Today, while standing along the sideline at UC San Diego watching
training-camp workouts, you need a program only for the guys in
white jerseys, the offense. That's where the new faces are
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 4-12, obviously you have to win with players,'' said
linebacker Junior Seau, the senior member of this team. ``Dean
(Spanos, the club president) and Bobby did a great job of stealing
players from other teams via free agency, and Dean opened the
wallet. And you can see that.''
</P>
<P>
   But only on one side of the ball?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best defense is a defense that is on the bench,'' Seau
continued. ``If we can get some rest and keep our players healthy
on the defensive side, we're going to have a solid defense. As for
us being jealous (about the offensive emphasis in the offseason),
no, we're not. The more points we get, the more times we can get
into a nickel situation and let loose.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be getting ahead of things a little bit. By all
indications, the Chargers will see more rough times before they
experience prosperity. It probably doesn't help that they reside in
one of the more rigorous divisions in the NFL _ where, in '97,
Kansas City and Super Bowl champ Denver combined to go 25-7.
</P>
<P>
   But at least San Diego seems to be going about the
reconstruction in the proper way.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the most important newcomers are John Jackson, Aaron
Taylor and Roman Fortin, free agents signed away from Pittsburgh,
Green Bay and Atlanta, respectively. They now comprise an entire
flank _ in order, left tackle, left guard and center _ and bring
experience and nearly a half-ton of heft to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Another important figure is a reacquisition, 245-pound running
back Natrone Means, who returned to the Chargers as a free agent
after two seasons with Jacksonville. Still another addition is
248-pound H-back John Burke, whose blocking ability is probably
evidenced by the fact he had no pass receptions last year with the
New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers also used a high draft pick, a second-rounder, on
wide receiver Mikhael Ricks of Stephen F. Austin. They have already
written him into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And then they hired some people to coach these folk. The San
Diego offense was in chaos last year, as new coach Kevin Gillbride
often operated at cross purposes with assistants Mike Sheppard,
George DeLeone and Tyrone Dixon. The latter two are gone now, and
Sheppard, who was out of position last year, has moved from
quarterbacks to wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Brought in are two former NFL head coaches who have solid
reputations as position coaches: June Jones, the former Atlanta
coach, who will tutor Leaf, and Joe Bugel, who escaped Oakland and
will attempt to make this offensive line in the image of the one he
once had in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger man for all of this was 2 years old when Dan Fouts
unleashed his first pass for Coryell. NFL convention holds that it
is folly to throw a rookie quarterback into the fray so quickly,
but the Chargers insist they're impressed with what Leaf has shown
so far. And, besides, they don't have much else.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified rookie? ``Oh, no, not at all,'' said right tackle
Vaughn Parker, the UCLA alumnus who is only one of two holdovers
from last year's line. ``He's very confident in his abilities. He's
good in the huddle. He's got a good command of the field when he's
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the learning curve for a quarterback is huge. It's
going to take some time before he's totally comfortable. But you
don't see him holding back out there. He's not tentative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid,'' adds Beathard, ``has been maybe even better than
we expected. He's tremendously talented. Being around him _ his
attitude and the way he acts _ his leadership really comes out.
He's a very emotional player. You can sense that burning desire to
be great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard some off-the-field things about him, where he's
immature and does foolish things, but we haven't seen it here. It's
been all football here.''
</P>
<P>
   With a deep breath, the Chargers will put all of this into play
when they open at home against Buffalo on Sept. 6. They're staking
their resurgence to the new look. Even if the method has a faintly
nostalgic feel to it.

<P>
   Sometimes it seems as though the Internet had been invented to
foster manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   There's the glee of finding information in a few seconds. Then
the head-banging frustration of waiting as an image fills the
screen pixel by excruciating pixel.
</P>
<P>
   Most home Net users, in particular, sip data through modems
operating at 28.8 kilobits per second. The newest modems offer 56
kilobits per second _ not an overwhelming boost.
</P>
<P>
   But home Internet users may soon have available to them the Net
equivalent of lithium.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this year, phone companies will begin to offer a
technology called ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) that
will bring fast network access through the copper wires that still
connect virtually every home to the phone network.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone within a few miles of a phone switching center can get
the benefits of ADSL _ connection rates exceeding today's fastest
modems by some 20-fold. And an ADSL connection is like an
electrical socket: It's always on.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL works because most households need high-speed connection in
only one direction. ADSL grants the high downloading speed by
splitting the information stream in two _ a low-frequency channel
for voice and a high-frequency one for data.
</P>
<P>
   This separation allows the copper to carry data at speeds of up
to 7 megabits per second in one direction without interfering with
the voice conversations that occupy the same wires.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ADSL is not new. But phone companies have until now
treated it as an exotic service, and it has required installing an
electronic filtering device, or ``splitter,'' at each home.
</P>
<P>
   To accelerate ADSL's penetration into the consumer market, a
host of computer and telecommunications companies have joined
forces to push for a new standard that would eliminate the need for
the splitter _ although by limiting data rates to less spectacular
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``universal ADSL'' would permit downloads at 1.5
megabits per second and upstream transmission at 500 kilobits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the drive for universal ADSL is a coalition of three
dominant players in the personal computer industry _ Compaq, Intel,
and Microsoft _ and several regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies will probably be conducting trials of the
service by year's end, and widespread availability should begin

<P>

   Remember monorail? That Jetson-era relic, one step above an
amusement park ride, zipping around airports, hotels, and yes,
amusement parks?
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment in the 1960s, monorail _ cars or trains
running on or under a single, elevated guide rail _ looked like the
future of mass transit. But that bright vision was eclipsed by a
surge of highway building and, more recently, the rush to build
urban light-rail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail was written off as a novelty, fine for Disneyland but
hardly a serious option.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday's dreams are today's leaps forward. Thanks partly
to technological improvements, partly to new recognition of the
limitations of conventional rail, and especially to the grass-roots
activism of impatient citizens, monorail is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Today, space-short Japan leads the world in elevated transit,
with eight urban monorails. Sydney, Vancouver, and Singapore all
use monorails, as do planned communities in Brazil and parks in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now monorail boosters in several U.S. cities are vying to make
their towns next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, those boosters recently attempted to persuade
transit officials to build a monorail in place of a controversial
planned light-rail system, on the ground that light rail would eat
too many precious street lanes.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed, but monorail boosters have made more headway
with the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council, which has proposed
a new light-rail system for the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Vexed because light-rail vehicles can't handle the grade to the
regional airport on their side of the Ohio River, residents of
Covington, Ky., are pressing for a switch to monorail, whose rubber
tires and enclosed guideways provide better traction than
steel-wheeled light-rail vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They've persuaded their congressman, Jim Bunning, to arrange
federal funding to study the monorail option.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Seattle, home of the mile-long monorail left from the
1962 World's Fair, that has given the technology its broadest
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Seattle voters approved a 42-mile monorail system
running to all four corners of the city, over the opposition of
city officials and the business establishment, who favored light
rail and buses.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure was an unusual exercise in do-it-yourself
transit planning, drafted and promoted by an activist/cab driver,
Dick Falkenbury, who says he got the idea while ``stuck in traffic,
watching the monorail zip by overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you get out of traffic, you're still stuck in traffic,''
Falkenbury explains. ``Once you realize that, only monorail makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most U.S. monorails are at theme parks and other
private venues only proves the technology's efficiency, he insist:
``When you build with other people's (i.e., public) money, you
build light rail. When you build with your own money, you build a
monorail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even monorail's critics concede that, because it weighs less, it
can be elevated less expensively than rail. Elevated systems can be
built quickly; because they needn't tango with traffic and
pedestrians, they can be automated, eliminating the driver salaries
that are conventional transit's biggest operating expense. (The
other way to get trains out of traffic's way, digging tunnels, is
prohibitively expensive _ as Los Angeles is discovering.)
</P>
<P>
   Though view-sensitive residents squirm at the thought of a
monorail's elevated guideways blocking their light, today's
guideways are much thinner than 1962's concrete behemoths. And
their pillars are spaced more widely _ 100-plus feet apart in a
leading model from Montreal-based monorail maker Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Technical improvements have also obviated another longtime
monorail shortcoming: awkward switching from one track to another.
Bombardier can now switch tracks in 8 to 12 seconds, making
multi-track systems feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop with a conventional, mass-transit monorail?
University of Washington engineering professor emeritus Jerry
Schneider notes that Seattle's Monorail Initiative would allow the
city to implement a truly revolutionary solution: personal rapid
transit (PRT).
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the 1970s and now being revived on three
continents, PRT offers individualized, point-to-point service in
private (say, four-seater) cars running on lightweight,
computer-controlled, elevated guideways _ usually monorails but
sometimes dual rails.
</P>
<P>
   Variously dubbed ``automated taxis,'' ``horizontal elevator,''
or ``personal monorail,'' it's the only transit form that just
might match the automobile's convenience, without its environmental
downside.
</P>
<P>
   The monorail of the future may surprise even its present-day
proponents. &QL;

LOBBYISTS GET GOP `MARCHING ORDERS' ON CANDIDATE FUND-RAISING

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Senate President Brenda Burns has assigned the state's
most powerful lobbyists to raise money for specific candidates in
races Republicans must win this fall to retain control of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Burns also warned the lobbyists that they will suffer political
retribution in the next session of the Legislature if they raise
money for Democrats, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' obtained a memo that shows lobbyists
were assigned to help raise money for GOP candidates Larry Nelson
in Yuma, Darden Hamilton in Glendale, and Senate Majority Whip Gary
Richardson in Tempe. All are considered vulnerable in this
election.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said coordinating lobbyists' fund-raising efforts was
``absolutely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the memo confirms what many voters suspected:
That special interests have a stranglehold on the legislative
process in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the smoking gun that reveals the quid pro quo of the
current system,'' said Kaia Lenhart, political director of
Arizonans for Clean Elections. The group is supporting a ballot
measure that would provide public funding for state elections in
exchange for strict limits on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public officials should not be bought by the highest bidder.
Arizonans want and deserve elections, not auctions,'' Lenhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of lobbyists on the Arizona Legislature has been
controversial since a law-enforcement probe in 1991, nicknamed
``AzScam,'' revealed that lawmakers had taken bribes from a
lobbyist, actually a police agent, who wanted them to legalize
gambling. Since then, citizen-inspired initiatives have attempted
to curb the influence of lobbyists, with limited success, and bills
to impose new limits on lobbyists' gifts and entertainment have
been repeatedly turned down by lawmakers. The influence of
lobbyists has been the subject of an occasional ``Republic''
series, ``The Invisible Legislature,`` since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Burns strategy, according to the memo and
sources familiar with the discussions, was to name ``champions'' in
the corps of corporate lobbyists who could direct campaign
donations from both lobbyists and political action committees from
the industries they represent.
</P>
<P>
   In notes in the margin of the memo, someone wrote, ``Need
champion for each campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are making a strong bid to pick up three seats in the
state Senate, which would deadlock the chamber at 15-15. That would
make it difficult for Burns to hang on to her power and could
severely hamper the conservative agenda at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The three-page memo came from a meeting held July 15 at
Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix. It includes four columns
of information: The first is titled ``Industry'' and contains a
list of 13 major Arizona industries, such as agriculture, mining,
and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Under each entry is a handwritten list of lobbyists who
represent those industries in contacting state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The next three columns are headed by the candidates' names. Two
lobbyists' names were written in the corresponding boxes in the
form, which was not completed in the version obtained by ``The
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was attended by a number of high-profile lobbyists,
including John Mangum, Wendy Briggs, Jim Klinker, Connie
Wilhelm-Garcia, Chuck Coughlin, Sidney Hoff Hay and Mike Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who made the pitch to lobbyists for their support at the
meeting, said nothing out of the ordinary occurred. The point was
not to get lobbyists involved in campaigns, but to reach the groups
they represent.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was an opportunity to get the word out about the GOP
candidates in those races, to let people know about their
philosophies and ideals, and find people willing to help with the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The idea was to provide industry officials with the information
so they can match their own beliefs with candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``absolutely appropriate,'' Burns said, to ``suggest to a
lobbyist that they inform the people they represent who the
candidates are.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the purpose of the memo was to provide candidates a
``funnel,'' that is, a way to tap information and resources at the
beginning of a campaign without making ``thousands of calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyist-coordinators named for each campaign, as suggested
by the memo, would be a starting point for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And she added that the list is so encompassing _ including
everything from firefighters to farmers _ that virtually all public
interests were represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would actually be extremely difficult to find groups who
were left out,'' Burns said. ``Those groups represent the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you campaign, people choose who they're going to give
their funding for the campaign that is closest to their
philosophies. I make no apologies. There's absolutely nothing wrong
with that. That's exactly what people should be doing. They need to
be as informed as they can about the candidates, and the only way a
candidate can get their message out is typically by things that
cost money.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to several people familiar with the discussions,
Burns' sales job included discouraging lobbyists from ``hedging
their bets'' in the three races by giving money to other parties
than the GOP, a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   The message to lobbyists was that donations to Democrats would
be remembered in next year's legislative session, according to one
lobbyist, who characterized the meeting as receiving ``marching
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a subtle message, but it wasn't so subtle,'' said
another source, who attended one of the discussions. ``It was along
the lines of, `We need you guys to stand up for Republican
candidates.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Furman, Darden Hamilton's Democratic opponent in District
16, said several lobbyists have told him that prominent Republicans
have warned them that if they support Furman, ``They can forget
about their bills being heard next year.''
</P>
<P>
   According to another source familiar with the discussions, Burns
was paraphrased as saying, ``We've been very pro-business,'' and to
keep it that way, ``we need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   The source added, ``What she's doing is exactly what a
Democratic or Republican leader should be doing. . . . She's
putting together an effort to helping candidates out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Burke, executive director of Arizona Common Cause, said
he doubted the veracity of the claim that lobbyists were warned
against giving to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like Brenda Burns,'' he said, adding that she
has a ``good government'' reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Burns said she doesn't remember encouraging lobbyists
to avoid giving to Democrats. But she acknowledges the business
angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a pro-business Legislature. The message is, if you want
this philosophy to prevail, support the candidates who hold those
philosophical values,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns added that she didn't put the July meeting together. Party
officials arranged it, she said. But state GOP chairman Mike Hellon
said the party didn't sponsor the event, although he said retaining
the three Senate seats is a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not at that meeting. I know what you're talking about,''
Hellon said. ``That was not something that we put together. That
was done by the people themselves. I think the intent was to sort
of go around the table of interested parties and say, `These are
races that are crucial. Who's interested in helping whom?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hellon, like Burns, isn't worried about the perception that the
GOP's campaign efforts are too closely tied to lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many interests involved, Hellon said, ``they
basically neutralize each other.'' Everyone is at the table. As
long as there is full disclosure about who is supporting whom, he
added, it's fine.
</P>
<P>
   And that's one of the reasons for the meeting, he said. It gave
competing interests a chance to sort out which candidates to back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to control it through the party. We're
saying, `Here are our guys, for those of you interested in the
election _ you know, get involved,'' Hellon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as everyone participates, then I don't think you have
inordinate influence on the part of one select interest group or
another. As long as everybody is involved, then they balance each
other out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Republican candidates, Hamilton and Larry
Nelson, said they were aware of party efforts to help them. Gary
Richardson said he was getting a lot of assistance, but he wasn't
aware of any specific aid.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said Burns was being extremely helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's an effort out there,'' he said. ``As far as her
strategy and how she picked people to pull the campaign and the
lobbying effort together, I'm not clued into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I meet with (lobbyists), it's clear they've talked
with her. The rails have obviously been greased by the time I get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, of Yuma, said Burns had been very supportive, writing
letters of endorsement to lobbyists and business leaders. But he
said he's not heard of any heavy-handed ``thou shalt support''
approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson's District 5 opponent, former House member Herb
Guenther, says he's convinced that some lobbyists are being
persuaded to avoid his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have been a little timid to offer financial
support and that might be one of the reasons,'' Guenther said of
the GOP effort. ``These are people who have historically
contributed to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tempe Mayor Harry Mitchell, Richardson's opponent in
District 27, said he had been warned by a lobbyist that Burns had
``laid down the law'' about contributing to the three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That angers Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, who calls
the effort by Burns and others a blatant attempt to use the
influence of special interests to win the election.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Cummiskey says, is a Legislature in which lawmakers
are beholden to groups that raise money for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a snapshot of what's going on in these campaigns. It's
a litany of lobbyists that are tapped to maintain the status quo,''
Cummiskey said. ``In this case, it sounds like just about every
primary interest that does business at the Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns responded that Democrats would do the same thing if they
had a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they're doing all that they can in the minority,''
she said. ``I know they are. You would expect them to.''
</P>
<P>
   She added a shot at the national Democratic party, which has
been beset by a fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, we're not going to Red China,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke says both parties live off lobbyists and special interest
money. According to Arizona Common Cause, 80 percent of state
campaign donations comes from lobbyists and their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the amazing truth of Arizona politics. It's funded by
lobbyists. They own the process,'' Burke said. ``The party with the
votes has the most to sell.'' &QL;

<P>
   After airline passengers walked through the metal detectors at
Albuquerque airport last fall, some volunteered to be scrutinized
one more time by a device that ``sniffed'' them to detect chemical
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they stepped into a portal about the size of two
shower stalls, where nozzles puffed jets of air from their
shoulders to their knees. A few seconds later, a computer screen
handed down the verdict: ``clean'' or ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosives-detection portal worked so well that researchers
at Sandia National Laboratories, who developed the device with
funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are now
seeking partners to commercialize it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA gave the researchers $2 million three years ago to
develop a way to ferret out people who are carrying or have
recently handled chemical explosives _ including so-called plastic
explosives _ which conventional methods cannot detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to cover any and all possible ways an explosive
could get on a plane,'' explains Paul Jankowski, manager of the
FAA's trace detection program, inaugurated in 1992 to stay a
technological step ahead of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The device is based on technology Sandia scientists developed to
protect nuclear weapons facilities from bomb threats and to prevent
people inside the facilities from smuggling out restricted chemical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   It sprays several cubic feet of air over a person's hands and
clothes to dislodge any chemicals adhering to them. The air is
sucked into a device below the traveler's feet and passes through a
chemical sensor called an ion mobility spectrometer that can
identify the chemical signatures of many different types of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity and type of chemicals detected then appear on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Sandia's research team was to develop the
preconcentrator technology _ the part of the device that aggregates
the air molecules quickly enough so that the ion spectrometer can
analyze them.
</P>
<P>
   The team succeeded so well that the device can detect very small
concentrations of all ``explosives of interest'' to the FAA,
according to project leader Kevin Linker, a mechanical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, given the task at hand, neither Sandia nor the FAA
will reveal what types of explosives the device detects or its
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial test, on 2,500 volunteers, worked well,
members of the research team say the process _ at 12 seconds per
customer _ still takes too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is 6 to 10 seconds,'' says chemical engineer Chuck
Rhykerd. ``That's the current speed of metal detectors. It doesn't
seem that long, but once you take your keys out of your pocket, put
your bags on the conveyor belt, walk through slowly, and pick up
your bags, that's how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the speed will be a challenge, he admits. ``Five
seconds to collect the air. Five seconds to do the analysis. We can
probably cut the analysis time by one to two seconds. But cutting
the sample time may reduce the device's sensitivity. It's a
trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another glitch that researchers hope to fix before the device
can go into production is that the machine occasionally sounds a
false alarm. As for what causes the false positives, the
security-minded Rhykerd says: ``I have a suspicion, but I can't
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhykerd believes that ultimately, the rate of false positives
can be held to 5 percent, ``well below'' that of metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving its accuracy, Rhykerd and his
colleagues hope to overcome two other technical challenges:
decreasing size and cost. The machine is bound to be expensive, but
the benefits could also be high.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, the FAA's Jankowski notes, the CTX5000, a
million-dollar machine designed to inspect luggage, is already in
use at some airports. ``And this device is nowhere near that
expensive,'' he adds. &QL;

EX-ARMY TECH NOW PLAYS AT TEXAS TECH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the rest of his Texas Tech teammates, Zeno McCoy begins
each day by slipping into shoulder pads before rush-hour traffic
reaches its road-rage-inducing zenith in most large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the majority of the Red Raiders, he has no qualms about
starting two-a-day football sessions at 7:55 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to sleep in for a change,'' said McCoy, 22, who has
spent the past three years answering to a 5 a.m. bugle as an E-4
communications specialist in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this summer, when McCoy finished his hitch at Fort
Lewis, Wash., and resurrected a college football career that got
off to a rocky start when the Plainview native enrolled at Texas
A&AMP;M for the spring semester in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of money and a dorm-room altercation with teammates over
McCoy's missing personal items convinced the defensive end that he
was better-suited for Army life than Aggieland. A midterm enrollee
who never signed a letter of intent, he left A&AMP;M before taking part
in an official practice or posting a grade in any class.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent trips to boot camp, South Korea, Thailand, Guam and
his home base outside Tacoma, Wash., taught McCoy additional
lessons. He partied hard, McCoy said, but he also matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you want to do something else with your life when
you're standing out there in the rain in a muddy foxhole,'' said
McCoy, who installed fiber-optic cable, telephone lines and
computer systems during his Army stint.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy estimates the trade could earn him between $40,000 and
$50,000 per year in a civilian setting. But the 6-foot-5,
220-pounder grew tired of shimmying up telephone poles and
installing cable wires.
</P>
<P>
   So he has landed at Tech, along with his wife, Clarissa, and
daughter, Zurri, 2, to prepare for a career as an art teacher or
football coach. Along the way, he hopes to display the same type of
pass-rushing skills he showed at Plainview, where McCoy recorded 13
sacks as a junior and 10 as a senior in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four years, McCoy is expected to take part
in contact drills this week when he returns from Fort Hood, where
he spent yesterday finalizing his Army discharge. Thus far, coach
Spike Dykes said he has been impressed with McCoy, who will be
classified as a freshman and is eligible to be redshirted under
NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his position, his skills haven't diminished like
they would have if he'd been an offensive lineman, quarterback or
running back,'' Dykes said. ``He doesn't have to depend on timing
what he does in conjunction with a lot of other people. That will
help him get on the field quicker. So far, he doesn't look like
he's missed a lick.''
</P>
<P>
   How much McCoy will play on a team that boasts an All-America
candidate at one defensive end (Montae Reagor) and has two proven
veterans (Taurus Rucker, Devin Lemons) available at the other spot
remains to be seen. But Dykes said he ``wouldn't count him out'' as
a contributor in 1998. That is McCoy's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anticipating too much because I'm just getting back
into it,'' McCoy said. ``But I want to get in there and make
something happen, to contribute in some way my first year. I'm
excited to be back. Plus, the food is a lot better than what I'm
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's perspective on quality cuisine might be skewed by his
overseas experiences. While in Korea, for example, he tasted dog
meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all right. It's considered a delicacy over there,''
McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he balked at trying the rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fertilize their fields with human feces,'' McCoy said.
``You see big piles of it ... and wonder if you really want to eat
their rice.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking Korean liquor, which is fermented with a touch of
formaldehyde, was another story, however. McCoy rated it as the
best in the Far East, ahead of Thailand's beer, because it does not
induce hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just get a slow, sluggish feeling. But your head gets kind
of hot,'' McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, by contrast, had the most intriguing entertainment
opportunities. A favorite haunt: the cobra pit, where snake
charmers attempt to control the venomous reptiles in one-on-one
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scoot around on their knees with a cane and catch them by
the back of the head. It's crazy,'' McCoy said. ``I'm there with my
buddies and we figure, `This guy is going to get bit and we can
laugh about it.' But it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like McCoy's initial college football experience at A&AMP;M,
from an NCAA eligibility standpoint, never existed. The defensive
end never took part in an official practice before he withdrew from
school and entered the Army. Looking back, McCoy said he harbors no
ill will toward A&AMP;M coaches and questions his emotional readiness,
at 18, to play college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the coaching staff. But I ran out of money. And I got
into a scuffle with teammates,'' McCoy said of his A&AMP;M experience,
during which no charges were filed from his dorm-room altercation.
``Instead of doing something that could put me in jail, I decided
to go into the Army. I wanted to make some money and do my own
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always planned on coming back to college football, but I
really don't think I was ready for it the first time. Now, I've got
a better fix on life, and I've got the discipline to handle it.''

TEEN-AGER DISCOVERS SAMPRAS IS NO AGASSI  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Pete Sampras has no fear of prodigies. He can
almost remember how it felt to be one a decade ago when he first
played Ivan Lendl, and he can definitely remember what happened to
him the first time Lendl glared in his direction from across the
net on a blood-red Italian clay court. The teen-age Sampras didn't
cry, but he did cringe. And lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely overwhelmed with his power and how tough he
was,'' said Sampras, who was impressed enough to sign on briefly to
do some hard time training with Lendl, then No. 1, at his
Connecticut estate. ``You're completely in awe of him,'' Sampras
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   These days it's Sampras who, despite taking what he intends to
be a temporary dip to No. 2 in the rankings, expects to be the
intimidator whenever he faces teen-age hotshots like Lleyton
Hewitt, whom he spanked, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), Wednesday in the second
round of the Pilot Pen International.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first winning the Open in '90, he was 9,'' Sampras
said of the 17-year-old Hewitt. ``He didn't seem to be that
intimidated by me, but I really didn't feel like losing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who hasn't captured a title since winning his 11th
career Grand Slam at Wimbledon, hopes to regain his No. 1 ranking
from Chile's Marcelo Rios by winning the title here.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 151st-ranked Hewitt, the pleasant prior
experience of dethroning Andre Agassi in January at the Australian
Hardcourts in his hometown of Adelaide, had sent him into
Wednesday's match against Sampras with some semblance of optimism.
After all, Hewitt's semifinal upset of Agassi not only came against
the player he considers his idol but also made Hewitt the ATP
Tour's third-youngest title winner ever.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it didn't take Sampras long to put a crimp in the
youngster's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good counterpuncher,'' Sampras said of Hewitt, whose
resume since his breakthrough at Adelaide has contained a string of
first- and second-round losses. ``In today's game, you need some
sort of weapon, something that stands out, and I'm not sure he has
that, but he's still young,'' Sampras added.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt tends to keep to the baseline and hasn't yet beefed up
his serving capacity to compete with ace artists like the one he
faced Wednesday. So, once Sampras, who hadn't played in New Haven
since getting off on the wrong foot with a first-round loss to
Michael Chang in 1989, sent up his radar and got his bearings in
the windy stadium, where the surface and balls are a dead ringer
for what's soon to come when the U.S. Open starts Aug. 31, Hewitt
was scrambling to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a set and a break down before I knew it,'' said Hewitt,
who broke Sampras in the opening game of the match but was breaking
racquets by midway through the opening set. ``I didn't even hold
serve in the first set.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hewitt, Sampras' well-rounded game bothered him far
more than Agassi's had. More than once, Hewitt was relegated to
applauding Sampras' volleys instead of returning them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such an all-court game, such a bigger serve,'' said
Hewitt, whose next challenge is qualifying for the Open after
accepting a wild card here. ``You can see how he wins Wimbledon
year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras then addressed his next challenge _ winning the Open and
equaling Roy Emerson's career record of 12 Grand Slam crowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not treating this Open any differently than any other
one,'' Sampras said. ``The 12 is just a number, and I'm pretty
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   More immediate is his attempt to win his first-ever title in New
Haven. Still smarting from Sunday's final-round loss to the
defending U.S. Open champion, Patrick Rafter, in Cincinnati,
Sampras admitted ``it's pretty obvious'' he is looking for a
rematch with Rafter here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my losses much more than my wins,'' said Sampras,
who next faces Leander Paes of India. ``I don't like losing
matches. I don't like losing, period.''.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Several other highly seeded players reached the third round:
third-seeded PETR KORDA handled ANDREI MEDVEDEV, 6-3, 2-6, 6-1;
sixth-seeded TIM HENMAN eliminated VINCENZO SANTOPADRE, 6-2, 6-3;
eighth-seeded GORAN IVANISEVIC defeated GEOFF GRANT, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3,
and 11th-seeded GUSTAVO KUERTEN downed ALEX O'BRIEN, 6-3, 6-2.

   LONDON _ When it comes to sexual indiscretions, Bill Clinton may
have scored higher than most presidents, but his conduct has
differed only in degree from that of most of his White House
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of American presidents surveyed in the Washington
Times newspaper shows all of them merited a black spot on a
scoreboard of sex crimes that range from the use of prostitutes and
fornication (defined as sex with an unmarried woman) through to
much more heinous misdeeds, such as group sex or being linked to
the ``unusual'' death of a lover.
</P>
<P>
   The republic's founding father, George Washington, receives only
one black mark for the crime, mild by the lax standards of the
eighteenth century, of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, a relative libertine, on the other hand, was
awarded four, for mistresses, ``fornication,'' ``adultery'' (sex
with a married women) and fathering illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   America's presidents in the nineteenth century were, by and
large, an obscure group of men who seem to have made up for low
profiles by indulging in pecadillos.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Cleveland _ not a name much bandied about now _ earns
four black marks, for mistress, prostitutes, fornication and
illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   Though not on the straight and narrow, the presidents of the
last century were, it seems, straight; James Buchanan was the sole
American president in the entire list to stray into the column
denoting homosexual affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The private lives of U.S. leaders in both centuries pale into
insignificance compared to those of our own era. After the prim and
dreary milk-and cookie years of Roosevelt and Eisenhower, the
number of black marks rockets under Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets seven marks _ for, among others, having a mistress,
using prostitutes, fornication, sex with White House Staff, group
sex ... narrowly beating Johnson who did not, as far as the
newspaper knows, have group sex.
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton and Johnson fall short of JFK's awesome tally. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE MEMO APPEARS TO CONTRADICT GORE'S ACCOUNT OF
FUND-RAISING CALLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd and 3rd grafs for new information and rewriting;
writethru combines previously sent 2 takes)  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department investigators have obtained a
November 1995 White House memo with hand-written notations that
appear to contradict Vice President Al Gore's account of his
fund-raising phone calls during President Clinton's re-election
campaign, government officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The notations indicate that at a meeting on Nov. 21, 1995, Gore
and several campaign officials discussed how some of the large
contributions being raised by the vice president for use only for
general campaign purposes by the Democratic Party would be diverted
to accounts to directly finance the Clinton-Gore re-election
effort, the government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not provide the notations on the memorandum,
which they said they had been written by an unidentified senior
aide to the vice president. The officials said that the notes were
not conclusive evidence of what the vice president knew about
fund-raising activities and they did not provide details of the
discussion between Gore and others at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has said that telephone
solicitations for hard money by the president or vice president
were subject to federal campaign finance laws and could be illegal.
Last December, she absolved Gore of wrongdoing on the issue of the
phone calls, based on what she said was the absence of evidence
that he had raised funds for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Gore's fund-raising telephone calls is significant
because it has emerged as a focal point of debate at the Justice
Department in recent weeks, after Reno decided to reconsider
whether to seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to
investigate fund-raising abuses during Clinton's re-election
campaign, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a spokesman for Gore would not comment on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, the officials said Reno's advisers
are divided about the significance of the notations on the Gore
memo and some said they doubted that the memo _ by itself _ would
lead to the appointment of an independent prosecutor. But the
document, along with a lengthy confidential report sent to Reno in
late July by the former head of her campaign finance unit, have
re-energized the long-running Justice Department debate about
referring the case to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   That report written by Charles La Bella, who last month returned
to his prosecutorial job in San Diego, urged Reno to send the case
to an independent prosecutor. He based his conclusions on a review
of the massive array of evidence collected during the Justice
Department's criminal grand jury inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the month, Reno opened a formal 30-day
review of Gore's phone calls, the first step toward deciding again
whether to seek an independent counsel. Under the statute, Reno has
until the end of the month to extend the investigation by ordering
a 90-day preliminary inquiry into the vice presidential phone
calls. After that investigation, Reno must decide whether to seek
an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the officials said, Reno has been unable to decide
whether to advance the Gore phone call issue to the 90-day review.
Reno's efforts to reach a decision are said by officials to be
painfully labored even by the standards of the protracted
decision-making that has become a hallmark of her tenure as
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he believed his solicitations were lawful and
intended to raise what is known as ``soft money'' to be used only
for general party purposes. Officials would not explain how the
notations on the memo, according to people who have seen it since
it was obtained last month, show what Gore knew about plans for his
fund-raising calls.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-level Democratic National Committee officials
attended the November 1995 meeting, including Donald Fowler, the
committee chairman, and Marvin Rosen, the finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's fund-raising phone calls have been under
scrutiny before. Reno cleared him in the earlier investigation by
saying evidence showed that he made calls to raise money
exclusively for generic party purposes, a category of funds which
are largely unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some memos about Gore's fund-raising activities also surfaced
during these investigations. Last year, his aides disclosed a memo
by Ronald Klain, the vice president's chief of staff, which was
given to Gore before he met with President Clinton and other chief
fundraising officials in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, Gore did not use the talking points, which show
him actively involved in the formulation of fund-raising strategy
and in the fund-raising effort. In contrast to the image of a vice
president detached from the day-to-day details of fund raising, the
memo showed him deeply involved in the effort to reach the
Democrats' $108 million goal, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella found that the effort to re-elect Clinton rested on an
aggressive but legally dubious attempt to evade the federal laws
designed to limit campaign contributions, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's independent counsel review reflects a deep split among
senior law enforcement officials. La Bella and FBI Director Louis
Freeh have each recommended appointment of an independent counsel,
but some of Reno's closest advisers have been opposed, These
include Lee Radek, the head of the Justice Department's public
integrity unit, and Jo Ann Farrington, a senior career lawyer who
has become a chief interpreter of the independent counsel statute,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal warfare over the appointment of an outside
prosecutor has been fought on at least four separate occasions.
Each time, Reno has rebuffed the lawyers who favor an independent
prosecutor. But officials said that this time the arguments seemed
especially intense, suggesting to some officials that Reno may be
slowly shifting her position. Although resistant to outside
campaign finance inquiries, Reno has referred more issues to
independent prosecutors than any other attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlines of the independent prosecutor statute are not the
only weight bearing down on the attorney general. Reno has been
cited by a congressional committee for contempt of Congress for
refusing to turn over reports by La Bella and Freeh. She has told
lawmakers that she would review La Bella's report by the end of
this week although officials said they do not know when she will
conclude those deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   That report, which is said to pose an embarrassingly direct
challenge to Reno, did not refer to the newly found Gore memo, but
assembled previously known evidence in the case to argue that the
fund-raising activities in behalf of the Clinton-Gore campaign
amounted to a conspiracy to evade the country's federal campaign
laws, the law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, La Bella is said to have argued that the case raised
such serious issues that Reno had no alternative but to seek an
independent counsel and said that she had misinterpreted the law in
her decisions rejecting the appointment. Like Freeh, La Bella said
that the totality of the evidence provided sufficient grounds for
an appointment under the statute.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, Reno has refused to examine campaign fund-rasing
abusesexcept in a limited way. Her critics inside the Justice
Department say that her decisions have created the impression that
she has twisted the independent counsel statute to protect Clinton
and Gore as confidence in her and the Justice Department have
eroded.

TCU STARTER SEES INJURY END CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When the sun rose over Amon Carter Stadium
yesterday, Eric Anderson was there ... waiting to say goodbye to
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat there in the stadium, in the dark, waiting for the
sun,'' said Anderson, a TCU defensive back and former star at L.D.
Bell High School. ``Somehow, I knew I would never walk on that
field again.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's fears were confirmed late yesterday when team
physician Jack McCallum told Anderson his football career was over.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, projected as the team's starting strong safety, was
injured during Tuesday morning's workout when he landed on his neck
after leaping high in the air to block a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a fine football player and a great person,'' coach
Dennis Franchione said, ``but the good thing is, it could have been
a lot worse. They'll operate on him Friday, and except for not
playing football, he's going to be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU trainer Ross Bailey said Anderson ruptured disks between the
sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, and ``a micro fracture of the
facets at C7. Those are the little feet that the vertebrae sit on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he goes in Friday, they'll fuse the vertebrae and he'll
recover, and should do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious neck injury. When he came down, he basically
just T-boned the ground. But luckily he's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a District 5-5A defender of the year at Bell and
Junior College All-American at Blinn College, was returning to his
natural position this year after playing linebacker for the Horned
Frogs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rushing the passer in a drill,'' he said of the play on
which he was injured, ``and I leaped really high in the air. They
tell you to never leave your feet, but it's just an instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up really, really high, and I think one of the backs hit
me on a block. I kind of rotated in the air and came down on the
back of my neck. I think I would have been OK if I hadn't gone up
so high.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came down, Anderson faced a chilling prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the ground, and I suddenly realized my arm was numb.
I couldn't feel anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lay there on the ground and said, `Oh, my God' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But after a few minutes, it went away, and I felt OK. Later in
the day, I was joking about it with the guys in the film room, and
I thought it was no big deal. It was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   But after undergoing X-rays, a magnetic resonance imaging exam
and a CT scan, Anderson began to have doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went to the stadium in the dark,'' he said, ``and I just
sat there and thought about life.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially, a new life.
</P>
<P>
   On July 17, Anderson's girlfriend, TCU track star Shareen
Sharrieff, had a son, Eric Jr. And as the sun rose, he thought of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be married, and we have a baby, and a future
life,'' he said. ``It's a funny thing, you think about all these
things like playing pro ball and all, and you kind of lose
perspective. Those of us who play this game, sometimes we look at
things kind of weird, like we lose track of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I have loved football. But it's just a game ...''
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson went to Dr. McCallum, who gave him the test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was showing me all this stuff,'' Anderson says, ``and
explaining what had happened to me, and what needed to be done. He
was talking about similar injuries. He mentioned Christopher
Reeve,'' the actor who was paralyzed in an equestrian accident in
May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum ``told me I should give up football,'' Anderson said.
``When he told me that, I just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it surprised him, but I wasn't smiling because my
career was over. I was smiling because I still have a normal life.
I was smiling because I won't be in a wheelchair, and someday I can
play baseball with my son and toss the football to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Anderson is a psychology major, he is determined to be
a coach _ a high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I want to do,'' he said, ``because in high school,
you can mold young boys, and turn them into men. You can instill in
them the determination to go to college, and be educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went the hard route, through junior college. But I will
guarantee, you give me four years with you in high school, and I
will get you to college. It has been such a great experience for
me, and I have been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson may get the opportunity to coach sooner than he
figured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to coach,'' Franchione said, ``and I told him that
when he is recovered he can join us as a student assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a senior with 4.5-second speed in the 40-yard dash who
had seven interceptions and 15 sacks in two years at Blinn, was
outstanding for the Frogs in an unnatural position last year, and
counted on heavily in this year's rebuilding effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I can walk away from this game, although I love it,'' he
said. ``But I'm not gone. I'm still on this team, and they're going
to have my spirit with them on every play this year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday the President of the United States testified by video
before a Federal grand jury on whether he perjured himself when he
denied a sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He now admits to some form of intimate relationship with
Lewinsky, though not to ``sexual relations.'' But the president's
opponents, the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and the
Republican Congressional majority, are guilty of a graver offense:
humbug masquerading as democratic vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, Republicans do not really believe Clinton
committed a serious tort. His alleged perjury took place in a civil
suit Paula Jones filed under sexual-harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   When she charged that the then-Governor of Arkansas had
propositioned her in a hotel room, Clinton was required to answer
her questions about his sexual conduct since becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jones came along, Republicans had insisted that sexual
harassment was nothing more than a feminism-fuelled litigative
lottery that allowed some women to collect money when men they did
not fancy made passes at them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican critique has won broad acceptance. Judges of both
political parties now generally respond to sexual harassment cases
_ as to Paula Jones's _ by chucking them out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In the second place, the Republicans once strenuously denied the
constitutionality of the independent counsel law, which was passed
in 1978 in the wake of Watergate. Kenneth Starr even wrote a brief
against the office he now occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Until Bill Clinton won the Presidency in 1992, and the
Republican campaign of calumny and detraction began, the view of
Congressional conservatives was that the independent counsel exists
outside the checks and balances envisioned in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton himself is no stranger to humbug. He did not
complain when the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was nearly
denied confirmation over a ``sexual harassment'' incident that
consisted of one dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he troubled when Ronald Reagan's presidency was crippled
after 1987 by the inquiry into the illegal raising of money and
arms for the Nicaraguan Contras.
</P>
<P>
   It is a telling parallel. Throughout the 1980s, Democrats warned
that Reagan was a doddering old warmonger. But that is what the
voters wanted _ a doddering old warmonger.
</P>
<P>
   In the Contra scandal, a Democratic congressional majority and a
power-hungry independent prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, reckoned that
if Americans could not be made to see reason at the polls, then the
work of removing (or disabling) Reagan had best be done judicially.
It is a dangerously anti-democratic tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the Republicans are making the same mistake. Voters
have always been aware that Clinton is, as the Southern idiom has
it, a hard dog to keep on the porch. And they don't care. They have
prospered under his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   They may even value his goatishness as an antidote to all the
prudery and prohibitionism that travels under the ``family values''
rhetoric of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric is not unknown in this country, of course. In the
current issue of the Spectator, the Greek-American playboy Taki
writes that the President's offense was that he had not restrained
his sexual impulses even though he is the head of a country with ``
its Christian values written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States is explicitly a non-Christian
country. The U.S. Constitution contains many noble sentiments, but
nowhere does it mention God, let alone Jesus Christ; and the First
Amendment insists on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Bill Clinton, an avowed Baptist, might be
expected to take the injunctions of his religion rather more
seriously than he apparently does, but he is not the first Baptist,
nor the first president, to play away from home.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed a moral question here, but the morality has been
muddied by the less attractive members of America's religious
right, and by those who cannot and will not reconcile themselves to
Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ especially the Southern conservatives _ are
finding the Clinton ascendancy unbearable. They, after all,
represent the Americans who steered clear of the leftist,
hedonistic 1960s in order to uphold the old values, work
diligently, and fight communism.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they felt, they would be vindicated, their virtue
rewarded. Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Americans handed the reins
of leadership to Mr. Didn't-Inhale and his clique of
abortion-promoting Ivy League millionaires. It was just too
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must be prosecuted to show that no one is above the law,
Republicans argue. This is, as Americans would say, baloney. That
no one is above the law is an important American principle, but it
gets flouted from time to time, with no lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   That people have a right to the president they elected _
provided that he is not guilty of a crime or misdemeanor far more
serious than lying about sex _ is a principle of incomparably
greater importance in a democracy. America ignores it at its
peril. &QL;

 UNDATED: about it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That evidence is varied. Allen Phillips, a photographer, used a
computer to line up facial features of five later images of Lincoln
and easily ``dissolved'' or ``morphed'' the daguerreotype image
into the last known photo of him, taken in April 1865, the month he
was shot. Albert Harper, a forensic anthropologist, measured such
things as forehead height, nasal height, mouth contour and other
facial elements and found matches with later Lincoln portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Buberger, a dealer in antique photographs and the
daguerreotype's most ardent champion, traced the travels of
itinerant photographers in 1843 and found at least two who visited
Springfield, Ill., where Lincoln lived that year. Buberger, who
helped the Hoffmans and who, some experts said, harbored hopes that
he would sell it for them on commission, even called in Dr. Henry
Lee, the forensic scientist whose testimony helped acquit O.J.
Simpson. Lee agreed with those who think the portrait is genuine. (
Hoffman said that all the experts volunteered their expertise. ``No
one ever charged us or anyone else for the research,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   The vein analyses, on the other hand, were mixed. Dr. Ralph
Leonard, a medical professor at Wake Forest University, concluded
that the vein patterns in the daguerreotype did not match
Lincoln's. But Dr. Blaine Houmes, the deputy medical examiner in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a Lincoln photo collector, said they did
correspond.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing the consignment, Christie's relied most heavily on
the work of Lewis Sadler, the head of the Biomedical Visualization
Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Sadler
developed an identification process that feeds mathematical
``facial maps'' into a computer model and sifts the data for
matches. To test the daguerreotype, he mapped it and three other
Lincoln images and mixed them with 300 other facial maps of white
males. He got three matches _ with the three other Lincoln
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have observed this type of clustering only in cases where we
had photos of the same individual and in the case of identical
twins,'' Dr. Sadler wrote. ``I would have to conclude that there
was nothing to indicate that this was not a photo of Abraham
Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny that,'' Wester of Christie's said. ``Everything
else is human opinion.'' Believers are also buoyed by the
daguerreotype's provenance, which shows a strong yet circuitous tie
to Lincoln. The Hoffmans bought the image from George Feeley, an
antiques dealer in Caledonia, N.Y., shortly before he died in 1993.
Feeley, Hoffman said, was the private liquidator for the Wadsworth
family. Senator James W. Wadsworth Jr. was married to Alice Hay,
who was the daughter of John Milton Hay, Lincoln's private
secretary (and later Secretary of State under Presidents William
McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt).
</P>
<P>
   Hay and Lincoln were close. During the Civil War, Hay moved into
the White House, and Hay, some historians say, was the only person
there who referred to Lincoln by his first name. Documents show
that the Lincolns gave Hay many artifacts, including a lock of the
president's hair, letters and two copies of the Gettyburg Address,
as well as a scrapbook of Civil War news clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants also say that they recall seeing the daguerreotype
in the Wadsworth household.
</P>
<P>
   To which Ostendorf said, so what? ``Everybody has pictures of
family and friends. If that's convincing provenance, I'd like to
see unconvincing provenance.'' Scholars said many look-alikes sent
Lincoln and his family their own pictures, and Hay might have had
one of those.

STARR WARS: POPPYCOCK MASQUERADING AS DEMOCRATIC VIGILANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday the President of the United States testified by video
before a Federal grand jury on whether he perjured himself when he
denied a sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He now admits to some form of intimate relationship with
Lewinsky, though not to ``sexual relations.'' But the president's
opponents, the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and the
Republican Congressional majority, are guilty of a graver offense:
humbug masquerading as democratic vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, Republicans do not really believe Clinton
committed a serious tort. His alleged perjury took place in a civil
suit Paula Jones filed under sexual-harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   When she charged that the then-Governor of Arkansas had
propositioned her in a hotel room, Clinton was required to answer
her questions about his sexual conduct since becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jones came along, Republicans had insisted that sexual
harassment was nothing more than a feminism-fuelled litigative
lottery that allowed some women to collect money when men they did
not fancy made passes at them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican critique has won broad acceptance. Judges of both
political parties now generally respond to sexual harassment cases
_ as to Paula Jones's _ by chucking them out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In the second place, the Republicans once strenuously denied the
constitutionality of the independent counsel law, which was passed
in 1978 in the wake of Watergate. Kenneth Starr even wrote a brief
against the office he now occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Until Bill Clinton won the Presidency in 1992, and the
Republican campaign of calumny and detraction began, the view of
Congressional conservatives was that the independent counsel exists
outside the checks and balances envisioned in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton himself is no stranger to humbug. He did not
complain when the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was nearly
denied confirmation over a ``sexual harassment'' incident that
consisted of one dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he troubled when Ronald Reagan's presidency was crippled
after 1987 by the inquiry into the illegal raising of money and
arms for the Nicaraguan Contras.
</P>
<P>
   It is a telling parallel. Throughout the 1980s, Democrats warned

<TEXT>
<P>
   Aside from the smutty jokes, President Clinton deserved our
sympathy as he faced the questioning of Special Counsel Kenneth
Starr across a video link Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a question of morality or even of past lies. It is the
problem of the leader of the most powerful country of the world
being chased like a rat into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that he is a rat, in his personal
morality and his character. There are those too who would argue
that truth is the greatest single ingredient in a democracy and the
law is its final guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Both may be true, although it should be said that the U.S.
public is the final arbiter in a democracy of what it does or does
not feel is important in the character of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There is little indication either that voters did not have a
fair view of Clinton before his election. The process of
investigation has become not so much a process of judgment as a
legalistic interpretation of what is truth and what is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   It is the process that matters to the world as much as to
America. For the rest of the world is probably reacting much like
the average American, bemused that it could come to this.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton stays on wounded and tarnished, it is not
just the prestige of the U.S. that suffers, it is also its ability
to act around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy remains the one area where the character of the
president does matter. So far Clinton's record in the field has not
been that strong, but nor has it been bad.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a domestic president, he has seen it as his task to
turn America's victory in the Cold War to commercial effect through
pushing free trade. But he has resisted most temptations to meddle
dangerously in the internal affairs of other countries, he has
followed a reasonably ethical policy and has put his weight behind
peace where it matters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely his fault that a Republican Congress has
continued to be so anti-U.N. or that Israeli politics have
prevented a breakthrough in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the rest of the world of a humiliated president
is that it will be precisely at this time that Clinton may decide
to move from domestic to international concerns in a way aimed at
increasing his prestige rather than pursuing national aims.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in Kenya, the continued troubles with Fidel Castro,
the war on drugs in Latin America and Asia, the edgy relationship
with Iran: all these could provide him with endless opportunities
to act tough to restore his image.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles are our concern and it is right for America's
allies to help him keep dignity if he is to remain responsible. &QL;

EX-KLANSMAN TESTIFIES ON HOW FATAL FIREBOMBING WAS PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 3rd graf to restore missing `is')   (bl)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ In the vernacular of the White Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi in the violent 1960s, a ``No. 1''
was a cross burning, and a ``No. 2,'' a whipping. A ``No. 3'' was a
firebombing, and ``No. 4,'' the most severe punishment of all, was
killing. Only the highest-ranking Klansmen could order a No. 3 and
No. 4, said Billy Roy Pitts, a foot soldier in the White Knights in
the winter of 1965-66.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Bowers was the only man who could order a No. 3 and No. 4
in the White Knights in the state of Mississippi,'' Pitts testified
here Wednesday in Bowers' murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, a 73-year-old former Klan leader, is being tried for the
fifth time for ordering the death of Vernon Dahmer, a civil rights
leader killed by the firebombing of his home on Jan. 10, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, now 54 and serving time for his part in the killing, told
the jury that he gathered with other Klansmen that winter in a
farmhouse near Laurel, Miss., for a special meeting _ special
because Bowers, the Imperial Wizard who led the Mississippi White
Knights, had come to see them in person, to order Dahmer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts testified that Bowers ordered the murder of Dahmer because
he had worked to register blacks to vote in Forrest County.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said Bowers was visibly angry at the meeting because the
Forrest County Klan had been lenient, doing nothing to silence
Dahmer, the respected merchant, farmer and local NAACP official who
offered his small store in the Kelly Setttlement community outside
Hattiesburg as a place blacks could pay their poll tax.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said Bowers, a businessman in Laurel, later told him:
``Don't worry. No jury in the state of Mississippi is going to
convict a white man for killing'' someone black.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bowers presided over other meetings where Klansmen
planned the firebombing of Dahmer's home and store, and that the
lawyer who is defending Bowers' in this trial, Travis Buckley, also
attended discussions of the plot to firebomb the house.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an outburst from Buckley, who demanded a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so inflammatory,'' said Buckley, who was indicted in the
Dahmer case three decades ago but was later cleared of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecuting attorney, Robert Helfrich, said his office had
filed a motion before the trial pointing out a possible conflict of
interest if Buckley tried the case, but that Bowers insisted that
Buckley serve as his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come up again that Mr. Buckley was there, by
this witness and other witnesses,'' said Helfrich.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard McKenzie denied the mistrial motion but told the
jury to disregard what they had heard about Buckley. When asked if
they could do that, the jurors _ six blacks, five whites and one
Asian-American _ nodded.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the most lively exchange in a day of courtroom
activity that opened up the Klan's strategy in the 1960s. When
another former Klansman, T. Webber Rogers, refused to tell the
court where he lived, the judge asked him if he did so because he
was afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah,'' blurted Rogers, who said he has been shot at
since testifying against the Klan in previous cases. The judge then
admonished him for using such language in court.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom laughed at that, but there was only silence as the
former Klansmen explained how the killing was planned and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the information coming out of this trial seems new in
1998, it is hardly so. Bowers has been on trial in the Dahmer
murder four times before, always walking free after deadlocked
juries of white males. He did serve time _ six years in connection
with one of the killings of the three civil rights workers in
Neshoba County in 1964 _ but no prosecutor has ever successfully
linked him to Dahmer's murder.
</P>
<P>
   As Bowers sat in the courtroom in his off-white suit, seeming
uninterested, Rogers described how angry a younger version of the
defendant had been on a winter night years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to know why that job down south hadn't been done,''
said Rogers. ``He wanted it done, and he wanted it done right. He
said it should have been done two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and other Klansmen took part in what Bowers called a
``dry run,'' piling into cars and driving past the Dahmers' house.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers is not accused of being at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he also did not take part in the actual killing. But
Pitts admitted being there. He told a story he has told before, in
trials that led to the convictions of four other men in Dahmer's
murder, of how eight men in two cars, the trunks loaded with
shotguns and 12 gallons of gasoline, rumbled toward the Dahmers'
home.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped at a black cemetery near there, and one of the
Klansmen urinated on a grave. Then, the others did, too.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bowers had sent him along as a guard, armed with a
pistol, to watch over the others. But as Dahmer, his body on fire,
fired a shotgun over and over from a window to give his wife and
children time to escape, Pitts said he dropped the pistol, unfired.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could hear Dahmer calling from inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer, his lungs seared by the flames, died in a hospital 12
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man's life was taken and I was part of it,'' Pitts said.
``It's something I can't get out of my mind. I wish to God I had
never been a part of it . . . I destroyed a family.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving a short federal sentence for his part in the
killing, Pitts was supposed to serve a life sentence in Mississippi
state prison. But, probably because he cooperated in the
investigation, he never actually did time in state prison. Pitts
said he was told by authorities he did not have to, but he was
never officially pardoned. In January, The Jackson Clarion-Ledger
reported that fact, and Pitts is now serving that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who has argued that his client is the victim of a
federal conspiracy, asked Pitts if the federal government gave him
money for his girlfriend in the 1960s. Pitts was married at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said federal investigators did give him about $8,000 over
time _ informants are often paid money _ but that money went to his
wife and children, not his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you're gettin' at and I'll save you a lot of

<P>
   Aside from the smutty jokes, President Clinton deserved our
sympathy as he faced the questioning of Special Counsel Kenneth
Starr across a video link Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a question of morality or even of past lies. It is the
problem of the leader of the most powerful country of the world
being chased like a rat into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that he is a rat, in his personal
morality and his character. There are those too who would argue
that truth is the greatest single ingredient in a democracy and the
law is its final guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Both may be true, although it should be said that the U.S.
public is the final arbiter in a democracy of what it does or does
not feel is important in the character of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There is little indication either that voters did not have a
fair view of Clinton before his election. The process of
investigation has become not so much a process of judgment as a
legalistic interpretation of what is truth and what is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   It is the process that matters to the world as much as to
America. For the rest of the world is probably reacting much like
the average American, bemused that it could come to this.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton stays on wounded and tarnished, it is not
just the prestige of the U.S. that suffers, it is also its ability
to act around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy remains the one area where the character of the
president does matter. So far Clinton's record in the field has not
been that strong, but nor has it been bad.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a domestic president, he has seen it as his task to
turn America's victory in the Cold War to commercial effect through
pushing free trade. But he has resisted most temptations to meddle
dangerously in the internal affairs of other countries, he has
followed a reasonably ethical policy and has put his weight behind
peace where it matters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely his fault that a Republican Congress has
continued to be so anti-U.N. or that Israeli politics have
prevented a breakthrough in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the rest of the world of a humiliated president
is that it will be precisely at this time that Clinton may decide
to move from domestic to international concerns in a way aimed at
increasing his prestige rather than pursuing national aims.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in Kenya, the continued troubles with Fidel Castro,
the war on drugs in Latin America and Asia, the edgy relationship
with Iran: all these could provide him with endless opportunities
to act tough to restore his image.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles are our concern and it is right for America's
allies to help him keep dignity if he is to remain responsible. &QL;

   SIMIANE-LA-ROTONDE, FRANCE _ ``In 1949, when I moved here, there
were children and shops,'' said Martin Gilbert, the retired mason
of Simiane-la-Rotonde, an ancient hilltop village in Provence
surrounded by fields of lavender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a baker, two grocers, cafes... (but) the young have
all gone off to Marseilles, like my daughter. Now I rattle around
this big house with my wife,'' he said, jabbing a finger at a fine
17th-century stone four-story house shadowed by the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is one of the few local people to be seen in the
village's charming but empty streets, carving miniature versions of
Provencal borries (stone huts) in a garage to sell to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, exhibited recently in a
London gallery, shows a gaggle of children in Simiane's old covered
market a few decades ago, prancing before the camera. Today the
market is pristine and silent, but for the sound of Gilbert
tap-tapping his borries in the street below.
</P>
<P>
   A similar silence envelops the village pump, where not that long
ago women gathered to wash their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The church of Ste. Victoire is locked. At the turn of the
century it was a thriving parish, and the patron saint's feast day
was the high point of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A summoner clattered around the winding streets, shouting out a
long program of events which included the blessing of the entire
population of 1,300 in the square and a great procession headed by
four women carrying the reliquary of Ste. Victoire around the
village, followed by dancing and feasting.
</P>
<P>
   These days an old priest comes from the famous cheese town of
Banon once a month to say Mass to a congregation of about 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the neighboring hilltop village of Oppedette, the church is
shut all the time. ``Except for funerals,'' one villager said. ``We
lock it to keep out vandals _ unemployed people from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   With tourism unable to provide an income for many in villages
off the beaten track, the blue and purple fields of lavender that
unfold like a pleated peasant's skirt beneath the walls of Simiane
and Oppedette perhaps offer the only lifeline by which the local
communities will survive.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, even this industry seemed on the edge of
extinction. Farmers were giving up the struggle to scratch a living
out of stony fields on steep hillsides, and then searching for an
often unscrupulous middleman to buy up the lavender and sell it on.
</P>
<P>
   The market was shrinking, as foreign firms turned to synthetic
substitutes for their oil, or to ultra-cheap ``cloned'' lavender
from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   But French lavender today is big business once again, as public
interest booms in herbs and alternative medicine. Synthetic
substitutes are out.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Apt, a few miles from the much-publicized
Museum of Lavender in Cordes, most shops heavily promote lavender
products. One is devoted to nothing else, selling lavender soap,
lavender shampoo, artful postcards showing lavender fields in
various shades of purple, oils of course, sprays for the kitchens
and potpourris.
</P>
<P>
   The piped music is of cicadas, presumably to give visitors the
feeling of being in a lavender field.
</P>
<P>
   The cognoscenti can muse over whether to buy bags of seeds of
``Lavandin'' (the hybrid, cheaper stuff) or pure ``lavande,'' the
infinitely more expensive wild variety, which only grows above 800
meters (2,500 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The church has tapped into a burgeoning ``New Age'' perception
that herbs, monks and alternative medicine are all intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cistercian abbey of Senanque and at Ganagobie, the monks
have opened sophisticated shops, selling a huge range of lavender
items far removed in quality from English cathedral shop tat.
</P>
<P>
   As well as their own generous range of lavender soaps, oils and
creams, the abbeys promote books in several languages on monastery
herb gardens and the ancient ``secrets'' of lavender, secrets
presumably preserved over the centuries only by the clergy (which
wouldn't be surprising, as the abbeys sit in fields of the stuff).
</P>
<P>
   Five drops drunk in a glass of wine, I read in one book, can
cure ``hysterical vapors.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the once moribund lavender industry of Provence
is not, however, a mere side-effect of the growing attraction to
New Age mysticism and alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Simiane's farmers have helped themselves too, setting up a
co-operative that dispatched the middlemen to oblivion. Out, too,
went ``romantic'' looking scythes (except for folk festivals) and
fat copper stills.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourists trundle around Simiane's pottery shop, the
village farmers sweat in the burning August heat, taking their crop
to the large and distinctly unpicturesque modern distillery that
the co-op has set up on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and sons join in with their men, stacking the
fast-browning bales into the giant vat. Clouds of steam rise
through the stalks, carrying the precious oil in pipes through a
cold water tank to rows of barrels underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The undulating lavender fields of Simiane and Oppedette may look
as if they are kept on for the benefit of the heritage industry or
for tourists, but the product is, in fact, sold direct to Proctor &AMP;
Gamble and Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Agricole des Plantes a Parfum de Provence and
its 290 members have seized almost a third of the total French
lavender oil production, three times more than before the co-op was
set up 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its still a hard living,'' says Claude Coutant, a 30-year-old
farmer, laughing mirthlessly at the notion that the industry's
revival has ensured farmers a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration streamed from his brow as the lavender was
pitchforked into the vat amid wafts of scalding steam. ``Whatever
money we make goes back into investing in equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutant's father and grandfather farmed lavender before him, and
so will he. Lavender will guarantee the survival of a way of life,
if not prosperity. &QL;

BARNICLE RESIGNS AFTER NEW QUESTIONS ON REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ending a tumultuous two-week period during which he was
asked to resign from The Boston Globe and then successfully battled
to retain his job, Metro columnist Mike Barnicle resigned from the
newspaper Wednesday after new questions arose over his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year columnist, already serving a two-month suspension
for writing a column that used jokes by comedian George Carlin,
agreed to quit after being unable to verify the facts contained in
an Oct. 8, 1995, column about two children being treated for cancer
at Children's Hospital, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to the Globe newsroom Wednesday afternoon, editor
Matthew V. Storin said that ``in light of his failure to follow the
most basic reporting requirements as well as the duplicitous way in
which the story was written, it is clear that Mike Barnicle can no
longer write for The Boston Globe ... I think this has been a
horrendous period, but now we can at least put it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached last night, Barnicle, 54, said, ``I'm sorry Matt thinks
I'm duplicitous. I believe that story to be true. I was told it by
a nurse. I've been trying all day to track down two people involved
in that column.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he agreed to resign because ``of the weight of
this thing. ... It was too much, it was absurd. ... The feeding
frenzy that has disrupted this paper. Matt Storin doesn't deserve
it, the Globe doesn't deserve it, and I don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 column told a detailed and poignant story of two
families _ one black and poor, one white and affluent _ that bonded
because they both had young sons suffering from cancer. After the
poor child died, the wealthy family sent a $10,000 check to his
family, which was struggling for economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper began probing the latest charge against Barnicle
Tuesday when Storin received a letter from Kenneth Tomlinson, a
former editor-in-chief of Reader's Digest who was writing a story
on his experiences with Barnicle for The Weekly Standard magazine.
Tomlinson said that in 1995 he had wanted to reprint the Barnicle
cancer column as the lead article in the digest's January 1996
issue. But, Tomlinson said, ``Barnicle declined to help me''
confirm the facts, and after ``exhaustive efforts'' to verify the
story, ``we concluded the column was fabricated.'' The magazine did
not tell the Globe of its suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday morning, assistant managing editor Walter
Robinson, who last week was appointed Barnicle's supervising
editor, attempted unsuccessfully to verify key facts of the column
through conversations with Barnicle, and with officials at
Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robinson's account of his conversations with the
columnist, Barnicle said he heard the account from a nurse who
worked at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and who had heard the
story from the affluent family with the surviving child. But
Barnicle was unable, said Robinson, to provide the name of the
nurse or further corroborating details.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson told Barnicle that he was troubled by his reliance
on a third-hand source for the graphic details in the column,
Robinson said the columnist told him, ``That's the way I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon the Globe decided to ask for Barnicle's
resignation and Barnicle agreed to quit during a phone conversation
with Globe chairman William O. Taylor. In addressing the staff
Wednesday, Storin said Barnicle ``could offer no account of
attempting to check out details of the story by calling Children's
Hospital or either set of parents. In fact, he said he did not know
the parents' names. Yet he quoted the black parents in the story
and quoted from the letter the white parents had purportedly sent
with the check.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The story may well prove to be true or essentially true,''
Storin added Wednesday. ``But the reporting procedures violated any
basic journalistic standard.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Globe was investigating Barnicle's 1995 column, The
Boston Phoenix Wednesday released a story it was preparing for
print containing what it called ``the most damning evidence of all
that Barnicle has, indeed, plagiarized.'' The column in question
was a Jan. 20, 1986, piece in which Barnicle attributed a series of
anecdotes about infamous Louisiana politician Earl Long to his
cousin, Gillis Long.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix story reported that the column had ``lifted exact
quotes, complete with idiosyncratic spellings,'' from author A.J.
Liebling's 1961 biography of Long. The Phoenix piece, by media
critic Dan Kennedy, pointed out that Gillis Long died a year before
the column appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Storin Wednesday said that ``we've been aware of the Phoenix
story since this morning,'' adding that the column singled out by
the weekly ``may have been just as bad (as the October 1995
column), but it wasn't a factor because we were already down the
track on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, a number of factors went into the Globe decision
to sever their relationship with Mike Barnicle,'' said Phoenix
editor Peter Kadzis, pointing out that his paper had faxed the
Globe a copy of its story Wednesday morning and suggesting it
played a role in Barnicle's demise. ``Let the readers draw their
own conclusion,'' Kadzis said. ``This isn't about trophies. It's
about getting at the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the second time in two weeks that the Globe
asked for Barnicle's resignation. The prolonged episode began when
an Aug. 2 Barnicle column was found to contain eight jokes similar
to those in comedian Carlin's 1997 book ``BrainDroppings,'' a
resemblance first noted in a Boston Herald story.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5 Storin, accepting Barnicle's explanation that he had
not read the book and got the jokes from friends, initially
suspended him for a month without pay. But later that day, WCVB-TV
(Channel 5) ran a clip of Barnicle endorsing the book on a June 22
edition of its ``Chronicle'' show, on which Barnicle appears. At
that point, Storin, concluding that the columnist had
``misrepresented himself either to his television audience or to
his editors,'' first asked for Barnicle's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, saying he had not read the book and did not recall
endorsing it on television, declined to resign. He took to the
national and local media circuit to plead his case, prompting
thousands of calls and messages to flood the Globe seeking his
reinstatement. Staples chairman Thomas G. Stemberg wrote a letter
implying he might withdraw advertising were Barnicle not brought
back on board.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, following three meetings between Barnicle and top
Globe officials, Storin, who had been out of the country when the
allegations arose, acknowledged acting too ``hastily,'' rescinded
the resignation request, and suspended Barnicle for two months
without pay. That decision led to two days of contentious meetings
inside the Globe and protests outside the paper.
</P>
<P>
   When the two-month suspension was announced at a staff meeting,
Barnicle apologized for his ``sloppiness,'' but faced a barrage of
tough questions, as did Storin. One huge factor hanging over the
episode was the requested resignation June 18 of Patricia Smith, a
Metro columnist who is black. She quit after acknowledging she
fabricated characters and quotes in several 1998 columns.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, more than 50 Globe employees signed a petition
presented to Storin and to publisher Benjamin B. Taylor, stating
that Barnicle's ``reprieve gives the appearance of a double
standard.'' The paper also faced criticism from the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National
Association of Black Journalists, the Urban League of Eastern
Massachusetts, the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, and from a tough
editorial written by New York Times editorial page editor Howell
Raines. The Times owns the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Wednesday afternoon, a group of black activists
met with Globe editors to express their concerns alleging unequal
treatment of Smith and Barnicle. Sadiki Kambon, president of the
Black Community Information Center, called the Globe a ``racist
publication'' and asked people of color to boycott it.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why he had given Barnicle another chance last
week, Storin said Wednesday that conversations with the columnist
revealed that ``the origin of the (Carlin) joke material was
muddy'' and that Barnicle's bosses became convinced ``we could
restore the trust between the editors and him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the furor of last week, I feel good in the sense
that I made the right call last week and I made the right call
today,'' Storin said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Globe readers last Sunday, Storin discussed the
decision to retain Barnicle, but noted that he is ``under perhaps
the greatest scrutiny a newspaper writer has ever had to endure. He
knows he is on a high wire without a net. Room for legitimate
errors? Yes. Room for an ethical lapse? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin also alluded to just how traumatic the past few weeks had
been for the Globe, facing internal and external questions about
its standards, judgment, and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel good yet,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, when announcing Barnicle's resignation to a newsroom
full of anxious and drawn faces, Storin said it was time to move
forward after a nightmarish few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``We have everyone on the same ethical page.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the assemblage burst into applause.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight days after salvaging his career at The Boston Globe,
columnist Mike Barnicle resigned Wednesday, at the newspaper's
request, when editors could find no evidence that two young cancer
victims he described in a 1995 column had ever existed.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle told his editors on Tuesday that he had been given the
story by a nurse whose name he could not recall. He also said he
had never tried to speak with the boys' families.
</P>
<P>
   Globe Editor Matthew Storin said in a statement Wednesday: ``In
light of his failure to follow the most basic reporting
requirements as well as the duplicitous way in which the story was
written, it is clear that Mike Barnicle can no longer write for The
Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt end of Barnicle's quarter-century career at the
Globe, owned by The New York Times Co., was another act in a
wrenching summer at the newspaper, which in a matter of only weeks
has lost two of its most popular metropolitan columnists, Patricia
Smith, and now Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   Storin had been alerted to the Barnicle column at issue on
Monday by Kenneth Tomlinson, a retired editor of Reader's Digest.
Tomlinson, whose own son had survived a spinal tumor, was moved
when he read the Oct. 8, 1995, column and sought to reprint it
around that time.
</P>
<P>
   But fact-checkers from Reader's Digest, who contacted various
cancer societies and Children's Hospital, where by Barnicle's
account the two boys had been patients, and could find no evidence
of the boys' existence. Eventually, Tomlinson said Wednesday, he
decided the column had been fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that was by turns gracious and resentful,
Barnicle said Wednesday that he felt consumed by a ``media feeding
frenzy,'' with his work of 25 years _ some 4,000 columns _ under
scrutiny. ``Just in the last 24 hours, I was asked to explain
circumstances and columns written in 1973, 1981, 1986 and 1995 and
was given 24 hours _ a single day's news cycle _ to rebut all the
allegations at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this is not what I want to do with my life. And it is
hurting the paper I love. This burden has made it impossible for
Matt Storin and the editors of the Globe to publish the terrific
product they put on the street each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a telephone interview how he had come to write the
column on the young cancer victims, Barnicle said that a nurse had
told the story to a telephone operator at the Globe who then told
it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed the story to be true,'' he said, ``and I wrote it
after talking to the nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone operator, Rose Berry Devine, an old friend of the
columnist's, Wednesday agreed with Barnicle's account, saying that
she remembered that a call had come in from a nurse's aide who was
suffering from AIDS and has since died.
</P>
<P>
   The column told of a friendship that had developed between the
two boys _ one black, one white _ while they were hospitalized
together. It reported details like the downsizing that had cost the
black youngster's father his job at a high-technology company, and
began with a passage in which that child's mother received a
$10,000 check from the white family:
</P>
<P>
   ``She opened the letter as she strolled up the driveway from the
mailbox. As she finished the first paragraph, she stopped in her
tracks, unable to focus because of the tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few seconds, she lifted her head toward the perfect
sky and, for a brief, wonderful moment, she could hear her son
singing his favorite song.''
</P>
<P>
   The column went on to quote her husband as saying, ``There
really is a God.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the questions raised by Tomlinson _ who said he was
now writing an article about the cancer-victim column for The
Weekly Standard, a Washington magazine _ The Boston Phoenix, the
city's alternative weekly, had prepared an article showing strong
similarities between the writer A.J. Liebling's biography of former
Louisiana Gov. Earl Long and a 1986 column by Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday why he had not alerted the Globe to his
suspicions back in late 1995, Tomlinson said it was because, in
part, he had assigned one of his own reporters to do a piece on how
a column can be fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get a lot of interest going,'' he said. ``It was
one of those good ideas that fell by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   When he read about the forced resignation of another Globe
columnist, Ms. Smith, in June, and the paper's decision to review
some of Barnicle's past work, Tomlinson said, ``I thought, `Any
examination by the Globe will turn this up.'' But that examination
of Barnicle's work since January 1996 turned up no problematic
columns, according to Globe editors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Tomlinson said, two weeks ago, when The Boston Herald
disclosed the similarities between Barnicle's Aug. 2 column and
jokes in a 1997 book by comedian George Carlin, he said he thought
Barnicle's career would be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a foregone conclusion he was going down and
his sins had caught up to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe the massive pressure brought to bear on the
Globe to keep him,'' Tomlinson added, referring to the support of
popular radio talk-show host Don Imus, prominent journalists, a
major Globe advertiser and hundreds of Globe readers who deluged
the newspaper switchboard with protest calls.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Storin had reversed his initial decision to ask for
Barnicle's resignation for misleading the Globe about the Carlin
situation did Tomlinson send a fax to Storin questioning the
cancer-victim column.
</P>
<P>
   In the Globe's newsroom, where there has been a crescendo of
complaints in recent days about Barnicle's standards, the mood
lightened perceptibly Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by and large the staff feels better than they've felt
in two months,'' Storin said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   When he read his statement to the staff, the final words _ ``I'm
glad we can now move forward with everyone operating from the same
ethical page'' _ provoked a smattering of applause and some nervous
laughter from a relieved staff, said two people present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all glad it's all over, but nobody is dancing on
his grave,'' said Anne Kornblut, a metropolitan reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do now, Barnicle, who has seven children
ranging in age from 5 to 34, said Wednesday: ``I don't know.
Tomorrow is my precious boy's 14th birthday. My job is to make sure
that he knows that everything will be OK.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the Globe's newsroom was recovering from the Barnicle
episode, the newsroom of The Wall Street Journal was getting word
that James S. Hirsch, who has covered the Boston area for the
Journal, had been fired. Hirsch wrote last week, erroneously, that
The New York Times Co. had declined to comment on Storin's decision
last week to keep Barnicle on staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal published a correction on Tuesday noting that The
Times Co. had not been asked for comment. Richard Tofel, a
spokesman for Dow Jones, The Journal's parent company, said that
the reporter ``knew that that sentence in the story was not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that he doesn't work for us,'' Tofel said.

PLAYER OR COACH? DEADLINE NEARS FOR DECISION ON BATES' STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys have less than a week to make a
final decision on whether Bill Bates will be a full-time coach or
player.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, a 15-year veteran, joined the Cowboys' coaching staff
before training camp when the Cowboys decided not to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the team said Bates could possibly return for
another season as a late roster addition.
</P>
<P>
   However, the NFL informed the Cowboys that in order for Bates to
be eligible to play this season, he must be on the active roster
when the team cuts to 60 players Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless Bates decides not to coach. If Bates quits the
coaching staff, then he can be come back at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Bates said the rule is meant to keep to keep teams from hiding
veteran players on their coaching staff for insurance purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who is one season from setting a team record for tenure,
said he wants to play, but would remain a coach if the team does
not move him to the 60-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way it will work out great for me and hopefully great
for the Cowboys,'' Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bates has a locker in the players' locker room, his
return doesn't appear likely. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey and
defensive coordinator Dave Campo said they haven't even discussed
the possibility of activating the former safety and special-teams
standout. &QL; 
SMITH CUT, MYERS PROMOTED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gailey announced that the team released backup defensive end
Herman Smith and moved promising rookie defensive lineman Michael
Myers to the No. 2 rush end position behind Kavika Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a three-year veteran who was once considered a strong
candidate to make the final roster, has struggled in the past week.
He started in place of an injured Pittman and recorded only one
tackle Monday in a 21-3 preseason loss to New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free-agent punter Barry Cantrell also was released
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt at this that he wasn't going to make the team,''
Gailey said of Smith. ``We decided to do it now to give him an
opportunity to find another team.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a fourth-round pick, has played only tackle so far but
has impressed the Cowboys with his play in games. Gailey said the
team is giving Myers a look at end because they want to find a way
to get him on the field. Brett Williams will also compete with
Myers behind Pittman, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Myers can do that, we've got a bonus because we've got some
inside guys,'' Gailey said. ``He's got a first-step quickness and
he makes plays in games. When a guy makes plays in games, we are
going to try to get him on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who was ineligible for his senior season at Alabama
because of dealings with an agent, played both end and tackle in
college. &QL; 
TICKETS ON SALE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for Cowboys home games go on sale at 10 a.m. tomorrow at
all Ticketmaster outlets and Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets can be charged by phone at (214) 373-8000 or (972)

LIVENT SAYS ACCOUNTING WOES MAY CUT NET WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new managers at Livent Inc., the producer of
Broadway shows, said Wednesday that the company's accounting woes
could significantly reduce its already slender net worth.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than a week of speculation and questions, the
company's five-page statement Wednesday gave few new details to
help unravel the mystery surrounding the suspension of the
company's founders, Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, from their
executive positions last week.
</P>
<P>
   The new managers, headed by Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood
power broker, said they still could not estimate the value of the
accounting irregularities that they said they unearthed last week.
Better financial estimates of those problems, they said, may not be
available until late October, when an internal investigation is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the statement, the new managers tried to reassure
investors and theatergoers, saying the financial problems would not
affect the company's current shows or the productions planned for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spoken with all of our partners in our major creative
and business projects,'' said Roy Furman, the company's new chief
executive, ``and we don't expect any of these projects to be
delayed by the recently discovered irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied any wrongdoing. But they say
that they cannot respond further since the company has not given
them details of the allegations. Drabinsky ``believes that it is
inappropriate to respond to rumors and speculations,'' his
spokesman said Wednesday. ``As the facts emerge, he will be in a
better position to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's statement, management said that the company was
now technically in default of its bond agreements. But executives
said that they believed those problems could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the accounting problems are likely to reduce
significantly the company's shareholders' equity of $46 million.
And, while executives earlier had said that the problems dated back
to the beginning of 1996, they said Wednesday that earlier years
may also be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that the irregularities relate to both the
understatement of expenses and the overstatement of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Management said the company may also have to take further
write-downs _ amounts that would come directly off the company's
bottom line _ that do not stem from the irregularities discovered
last week. Earlier this spring, the new management had assured
investors when it announced the most recent $20 million write-down
that there would be no more surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The assets being written down relate mostly to musicals that
have closed. As regular accounting practice, the company does not
immediately expense a show's costs like advertising, stage sets and
costumes. Instead, it capitalizes those costs and gradually
amortizes them over the show's run, which the company estimates
will be five years.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have long criticized the company for that
practice, saying that many of the capitalized expenses should have
long ago reduced the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the company was eager to promote its
successful productions, and the release painted an optimistic
picture of its long-term future. Furman, who left his Wall Street
investment banking firm to become Livent's chief executive, said:
``We are even more optimistic than when we first arrived in June
about the strength of our current slate of shows, our development
projects and our ability to forge new relationships.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among other potential moneymakers, the company cited a North
American touring company of ``Ragtime,'' now booked into the year
2000. However, there are questions about that tour. The Vancouver
production of ``Ragtime'' was closed prematurely at the end of
July, a decision that a company spokeswoman said was made ``for
good financial reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to the latest figures supplied to Variety, the
entertainment trade paper, ``Ragtime,'' which was close to sold out
in New York, was playing to considerably less than full houses in
both Washington and Winnipeg last week.
</P>
<P>
   And though the company had high hopes for the success of its
``Showboat'' abroad, it has recently said that the London
production, which opened on April 28, would close in late
September. An Australian production of ``Showboat'' is also closing
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance'' is currently playing
in Toronto, but the theater, which Variety reported took in
$344,831 last week, has not sold out despite good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman for Livent claimed that he did not know
where Variety got the numbers. But Variety numbers are typically
supplied by personnel connected with the show. Livent owns both the
theatres and the production.
</P>
<P>
   The company also took pains to assure Wall Street that a number
of the projects in development would go forward. Those include
``The Sweet Smell of Success,'' with director Nick Hynter, author
John Guare and composer Marvin Hamlisch, as well as a Canadian tour
of ``Phantom of The Opera,'' though the show is an aging one that
has toured North America repeatedly with multiple companies since
it opened in 1988.

SEVENTH TV NETWORK TO MAKE DEBUT AGAINST VALLEY BACKDROP

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- By the end of this month, Americans will have a
new view of the San Fernando Valley: from their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   When Pax Network launches the nation's seventh TV network at
noon Aug. 31, it will be with a sweeping view of the suburban
Valley and the proclamation ``Live from Universal Studios
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus will begin ``Great Day America,'' the family-oriented
Pax Network's first show -- a feel-good spin on entertainment,
current events and upbeat ``news use you can use'' such as cooking
demonstrations, personal finance and home improvement.

   To make its first show a go, Pax is scrambling to convert the
Roman Noodle restaurant -- which was serving meals as recently as
last weekend -- into a TV studio. Its key feature will be two large
glass walls that allow park visitors to peer in during tapings.
</P>
<P>
   The show's look has been designed to evoke the feel of NBC's
``Today'' show, with its signature location on the corner of the
ground floor of New York City's Rockefeller Center, said producer
and co-host Michael Young. The main interview set of ``Great Day
America'' will be backed by a panoramic view of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Shows, which will start with a rooftop shot of the ``Great Day
America'' studio with the Valley in the background, will likely
draw as many as 500 park visitors outside the TV studio. The audio
portion of the broadcast will be piped outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Universal is the perfect location,'' Young said.
``It's right in the middle of where everyone lives in Los Angeles
and it's a place that attracts a lot of families on vacation, so
it's not going to be strictly people from Los Angeles. There are a
lot of regulations we have to adhere to because it's a theme park,
but what we get back will be something we couldn't have gotten
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax's new studio underscores the continuing boom in the Valley
specifically and the Los Angeles region generally, said Stephanie
Hershey-Liner, vice president of the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of new production space in former warehouses,
but this is the first time I recall that anyone's converted a
restaurant,'' she said. ``Every studio's been expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, work began on converting the dining area to the three
sets -- an interview area, a demonstration set and the anchor desk.
Roman Noodle's serving line will be used for the waiting area, or
green room, and dressing room, while the kitchen will become the
control room.
</P>
<P>
   Young foresees ``Great Day America'' as a ``town forum'' for Pax
with unscripted interactions with park visitors and comments from
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than merely report the news, the program will be
oriented toward an attitude of, Here's what you can do about it,''
he said. ``For example, if we had a show on the day of President
Clinton's statement about Monica Lewinsky, we might include
something about how do you explain this to your children.''
</P>
<P>
   After its opening day special Aug. 31, ``Great Day America''
will air live at 5 p.m. on the East Coast and 4 p.m. in the Central
time zone, and will be rebroadcast at 5 p.m. on the West Coast with
occasional live inserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a significant audience at that time of day
that does not want blood and guts,'' Young said. ``One of our
slogans is `We'll tell you what's right with the world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pax founder Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson has pledged that the network,
which will be made up mostly of stations now broadcasting
infomercials, will be free of ``excessive violence and gratuitous
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax, part of Paxson Communications Corp., will launch with 88 TV
stations covering 70 percent of the nation's markets. Locally, the
network will air on the Channel 30 slot on many cable systems with
wholesome fare such as reruns of ``Dave's World,'' ``Touched by an
Angel'' and ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'' and original programming
such as ``Flipper: The New Adventures'' and ``It's a Miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Day America,'' which will air for an hour each day, will
be going up mostly against newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we can establish ourselves as being the
pre-eminent family channel, much like MTV is for music or ESPN is
for sports,'' said programming veteran Jeff Sagansky, president and
chief executive officer of Pax.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky, the former co-president of Sony Pictures Entertainment
and president of CBS Entertainment (where he helped create
``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Dr. Quinn''), joined up with Paxson
in May. ``I think it's very important to create a strong brand and
a promise of what you are and what you're not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, who made his fortune by creating the Home Shopping
Network, decided last year to launch Pax as an upbeat alternative
to the six existing networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB. He
has promised that Pax will be profitable within four months.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Young, a broadcast veteran who won an Emmy for ABC's ``Kids Are
People Too,'' proposed the idea for ``Great Day America'' to Paxson
in January at a launch party for Pax in Florida. ``I told him, `You
need a show like this to reflect the personality of the network,'
'' Young recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The format that we're using is tried and true,'' he added.
``We know that people want information given in a way that feels
comfortable and familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Young planned to broadcast from the Universal
CityWalk entertainment center next to the theme park, but Universal
officials suggested Roman Noodle might offer a better solution if
Pax could wait until late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The move to build the studio, which will employ about 30 people,
will add to Universal's position as the largest home to production
space in the entertainment industry. The studio already operates 36
stages with 370,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Projects such as ``Great Day America'' have helped maintain
entertainment production at impressive levels. A recent study by
the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley showed a 30
percent gain between 1992 and 1996 in entertainment production
spending in the Valley, to $6.44 billion, and demand for more
programming is spurring the construction of additional production
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment industry continues to be an important
component of the economy,'' said Steve Lew, a Universal executive
and an alliance board member. ``The need for more production helps
to create more jobs.''

<P>
   Tyson merits a shot &QL; 
at more humiliation
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SO now Mike Tyson is returning to Nevada to apply for the
reinstatement of his boxing license because, after all, it is the
proper place, the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   And the cow jumped over the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely truth is that the sudden change of venue had
more to do with New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman's impersonation
of Tyson, chewing on the ear of state boxing chairman Larry Hazzard
for his willingness to be used as a facilitator to get the sport's
most famous carnivore back into the ring as soon as possible,
preferably at one of Atlantic City's hungry casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's newest tapeworm/adviser, Shelly Finkel, had originally
gone to New Jersey for approval because word had it that the
powers-that-be in Nevada _ site of the June 1997 Evander Holyfield
buffet _ were prepared to rebuff his man, mainly on the grounds it
would be bad for the image of Las Vegas, which on the meter of
cheap and tawdry affairs these days falls just short of the White
House and the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects political correctness being behind Gov. Whitman's
sudden interest and intervention into the fight game, a sleazy
business that has pumped millions of tax dollars into her state's
coffers and never been given the bum's rush, though numerous bums
have certainly been rushed into the ring. Or maybe it was Tyson's
outburst of obscenities during a July 29 licensing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada unlikely to say no
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Nevada is now where the legal battle will be fought,
along with the comeback bouts of Tyson. And by the way, shouldn't
his first fight be against Liz Taylor _ Man-eater vs. Man-eater?
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt the Nevada commission will eventually give
Tyson permission to fight. After all, there are thousands of hotel
rooms to fill out in the desert, and nothing does that like the
scent of blood in the air, which seems a certainty as long as Tyson
continues to treat his rivals as hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will then rapidly heat to a boil as the cry will come
that Tyson should never be allowed back in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Why? To keep the fine, gentlemanly activity of boxing pure?
</P>
<P>
   This is a sport where, at the heavyweight level, the object is
to beat the other man senseless. It is also a bottom-feeding
business, where the movers and shakers would drown kittens on
pay-per-view television if they thought there was a buck in it.
Thus, there is a place for the Don Kings and the Tysons of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   King is simply the latest in a long line of con artists who have
manipulated the sweet science to their own larcenous ends. There
once was a manager named Jack Hurley. When a low-life acquaintance
bragged that he had just rolled a drunk for $400, Hurley rolled his
eyes in scorn. ``You're an amateur,'' he chastised. ``You should go
right back now and put $200 back in his pockets. When he wakes up,
he'll just think he blew the $200. I mean, he'll think, `Why would
somebody rob me and leave $200?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is the history of boxing. So, too, are names like Sonny
Liston and Leon Spinks, predecessors to Tyson, stepping out of a
shadowy world straight off the streets and ascending to the rank of
heavyweight champion, where they provided amusement for the
celebrity and monied set until they took too many beatings and
their brains were scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   Terror of old is history
</P>
<P>
   To ban Tyson now would be like handing out punishment in prisons
for bad behavior. Redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a convicted rapist, unrepentant. He is antisocial and
still out of control, as evidenced by the explosion during the New
Jersey hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Why keep Tyson out of the ring now, when assaulting Desiree
Washington and beating his ex-wife, Robin Givens (``the best punch
I ever threw,'' he once said), were not enough to turn off the
public? When they start charging $39.95 for his comeback fight on
pay-per-view, the phone lines will ring.
</P>
<P>
   There are many who still want _ and expect _ to see the young
monster who worked his way up the heavyweight ranks by annihilating
opponents in the space of 90 seconds. That boxer hasn't fought
since 1988 against Michael Spinks. That man no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is 32 now. Older, not wiser or better. He spent two years
in jail. He has fought just six times in the past seven years, 22
rounds total. A shell of his former self, having rejected the
managers and handlers who helped make him invincible, he is
unchanged, still angry at the world and wanting one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   So why not give it to him? In a boxing ring with Holyfield.
After all, isn't a good beating one of the few things a bully can
understand?

INTERNET USERS VIEW HEART BYPASS SURGERY OF TEXAS WOMAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Includes update on condition of woman) 
 
By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Upstaged by a Seattle surgeon in a bid to perform the
first open-heart surgery live on the Internet, Dr. Denton Cooley
declared the quadruple bypass he performed on a Houston-area woman
a success because of its educational value.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, we wouldn't let people see what we were doing
(in the operating room),'' Cooley said. ``Some people have a
burning curiosity to know what we do. It's astounding to me that
this is available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The curious numbered in the millions, said Web Golinkin,
chairman of America's Health Network, which broadcast the operation
live on the Internet and cable television. A final tally of
``hits'' on the Internet has yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The audio remained clear throughout the broadcast although there
were a few glitches in the video.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley and Golinkin announced last week that the surgery would
take place Wednesday at the Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to stimulate Providence Seattle Medical Center
to move up a scheduled Internet surgery to Monday, said hospital
spokesman Serge Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we found out about Dr. Cooley's plans last week, we
decided to seize the opportunity,'' he said. ``We did one on Monday
as a test run.''
</P>
<P>
   That broadcast was not advertised and only hospital personnel
saw it, Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert Lazzara of the Seattle hospital performed two
coronary artery bypass procedures Tuesday, Gregory said. Because
the hospital made the public aware of this one, ``we think 7,500
people viewed the first (Tuesday) procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Houston physicians were ready for
thousands, if not millions of viewers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley's assistant, Dr. J. Michael Duncan, began the procedure
on 48-year-old Rena Fluker of nearby Pasadena at 1:07 p.m., CDT.
After nearly an hour of preparatory work opening the chest and
removing the artery and vein to be used in the bypass procedure, he
gave way to Cooley. The two finished the operation in a little more
than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday that Fluker was ``doing
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 570,000 coronary artery bypass operation are expected
to be performed in the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Fluker's husband, Jerry, said he hoped the broadcast would help
people better understand heart disease and the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't look at it today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he said, had the patient been someone other than his
wife of 32 years, he might have wanted to view the procedure. He
hopes the operation will give the couple many more years together.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Larimore of America's Health Network narrated the
surgery and interviewed the surgeons as the operation proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Larimore explained the activities of the surgeons as they
performed each task, but he also had to provide ``filler'' comments
much like that of sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   He said Rena Fluker, the mother of three, was a diabetic,
somewhat overweight and had a family history of heart disease
before she was diagnosed with clogged coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The first symptoms were shortness of breath during exertion, her
husband Jerry Fluker told Larimore during a broadcast interview.
Then she began to suffer a feeling of pressure in her chest. At
that point, she sought care at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery went smoothly until Cooley came to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, a major blood carrier to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said the clogged artery was no bigger than a piece of
kite string. It took longer than he expected to remove some of the
material and prepare the blood vessel so that the mammary artery
could be used to bypass the clogged portion.
</P>
<P>
   Larimore said he hoped the operation would emphasize the
importance and value of heart disease prevention, as well as
informing people about the most common procedure to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said he was not concerned that millions of people were
peeking over his shoulder. ``I was worried more about the patient's
welfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like to see more such procedures as long as
they are done in a manner that is respectful of the patient's
privacy and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old surgeon, who performed the nation's first
successful heart transplant in 1968, admitted he is not
particularly computer savvy and does not surf the Internet. ``But I
plan to become more knowledgeable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Seattle surgeon, Cooley grinned. ``I don't want to be
critical. It's part of human nature to want to be first.''

L.A. COUNTY RETAIL SALES FELL OFF LAST YEAR TO MIRROR '90s TREND 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Retail sales in Los Angeles County fell behind
those of richer neighbors and the state as a whole in 1997,
continuing a trend that has plagued the region in the 1990s and
signaling that consumers may still be feeling the aftermath of the
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well below the surrounding areas,'' said Tom Lieser,
executive director of the UCLA Anderson Business Forecasting
Project in Los Angeles. ``The county is losing out in terms of
regional growth in sales.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, retail sales in Los Angeles rose 3.7 percent to $55
billion, compared with a 7.8 percent increase in Orange County to
$21 billion and a 5.6 percent gain for Ventura County to $4.9
billion, according to preliminary figures from the California Board
of Equalization. For the state, retail sales -- which exclude
business-to-business sales and sales of construction materials --
rose 5.6 percent to $217 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recession was deeper in Los Angeles and the recovery was a
little slower,'' said Jeff Reynolds, statistics manager for the
state Board of Equalization, which collects taxable sales figures.
``Southern California as a whole has lagged the Bay Area in overall
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   An overdependence on the defense industry crippled Los Angeles
in the early 1990s, as the national economy shifted gears at the
end of the Cold War. The county has since struggled to diversify
and pull itself out of the slump.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the entertainment industry and international
trade have lifted the local economy, but these two sectors might be
slowing down. Hollywood isn't making as many movies, and the Asian
crisis has hurt trade with the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, homeowners had to contend with sliding real estate
values in much of this decade, further hurting consumer spending,
Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Los Angeles had to pull out of a deeper recession than did
other regions, its effect on consumer spending was more severe.
Therefore, it's not surprising that Los Angeles did not show the
strong rebound of other areas, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the weaker growth is a shift in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Economic Development Corp. in
Los Angeles, believes there is some sales ``leakage'' to other
regions, with residents flocking to places such as the outlet
stores in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Camarillo Premium Outlets has seen more customers from
Los Angeles as it expanded its shopping center. So far this year,
customer traffic is up more than 50 percent from a year ago, said
Michelle Rothstein, vice president of marketing at parent company
Chelsea GCA Realty in Roseland, N.J. The mall did not track figures
in 1996 and could not supply a comparison for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major part of our advertising is in Los Angeles,'' she said.
``We draw from a wider radius since people don't visit outlet
centers as often.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser also believes the lower per-capita income in Los Angeles
County -- $25,402 in 1997, compared with those of Ventura and
Orange counties, at $30,264 and $27,197, respectively -- could have
depressed sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the recovering real estate market last year also
hurt consumer spending. Kyser said consumers who bought homes were
left without as much discretionary income to spend on other things.
</P>
<P>
   But Kyser and Lieser don't believe the local economy is
weakening. They cite the lower unemployment figure of 6.1 percent
in July and thousands of new jobs the county continues to add.
Retail sales figures are important, but by itself it's not the
definitive report card on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one economic indicator among many,'' Lieser said.

KERKORIAN TO RAISE STAKE IN MGM WITH $389 MILLION DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Kirk Kerkorian, capping weeks of speculation
about the future of the troubled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio,
announced he will boost his stake to 89.6 percent in a $389 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian, who has owned MGM for most of the last three decades,
will pay $24 a share for Seven Network's 24.6 percent stake,
representing a premium of 32 percent to Wednesday's closing stock
price. MGM shares, depressed by recent disclosures of a bleak
outlook, rose 19 percent by gaining $2.875 to $18.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian and the Australian broadcaster bought the fabled
studio in 1996 for $1.3 billion. Seven, suffering from financial
problems, had been expected to bail out after refusing to
participate in an impending rights offering and said Wednesday its
funds could be better used in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been trying to decipher Kerkorian's motives
since Aug. 6, when he announced MGM was holding talks with
unidentified buyers, believed to be Burbank-based Walt Disney Co.
and News Corp. Arthur Rockwell, a Drake &AMP; Co. analyst and former
MGM executive, declared: ``This means MGM is back in business. It
shows Kirk believes in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the buyout talks were held to demonstrate to Seven
head Kerry Stokes that there were no immediate buyers for MGM.
</P>
<P>
   MGM also said Wednesday it will double the value of the rights
offering, which allows shareholders to buy discounted stock, to
$500 million. Barry Hyman, analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,
said Wednesday's deal may be the first step toward a sale of the
entire studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confusing part is why he was willing to pay $24 a share
(to Seven Network),'' Hyman said. ``It may be a statement that
MGM's available at that price.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors have demanded a sample of President
Clinton's genetic material to establish forensic proof that his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky was sexual, a lawyer familiar
with the request said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted to a federal grand jury Monday that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr strongly suggests
that the FBI crime lab has determined that a dress turned over to
prosecutors by Ms. Lewinsky contained DNA evidence of a sexual
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's team had believed that the results of genetic testing
on the dress were moot after the president's admission in his
testimony, as well as by a brief speech he gave later, on Monday
night, calling the relationship ``not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior presidential adviser said Clinton's lawyers would not
challenge Starr's request. White House press secretary Mike McCurry
said any sample could be obtained from tissue samples stored at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, where Clinton undergoes annual physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The request became public a day before Ms. Lewinsky, who was
said by friends t feel hurt by the president's terse public
description of their relationship, is scheduled to appear for a
second time before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's request suggested that he is determined to learn the
specific nature of the physical contact between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky, presumably in an effort to find inconsistencies between
Clinton's and Ms. Lewinsky's accounts and to establish whether he
committed perjury in his deposition in the Paula Jones case when he
denied having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his advisers believe that such an effort could work to
the president's political benefit as Congress weighs conducting
impeachment hearings. They say it could make prosecutors look
sex-obsessed, even as most Americans tell pollsters that they
already know more than they would like about lies, betrayal, and
sexual indiscretion at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A careful vagueness about his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky is
central to the president's legal and political strategy, his
advisers say, since it may help deflect a possible perjury charge
while also walling off seamy details from an already queasy public.
Clinton was even more vague in his four-minute address Monday night
than in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to give prosecutors a detailed description of
his physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, after reading a statement
admitting an inappropriate relationship at the beginning of his
four-hour testimony. Starr has been seeking to determine if Clinton
committed perjury in January, when he denied any sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in a deposition in the Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Clinton argued that the type of
relationship he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the definition of
sex used by the Jones lawyers. Although he rebuffed prosecutors'
questions about his sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky, he did answer
a series of questions about what types of sex he considered to be
covered by that definition, one Clinton adviser said Wednesday. The
president said that oral sex, among other acts, was not covered by
the definition, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser to Clinton said that he did not acknowledge
having oral sex or any other type of specific sexual contact with
Ms. Lewinsky, instead referring prosecutors back to his initial
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over and over, he said, `I've already said that it was
improper,''' said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That speech was watched by 67.6 million people, Nielsen Media
Research said Wednesday. Some 53 million viewers watched his far
longer State of the Union Message, delivered shortly after Clinton
was first accused of having an affair with Ms. Lewinsky and
covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers have said that Clinton answered every question
put to him that did not deal with sex. That position is also
central to the president's political defense. If Starr demands
further testimony, the president's team would like to be able to
argue that prosecutors are intent on grilling him only about
intimate matters. ``We want to make the argument that Starr's
investigation is just about sex,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, did not agree to extend
his testimony more than a few minutes beyond the four-hour time
limit, even though prosecutors had more questions. Starr said that
he might subpoena Clinton for further testimony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not confirm the request for samples of
Clinton's genetic material from Starr's office. It released a
two-sentence statement: ``On Monday night the president
acknowledged an improper relationship and apologized for that. The
president also said it's time to reclaim his privacy, and we will
respect that by not commenting on every leak generated by this
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Lewinsky prepared to testify, she was said by friends to
be unhappy about Clinton's speech. Ms. Lewinsky, her friends and
associates said, was dismayed to hear what she regarded as an
18-month, emotional relationship with Clinton, which included gifts
of poetry and neckties, acknowledged as merely an inappropriate
dalliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an older man who made all the instances and
references to a younger woman that this relationship was not just
about sex,'' one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told friends that she was trying to protect the
president when she signed the affidavit falsely in January that she
had not had a sexual relationship. And in the seven months since,
Ms. Lewinsky has been ``profoundly disappointed'' that the White
House has quietly attempted to smear her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's friends said that she had always intended to tell
the truth before the grand jury, so her feelings would have no
impact on her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Since the president acknowledged an improper relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky on Monday night, White House advisers and prominent
Democrats have been disclosing their wounded feelings over the
intimate revelations of recent days. Some appear to be bidding for
publicly sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Others are just downright mad. Among them is Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who said Tuesday that her trust in Clinton's
credibility had been ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days just after the Lewinsky accusations were disclosed
last January, Clinton sought to reassure Senator Feinstein by
privately telling her that Ms. Lewinsky had had to be transferred
from the White House because she was fantasizing about him, and
``on the verge of stalking him,'' a person close to Ms. Feinstein
said Wednesday. Friends said that helped explain Ms. Feinstein's
strong statement of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   On vacation at a borrowed Martha's Vineyard estate, Clinton
celebrated his 52nd birthday Wednesday night with Vernon Jordan,
his friend and confidant. It was the first extended time that the
two men and their families spent together since Jordan was
subpoenaed by Starr to explain his role late last year in helping
Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York. He has denied any effort to
help hide her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president awoke Wednesday to calls for his resignation from
some editorialists and Republican congressmen. His advisers
dismissed such statements as the chattering of Washington elites,
saying that the public had heard more than it wanted to hear about
the Lewinsky investigation, and was anxious for the federal
government to turn to matters of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Some allies of the president said Starr was trying to make
crimes of private indiscretions. ```I think the criminalization of
bad sexual judgment is something we ought not to be doing,'' said
James Carville, the president's former campaign manager. ``It's
just loony.''

EDITORIAL: THE RENO WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 20:
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton's reputation for integrity continues to
plummet, Attorney General Janet Reno seems to be thinking about
salvaging hers by appointing an independent counsel. Aides say that
within the next few days she will complete her review of an
exhaustive report in which her chief prosecutor for campaign
finance irregularities, Charles La Bella, argues for naming an
independent prosecutor to investigate White House fund-raising
during 1996. Such an appointment is 18 months overdue, but it is
encouraging to see news reports that Reno is at least lurching in
the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is responding to the report in her own
peculiar way, of course. La Bella, who has returned to his job as
acting U.S. attorney in San Diego, apparently recommended
appointment of a counsel with a broad mandate to look into all
aspects of campaign fund-raising. The Washington Post and The Wall
Street Journal reported that Reno was thinking about a narrower
inquiry by an independent counsel, focusing on former deputy White
House chief of staff Harold Ickes or the telephone solicitations by
Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But until she turns the whole matter over to a prosecutor with
broad authority, Reno will continue to be seen as a law enforcement
official who puts party loyalty above the law. One reason is that
trying to contain an investigation of the Democrats' sprawling and
reckless money machine is like trying to keep puppies in a basket.
Something keeps popping out.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the report by David Johnston in today's Times. It says
that investigators have found a 1995 memo suggesting that Gore may
have known that some of the money raised in calls from his office
would go directly into the re-election fund. If the memo says that,
of course, it blasts to pieces Reno's excuse that the phone calls
were not illegal because Gore thought he was raising ``soft money''
for purposes of maintaining the party rather than ``hard money''
going directly to campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to campaign law, Reno has been full of ideas that
do not conform with the federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 or
the Independent Counsel Act. For example, she has clung to the
notion that she can investigate her own boss. Both La Bella and
Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, have told her that the law
requires her to step aside. She also invented a theory of ``soft
money'' that validated the White House practice of using such funds
for campaign ads. Her interpretation effectively erased the
spending limits in the Campaign Finance Act. An independent counsel
would almost certainly have a less tolerant attitude toward the ad
campaigns planned by Clinton, Ickes and other key aides in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unfair and incomplete to focus the investigation
solely on Ickes, Gore or any other single individual. That could be
regarded as nothing other than a scam to avoid getting at the more
serious questions of whether the Clinton campaign bartered
presidential audiences or policy decisions for contributions. A
narrowly focused inquiry could miss the towering problem of how so
much illegal foreign money, possibly including Chinese government
contributions, got into Democratic accounts. It might also miss the
Republicans' use of soft money in ads for former Sen. Robert Dole.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, we are heartened by reports that Reno is thinking
about doing what the law requires of her. We urge her not to take
the time-consuming step of invoking the 90-day ``preliminary
investigation'' allowed under the Independent Counsel Act. In some
cases that is appropriate. But the La Bella report, Freeh's advice
and the 18-month investigation conducted by her own staff all show
that it is time for an independent counsel to get to work right
now.

GREEN URGES CUTS IN DEFENSE TO PAY FOR SOCIAL PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Green, a Democratic Senate candidate, called
Wednesday for substantial cuts in Pentagon spending over the next
five years, saying the nation was wasting money on defense that
should instead go to school construction, health care for children
and other domestic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Green, the New York City public advocate and one of the three
major Democratic candidates seeking to challenge Republican Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato this fall, asserted that the Pentagon was relying
on an outdated view of the world in determining the nation's
defense needs.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Green disputed the assumption that the nation
should be prepared to wage simultaneous wars in two theaters, now a
core component of the Pentagon's military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to an organization of young Democrats, Green
asserted that his defense cuts would not jeopardize national
security. He estimated that they would save $100 billion over the
next five years that could go to rebuilding schools, connecting
classrooms to the Internet, providing children with health
insurance and other spending programs he has proposed during this
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Green urged an end to the Trident D-5 missile program and the
F-22, the Air Force's new attack fighter jet. He also said the
Pentagon should abandon continuing efforts to construct a national
anti-missile program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we waste $100 billion on Pentagon spending that buys
us no real security, or, on the other hand, invest it in children,
does not appear to be a very difficult proposition,'' Green said at
a breakfast sponsored by Democratic Leadership for the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
   Green's speech signaled his latest, and most direct, effort to
court what has historically been the heart of the Democratic
primary electorate: liberal voters. Green moved again to draw a
contrast with both of his major Democratic opponents _ Geraldine
Ferraro, the former congresswoman from Queens, and Rep. Charles
Schumer of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato had no comment Wednesday on Green's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Ms. Ferraro and Schumer said they supported cuts in
defense spending, but not necessarily as extensive as those
proposed by Green.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign manager, Josh Isay, said Schumer supported
the Trident missile but wanted an end to the anti-missile defense
program.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro's press secretary, Stephen Gaskill, said that Ms.
Ferraro supported cuts in defense spending, but he was unable to
say whether she favored the specific measures proposed by Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of a post-Cold War world is that we can afford to
cut more from the defense budget,'' Gaskill said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In making his proposal, Green took a position that put him at
odds with the broad consensus of Republicans and many Democrats in
Washington. There has been no discussion in Congress about reducing
defense spending, certainly along the lines Green suggested, and
Pentagon spending has been held essentially flat since the end of
the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, there have been calls among prominent
Republicans and conservative Democrats to increase military
spending, most likely starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Green's strategy, which is to a large extent shaped by the fact
that he does not have the money to afford television
advertisements, is not without its risks. In calling so directly
for cutting defense to finance social programs, it allows D'Amato,
in a general election campaign, to attack Green as a liberal, a
strategy that the Republican incumbent has employed in past
campaigns, including in 1986, when D'Amato defeated Green in
winning his second term.
</P>
<P>
   The defense budget this year is $271 billion. Green said his
proposed cuts totaled $100 billion over five years, though his
opponents said that his figure was inflated.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 billion figure would translate into $20 billion a year
for each of the next five years, or about 7 percent at the current
rate of spending. &QL;

IRWIN SUALL, 73, INVESTIGATOR FOR ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irwin Suall, who for three decades headed undercover
investigations of groups regarded as inimical to Jews on behalf of
the Anti-Defamation League, died Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from emphysema, said his son, Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Suall _ pronounced SOO-ell _ joined the staff of the
Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, in 1967
with the title of national director of fact-finding. He held that
title into the 1990s and retired last year from the league's
headquarters at U.N. Plaza in Manhattan. He then served for some
months as a consultant to the league.
</P>
<P>
   He was an expert on neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and other
extremist organizations. As Suall put it, the Anti-Defamation
League's inquiries into extremism and extremists entailed ``turning
over the rocks'' under which they hid and ``exposing them to the
light of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 letter to The New York Times, replying to critics'
contention that the Anti-Defamation League had ignored the
right-wing fringe, he and a colleague wrote that most of Suall's
``life work with the Anti-Defamation League has been spent
combating the racists, anti-Semites and extremists of the far
right,'' and ``our organization's refusal to distort the facts has
made it a credible source of information and analysis for the
press, the public, academic researchers and law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 interview, Suall said of the book ``The Turner
Diaries,'' an explicitly racist and anti-Semitic work by William
Pierce, who published it under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald:
```The Turner Diaries' is probably the most widely read single book
among far-right extremists. They get out of it a notion of how to
achieve what they've sought all along: how to conduct an American
revolution, how to overthrow the present government and replace it
with an Aryan republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Anti-Defamation League has brought out many
publications reporting about organizations that it regarded as
opposed to democracy, to Jews or to both. These organizations have
also included the Nation of Islam and other black groups, Arab
groups opposed to Israel, and numerous leftist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Suall talked in a very deliberate way and could be combative.
His son recalled Wednesday that ``he was this tough and disciplined
political guy _ who left the house every day with peanuts in his
pockets to feed the squirrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Suall was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, grew up in
Brownsville, in Brooklyn, and graduated from Samuel Tilden High
School in Brooklyn. He attended Brooklyn College for two years and
then served in the Merchant Marine for about three years, beginning
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In his Merchant Marine years, Suall had a formative experience
during a stay in Shanghai, China. He saw the squalor that Jewish
refugees were living in there. The sight spurred in him pity _ and
wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Suall went on to study at Oxford University on a Fulbright
scholarship and received a bachelor's degree in political science
there in in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he returned to New York and was successively, among other
things, education and organization director of the International
Ladies Garment Workers Union, national secretary of the Socialist
Party-Social Democratic Federation _ headed by Norman Thomas _ and
public relations director of the Jewish Labor Committee before
joining the staff of the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   His many writings included a study of partisans of the extreme
right, ``The American Ultras'' (1962).
</P>
<P>
   Suall married Sarah Mountain in 1949 in England. She died in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son, Mark, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Suall liked to tell the story of what happened one evening,
while he was a young man, when he and the writer James Baldwin went
out drinking in Greenwich Village. One of the bars they went to
refused to serve Baldwin because he was black and gay, Suall said.
So the two men left the bar and made placards protesting the bar's
policy. And they took the placards and picketed the bar for a time,
even though there was snow on the sidewalk.

 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since Trimble's Whiskey erected the first neon
sign there nearly a century ago, Times Square has been New York's
glowing, pulsating marketplace for everything from steam irons to
video cameras, Camels to Calvins. Now, though, it is beginning to
hawk a very different kind of product: the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of those advertisers _ at least in terms of neon
acreage _ will be the Nasdaq market, which is waging an upstart
campaign to overtake the New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq recently
signed a deal to build the largest single sign in Times Square: a
$15 million, multimedia kaleidoscope of stock tickers, video
screens and colorful billboards that will festoon the cylindrical
tower of the building now rising at the southeast corner of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   The sign will be big _ roughly the size of three basketball
courts _ but it will hardly be alone. Times Square will soon be a
visual metaphor for the way the stock market _ news about it, talk
about it, anxiety about it _ seems to pervade life these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq sign, on the skyscraper known as the Conde Nast
building, will stand directly across the street from Dow Jones'
electronic zipper, which encircles the signpost tower at 1 Times
Square. That, in turn, is directly across the street from where
Reuters will hang a series of electronic signs on its new U.S.
headquarters, at Seventh Avenue and 42nd St.
</P>
<P>
   And those three signs will be only five blocks south of three
157-foot-long stock and financial information zippers that strut
across the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter building, at 1585 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a shootout in Times Square between Nasdaq,
Reuters, Morgan Stanley and Dow Jones,'' said George Stonbely,
president of Spectacolor Communications, the electronic sign
company that designed the giant Kodak, Hertz and AT&AMP;T signs on the
face of the Marriott Marquis hotel, at Broadway and 47th Street.
``They're all talking about mega-hardware on the outside of their
buildings. It's going to be funny to see so much financial
information in Times Square, instead of a Coke bottle or a can of
Planters peanuts. Someone who hasn't been here in many years is
going to think they're in the wrong place.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks and bonds are certainly a far cry from the products that
were traditionally hawked on the district's billboards and neon
signs, like Maytag washers, Wrigley's Spearmint Chewing Gum and
Trimble's Whiskey, which was depicted on that first neon sign in
1904.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous billboard of all was the Camel cigarette sign,
designed by sign specialist Douglas Leigh, which blew rings of
steam over Broadway between 1941 and 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But with Times Square now the symbol of New York's resurgence,
it is fitting that the businesses fueling that boom _ finance,
along with media and entertainment _ should be jostling for space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square has always been a little bit ahead of the game in
displaying the rawest edge of commercialization of our society,''
said Thomas Bender, a history professor at New York University.
``It makes sense that Wall Street should display itself on the
biggest public stage available at a time when we have the most open
celebration of the marketplace in history.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the changing images on the signs reflect the
changing nature of the business being done in the offices behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime entertainment district, Times Square was a logical
location for media giants like Reuters and Viacom. But the
financial services industry has become a large and growing
presence, most notably Morgan Stanley, which signed a tentative
deal last week to erect its third tower at the north end of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the financial industry, Times Square's greatest charm
is its advertising might, especially at a time when the number of
Americans who own stock has soared to 43 percent of adults, from 10
percent only two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to compete in the global marketplace, what
better place than the international crossroads of the world,'' said
David Arena, who heads Morgan Stanley's corporate real estate
department and is well aware of the estimated 20 million visitors
who pass through the square annually, not to mention the 250
million television viewers who watch the ball drop from the former
Times Tower on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the unbridled proliferation of signs in Times Square
has some people worried that the billboards will eventually all
look like undifferentiated ``wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never this much clutter, this much clamor for
attention,'' said Jason Perline, who has put up signs in Times
Square for 32 years. ``It's anybody's guess how long it'll be an
attractive media buy. Time will only tell, but I do question it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters is going to great lengths to insure that its signs will
be unique among that ``clutter,'' by hiring the designer Edwin A.
Schlossberg and by dropping plans for a zipper, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Frank Zarb, chairman of the National
Association of Stock Dealers, which owns the Nasdaq market, has
made no secret of his plans to build a world financial market that
would rival the New York Stock Exchange. The NASD has already
acquired the American Stock Exchange and may move it, together with
the association's headquarters, to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   With its giant sign and other attractions in Times Square,
Nasdaq hopes to sell itself to the public by creating a virtual
trading floor that rivals the much-televised opening bell of the
New York Stock Exchange, which is larger and better known. Unlike
the telegenic trading floors of the New York exchange, Nasdaq is an
electronic market composed mainly of telephone lines and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jones, a senior vice president at the NASD in
Washington, confirmed that Nasdaq was planning to move its
marketing operation to Times Square, but he declined to provide
details. Sign builders and real estate executives say, though, that
the NASD's board approved a 65,000-square-foot leasing deal Aug. 6
for the gigantic sign, a television studio and marketing center at
4 Times Square, at 43rd Street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives who have seen the plans said the Nasdaq
marketing operation would move from an obscure berth on the ninth
floor of 33 Whitehall St. in lower Manhattan to 4 Times Square.
There would be a broadcast studio with a curving wall of television
monitors looking out on Times Square from behind a semicircular,
two-story glass wall, where daily briefings and public stock
offerings would be announced. A public entrance would lead to the
second floor, where there would be an auditorium and interactive
displays for visitors wanting to track the progress of various
stocks. The NASD is also taking some office space.
</P>
<P>
   The huge sign itself would rise from the third story and ascend
about 125 feet, the executives said, and is expected to cost $15
million, about three times the price of Morgan Stanley's giant
electronic zippers, but only half of what Reuters may spend to
build 15,169 square feet of sophisticated, high-resolution video
signs on the side of its building.
</P>
<P>
   Though ever popular, signs in Times Square have only in recent
years generated big money. Last year, a German investment group
bought 1 Times Square for $110 million, or nearly four times the
price paid by Lehman Brothers two years earlier. The value of the
deal was in the signs, not the building. The four large signs that
climb up the front of 1 Times Square, home of the New Year's Eve
ball drop, generate more than $7 million a year in rent from
Budweiser, Nissin, ITT and Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   The current Times Square revival is in stark contrast to the
1970s, when many New Yorkers avoided the area and neon signs fell
out of fashion. By the time Leigh sold his 14 billboards in Times
Square to the Van Wagner sign company, 13 were blank. The sole
renter was Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Perline, a founder of Van Wagner, said that as hard as he tried
he could not sell space to U.S. companies because of the image of
Times Square as dowdy and dangerous. He recalled a salesman for
Philip Morris saying, ``We don't want a sign seen only by pimps and
prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Who smokes more than pimps and prostitutes?'''
Perline said. ``But it wasn't a good sales pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Wagner turned its attention to Sony's contemporaries in
Japan, emerging companies looking to make a name for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many New Yorkers, the Japanese realized that millions of
camera-laden tourists were still pouring through Times Square every
year in a kind of civic pilgrimage akin to visiting Mecca or
Lourdes. Soon Hitachi, Minolta, Konica and Fuji were pitching up
billboards and neon spectaculars in Times Square, the first step
toward becoming household words in America.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, U.S. companies did not return for another
decade, and not until the city imposed an ordinance in 1987
requiring new buildings in the Times Square district to display
oversize, bright signs on new buildings along Broadway and Seventh
Avenue. At the time, civic groups hailed the ordinance as a tool to
save Times Square, but real estate developers who were trying to
douse the bright lights and create a new office district disliked
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment bankers and lawyers don't want to work in an
environment surrounded by flashing lights,'' David Solomon, the
developer who built the Morgan Stanley building and then lost it in
the recession, said at the time. ``They want museums and sidewalk
cafes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Morgan Stanley moved into the tower in 1995, it was
reluctant to dangle bright, garish signs off the side of its
buildings. But Disney has moved onto 42nd Street, and a museum,
albeit Madame Tussaud's, is on the way, making the area more
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan Stanley has since merged with Dean Witter, providing
the investment bank with a vast retail clientele that can be
reached through the signs in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs of the '20s _ Presto steam irons and Royal
typewriters _ were about liberation from drudgery,'' said Tama
Starr, co-author of ``Signs and Wonders: The Spectacular Marketing
of America'' and president of Artkraft Strauss, a family-owned sign
maker. ``Now the signs are about the world market and the
information age.''

IT'S NO BIG SECRET: STOTTLEMYRE MUST STAND AND DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It's a company secret, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's talking.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the way I figure it: Whatever it was that Rangers
pitching coach Dick Bosman whispered in Esteban Loaiza's ear when
he arrived here from Pittsburgh, isn't it time Todd Stottlemyre
heard the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   If only it was that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman swears he hasn't told Loaiza a thing. Well, very little
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If he's using the same strategy with Stottlemyre, it might be
time for a change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   This deal was supposed to work just the opposite, remember?
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza was supposed to be the inconsistent young right-hander
coming over from Pittsburgh. He was the appetizer to Doug Melvin's
main entree of a deal, the one at the trading deadline that brought
Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce Clayton from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, son of former Yankees great Mel Stottlemyre, would
bring the bulldog attitude and strikeout persona that could make
him No. 1 in the Rangers' struggling rotation.
</P>
<P>
   So guess who's emerged as No. 1 and who's struggling to hold up
his end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers spell it out dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who faces the Yankees Friday night, is 1-2 in six starts
with a 3.79 ERA. Three times he has carried the Rangers into the
eighth inning or beyond and has yet to go less than 5 2/3. He has
fanned 31 and walked only seven in 40 1/3 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is 2-1 in three starts with a 6.89 ERA in 15 2/3
innings. He has struck out 18 and walked 15.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, without question, has been the steal, but if the Rangers
are going to win this division and have a chance to get beyond the
first round of the playoffs, Stottlemyre must be the pitcher the
Rangers thought they were getting when they sent Darren Oliver and
Fernando Tatis to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't have to be is anything more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so excited about being here and being in a pennant
race,'' Bosman said last night before the Rangers opened a 10-game
home stand against the Indians. ``He wants to do well and he's the
kind of guy who really raises it up emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Very quietly, Bosman and Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching
coach, discussed how best to keep Todd's emotions under control
while the Rangers were in New York last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like anybody else,'' Bosman said of the highly
competitive younger Stottlemyre. ``Sometimes he tries to throw the
ball past the hitter instead of just throwing it into the catcher's
mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Carlton always told me all he ever concentrated on was
the dirty spot in the middle of the glove. Todd and I had a good
session yesterday in Boston and we talked about that. I want him to
bring his curveball back into his repertoire because he hasn't been
using that very often. I want him to use his whole package and go
to the glove. I don't care who's up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's troubles here are a continuation of a stretch that
began when he strained rib cage muscles while sliding into second
base during a game with the Cardinals about two weeks before the
trading deadline. He arrived in Texas still sore but wouldn't use
the injury as an excuse not to take the mound. Now he says he's 100
percent and ready to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't run from the fact that I haven't pitched here anywhere
close to how I pitched in the first half,'' said Stottlemyre, who
starts tonight against the Indians. ``I know that the way to
impress is just to go out and be myself and no more. There's no
question that I've been trying to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to a new club that's in first place, a club trying to
win its division, and they're counting on you to do your job. Not
only are there expectations inside the clubhouse, I'm hard on
myself and I have high expectations and I haven't met those yet.
But there's still plenty of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Stottlemyre doesn't have six months to show the Rangers
what he can do. Counting tonight, he probably has another eight
starts to get it in gear and lead this team into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My delivery has gone in and out and I've been fighting that a
little bit,'' Stottlemyre said. ``But I'm working at it. It's not
like I'm going through a bad stretch and accepting it. You never
accept it. You keep working; you keep grinding. You try to identify
where the problems are and you work on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start with baby steps. My last four innings in New York
were good ones. I'll try to take those four innings and build on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Rangers can only hope it's not the beginning
of a long reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that they just don't have the time.

LOW SCORE NOT IMPORTANT TO VOGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mitch Voges makes another trip to the U.S. Amateur
Championship next week, hoping for the best while not expecting too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play almost nothing now,'' he said. ``I've played two
competitive rounds all year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1968 City Section champion from Birmingham High will
trek back to Rochester, N.Y., with the satisfaction that he has
already achieved everything he ever wanted from the game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, more than a decade after he spent six months in a body
cast recuperating from three-level spinal fusion, Voges won the
U.S. Amateur at The Honors Course in Chattanooga, Tenn., outlasting
Manny Zerman 7 &AMP; 6 in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit like that guy in `The Natural,' '' Voges
said. ``Good when he was young, then coming back when he was old
and beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked out as well for Voges as it did for the mythical Roy
Hobbs in that 1984 movie, when the aging ``Natural,'' played by
Robert Redford, hit a pennant-winning home run in the last at-bat
of his abbreviated career.
</P>
<P>
   While Voges has lower expectations for himself next week, he'll
show up at famed Oak Hill Country Club with a high appreciation of
what he has already accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if doesn't turn out well for me, it doesn't make any
difference,'' he said. ``Because I'm satisfied with my competitive
ability. All I ever wanted to do was pull the trigger a few times
when it mattered, and I was able to get that satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Voges wound up satisfied and thrilled in '91, when he overcame
100-degree heat, soaring humidity and a near early-round derailment
in match play to become the first and only San Fernando Valley
golfer to win the U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all good,'' he said of his memories of that long, hot
week. ``The best part was that I had my family with me and my (then
13-year-old) son on the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Voges trailed by three holes with four remaining early in match
play before finishing birdie-par-eagle-birdie to win 1-up in
regulation and advance. It turned out to be his toughest match in a
competition he closed out on the 11th hole of the championship
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go all the way, it takes a pretty solid game, a lot of
stamina, a lot of emotional stability,'' he said. ``It's just a
grind, so many rounds of golf. It's not just going out, playing 18
holes and going in. As soon as you think you're getting tired, it's
time to go out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Voges said the grind is matched by the difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like downhill ski racing,'' he said. ``The difference
between getting the gold and not getting anything is a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   His assured gold next week is his automatic entry, courtesy of a
10-year exemption for winning in '91.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me not playing much golf, going back there is almost
ludicrous,'' Voges said. ``I got to match play last year. That will
be a lofty goal for me this time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Million Dollar Shootout: Senior PGA star Jim Colbert has come
up with a novel idea in his campaign to raise funds to fight
prostate cancer, which he and Arnold Palmer have overcome in recent
years. The Million Dollar Shootout, scheduled for Sept. 21-26 at
Los Alamitos Racetrack, offers amateur golfers a chance _ at $1 per
shot, no limit on shots _ to win $1 million by hitting a 141-yard
hole-in-one over the Los Alamitos grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, open to amateur golfers aged 18 and over, will
be held from 1-4 p.m. at the track Sept. 21-25. The two golfers
closest to the hole on those five days will be eligible for the
Sept. 26 final.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds will benefit Senior PGA Tour For The Cure, the
fundraising and awareness program to help fight prostate cancer _
the most-frequently diagnosed cancer in the nation, with a new case
diagnosed every two and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the marketfront: Tracking the junior golf boom launched
and nourished by Tiger Woods, the nation's largest clubmaker has
introduced a line of golf clubs for children.
</P>
<P>
   Little Berthas, produced by Callaway Golf Co. of Carlsbad, are
woods and irons designed in proportion to children's bodies and
equipped with lightweight, flexible, grafite shafts. Features
include grips for smaller hands and club faces designed to
compensate for children's' swings.
</P>
<P>
   A set, including driver, 6-iron, 8-iron, wedge, putter and bag
sells for a suggested retail price of $500.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Callaway is the latest example of clubmakers testing
the growing market in junior golf. According to the National Golf
Foundation, juniors represented the biggest percentage growth in
play during 1997, when golfers aged 12-17 produced a 33.8 percent
increase over rounds played by that age group during 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Agoura-based Gripps Golf Gear introduced its line of junior
clubs in April and will have them on display at the PGA
International Golf Show next week in Las Vegas. Selling for a
suggested retail price of $139, a set of composite-shafted Gripps
clubs includes a driver, four irons and putter plus bag.
</P>
<P>
   __ Skins saver: Discount tickets are now on sale for the $1
million Skins Game, scheduled for Nov. 28-29 at Rancho La Quinta
Country Club. Season tickets purchased before Sept. 1 cost $60.
After that, the cost is $75.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Tom Lehman and three players to be announced
will compete for $300,000 in the Saturday nine holes and $700,000
on Sunday. Information: 800 914-9075.

KICK COVERAGE IN DAVIS' FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The encounter came early in training camp.
Michael Irvin saw Billy Davis' new blond haircut, and he couldn't
resist this barb: ``Why'd you think you had to go out and get a new
identity?''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to yesterday. Davis only wished his new 'do was
causing his identity crisis. Already in competition with Ernie
Mills for the starting wide receiver position opposite Irvin, Davis
learned he'd have to play more special teams this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know whether to be flattered or flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of the Cowboys' best at running down field on punts
and kickoffs, Davis said he could appreciate being needed to
solidify a unit that suffered two fumbles and was a penalty away
from allowing a punt-return touchdown against the Patriots on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis also feels that playing on fourth down will limit his
effectiveness on first, second, and third downs. So the question
that was left to be answered was this: Does the club's use of Davis
on special teams mean that the Cowboys have privately given the
first-team job to Mills?
</P>
<P>
   When asked this question before practice yesterday, Davis did
not know what to think. But no one needed to remind him that
starting wide receivers in the NFL do not play on special teams
unless they are returning kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely going to set me back as far as competing with
Ernie for the second wide receiver position,'' Davis said of
missing reps with the first team to compete on special teams. ``I
really don't know what it means. I've come to a point of where I'm
tired of figuring it out, of asking where I stand on the field.
Hey, I'm on the field, so that's what's important. Secondly, they
paid me to come in here and have an impact at wide receiver. I'm
working on that, and I'll continue working on being the best
athlete I can be to help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers coach Dwain Painter acknowledged yesterday that
Mills ``has the slight edge'' over Davis because of his experience
with the offense. But head coach Chan Gailey said nothing should be
made of Davis being asked to play more on special teams. The job
hasn't been settled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gailey said Davis will get his second start this summer
against the St. Louis Rams on Saturday _ something that was
scheduled before the preseason began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a valuable special teams guy, but he's more than a
Steve Tasker guy,'' Painter said, referring to the retired Buffalo
Bills special teamer. ``Billy is not a backup wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has more receptions than Mills (5 to 2) during the
exhibition games, but Davis acknowledges that he has done nothing
to stand out from Mills. Part of that, Davis said, is because he is
still thinking too much about Gailey's complex offense, which calls
for him to make route-running decisions on the fly. In the Cowboys'
old offense of Ernie Zampese, Davis ran to a spot and Troy Aikman's
pass was already on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to quit worrying about trying to please the coaching
staff by running the perfect route,'' Davis said. ``I just need to
be alone when the ball gets there. I've got to make plays and not
worry about anything else. And with my size and speed and strength,
I can make an impact with the ball in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' 23-yard reception against the Patriots has Cowboys
coaches thinking Davis can adapt to this offense, Painter said. The
original play called for Davis to run a 10-yard out pattern toward
the sidelines. But when the Patriots defense switched from a man to
a zone defense at the snap, Davis changed his route to a deep fade
pattern, catching Jason Garrett's pass in front of the safety to
set up the Cowboys' only score of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has made progress,'' Painter said. ``He just needs the
experience of doing things the way we do them. I have no
reservations about Billy Davis. There is a big upside to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis just hopes that side leads to a starting role.

TELEMARKETERS FACE CHARGES FOR ALLEGED LICENSING VIOLATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An investigation by a multiagency task force
culminated with criminal charges being filed against 24 people in
Los Angeles and Orange counties for allegedly operating
telemarketing businesses without proper state licenses.
</P>
<P>
   One of those companies, Internet Casino Sports Gaming of
suburban Sherman Oaks, is the target of a federal civil probe. The
defendants are accused of violating the California Telephonic
Sellers Act by not registering with the California Department of
Justice and failing to maintain a $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty is six months in jail and a $2,500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant when you fail to maintain a $100,000 bond.
These are high-grade misdemeanors,'' said Los Angeles Deputy City
Attorney Don Kass.
</P>
<P>
   The charges -- stemming from what prosecutors dubbed ``Operation
Cold Call'' -- were filed by the City Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Several involve San Fernando Valley-area companies or
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   They include Robert Duvall Matias Jr., 35, and Dianna Duvall
Matias, 30, both of Mission Hills, and Alan Lenchner, 62, of
Granada Hills, all of whom operate Internet Casino Sports Gaming.
Each is charged with two counts of failing to register the business
and failing to maintain a $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at the company declined to answer questions about
the charges Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Facing eight charges each are Dandal Aubrey Dampier, 51, of
suburban Westchester and Valda Kathleen Ray, 50, of North
Hollywood, operators of Media Capital Consultants.

   NEW YORK _ Ever since Trimble's Whiskey erected the first neon
sign there nearly a century ago, Times Square has been New York's
glowing, pulsating marketplace for everything from steam irons to
video cameras, Camels to Calvins. Now, though, it is beginning to
hawk a very different kind of product: the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of those advertisers _ at least in terms of neon
acreage _ will be the Nasdaq market, which is waging an upstart
campaign to overtake the New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq recently
signed a deal to build the largest single sign in Times Square: a
$15 million, multimedia kaleidoscope of stock tickers, video
screens and colorful billboards that will festoon the cylindrical
tower of the building now rising at the southeast corner of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   The sign will be big _ roughly the size of three basketball
courts _ but it will hardly be alone. Times Square will soon be a
visual metaphor for the way the stock market _ news about it, talk
about it, anxiety about it _ seems to pervade life these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq sign, on the skyscraper known as the Conde Nast
building, will stand directly across the street from Dow Jones'
electronic zipper, which encircles the signpost tower at 1 Times
Square. That, in turn, is directly across the street from where
Reuters will hang a series of electronic signs on its new U.S.
headquarters, at Seventh Avenue and 42nd St.
</P>
<P>
   And those three signs will be only five blocks south of three
157-foot-long stock and financial information zippers that strut
across the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter building, at 1585 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a shootout in Times Square between Nasdaq,
Reuters, Morgan Stanley and Dow Jones,'' said George Stonbely,
president of Spectacolor Communications, the electronic sign
company that designed the giant Kodak, Hertz and AT&AMP;T signs on the
face of the Marriott Marquis hotel, at Broadway and 47th Street.
``They're all talking about mega-hardware on the outside of their
buildings. It's going to be funny to see so much financial
information in Times Square, instead of a Coke bottle or a can of
Planters peanuts. Someone who hasn't been here in many years is
going to think they're in the wrong place.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks and bonds are certainly a far cry from the products that
were traditionally hawked on the district's billboards and neon
signs, like Maytag washers, Wrigley's Spearmint Chewing Gum and
Trimble's Whiskey, which was depicted on that first neon sign in
1904.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous billboard of all was the Camel cigarette sign,
designed by sign specialist Douglas Leigh, which blew rings of
steam over Broadway between 1941 and 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But with Times Square now the symbol of New York's resurgence,
it is fitting that the businesses fueling that boom _ finance,
along with media and entertainment _ should be jostling for space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square has always been a little bit ahead of the game in
displaying the rawest edge of commercialization of our society,''
said Thomas Bender, a history professor at New York University.
``It makes sense that Wall Street should display itself on the
biggest public stage available at a time when we have the most open
celebration of the marketplace in history.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the changing images on the signs reflect the
changing nature of the business being done in the offices behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime entertainment district, Times Square was a logical
location for media giants like Reuters and Viacom. But the
financial services industry has become a large and growing
presence, most notably Morgan Stanley, which signed a tentative
deal last week to erect its third tower at the north end of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the financial industry, Times Square's greatest charm
is its advertising might, especially at a time when the number of
Americans who own stock has soared to 43 percent of adults, from 10
percent only two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to compete in the global marketplace, what
better place than the international crossroads of the world,'' said
David Arena, who heads Morgan Stanley's corporate real estate
department and is well aware of the estimated 20 million visitors
who pass through the square annually, not to mention the 250
million television viewers who watch the ball drop from the former
Times Tower on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the unbridled proliferation of signs in Times Square
has some people worried that the billboards will eventually all
look like undifferentiated ``wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never this much clutter, this much clamor for
attention,'' said Jason Perline, who has put up signs in Times
Square for 32 years. ``It's anybody's guess how long it'll be an
attractive media buy. Time will only tell, but I do question it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters is going to great lengths to insure that its signs will
be unique among that ``clutter,'' by hiring the designer Edwin A.
Schlossberg and by dropping plans for a zipper, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Frank Zarb, chairman of the National
Association of Stock Dealers, which owns the Nasdaq market, has
made no secret of his plans to build a world financial market that
would rival the New York Stock Exchange. The NASD has already
acquired the American Stock Exchange and may move it, together with
the association's headquarters, to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   With its giant sign and other attractions in Times Square,
Nasdaq hopes to sell itself to the public by creating a virtual
trading floor that rivals the much-televised opening bell of the
New York Stock Exchange, which is larger and better known. Unlike
the telegenic trading floors of the New York exchange, Nasdaq is an
electronic market composed mainly of telephone lines and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jones, a senior vice president at the NASD in
Washington, confirmed that Nasdaq was planning to move its
marketing operation to Times Square, but he declined to provide
details. Sign builders and real estate executives say, though, that
the NASD's board approved a 65,000-square-foot leasing deal Aug. 6
for the gigantic sign, a television studio and marketing center at
4 Times Square, at 43rd Street and Broadway.

MANAGED-CARE COMPANY'S SHARES LOSE NEARLY 15 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares in Foundation Health Systems, the nation's
fourth-largest publicly traded managed-care company, fell sharply
on apparent concern that the company will not make as much money
this year as expected.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Wednesday, Foundation shares were off nearly 24
percent, trading at a four-year low of $12.375. But late trading
helped the issue regain some ground to close down $2.375, or 14.61
percent, at $13.875. More than 1.95 million shares traded hands, or
more than four times the stock's three-month average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Though Foundation last week announced trouble with several of
its Medicare programs that could hurt year-end earnings, analysts
and company officials were at a loss to explain the sharp sell-off
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make up 50 stories that all sound plausible, but I
don't know why the stock is down,'' said Mary O'Connell at San
Francisco-based Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the New York Stock Exchange, Foundation
officials addressed the price drop Wednesday, saying in a written
statement that they were ``aware of no corporate developments that
would account for the unusual trading activity'' in the company's
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care sector in general has come under investor scorn
lately, as giants like United Healthcare Corp. have reported heavy
losses, and even profitable firms have seen their share price fall.
Humana Corp., which last week reported a 24 percent increase in
quarterly earnings, has lost more than half its market
capitalization since late July.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation last week reported that before a one-time charge from
the sale of its workers' compensation unit, its profit dropped to
$31.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $54.8 million, or 43 cents
a share in 1997. But analysts said any effect from that drop should
have been felt last week, when the news was released.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation spokesman David Olson speculated that the company's
shares were under pressure from short sellers who borrow shares in
a company, sell them and then replace the shares later with ones
bought at a lower price. So-called ``shorts'' are often accused of
starting rumors about a company in investor circles in the hope
that it will send the stock price down.

 NEW YORK: and Broadway.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real estate executives who have seen the plans said the Nasdaq
marketing operation would move from an obscure berth on the ninth
floor of 33 Whitehall St. in lower Manhattan to 4 Times Square.
There would be a broadcast studio with a curving wall of television
monitors looking out on Times Square from behind a semicircular,
two-story glass wall, where daily briefings and public stock
offerings would be announced. A public entrance would lead to the
second floor, where there would be an auditorium and interactive
displays for visitors wanting to track the progress of various
stocks. The NASD is also taking some office space.
</P>
<P>
   The huge sign itself would rise from the third story and ascend
about 125 feet, the executives said, and is expected to cost $15
million, about three times the price of Morgan Stanley's giant
electronic zippers, but only half of what Reuters may spend to
build 15,169 square feet of sophisticated, high-resolution video
signs on the side of its building.
</P>
<P>
   Though ever popular, signs in Times Square have only in recent
years generated big money. Last year, a German investment group
bought 1 Times Square for $110 million, or nearly four times the
price paid by Lehman Brothers two years earlier. The value of the
deal was in the signs, not the building. The four large signs that
climb up the front of 1 Times Square, home of the New Year's Eve
ball drop, generate more than $7 million a year in rent from
Budweiser, Nissin, ITT and Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   The current Times Square revival is in stark contrast to the
1970s, when many New Yorkers avoided the area and neon signs fell
out of fashion. By the time Leigh sold his 14 billboards in Times
Square to the Van Wagner sign company, 13 were blank. The sole
renter was Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Perline, a founder of Van Wagner, said that as hard as he tried
he could not sell space to U.S. companies because of the image of
Times Square as dowdy and dangerous. He recalled a salesman for
Philip Morris saying, ``We don't want a sign seen only by pimps and
prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Who smokes more than pimps and prostitutes?'''
Perline said. ``But it wasn't a good sales pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Wagner turned its attention to Sony's contemporaries in
Japan, emerging companies looking to make a name for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many New Yorkers, the Japanese realized that millions of
camera-laden tourists were stillpouring through Times Square every
year in a kind of civic pilgrimage akin to visiting Mecca or
Lourdes. Soon Hitachi, Minolta, Konica and Fuji were pitching up
billboards and neon spectaculars in Times Square, the first step
toward becoming household words in America.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, U.S. companies did not return for another
decade, and not until the city imposed an ordinance in 1987
requiring new buildings in the Times Square district to display
oversize, bright signs on new buildings along Broadway and Seventh
Avenue. At the time, civic groups hailed the ordinance as a tool to
save Times Square, but real estate developers who were trying to
douse the bright lights and create a new office district disliked
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment bankers and lawyers don't want to work in an
environment surrounded by flashing lights,'' David Solomon, the
developer who built the Morgan Stanley building and then lost it in
the recession, said at the time. ``They want museums and sidewalk
cafes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Morgan Stanley moved into the tower in 1995, it was
reluctant to dangle bright, garish signs off the side of its
buildings. But Disney has moved onto 42nd Street, and a museum,
albeit Madame Tussaud's, is on the way, making the area more
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan Stanley has since merged with Dean Witter, providing
the investment bank with a vast retail clientele that can be
reached through the signs in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs of the '20s _ Presto steam irons and Royal
typewriters _ were about liberation from drudgery,'' said Tama
Starr, co-author of ``Signs and Wonders: The Spectacular Marketing
of America'' and president of Artkraft Strauss, a family-owned sign
maker. ``Now the signs are about the world market and the
information age.''

NO WORD FROM WOODS; OFFENSE LOOKS SHARP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback Quincy Woods had not been heard
from Wednesday as he continued to ponder his future with the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, upset that he is no better than third-string, was given
some time off by USC coach Paul Hackett but was expected to contact
the coach Tuesday night. No USC player or coach has talked to Woods
for at least 48 hours and he took all his belongings when he left
UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard a word,'' Hackett said. ``I was pretty
flexible as far as sorting things out. I told him, `I will support
you.' He doesn't feel comfortable to tell me (his plans) yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has urged Woods to play wide receiver this season, but
he will not force him to quit playing quarterback. Woods could
transfer to a lower-division school and gain immediate eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   __ Improved scrimmage: USC's offense rebounded during a 92-play
scrimmage at the Coliseum on Wednesday, the Trojans' final tune-up
before the Pigskin Classic on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward had five receptions for 133 yards
and one touchdown as the Trojans' offense produced six touchdowns.
Freshman quarterback Carson Palmer completed 11 of 15 passes for
166 yards while Mike Van Raaphorst completed eight of 10 passes for
126 yards and two touchdowns, including a 47-yard scoring strike to
Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the offense felt the repercussions from last
weekend,'' Hackett said. ``The running-back group stepped up. I'm
pleased with the quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   There could have been more scoring, but Soward dropped a 62-yard
scoring pass from Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Achilles' heel,'' Hackett said. ``You drop one and it's
likely to cost you the game. R. Jay knows it's a weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jason Thomas threw a 71-yard TD pass to walk-on Jason
d'Autremont.
</P>
<P>
   Malaefou MacKenzie led the running backs with 78 yards in five
carries and two touchdowns. Ted Iacenda had 61 yards on two
carries, including a 55-yard run. Freshman Frank Strong had another
impressive performance, with 39 yards in three carries.
</P>
<P>
   Strong's elusive moves have been one of the surprises of
training camp, especially considering Nebraska recruited him to
play linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line's doing such a great job, it's easy,'' Strong said.
``They're the ones that set the tempo today.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sitting it out: About 15 players did not scrimmage, including
Grant Pearsall (knee), Larry Parker (hamstring), Marc Matock
(shoulder), John Fox (back spasms), Lawrence Larry (ankle), Marvin
Powell (knee), Ken Bowen (elbow) and Mark Cusano (hamstring). None
has been ruled out of the Purdue game. Troy Garner sprained his
right ankle during the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   __ Grain at left guard: Junior Jason Grain appears to have
locked up the starting left guard position. He worked out with the
first unit in the scrimmage and has received compliments from
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good about the left side,'' Hackett said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a rare example of marital and professional
alignment, Michael and Ariane Batterberry _ gatekeepers of
Manhattan's foodie culture _ are celebrating almost every possible
anniversary a couple could in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Food and Wine _ the magazine they created that guided Americans
through Perrier, the purple Peruvian potato and Patagonian
toothfish _ celebrates its 20th year next month. Food Arts, the
professional chef's bible they founded and still edit, turns 10. In
November, Routledge Press publishes the 25th-anniversary edition of
the Batterberrys' culinary history, ``On The Town in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and May 15 was their 30th wedding anniversary, which they
celebrated at a meeting of the National Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   So when Batterberry, a well-appointed man who favors slim
Italian suits and cultivates an accent as plummy as George
Plimpton's, and Mrs. Batterberry, a cool ashy blonde with an old
New York rhythm to her voice, talk food, they speak profoundly, as
if eating were a political, or even religious, movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Batterberry talks about the revolution that transformed a
Wonder-Bread-adoring America into a country that embraced the
Australian blue squash and the smoked-salmon pizza. Lob any food
question their way and they have an answer. Where was vodka sauce
invented? He said: ``The White Elephant, in Rome, in the '60s.
Everybody thought, `Has the chef thrown a Bloody Mary on the
pasta?''' Carpaccio? She said: ``It was 1971, Harry's Bar in
Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Batterberrys believe that the history of food is
more scintillating than the history of ... anything. ``When you
start looking at people and what they did in restaurants, you're
dealing with public life as it's lived day to day and that's real
history,'' Mrs. Batterberry said over a cup of tea and a petit four
in the Four Seasons lobby lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The Batterberrys won't reveal their ages (``Age entries should
be reserved for wine lists,'' he said), but let's just say that a
bottle of Quinta Do Noval ``Nationale'' port about his age would
cost a few thousand dollars. Ariane Ruskin grew up on the Upper
East Side _ where the couple still live _ graduated from Barnard
(class of 1955) and got a degree in classics from Cambridge
University. He was born in England 60-ish years ago, moved to New
York with his family before high school, and knew he would stay
forever when he celebrated his 12th birthday with his parents by
seeing ``Parsifal'' at the Met, then going to Harlem's Cafe Society
to hear Hazel Scott sing and Zero Mostel tell jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Batterberrys met on the St. Regis roof in the mid-1960s at a
benefit for an arts society. After sharing a house in the Hamptons
with Hugh Johnson, the wine writer, they decided to work with him
on a book about the history of New York restaurants. They weren't
food writers, but esthetes: Batterberry had spent much of his 20s
painting and writing in South America and Europe; she had published
a history of art. But they both loved restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, coincidentally, or maybe just politely,
Johnson bowed out of the book project.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published in 1973, a few years after they were
married, because, as Batterberry puts it, ``New York was in such a
miserable state then'' _ the late '60s _ that the publisher decided
no one wanted to read a book about Manhattan entertaining or night
life. By 1973, though, Burroughs Mitchell, Ernest Hemingway's last
editor at Scribner, had seen the light _ or perhaps had just eaten
at some great new restaurants _ and decided to publish the book,
long a staple in culinary libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The Batterberrys see all history through the social prism of
food: the Depression, World War II, technology, feminism. In fact,
in the mid-1970s, the couple decided that feminism had created a
market for a food magazine aimed at both men and women, and created
Food and Wine, with start-up money from Hugh Hefner. They edited
the magazine until they sold it to American Express in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big changeover at the moment we founded Food and
Wine in the late '70s,'' Mrs. Batterberry said. ``Before feminism,
it was the little wife in the kitchen.'' Many of the world's most
famous chefs are and have always been men, but when more women went
to work outside the home, the Batterberrys explained, more men
wandered into the nonprofessional kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys were starting to go off to college with woks,''
Batterberry said, adding, ``You know, it was like bra-burning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything changed!'' Mrs. Batterberry exulted, with enough
gusto to rattle her teacup. ``New York today is kind of like
Florence during the Renaissance. There's a genius on every corner,
someone young who is doing something very exciting everywhere you
look.''
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when the stock market crumbles like an
overbaked scone and all those bankers with a yearning for haute
cuisine and $600 bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild start eating
Thai takeout?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean will we become like the Baths of Caracalla?''
asked Mrs. Batterberry, referring to ruins left behind by the
Romans. ``Will we leave behind these huge vast empty restaurants?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we do,'' her husband said, ``at least the Olive Garden
uses fresh tomatoes and basil in the summertime now,'' he said.
``So the revolution has achieved something.''

PLAN OFFERED TO REVERSE LILCO PAY DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HICKSVILLE, N.Y. _ Top officers of Long Island Lighting Co. who
received large severance checks when the utility merged with
Marketspan have been told they must return the money if they expect
to keep their jobs at Marketspan, company officials confirmed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the executives decide to return their severance pay,
Marketspan will offer them stock options and other long-term
benefits. If they do not return the money, officials said, they
will be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan is not desperate to keep some of its employees. In
fact, various other packages are also being developed in an effort
to slim the ranks of the merged company, said Robert Catell, the
new chairman and chief executive officer of Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference intended to educate the press on hurricane
preparedness, Catell was repeatedly asked about the executive
compensation issue. He declined to discuss the payout recall, but
did not deny that the demand had been made as a means of recovering
some of the $67 million that was promised to 26 LILCO executives
just before the merger in May. The payouts aroused the anger of the
utility's customers and Gov. George Pataki, when they were
disclosed in documents filed after the Long Island Power
Authority's partial takeover of LILCO.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue remains a sore spot for many Long Islanders and
clearly you want to get this behind you,'' Catell said at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Catell would not discuss the details of the payback demand,
which were first reported in Tuesday's issue of Newsday. ``It
wouldn't really be appropriate for me to comment on that at this
time,'' Catell said. But he did say that he expected the matter to
be ``resolved shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the payout money, or $42 million, went to the former
chairman of LILCO, Dr. William Catacosinos, who was forced to
resign July 31 after Pataki and other state leaders criticized him
for misleading them about the payouts. Catell said at the time that
he, too, was unaware that Catacosinos had built the lucrative
severance payouts into the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos has declined to return the money, saying that it was
for his pension and other legal entitlements under his contract and
that the benefits had been disclosed in public documents. Utility
officials declined to discuss how the payouts or possible
reimbursements might affect any of the numerous investigations of
Catacosinos, or their impact on pending shareholder suits and other
suits brought by opponents of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five other former LILCO executives were paid a total of
$25 million. At least two of those executives decided not to join
the new company. Several others, regarded within the utility as
close allies of Catacosinos, were not asked to join Marketspan, the
company formed by the merger of Keyspan _ the parent of Brooklyn
Union Gas _ and part of LILCO.
</P>
<P>
   But at least six of the former LILCO officers who received
payouts _ in their cases ranging from $400,000 to $800,000 each _
now work for Marketspan carrying out its long-term contract to
manage electric service for the Long Island Power Authority. None
of the executives returned phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel said Wednesday that he did not
expect the severance pay dispute to affect the authority's ability
to provide service to its customers. ``I'm confident there are
plenty of talented and experienced people to manage the system
efficiently and effectively,'' he said. ``I expect a lot of them
will decide to stay. We'll just have to wait and see what
happens.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The original purpose of Wednesday morning's news conference was
to discuss Marketspan's preparations for the coming hurricane
season. In attendance at Marketspan's headquarters here were
Kessel, Catell and Michael Wyllie, a meteorologist for the National
Weather Service who advises the power authority and Marketspan on
potential weather-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wyllie noted that it was seven years ago Wednesday that
Hurricane Bob swept past the eastern end of Long Island. ``It was a
near miss, but it still caused an awful lot of damage,'' he said.
``By far the worst storm to hit Long Island was the hurricane of
1938, and we're long overdue for another big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said water temperatures along the Atlantic coastline all the
way up to Long Island were three to four degrees warmer than
normal, which should allow the hurricane season, which is generally
most active from mid-August to the end of September, to extend into
mid-October. The warmer temperatures are a lingering effect of El
Nino, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Catell and Kessel promised that should a storm hit, they
would be at the command center here. Catacosinos was on a European
vacation when Hurricane Gloria struck on Sept. 27, 1985. He did not
return to Long Island for four days, and this aroused much of the
public's initial anger against him.

A MODEST CHARTER PLAN SERVES A BIG MAYORAL GOAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani created his Charter
Revision Commission last spring, he described its mission in the
noblest of terms: to present to the voters a series of much-needed
changes to the City Charter, the hallowed how-to list for the
governance of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Although a furrowed brow may have masked a mayoral grin, few
missed Giuliani's inside joke. The immediate need for such a
commission was less to save Gotham from chaos, and more to trump a
political adversary on a matter of _believe it or not _ baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Having his commission place a Charter-related question on
November's ballot would, under state law, block the plans of City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone for a referendum on whether city
funds should help pay for a stadium in Manhattan for the New York
Yankees _ which the mayor saw as an affront to his skills as a
leader and negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the commission nears completion of its task, the mayor's
gambit is drawing fewer smiles. Its members have weathered brutal
public hearings at which they were ridiculed as Giuliani go-fers.
As predicted by its many critics, the commission did not have
enough time to meet its most ambitious goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the commission emerged this week with just a single
proposal: a stripped-down campaign-finance plan that has little
support outside the rooms in which its 12 members gather. But the
proposal, however modest, has one alluring attribute. It has been
drafted in time to appear on the November ballot, thereby serving
the mayor's political needs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which the commission is scheduled to vote on
Thursday night, calls for a referendum on whether to ban city
candidates from taking contributions from corporations. Advocates
for campaign-finance reform say that the measure is tepid at best
since corporate officers could still make donations as individuals
or through political action committees. They prefer a comprehensive
City Council bill that would lower contribution limits and provide
more money from the city treasury to candidates who participate in
the city's campaign-finance program.
</P>
<P>
   The full Council is expected to approve its bill next week.
Whether the mayor plans to sign the bill into law remains unclear,
but his defiance on the matter of the commission is not. Wednesday,
the mayor was asked whether the commission's proposal was worth the
time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth a great deal of time and money given the fact that
Speaker Vallone wants to misuse the referendum process,'' he said.
``And there is no other choice but to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's political victory comes at a cost, said Gene
Russianoff, the staff attorney for the New York Public Interest
Research Group and an early critic of the charter panel. ``The
charter process has been a disgrace,'' he said. ``The worst
predictions we had for it came true. It was sloppy, hasty, and in
search of any purpose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Assessments like that of Russianoff _ and there are many _
rankle Peter Powers, a close friend of the mayor's and a former
deputy mayor who is chairman of the commission. ``I think we can
hold our heads high and say we did our job responsibly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration's peculiar entree into charter
reform began in April, shortly after Vallone announced plans for a
referendum on the possibility of building a stadium for the Yankees
in Manhattan. Vallone's measure was intended to keep the team in
the Bronx, and thwart the mayor's plan to offer midtown Manhattan
as an alternative to losing the Yankees to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that Giuliani was genuinely offended by Vallone's
plan. He thought it would compromise his responsibilities as the
city's leader and raise the political profile of the speaker, who
is a Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor responded by creating the charter commission, assigned
with the task of coming up with something in time to block
Vallone's referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The commission held public hearings in each of the five boroughs
to solicit comments that were often abusive or frivolous. All the
while, it had to contend with an ever-closer deadline of the first
week of September to insure that its proposals would appear on the
November ballot. But as the criticism continued and the complexity
of their task proved more time-consuming, the panel's members began
to shed their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, the commission dropped several goals to focus on
campaign finance, nonpartisan elections, and the part-time duties
of the City Council. Then, two weeks ago, it winnowed its goals
further, to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this week, the commission abandoned the centerpiece of
its campaign-finance proposal, which was to to bar candidates from
accepting campaign contributions from people who do business with
the city. Now, aside from some minor changes to the city's Campaign
Finance Board, the panel's ballot proposal is to ban contributions
from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schrader, director of Citizen Action of New York City, a
public advocacy group, said that he had met several times with the
commission to try and develop an effective campaign-finance
proposal. But those talks abruptly ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has seen the commission's ballot proposal, he senses
a rush job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They squandered a real opportunity to create a really strong
campaign finance initiative,'' he said. ``It feels like they're
lurching for anything to block Yankee Stadium. It makes you suspect
it's done not for policy but for politics.''

LOFTY GOALS FOR NEW MATADOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Melvin Blue is even ONE-THIRD as good as he
thinks he is, Cal State Northridge should contend for the Big Sky
Conference title this season.
</P>
<P>
   Blue, a senior running back who transferred from Utah State this
year, has his sights set high. Make that ridiculously high.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is unbelievable,'' Blue said, accurately. ``But I want
to run for 3,000 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   This despite playing at pass-happy CSUN, where no back has ever
rushed for more than 1,500 yards. But Blue's got an agenda. He
wants to play in the NFL, and he has the attention of pro scouts.
But in Division I-AA, Blue figures a good season won't be enough.
He needs a great season. Like 3,000 yards great.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just me. I know I can run for 2,000, but just to go for
3 (thousand).... I think the higher your goals, the more you do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the euphoria of returning to his native Los Angeles has
simply gone to Blue's head.
</P>
<P>
   He describes the four years spent in Utah as the toughest time
of his life. He feuded with his coach, groused about splitting time
with other backs and struggled to adjust to a program heavy on
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Then, six months ago, Blue's girlfriend in Hawthorne gave birth
to their daughter, Symphony, and everything changed. Blue wanted to
be close to his daughter, wanted to be near his family and needed
to find a new football home to make the most of his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from (Compton), a lot of people grow up without
their parents. I didn't want to see my daughter go through it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New CSUN head coach Ron Ponciano was more than happy to bring
Blue, a Walter Payton Award candidate, back to Southern California.
At 6 feet, 232 pounds, Blue combines size and speed and could be
CSUN's best running back since Robert Trice, an NFL draftee in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melvin is a powerful runner who can make people miss,''
Ponciano said. ``He can run over them, he can catch the ball. He
can do a number of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rush for 3,000 yards?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a little more reality with that thought, but it's
nice he's ambitious,'' Ponciano said. ``I think everyone's looking
for ... well over 1,000 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue rushed for 741 yards and nine touchdowns last year,
including a 224-yard, three-TD effort at Idaho. That, Blue figures,
should translate into even higher numbers in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (Division) I-AA. Not to talk bad about it, but the
competition is not as strong as it is (in the Big West
Conference),'' Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Matadors' passing game should leave Blue with big
running lanes. ``A lot of teams play Northridge with dime and
nickel coverage, where they take their linebackers out, which
leaves litte (defensive backs) in there for me just to run
through,'' he said. ``So I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Four Matadors went down with groin injuries
during Wednesday's morning practice, and Ponciano blames a poorly
maintained practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting strains and pulls due to our sloppy pratice
field. I'm just irate over it right now,'' Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   The injured included receiver Anthony Ramos and defensive backs
Donnell Day, Chris Karibee and Quincy Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Though junior Josh Fiske is designated the starting
quarterback, he continues to split snaps with junior David Lins,
freshman Marcus Brady and sophomore Mitch Ryerson. The rotation
will probably continue until one player sets himself apart from the
pack.... The Matadors will hold their first full-contact, full-pads
practice today.

PLANS UNVEILED FOR HOTEL COMPLEX AT NEWARK AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The developers of a proposed hotel and conference
center complex on the fringes of Newark International Airport
Wednesday detailed their plans for the project, which would tap
into a growing need for hotel rooms and meeting space within easy
reach of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-acre site will include a 50,000-square-foot conference
center, a 550-room deluxe hotel and a 250-room limited service
hotel, said Emanuel Stern, president and chief executive of Hartz
Mountain Industries, the developer. He said work on the project
would create 3,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent jobs once
the work was completed. Construction of the $150 million project is
to start early next year, company officials said, and is expected
to be completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the site, stretching along the long-unused Waverly
rail yards a little over a mile west of the airport, have for much
of the last decade been little more than a gleam in the eye of
developers and Newark officials. The expectations have risen and
fallen with the changes in Newark's fortunes, the real estate
market and air travel.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the chances of development on the site
have increased tremendously as the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey planned and began construction of a monorail from the
airport to a new terminal for New Jersey Transit commuter trains
and Amtrak trains adjacent to the Hartz Mountain property. Last
spring, the developer won in its bid to build a pedestrian walkway
connecting the hotel and conference center complex to the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Smith Jr., executive vice president of operations with
Hartz Mountain Industries, said the property the developer acquired
from Newark in 1988 had gone from being a likely industrial site
with little access to the airport to a vastly more valuable
property with a direct line into the stream of 30 million people
who pass through the airport annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the current upturn in the economy which really makes this
possible,'' he said. ``And we have been hearing that there is an
increasing business travel meeting space requirement for companies
that might want to fly people into a single airport in the morning,
get them to an all-day meeting near the airport and then fly them
home that same night.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Hartz Mountain spent between $3 million and $5
million to rid the site of hazardous materials like heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plans were revealed Wednesday as Hartz Mountain
executives and other business people joined Newark Mayor Sharpe
James and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., on a tour of a number of
economic development sites in the city, which has been undergoing a
resurgence and attracting the interest of developers after years of
economic decline. As Stern described the company's plans, a steady
stream of airplanes could be seen just over his shoulder, noisily
sliding down the glide path to the airport's runways.
</P>
<P>
   James called the wedding of the proposed conference center
complex with air, rail and highway connections ``a home run'' for
the city economically.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who was instrumental in winning federal financing
for the monorail and the commuter and Amtrak rail terminal, said
the transportation links and the need for meeting space would make
the location ``a premier site'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   There are now about 3,700 hotel rooms within two miles of the
airport, Newark economic development officials said, and the
proposed Hartz Mountain complex will, by itself, increase that
number by more than 20 percent. Newark was listed as the 16th
busiest airport in the world in terms of takeoffs and landings in
1997, by the Airports Council International _ ahead of La Guardia,
which was 33rd, and Kennedy International, which was 34th. In total
passengers, Kennedy was 15th, Newark 16th and La Guardia 37th.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Newark has been the fastest growing airport in
the New York area, Port Authority officials said.

DELAWARE GAINS IN LITTLE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the most dramatic play imaginable, a bases-loaded, two-out
delayed steal of home in extra innings, Georgetown, Del., beat
Staten Island, New York City, 3-2, on Wednesday in the semifinals
of the Little League Eastern Regional tournament at Breen Field in
Bristol, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware will play Toms River, N.J., on Thursday night (ESPN2, 8
p.m. ET) for the regional title, with the winner advancing to the
eight-team Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa.,
starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware-Staten Island game was tied at 2-2 after the
regulation six innings. In the last of the eighth, with Delaware
runners on second and third, Staten Island intentionally walked the
Delaware pitcher, Donald Lewis, to fill the bases.
</P>
<P>
   With the count 1-2 on Justin West, Staten Island catcher Matt
Broms threw the ball back to Matt Castellano, his pitcher. When
Castellano turned his back on home plate, Delaware manager Bill
West told the runner on third base, Jared Lineweaver, to race home.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano did not see Lineweaver take off. When Broms yelled to
alert his pitcher, Castellano turned, saw what was happening and
threw home. Lineweaver slid and kicked the ball out of the
catcher's glove, ending the game. Paul Alesse, the official scorer,
called it a stolen base because, he said, ``The play was too close
to give an error to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was dominated by the pitchers. Lewis, the winner,
pitched a six-hitter, struck out 13 and had 80 strikes among his
124 pitches. Castellano yielded only 4 hits and struck out 17, but
also walked 10.

GIANTS GAME JUST AN EXHIBITION, JETS INSIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ They may be wearing the helmet designs of a
bygone era on Thursday, and they may be facing the team that once
symbolized the Establishment, but to the Jets, the meeting with the
Giants has become just an exhibition game rather than a rite of
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Jets Coach Bill Parcells, who coached the Giants to a 9-2 record
against the Jets, including 2-1 in the regular season, said:
``Bragging rights are overrated. Who are you bragging to? You're
bragging to somebody in preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   And after their 33-0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday,
the Jets are bragging to nobody. Thus, the game is really more
about the Jets getting back on track as a team, getting ready to
start the season with many new faces.
</P>
<P>
   All the regulars will see action into the third quarter,
including the special teams, the most improved unit a year ago when
the Jets had the best field position in pro football, on both
offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Ravens, 10 players who were backups the week before
were starters.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jumbo Elliott is back at left tackle after recuperating from
an ankle injury, and Todd Burger is at left guard after being
sidelined for most of the opening half, perhaps as a motivational
tool. Glenn Foley is the starting quarterback, as Parcells
promised, after Vinny Testaverde started against the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Parcells has created what he describes as ``a two-headed
middle linebacker'' and a ``two-headed fullback.'' Pepper Johnson
will start in the middle, while Dwayne Gordon will see special
teams action and then relieve Johnson. Keith Byars and Jerald
Sowell will split the fullback spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are concerned about themselves, not the Giants. The
first time the Jets faced the Giants, it was six months after their
stunning triumph over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were champions of every place but New York,'' linebacker
Ralph Baker liked to say. ``It was as if we had to beat the Giants
to really be the champions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did, and handily, with Joe Namath starring and a player
named Mike Battle _ who used to chew glass in barroom bets _
hurdling the opposition returning a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jets are once again wearing the helmet logos they donned
when their game with the Giants in 1969 began a tradition that
keeps fans excited. This is the 30th meeting between the teams,
with the Giants holding a 16-12-1 edge.
</P>
<P>
   But the matchup has increasingly turned into merely a summertime
exhibition. In fact, Foley doesn't remember that it was against the
Giants a year ago that he came in off the bench and tossed a
touchdown pass to Dedric Ward for the deciding score.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the significance of Thursday night's game, Foley
said, ``I think right now we're trying to turn this thing into
where it will be in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who is from Cherry Hill, N.J., and knows more about the
Jets and Giants than most players, said of his performance last
year: ``I can't remember anything about the game. You can't get
caught up in it. It's a fun atmosphere but we're grinding out
two-a-days and you're in the process of getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   For linebacker Chad Cascadden, the game, and not the opposition,
is what is important over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute well last week,'' he said. ``We just need to
worry about what we need to do. Who we play isn't important. It's
not like I want to beat the Giants to win the New York
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Burger is one of several players with uncertain outlooks.
Burger, a free agent who played previously for the Chicago Bears,
didn't start against the Ravens. Parcells is looking for better
pass protection from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not starting got me going,'' he said. ``The message was: get
in gear or get ready to watch on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, a former Giant, said: ``I look at this game as trying
to dominate the line. Sure there's a little more excitement, but
it's still an exhibition game.''

IT'S HEAD-TO-HEAD, AND MADE FOR TV 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANJESTAD, Aruba _ Terry Jastrow, executive producer of
``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf'' TV series, knew he had a
winning site the first time he looked out upon Tierra del Sol Golf
Course in Aruba. Here he was on a desert island in the Caribbean
Sea, with golf holes that brought the beach and water into full
view. A perfect setting, he thought, for a match between Nick Price
and Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem, he told his would-be hosts. Jastrow
pointed to the famed California Lighthouse, a 120-foot-tall
landmark that dominates Aruba's rocky northwest coastline looming
over the back nine. ``It's a little faded and rusted,'' Jastrow
said. ``Any chance we can paint it white? It'll show up much better
on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Jastrow has an eye for detail. He has to: he is the man who has
taken charge of a television series that had long been familiar to
golf fans. From 1961 through 1972, ``Shell's Wonderful World of
Golf'' was a Saturday afternoon staple. Starting with a match
between Gene Littler and Byron Nelson at Pine Valley Golf Club in
New Jersey, the series featured big-name golfers in an 18-hole
match contested on a famous course.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the show emphasized the game's global
appeal. Viewers were transported to the Old Course at St. Andrews
for a match between Gene Sarazen and Henry Cotton or to Cape Breton
Highlands Links in northern Nova Scotia for a match between the
Canadians Al Balding and George Knudson. Classic golf writers like
Herbert Warren Wind and Al Barkow wrote for the show, and Sarazen
was ultimately recruited to serve as a host. All told, 92 episodes
were broadcast _ until sponsors discontinued the show because of
mounting production problems and lagging network ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, the show was revived, this time as a
prime-time cable show, and was broadcast up to five times a year.
``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf'' was restarted in 1994, with a
match between Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus at Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Jack Nicklaus Productions, Jastrow has handled
all 19 of the new episodes. His responsibilities include locating
sites, arranging matches and overseeing the taping. ``There are
three stars to each show,'' he said. ``The two golfers and the
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, he inspects some three dozen potential sites. What
does he look for? ``A good natural setting and strong local
sponsorship.'' Total production costs for each show come to about
$400,000, including the purse. Local business interests get
involved to showcase tourism and real estate. For the Aruba show,
resort operators joined the local tourism authority in publicizing
the island's newfound status as a golf destination.
</P>
<P>
   Until the opening of the Robert Trent Jones Jr.-designed Tierra
del Sol layout in 1996, the island's only golf course consisted of
a burned-out nine-hole tract with sand greens. Folks here now hope
that all those aerial views of the golf course and surroundings
will entice viewers to think about a golf getaway in Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   Jastrow, always looking for good visuals, is happy to comply. As
the golfers leave the sixth green, Jastrow points to a caravan of
all-terrain vehicles making the trek along the beach. ``Make sure
you get a shot of that,'' he reminds a cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1961, Littler's share for winning was $2,000, with
Nelson settling for $1,000; today, winners receive $100,000, while
second place pays $50,000. Of course, not everyone takes these
matches as seriously as did Ben Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   For his match in 1966 against Sam Snead at the Houston Country
Club, Hogan arrived a week in advance and played six approach shots
from the left side, six from the center and six from the right into
each of the greens.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, a few casual practice rounds sufficed for
Price and Stewart, enough for them (and their regular PGA Tour
caddies) to acclimate to the 30-mile-an-hour wind.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, filming an 18-hole round required two days
of shooting. The 35-mm motion-picture cameras were clumsy to handle
and frequently had to be refocused and relighted. Occasionally,
golfers would have to replay shots that the cameras had missed. All
of that has changed now, thanks to six video cameras and a crew of
30 that virtually swarms over the golf course. The match between
Price and Stewart took all of four and a half hours to tape.
</P>
<P>
   Announcers Jack Whitaker and Bob Rosburg followed the action and
did some live voice-overs. Much will also be added during the weeks
of editing needed to boil the show down to 90 minutes. The air date
is Oct. 28 on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jastrow will have plenty of time for scouting more
sites and putting together other matches. He still bristles over
having nearly secured Tiger Woods against Jack Nicklaus at Merion
Golf Club outside Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's a big fan of the series,'' he said. ``I'm told he
spends time at the Golf Channel watching old tapes.''

 McCAUGHEY ROSS FACES POINTED QUESTIONS IN GOVERNOR DEBATE 
 (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRENTWOOD, N.Y. _ Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross came under
attack Wednesday night by her three rivals for the Democratic
nomination for governor, who used their second debate to question
her loyalty to Democratic values, her political experience and her
competence.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate that had been largely marked by comity and unity of
purpose _ the candidates spent the bulk of the evening assailing
Gov. George Pataki _ the three other Democrats made the same choice
when offered a chance to select one candidate to question: They
turned on Ms. McCaughey Ross, the former Republican who is now
seeking to run against the man who brought her into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder, in all earnestness,'' said one of the candidates,
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, ``what is it about your
experience as lieutenant governor that prepares you to be the chief
executive of a state with a $72 billion budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, James Larocca, a former state transportation
commissioner, asked why Ms. McCaughey Ross, who is also the Liberal
Party candidate for governor, would not agree to support the winner
of the Democratic primary if it was not her.
</P>
<P>
   And the other gubernatorial candidate, New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, asked if Ms. McCaughey Ross was aware that
he had introduced city legislation mandating the use of trigger
locks on handguns, similar to a bill Ms. McCaughey Ross has called
for statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came in a race that has until now been remarkably
placid. Indeed, until the questions about Ms. McCaughey Ross were
posed at the debate at Suffolk County Community College here, the
discussion had been free of wrangling. Until then, each candidate
had taken turns serving up a variety of criticisms of Pataki's
effectiveness as governor and his political ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Ms. McCaughey Ross seemed to reflect continuing
uncertainty among the various camps over the shape of the race and
how best to position their candidate. From the start, she has been
assumed to be a front-runner, if only because she is the only woman
in the race and because her husband, Wilbur Ross, an industrialist,
was said by her campaign to be prepared to finance a heavy
television advertising campaign on her behalf. (With the election
less than a month away, it remains unclear whether he will actually
do so.)
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's aides distributed a statement attacking Ms. McCaughey
Ross' record even before the debate began.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross appeared unfazed by the attacks, seeming to
welcome the jostling.
</P>
<P>
   When Larocca accused her of using government funds to print a
report on the state economy that has become a staple of her
campaign appearances, she brushed aside his remark as `'a
distortion.'' (A notice on the report says it was not published at
taxpayers' expense).
</P>
<P>
   And when Larocca pushed her about why she would not promise to
support the Democratic candidate if she lost the nomination, Ms.
McCaughey Ross dismissed the line of inquiry as irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When working families watch this on television,'' she
responded, ``they are less concerned with insider party politics
than the fundamental issues facing the people of New York.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a group, the Democrats differed on one major issue: the death
penalty. Only Hynes opposes it. Vallone strongly endorsed capital
punishment, referring to convicted killers who murder prison
guards. ``There are people who will kill again,'' Vallone said. ``I
have no problem whatsoever in sending them back to their maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said she was more concerned about domestic
violence. But she said she has ``come to accept the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A society has a right to express its moral outrage,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hynes promised that his top priority, if elected, would be
to revoke the law that was a centerpiece of Pataki's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phony issue. It's not punishment at all to stick a
needle in someone's arm after 15 years of appeals,'' Hynes said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he favored ``real life without parole, the kind of
punishment the federal Government gives to John Gotti, who spends
23 hours a day in a jail cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Larocca sought to distinguish himself from his opponents by
urging them to sign a pledge promising not to take money from
interests doing business with the state. ``We cannot make the case
against George Pataki, who runs his campaign on this
self-interested big money, if we ourselves are part of this
process,'' he said. ``I am the only candidate who is not part of
this system.''
</P>
<P>
   None took Larocca up on his offer.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, the candidates were nearly in unison as
they attacked Pataki on a variety of fronts, ranging from his
administration of the state government to his fund-raising
practices to his recent display of national ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor _ we have problems,'' Vallone said. ``You're out of
state. You're out of touch. You have to come back and address those
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates assailed Pataki for pushing for increases in
tuition for the State University of New York, which Hynes said
``has deprived students of an education.''
</P>
<P>
   The four candidates also criticized Pataki for allowing the
state debt to increase during his first four years in office.
Larocca said he would push legislation that would mandate that 25
percent of any surplus go toward paying down the state's debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Pataki came to New York and said he was a fiscal
conservative,'' Larocca said. ``He is sinking New York into debt at
a rate that would make Nelson Rockefeller and Abraham Beame blush.
We are on our way to a debt situation exactly like 1975, when we
were at the brink of bankruptcy in New York.''

BERNARD VAN LENTEN, 56, MEN'S FASHION JOURNALIST
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WOLFGANG SAXON c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernard F. Van Lenten Jr., a New York editor and
columnist on the men's apparel industry who helped organize the
first major private fund-raiser for AIDS research, died on Aug. 15
at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 56 and a resident of
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a long illness, according to DNR, a sister
publication of Women's Wear Daily at Fairchild Publications, where
he was associate publisher, editor at large and a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Van Lenten reported from the men's designer fashion-show circuit
as a regular visitor to runways in New York, Milan and Paris. He
was an industry reviewer and commentator for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, as AIDS began to take its toll in his industry, he
joined the organizing committee of a fund-raiser for research
presided over by Elizabeth Taylor. The event was sponsored by the
fashion, fragrance and cosmetics industries and by the American
Foundation for AIDS Research, known as Amfar.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paterson, N.J., Barry Van Lenten graduated from Rutgers
University. In the 1960s, he briefly worked at Fairchild's Men's
Wear magazine before helping to found Boutique magazine in Boston.
He also set up his own fashion publicity firm, Wordesigns, and
wrote a column for GQ magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Men's Wear in 1981, moved to DNR two years later
as associate editor and helped design DNR Magazine, becoming its
managing editor. He was promoted to associate publisher-editor at
large last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Patricia Ann Van Lenten of North
Branch, N.J., and a brother, Brian J., of Sherman Oaks, Calif.

WALLACE FOWLIE, 89, EXPERT ON FRENCH POETS AND REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace Fowlie, a professor emeritus of French literature at
Duke University who once compared the rock singer Jim Morrison with
the poet Arthur Rimbaud, died Aug. 16 at Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C. He was 89 and lived in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Fowlie gained prominence as a scholar by writing more than 20
books focusing on the great French poets and other literary figures
of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Baudelaire, Dante,
Mallarme, Proust, Rimbaud and Verlaine. He crossed into popular
culture and received national attention in 1994 when, as an
octogenarian, he wrote ``Rimbaud and Jim Morrison: The Rebel as
Poet,'' published by Duke University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Fowlie said that the French poet and the lead singer of the
Doors both were rebels who grew up without fathers, experimented
with drugs and alcohol and dealt with death and pathos in their
writings.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brookline, Mass., Fowlie, in his 1978 autobiography,
``Journal of Rehearsal,'' described the formative experiences that
led to his lifelong love of all things French: the pleasure felt at
first hearing the musical sounds of the French language, of Mary
Garden singing Louise in Charpentier's opera, and his awe when, as
a child, he listened to Paul Claudel, then French ambassador in
Washington, deliver an incomprehensible speech at the Copley Plaza
Hotel in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor's
degree in 1930, a master's degree in 1933 and a Ph.D. in 1936,
after which he traveled to Paris briefly for the first time, the
names of the streets and monuments long since memorized from his
readings. He took up teaching upon his return, with stints at
Bennington College, the University of Chicago and Yale University
before arriving at Duke in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1975 review in The New York Times of ``Letters of Henry
Miller and Wallace Fowlie,'' which traced seven years of
correspondence between the writer and the scholar _ much of it
focusing on the place of the artist in society, and on Rimbaud _
Fowlie was described as ``a devout Catholic, a man of genuine
sensitivity, a devotee of French literature and a critic who was
particularly interested in such spirit-laden figures as Narcissus,
Hamlet and the clown.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this sensitivity that led to his success in the
classroom, said his longtime friend and colleague, Marcel Tetel, a
professor of French at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his greatest assets was that he was revered by his
students,'' Tetel said. ``He developed friendships with many of his
students. He talked to them at length after class, and he would
even have them over to his house for dinner. His classes were
always full.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 interview, Fowlie said he had always seen his role
``as transcending that of a mere academic adviser.'' Rather, he
offered encouragement, a friendly word and an occasional rebuke
along with his insights.
</P>
<P>
   His unending quest, he said, was the answer to the question,
What is poetry? The solution, he believed, rested in ``the
direction of an individual toward a decent life.''
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

CONFESSED SMUGGLER OF CHINESE GIVES ACCOUNT OF ENTERPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Providing the fullest account to date of an operation to smuggle
Chinese immigrants into the United States, a top organizer said
Wednesday that the smugglers transported at least 100 people on as
many as five voyages from South America over a year and a half,
before bungling the latest trip in May off the coast of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggler, Nam Jick Cho, 57, was so committed to the
enterprise that he said he often flew to Venezuela and Suriname
from his home in Queens to insure that the Chinese were squeezed
aboard the smuggling ship, the Oriental I. When the ship had
mechanical trouble in Bermuda en route to New Jersey, Cho flew down
carrying new parts. And to prepare for the arrival of the latest
group of immigrants in Belmar, N.J., he paid $7,000 for a van to
take the men to a parking lot in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   Cho offered these details and more Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Newark, N.J., during a remarkably candid hearing in which
he pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges in connection with
the operation, which came to light when the Oops II, a smaller boat
that had picked up the men from the Oriental I, ran aground in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Cho is the second man involved in the Oriental I operation to
plead guilty to conspiracy charges in the last week. Three other
men, all crew members aboard the Oriental I, remain in government
custody, while a fourth _ a Queens resident named Charng Seon Choi,
said to be another top organizer _ remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's hearing, some details had emerged about the
Oriental I and the 23 Chinese it unloaded in New Jersey, mainly
from a federal complaint, and from the Chinese themselves. But Cho
is the first person on the operations side of the endeavor to
discuss what happened and what, ultimately, went wrong in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the people we have, he is an important one,'' said
Carolyn Murray, an assistant U.S. attorney. ``He was in charge of
land operations, so to speak. He hired some of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a Korean interpreter, Cho said that he had been
hired by Choi to participate in a smuggling operation that
solicited $25,000 to $40,000 apiece from anyone interested in
leaving Fujian Province in southern China for North America.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the scheme worked like this: First, the smugglers
took the immigrants to Suriname by air or by ship. A man with the
surname Chang, based in South America, arranged housing for the
immigrants. Cho secured the use of the Oriental I, a 120-foot
fishing vessel owned by a Venezuelan company, to smuggle the
immigrants. Then the smugglers directed the Chinese onto a small
boat that, in turn, reconnoitered with the Oriental I about 30
miles off the Suriname coast.
</P>
<P>
   Each trip would include 20 or so immigrants, Cho said. And Cho
would receive a cut of $7,000 from the smuggling fee paid by each
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Oriental I made four or five trips to North America
between March 1997 and June 1998, Cho said, including two to the
Bahamas and two to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when or where the Oriental I made its first
trip to the United States; Cho did not say. But Cho has also been
indicted on similar charges in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
Ms. Murray said. In many cases, the final destination of the
immigrants is Chinatown or Flushing, Queens, where jobs for Chinese
are more plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent trip of the Oriental I was a little
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression that this trip was more unusual because
it came into New Jersey, and not somewhere in the city,'' said Sean
McGovern, Cho's lawyer. ``They had presumed that it would be safer
to go into New Jersey, with less chance of being detected by the
authorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Cho, the Oriental I carried an unusually large load
of 50 Chinese immigrants, with scheduled drop-offs in Belmar, N.J.,
and the Bahamas. In addition, the ship broke down in Bermuda,
requiring Cho to fly down with new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the other smugglers gave Cho $35,000 to pay for
the van _ on which the imprint of the previous owner, a Korean
church, was still visible _ and other expenses in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, he traveled to Point Pleasant, N.J., to test out a
small powerboat, the Oops II, in anticipation of picking up the
immigrants. On May 30, Choi steered the Oops II to meet the
Oriental I, about 100 miles offshore, while Cho waited in Belmar
with the van.
</P>
<P>
   There was dense fog, though, and after picking up the men the
Oops II ended up in the affluent town of Bay Head, eight miles off
target to the south. But McGovern said that Cho told him that he
simply ran out of gas and drifted toward shore before dropping the
23 off against a backdrop of mansions.
</P>
<P>
   The Oriental I, meanwhile, chugged on to the Bahamas, dropping
off 20 or so more Chinese before experiencing mechanical
difficulties _ again. And on June 8, the U.S. Coast Guard found the
Oriental I about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island in the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Cho said that he felt remorse over his role in the
operation, McGovern said. In exchange for his cooperation,
investigators could pare his sentence from its of maximum of 10
years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cho Yang Nam, a deckman aboard the Oriental I,
pleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge; he, too, is cooperating
with authorities. Three others _ Kim Jong Che, the captain; Piao
Zhen Jia, a cook, and Jiang Yong Zhu, a mechanic _ are expected to
go to trial on Nov. 17, their lawyers have said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 23 Chinese from the Oops II, they remain in
government custody. The government expects to begin taking
videotaped depositions of some of the 23 men beginning Monday, Ms.
Murray said, meaning that the men should be released on bond soon.

<P>
   But that freedom could be brief. All still face deportation
proceedings by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ It isn't for nothing that D.Wayne Lukas
is known as the master of 2-year-old horses. Since 1984, he has
trained 24 winners of Saratoga's prestigious juvenile stakes for
colts and fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in the Saratoga Special, Lukas saddled another
aspiring winner: Tactical Cat, a gray son of the legendary Storm
Cat. Tactical Cat, ridden by Jerry Bailey, the best in the
business, went off as the 1-5 favorite and was expected to dominate
the small field of four. But he labored and finished third while
Prime Directive stole the show, winning by 5{ lengths over Silk
Broker.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Directive was racing last behind a fast pace: the
quarter-mile in 21 4/5 seconds, the half-mile in 45 2/5. With a
quarter of a mile left, he made his move, flew past his three
rivals and seized the lead. He ran the six and a half furlongs in
1:17, paid $9.90 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $90,000 for
his owner, Noreen Carpenito.
