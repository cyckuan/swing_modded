SMALL TRACT MIRRORS FIGHT FOR ADIRONDACKS' FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FINE, N.Y. _ John Gibbs, a New York state forester, walked along
a ribbon of dirt road through one of the hundreds of public
woodlands in the Adirondack Park, a Vermont-size patchwork of state
preserves and private land.
</P>
<P>
   On one side lay the 2,000-acre Alice Brook tract, one of many
areas in the park officially designated as ``wilderness,'' where
people can pass only on foot or in a canoe; on the other was land
labeled ``wild forest,'' where trails can be traversed by
snowmobiles or mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   The trees and tangled brush on both sides of the road were the
same. The patches of still-green ferns sprouting through golden
mats of newly fallen leaves were the same. But the difference could
not be more stark, a variety of private environmental groups,
sporting groups and local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest fray in a decades-long battle for the soul of the
Adirondacks, the culture of the hiking boot and that of the motor
are locked in debate over a state plan to change the status of the
Alice Brook tract from wilderness to wild forest so it can provide
an east-west corridor for snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Adirondack Park Agency this fall is considering
what kinds of restrictions should apply to about 45,000 acres of
forest preserve land, including parcels like Alice Brook that have
long been state property and newly acquired land, such as the
14,700-acre William C. Whitney tract, which was bought two years
ago for $17 million from a company owned by Marylou Whitney, the
heiress and Manhattan socialite.
</P>
<P>
   Even taken together, the tracts are minuscule compared with the
total of more than 1 million acres of wilderness and 1 million
additional acres of wild forest within the sprawling park, which
runs from about 50 miles north of Albany to the Canadian border and
contains a mix of publicly and privately owned tracts. But the
pending decision has sparked intense interest, with advocates on
both sides packing a series of public hearings that ended on Oct.
15.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every decision it will make, the park agency, whose
board is appointed by Gov. George Pataki, stands to make someone
very unhappy when it rules in December or January.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision rests with the governor, who under state law
can reject the board's land-classification plan. That decision will
be a difficult one, political and environmental experts said. In
the past, Pataki has received high marks from land-preservation
groups, but he also relies on a strong base of support in largely
Republican upstate towns where snowmobiles and outboard motors are
often preferred to boots and paddles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pataki's aides said he would give no hint of his
position until the agency board presented its findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Alice Brook tract is ground zero in the fight. It lies on
the northern flank of an ecological treasure called the Five Ponds
Wilderness. But it also contains an old snowmobile trail that, if
restored, could link existing snowmobiling areas that are currently
cut off from each other.
</P>
<P>
   As he clambered over a pile of trees, Gibbs laid out the debate:
``There's a lot at stake, whether it be economics to the folks
living here who need to make a decent wage, or preservation to
those folks who may live in Long Island or Syracuse but who feel
good that this is here, and will be here forever. Somehow,'' he
said, ``there's got to be some kind of a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   To many small Adirondack towns, where the economy largely shuts
down in winter, a boom in snowmobiling could mean jobs and money.
But to environmental groups, any diminution in wilderness in the
107-year-old park would set an unacceptable precedent and violate
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little true wilderness in the Northeast that we
think every acre is valuable,'' said John Sheehan, a spokesman for
the Adirondack Council, a private group that opposes and reduction
in protections on forest preserves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, Adirondack park officials have been slowly working
their way across the park, studying and then classifying each patch
of public land as suitable for some level of use _ or, if left as
wilderness, for hardly any use at all except to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Land that had old logging roads, mines or intermingled private
holdings was given the wild forest classification, allowing more
access. The delicate politics in the region always demanded rough
parity between amounts of wilderness and wild forest.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest batch of proposed land classifications, the park
agency's planners attempted to keep a rough 50-50 split. But in
this case, the details do matter, people on both sides of the
debate say.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newly configured zones would reclassify land that is
currently wild forest, and snowmobiling groups want none of the
land now accessible to them to become off limits. David Perkins,
the president of the New York state Snowmobile Association, asked
the group's members recently to write letters to the park agency
opposing the new wilderness designations that were being pushed by
what he called ``environmental extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Woodworth, a lawyer for the Adirondack Mountain Club, a
private lobbying group, said that the state constitution and a
series of court decisions are clear on the need for state preserves
in the Adirondacks to remain free of excessive human intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a 1930 decision of the Appellate Division of state
Supreme Court, which described the Adirondack forest preserve this
way:
</P>
<P>
   ``We must preserve it in its wild nature, its trees, its rocks,
its streams. Its uses for health and pleasure must not be
inconsistent with its preservation as forest lands in a wild
state,'' the judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles and jet skis and other powered craft are not what
the judges were describing, Woodworth said. Even so, he said, at
least for the Alice Brook tract there is a solution that could
satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, even with the stricter wilderness
classification for the land, a snowmobile trail could run around
its edge, as long as it was built within 500 feet of the outer
boundary of the parcel.
</P>
<P>
   For the Whitney tract, the debate centers not just on
terrestrial vehicles, but also on motor boats. The parcel is prime
canoeing territory, containing Little Tupper Lake and Rock Pond,
which are linked by a winding channel. And it sits to the east of
Lake Lila, which is also on state park land.
</P>
<P>
   The park agency is considering whether the Whitney tract and the
land around Lake Lila should be wilderness or something less.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell and other local officials, along with snowmobile clubs,
would like to see the area opened to more than just hikers and
canoeists.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen private environmental groups weighed in at the
hearings, insisting that the Whitney land be wilderness and nothing
less. Little Tupper and Lake Lila are among only a few water bodies
left in the Adirondacks where the sound of motors is almost
unknown, representatives of these groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, once the park agency and Pataki decide what to do, it
will be up to John Gibbs and others at the state Department of
Environmental Conservation to draw up detailed management plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and other state foresters working in the area generally
favored the view that the Adirondack landscape is vast enough to
satisfy hikers seeking solitude and people who prefer to be pulled
along by a high-revving engine.
</P>
<P>
   As Gibbs made his way along the road through the Alice Brook
tract, he pointed out that by far the greatest disturbance to the
forest there came not from snowmobiles or other human influences,
but instead from violent wind storms that swept the region in the
summer of 1995, pummeling millions of trees. New saplings were
rising from between uprooted stumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years down the road this is going to be beautiful
softwood forest,'' he said.

POLLUTE-DIESEL _ A new report, released just as the Phoenix area
enters the winter pollution season, traces the Brown Cloud directly
to the exhaust pipes of the very same motorists who lament the
stain it leaves on the Valley's horizon. It documents that diesel
engines spew out a disproportionate share of the microscopic bits
of soot and grime that create the visible pollution. And it
discounts the belief that the desert terrain is the reason why the
Phoenix metro area is bedeviled by a Brown Cloud. By MARY JO PITZL.

WILSON-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ It was just the kind of tasty morsel a
critic of TV news loves to munch. A new nightly newscast, featuring

on cable TV, reported Brill's Content. What a sterling example of
how shallow TV news is becoming, I thought. Checking into the
story, however, I found that Brill's report on the half-naked
newscast was half-baked, the kind of slipshod journalism the
watchdog magazine routinely skewers. By STEVE WILSON. Column will

GARCIA KEEPS HEAD STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Could buddies Fernando Vargas and Robert Garcia of
Oxnard be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, the IBF junior middleweight champ, has a knack for
finding trouble. He's scheduled to defend his title against Ronald
Wright but only if he's not sent to jail for pending assault
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garcia was asked what he'd like to do after his
boxing career: He wants to be a cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seriously considering that,'' said Garcia, who defends his
IBF junior lightweight title against Diego Corrales tonight on the
Mike Tyson-Orlin Norris undercard. ``I think a lot of kids in the
neighborhood look up to me. I think I could do a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, the bad boy, commands much more attention and money than
Garcia because of his remarkable skills, Olympic background and
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, like Vargas, is undefeated _ (32-0, with 24 knockouts) _
but has yet to receive universal recognition or anything close to a
seven-figure payday. He'll make a career-high $200,000 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   He outpointed Harold Warren in March of last year to win the
title and has defended twice, the last time a decision over capable
John John Molina in January.
</P>
<P>
   His handlers have spoken to those of WBC champion Floyd
Mayweather about a title-unification bout early next year. Garcia
would be a significant underdog against the richly talented
Mayweather, but a victory could make him a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of fight I need, the kind of fight that will
prove I'm a great champ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's Corrales, an unbeaten (28-0, 23 KOs)
resident of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia hasn't fought since the Molina fight, nine months ago. He
had been scheduled to face Derrick Gainer in June but pulled out
because he objected to the judges selected for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   That layoff and the fact Corrales is 6-feet tall _ Garcia is 5-7
_ make this a potentially difficult fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't box, if he stands in front of me, that will be
good,'' Garcia said. ``I heard he's going to box, though. It'll be
a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Big Bear two months focusing completely on Corrales.
I'll be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up: If Tyson defeats Norris tonight, he's expected to face
Shannon Briggs on Jan. 29 at Madison Square Garden in New York. No
contracts have been signed.
</P>
<P>
   The other Norris: Norris' younger brother, former junior
middleweight champ Terry Norris, has been training the past few
months and plans to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Norris (47-9, 31 KOs) hasn't fought since he was stopped by
Laurent Boudouani in November of last year and is thought to be
washed up. One rumor has him facing Julio Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual card: A card featuring boxers from the United States
against kung fu martial artists from China is scheduled for Dec. 11
in St. George, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters will be required to observe the rules of their
discipline, meaning the boxers cannot kick. Eight bouts of five
rounds each are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The show could be on cable or pay-per-view television, depending
on whom promoter Ron Weathers is able to sign to fight. He has
spoken to Hector Camacho and other well-known boxers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get recognizable champions, it could be on
pay-per-view,'' he said.

LORD GREY, 89, QUEEN'S LAST GOVERNOR IN ULSTER  
 BERNIE PRIVIN, 80, BIG-BAND TRUMPETER

  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Lord Grey of Naunton, the last official representative of the
queen of England in Northern Ireland, died Oct. 17 in Naunton,
Gloucestershire. He was 89.
 &HT;    From 1968 to 1973, Grey was governor of Northern Ireland, the
British province. After that the post was abolished and Britain
appointed a secretary of state for Northern Ireland, based in
London.
 &HT;    Although Grey's responsibilities were largely ceremonial, they
included a few important duties like formally appointing the prime
minister and reviewing legislation.
 &HT;    He previously served as governor of British Guiana, as Guyana
was then known, and later of the Bahamas.
 &HT;    While previous governors in Ulster often remained aloof from the
workings of government, Grey was known for his diligent examination
of proposed legislation and for not being afraid to point out what
he regarded as errors.
 &HT;    Ralph Francis Alnwick Grey was born in Wellington, New Zealand,
on April 15, 1910. He was educated at Scotts and Wellington
colleges in New Zealand and received a law degree from Auckland
University College.
 &HT;    In 1936 he was accepted by the British Colonial Administrative
Service, and the following year he was posted to the Eastern
Provinces of Nigeria. He rose steadily through the ranks of the
Colonial Office and was noted especially for his efforts to combat
the practice of kidnapping children and slave trading in Nigeria.
 &HT;    He was knighted in 1956, and was raised to the peerage as Baron
Grey of Naunton, the town in Gloucestershire where he had settled.
 &HT;    Grey's wife, Esme Kirkcaldie, died in 1996.
 &HT;    He is survived by two sons and a daughter.

<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said Elwyn Walshe, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Privin bought a trumpet the day after hearing Louis Armstrong at
the Apollo Theater when he was 13. He taught himself how to play,
and six years later he joined the Tommy Dorsey orchestra, replacing
Charlie Spivak. In 1938 he joined the Artie Shaw orchestra, then at
the peak of its popularity, and was the soloist on ``Traffic Jam,''
among other compositions. In the early '40s he spent two years
working with Benny Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his military service as trumpet soloist in Glenn
Miller's Army Air Force Band, and after being discharged he
returned to Goodman's band, Late in the '40s he was hired by the
CBS Staff Orchestra, a job he kept for 25 years, playing in such
shows as ``The Ed Sullivan Show.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With controlled fury, as if with each word
he could begin to rebuild his shattered homeland, the leader of
East Timor, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, exhorted his weeping countrymen
Friday to show the world their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would suffer!'' he shouted, his words echoing
through a microphone across a vista of burned and vandalized
buildings, and broadcast on international television. ``But we are
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under threat from the Indonesian-backed militias that continue
to torment East Timor in a campaign of organized vengeance, Gusmao
was flown in secret on Thursday night to the capital, Dili, on an
Australian military plane.
</P>
<P>
   As he addressed a crowd of 500 people on his first visit home
since his arrest and imprisonment in Indonesia in 1992, Gusmao was
flanked by foreign bodyguards in battle fatigues, holding rifles
and scanning the surroundings through dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the man who is widely seen as the future leader of
an independent East Timor was a signal of the slow rebirth of the
territory, which was ravaged by the militias in response to its
vote of nearly 80 percent on Aug. 30 to become independent of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of national humiliation on Wednesday, the Indonesian
national assembly formally accepted that vote. The recognition of
the democratic choice of the territory it invaded in 1975 coincided
strangely with the assembly's choice of a new president, an
experiment in electoral politics after a generation of one-person
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao's words Friday, enunciated slowly and fiercely in the
local language, Tetun, seemed to try to begin East Timor's revival
by infusing his people with a sense of determination and hope for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will show the world, we will show Indonesia, we will show
ourselves that we can do it!'' he shouted to the crowd, in which
most people had lost their houses and possessions and many were
still searching for missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether it was tears or rage or the battle cry of
a former guerrilla leader that caused his voice to break and seemed
to fill each word with pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put in the past the evil they have done to us,''
Gusmao said. ``Tomorrow is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The return was a month after the arrival in Dili of the first
elements of the 8,000-member security force.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as it deploys slowly throughout the territory, the force
has begun to engage in small fire fights with militias. Military
officers say they believe that some of the militia members are in
fact renegade Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The international force has also begun finding evidence of
killings in twos and threes and fours, bodies in wells, in creek
beds, in ponds and in fields. But so far, the troops and U.N.
officials say, they have not found evidence of the large-scale
massacres that had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is expected in the coming days to approve the
creation of an international administration for the newborn nation,
backed by 10,000 soldiers, that would run its affairs for two to
three years while Gusmao and his allies put a government apparatus
in place.
</P>
<P>
   That process will require the writing of a constitution, the
passing of laws and the creation of the fundamentals of an
independent nation, from law enforcement to electrical power
supply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The creation of a new East Timor will literally be from the
ground up. Most people now have no houses. Those with houses often
have no roofs. And for now, few building materials or tools are to
be found anywhere in the burned and vandalized territory.
</P>
<P>
   Small markets have sprung up in Dili and in some other towns.
But they sell almost nothing besides vegetables and black-market
Indonesian military rations. International aid agencies have begun
streaming into the territory, often competing or working at cross
purposes with one another, according to officials there.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups have set up clinics and hospitals, and the news from
those centers offers a rare encouraging sign _ there is little
evidence of starvation, epidemic or injury by armed men.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese have been driven from
their houses and are still too frightened to return from
mountainside refuges. But the humanitarian disaster that had been
feared has not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking in this aftermath is the seeming pointlessness
of the campaign against the East Timorese. Six weeks after it
began, it is evident that the rampage of destruction, killings and
forced evacuations _ unlike many other eruptions of violence around
the world _ was not fired by any ideology, territorial claim,
ethnic conflict or tactical design.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage appeared to be an almost wholly negative enterprise
of retribution, engineered by what may have been a relatively small
group in the Indonesian military, against a people who had rejected
them after a failed 24-year campaign of armed pacification.
</P>
<P>
   As they departed, Indonesian soldiers or their militia
surrogates set fire to almost every administrative building,
including their own barracks, that could be used by a new
government. On the burned out buildings they left graffiti that
served as explanatory captions like ``Freedom in the jungle.'' And,
in a warning that people there would starve: ``A free East Timor
will eat stones.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last small units of Indonesian soldiers are pulling out
now, following the vote of their parliament, and Friday the last
word belonged to Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to kill us,'' he said. ``But we are still here,
crying and suffering but still alive. We will rebuild our homeland.
Nothing can stop us.''

REPORT ON HALF-NAKED
 NEWSCAST TURNS OUT
 HALF-BAKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - It was just the kind of tasty morsel a critic of TV
news loves to munch. A new nightly newscast, featuring anchors and
re porters wearing bikinis and Speedos, is coming soon on cable TV.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How low can TV news go?
</P>
<P>
   ``The broadcast is slated to debut in January, from Miami's
South Beach,'' reported the media maga zine Brill's Content in its
November issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all goes as planned, Bare Essen tials News will deliver the
national news in a half-hour time slot be tween 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
every week night.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's Florida producers are ``scouring the top journalism
schools for talented young journalists who have good grades and
great bodies,'' said a blurb in the Los Angeles Times last month.
</P>
<P>
   A producer said the show was squarely in line with the finest
traditions of TV journalism. All news programs pander for ratings,
he said, and his is just the first that's willing to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give it that much. But what a sterling example of how
shallow television news is becoming, I thought. It reminded me of a
recent complaint by another TV news critic, Bill Moyers. Pressures
to attract more viewers have led many TV operations to seek ``the
fastest, cheapest, easiest way to get an audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What could be cheaper than drawing people to news with sheer sex
appeal?
</P>
<P>
   My ranting was cut short, however, when I found a story about
the show from the Miami Herald. Terry Jack son, the paper's TV
critic, wrote earlier this week that the Brill's report about Bare
Essentials News airing in January was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Schorr, a Miami entrepreneur who came up with the fleshy
idea, told him the show was just an idea that hasn't gone much
beyond the concept stage. Schorr told me the same Thursday, Oct.
21st.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald's story said Nicholas Varchaver, senior editor at
Brill's Content, acknowledged that the magazine ``didn't nail down
the very tentative nature'' of the show before giving it prominent
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew it,'' Varchaver is quoted as telling the Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brill's Content considers itself a media watchdog and
regularly puts the bite on other journalists, this was interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I called Varchaver to confirm his candid admission.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``We blew it'' quote was taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Those words referred to a part of the story that said the same
producers had come up with a hit show called Senior Prom, a dating
game for people over 50, that was syndicated in 35 markets.
Varchaver said he could find no evidence that the dating show ever
aired. The maga zine will say so in a correction next month.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he doesn't think the bikini-clad newscast will
ever go on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Then why not also set the record straight about Bare Essentials
News?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our story demonstrated skepticism about that show,'' Varchaver
said, lamely.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the sort of weaseling you would expect from a
magazine that preaches accountability and pub lishes in each issue
a statement of principles saying journalists ``should be eager'' to
correct ``mistakes of fact, context and fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reported that a show using half-naked newscasters
is scheduled to be broadcast in three months, and it's not true.
The editor doesn't believe the show will ever be broadcast, yet he
contends no correc tion is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   That seems irresponsible not only to me, but also to Schorr, the
man who would like to produce the newscast but concedes it's still
little more than a concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brill's has egg all over its face,'' he said. ``It ran a story
reported by an intern without verifying it. The mag azine lambastes
other media for premature and inaccurate reporting. That's exactly
what this was.''
</P>
<P>
   TV news is often justly criticized for superficial reporting,
for jumping on an attention-grabbing item and pumping it up. Here's
a case of the same thing being done by a maga zine, one that
aspires to be an aggressive watchdog tracking down slipshod
journalism. Brill's got the story wrong and ought to set it right.

EXPERTS SAY LAPSES LED TO JAPAN'S A-PLANT FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; graf 2 is new, and graf 3 is substantially

 By MATTHEW L. WALD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Japanese nuclear accident three weeks ago
occurred largely because managers counted on workers to follow
rules but never explained why the rules were important, three
Energy Department experts said Friday after touring the plant this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said at a news conference here that managers should
have concentrated on providing equipment designed to make such
accidents impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical reports in Japan contest this view of the accident,
suggesting that the plant's workers routinely took dangerous
shortcuts that violated rules and were encouraged to do so by plant
managers in an effort to increase productivity.
</P>
<P>
   At the Japanese Embassy here, a spokesman said officials were
trying to obtain a transcript of the experts' remarks and would not
comment until then.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Frank McCoy, deputy manager of the
Energy Department's Savannah River Operations Office, said that
Japanese officials had performed a safety evaluation of the plant,
at Tokaimura, and concluded that an accidental reaction was
impossible. Based on that, the plant had no emergency plan, he
said. The plant processes nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the technicians were trying to carry out a task using
incorrect equipment. ``Using the system in the right way was more
difficult than anyone would have desired,'' he said. McCoy and his
colleagues gave a description that made the job sound like trying
to bake a cake in a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   The experts, an official delegation invited by the Japanese
government, gave a detailed explanation of the accident, on Sept.
30, in which technicians brought too much uranium together in one
spot and created an unintended chain reaction that continued for 17
hours. They were dissolving a powdered form of uranium with an acid
and had planned to ship it to another plant for baking into solid
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The workers should have stored the material in a tall
column-shaped cylinder, a shape that would have prevented a
critical mass from forming, said Leroy Lewis, a chemist at the
Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. But, he
added, the spigot to draw liquids out of that container was about 4
inches off the ground, suitable for filling a low, flat pan, which
is used in the process for which the tank is normally used. In this
case, the workers wanted to fill a taller container.
</P>
<P>
   So the workers put the dissolved uranium in a second vessel,
intended for another purpose entirely, the experts said. It had a
spigot that was easier to use. But the vessel was circular, a shape
that encourages a chain reaction. Worse, it was surrounded with a
shell filled with cooling water, and the water functioned as a
reflector, bouncing neutrons from the uranium back into the tank,
improving the conditions for a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The workers did not understand the reason behind the rules that
limit the sizes of batches and containers, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers stopped the reaction by smashing a pipe
connected to the water shell, letting the water drain.
</P>
<P>
   The American approach would be to assure that there were no
containers present in which material could form a critical mass,
the experts said. The size and shape of such a container would vary
according to the material being handled.
</P>
<P>
   For the uranium that the Japanese were processing, the
containers would have to be smaller or would have to be flat or
columnlike.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Japanese Embassy said officials were trying
to obtain a transcript of the experts' remarks and would not
comment until then. News reports in Japan suggest that the workers
routinely took dangerous shortcuts that violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department experts said that although the Tokaimura
accident let out a huge shower of radiation in the form of gamma
rays and neutrons, those emissions ended when the reaction stopped.
In other accidents, including Chernobyl, the problem after the
reaction ends has been the dispersal of radioactive materials _
unstable atoms, mostly from splitting uranium or plutonium, that
emit rays or subatomic particles for days or years.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokaimura, the experts said, the radioactive materials were
almost entirely contained in the vessel where the reaction
occurred.

6,000 U.N PEACEKEEPERS TO BE SENT TO SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to clarify time frame; changes in grafs 1, 3, 4 and 5.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council voted Friday to authorize
a 6,000-member peacekeeping force for Sierra Leone, where an uneasy
coalition of elected officials and former rebels has pledged to
restore order after the latest round of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main tasks of the peacekeepers will be to collect
weapons from rebel factions and help reintegrate their forces,
numbering up to 45,000, into society. They will also be responsible
for protecting relief workers and for the distribution of aid in a
shattered country.
</P>
<P>
   The U &UR; . &LR; N &UR; . &LR;  force will oper- ate with troops from a West
African peacekeeping unit that is dominated by Nigerians, who have
given mixed signals about how long they want to stay. That force
has recently been as high as as 12,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nigerians are already on the scene, and since it will
take some time for the United Nations to put together troops from
other countries, the Nigerians seem likely to be asked to dedicate
troops to form the major part of the U &UR; . &LR; N &UR; . &LR;  operation. What other
countries may contribute personnel has not been decided, but the
United States will be asked to pay one-third of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   With approval of a U.N. force of 10,000 for East Timor also
expected in the next few days, the issue of money has become more
acute. The United States is in arrears on its dues by hundreds of
millions of dollars, and there is less and less support in Congress
to pay the ever-rising bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action Friday, the Security Council extended for a
month the term of a smaller operation in the Central African
Republic, where President Ange-Felix Patasse began a second term in
office amid continued political tensions. The country has been
unstable for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, preoccupied with crises in the Balkans and
East Timor, has been under pressure from African nations and other
countries to pay more attention to Africa, with greater priority
given to the war centered in Congo, which has involved more than
half a dozen nations in shifting alliances.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the United Nations may have to set up a
substantial peacekeeping operation in Congo. But officials here,
who have so far sent only liaison officers to neighboring countries
of Congo, say there has to be a durable truce first.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, rebels who fought the government of President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah have been responsible for brutal acts of
violence. The rebels chopped off the hands or legs of thousands of
civilians, including many children, as warnings or punishment.
Thousands of others have died, and half a million people were
driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   To reach a peace agreement with two competing rebel leaders,
Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul Koroma, Kabbah agreed to give them
amnesty and positions in government, a move that was sharply
criticized by human rights groups. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
among those expressing reservations about the deal struck with the
rebels, which was signed July 7.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a speech to the Security Council, Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, said Washington had offered to
help Sierra Leone establish a truth and reconciliation commission
to deal with past atrocities. ``Like the secretary-general,'' he
said, ``we are concerned by the provisions for amnesty. We remain
committed to justice and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Sierra Leone this
week and discussed the next steps in restoring order with both the
government and rebel leaders. She described what she saw as
``unspeakable horror.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials and diplomats from other nations say the
Kabbah government had no choice but to accept rebel demands for a
share in power after Nigeria, which restored the president to power
nine months after he was overthrown and then kept the rebels at
bay, said it was uncertain about how long it could continue its
role. No other nation, African or otherwise, volunteered to take on
the job of keeping order.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed Friday gives the force a six-month initial
mandate, but is renewable. It requires that the peacekeeping force
sent to Sierra Leone include ``personnel with appropriate training
in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law,
including child and gender-related provisions.''

MAKERS OF WATER HEATERS OFFER TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE PART

 HEATERS 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest manufacturers of water heaters, trying to
stop mounting legal and public relations problems, have agreed to
repair up to 14 million water heaters that have a defective piece
of plastic pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, filed late Thursday at the U.S. District Court in
Kansas City, will include mass mailings and ads in hundreds of
newspapers to notify customers of the problem. The industry had
previously downplayed the problem but is offering the agreement to
settle class-action lawsuits across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge still must approve the settlement, but it has
been agreed to by the manufacturers of virtually every water heater
made in the United States and two dozen law firms who have sued
them.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, first reported on in January by The Kansas City
Star, involves a piece of plastic pipe called a dip tube, which
funnels cold water to the bottom of the water heater. A defect in
the tubes causes them to disintegrate, making the water heater less
able to produce hot water and clogging water lines with plastic
chips as the tubes dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement would replace, if the consumer files a claim, dip
tubes in any of an estimated 14 million water heaters made from
August 1993 to October 1996. In addition, those who have already
paid for repairs will be able to be reimbursed for at least $175 of
their expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who believe that their faucets, dishwashers and other
plumbing or appliances have been ruined by the plastic chips also
will be eligible to have those items repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys and others involved in the settlement declined to
specify the settlement's price tag. But if 10 percent of affected
consumers took advantage of the offer, the expense could exceed
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the settlement is Perfection Corp., the Ohio company
that made the defective dip tubes, which cost less than $1 each.
The manufacturers say they will seek to recover from Perfection any
costs for correcting the dip-tube problem.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Perfection said Friday that a dispute with its
insurers kept it from joining the proposed settlement. The proposed
settlement's costs, if they all had to be paid by Perfection, would
put the company's future in doubt, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This threatens Perfection's existence,'' said William Mertens,
an attorney for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement is a striking turnaround from earlier
this year, when Perfection and the water-heater companies
downplayed the problem. Perfection, the primary supplier of dip
tubes to the water-heater industry, acknowledged that from 1993 to
1996 it had left out an important additive that kept the tubes from
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   But while millions of defective tubes were in use, Perfection
and the water-heater companies insisted that the number that would
fail would be quite small _ perhaps no more than 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised over how accurate such an estimate could
be since the defect had not been publicized but at least 10,000
heaters had been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers usually reimbursed customers for repairs if
the problem was brought to their attention, but there was no recall
of the heaters or notification to affected consumers. Indeed,
earlier this year the manufacturers' Web pages didn't even mention
the dip-tube problem.
</P>
<P>
   That low-key approach, as much as the defective dip tubes,
seemed to arouse the ire of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Phelps of Northbrook, Ill., recently spent $250 to
replace a faucet that had been clogged by the plastic chips before
he saw a news story about the dip tubes and discovered his water
heater had the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can break, but I'm less forgiving if they don't admit
it,'' said Phelps, the editor of an engineering magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The water-heater companies and Perfection now concede that they
underestimated the problem, although they still believe only a
fraction of the defective dip tubes will fail.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the problem spread, so did the manufacturers' legal
and public relations woes. The proposed settlement seeks to make
the debate about the number of tubes that will fail irrelevant
because all of the defective dip tubes _ whether they have begun to
disintegrate or not _ would be eligible for replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to do the right thing,'' said Ralph Phalen, an
attorney for Humphrey Farrington &AMP; McClain in Independence and
co-lead counsel in the settlement talks. Phalen and his colleague,
Garrett Hodes, filed the first class-action lawsuits against the
water-heater makers.
</P>
<P>
   The water-heater companies approving the settlement are Rheem
Manufacturing Co., American Water Heater Group, Bradford White
Corp., A.O. Smith Water Products Co. and State Industries Inc.,
which says it used the defective tubes only in late 1994 and early
1995. A manufacturer of commercial water heaters, Lochinvar Corp.,
also has endorsed the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   None of the settlement's provisions will go into effect until
they are approved by U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs, who among
other things will look at its fairness to consumers. But court
documents specify what the manufacturers have agreed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who have already made repairs will have until June 30,
2000, to file a claim for reimbursement up to $175, which will
automatically be deemed ``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Any costs over that amount will have to be approved by a
``special circumstances panel'' made up of plumbers. The panel
members are to be approved by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Those who haven't made any repairs will have until Dec. 31,
2000, to file a claim to replace the dip tube and _ if the tube is
dissolving _ to flush out their water heater and water lines. They
will receive a certificate that will be given to the plumber who
does the work.

   Class-action lawsuits have been criticized for often failing to
do little more than generate fees for lawyers. Attorneys filing the
dip-tube lawsuits will receive fees up to $5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Baker of Orange Beach, Ala., says he'll do his part to
make sure the manufacturers pay. He recently spent two weeks trying
to find out why there were plastic chips in his bath water before
finally being told about the dip tubes.
</P>
<P>
   He was so angry at the lack of available information that he
stood up during his church's services to tell the congregation
about the dip tubes and that he was available to share the
information he had gathered.
</P>
<P>
   After services, about two dozen people told him that they, too,
had the problem, he said. Some had tears in their eyes, he said,
after telling him they had already paid for the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just sad,'' he said. ``You shouldn't have to go through
this.'' (30)

AS THE WORLD TURNS

<P>
   All American presidents nearing the end of their terms become
lame ducks. But there are different degrees of presidential
hobbling. Unfortunately, President Clinton and some conservative
Republicans in Congress are restricting Washington's freedom of
action in a world that will not wait for a new US president to take
office.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries cannot be faulted for reading the Senate's vote
this month against the Test Ban Treaty as a troubling symptom of a
dysfunctional superpower. Although Republican administrations
initiated the arms control process that led to the test ban and the
United States ceased testing nuclear weapons during the tenure of
George Bush, a cluster of isolationists and arms control skeptics
in the Senate played on enmity for Clinton to defeat the treaty. At
the same time, allies such as Britain and France that had ratified
the treaty must have been bemused by Clinton's dilatory efforts to
lobby for votes in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The unpleasant truth is that no party and no faction wins if
America's allies and rivals sense that US foreign policy might be
paralyzed for 15 more months by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opponents in Congress may have potent reasons for
disliking him, but some of their efforts to humiliate him risk
humiliating the country and undermining its security.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton makes a harmful mistake if he tries to
preserve his own legacy by berating Republicans for their
obstructionism in order to endow his party with winning issues for
attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties, Congress, and the president need to act on an
understanding that there are some matters more grave than winning
partisan political advantage. And if such an understanding is to
permeate the country's political class, the press will have to play
its part in preserving some perspective on political conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is an important
story not because it signified a personal rebuke of Clinton but
because it might make it harder to keep India, Pakistan, China, and
Russia from developing nuclear weapons. When Republicans refuse to
appropriate the funds promised to Israel and the Palestinian
Authority to implement their Wye River Agreement, the crucial
consequences will be played out in the geopolitics of the Mideast,
not in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the advent of a new administration, a number of
international challenges will confront the United States. In each
of these there ought to be room for a debate that leads to a
national consensus. But consensus will be possible only if
Clinton-haters in Congress subordinate their personal animus to the
general good and if Clinton performs the hard political task of
consulting and courting a responsible opposition _ as he did in
garnering support for NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   On the docket right now are negotiations with Beijing for
China's accession to the World Trade Organization. One of Clinton's
worst blunders was his failure to accept trade concessions offered
to him last April by China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji. Clinton
mistakenly thought there would be too much Republican opposition to
a WTO deal. He failed to count votes, and he compounded his error
with a display of political cowardice. Now it will be much harder
to obtain the bipartisan consensus needed to bring China into the
WTO and end the annual debate over China's trading status with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another question that cannot be postponed is how to prevent
North Korea from developing nuclear arms and long-range missiles.
After an extensive review of policy toward North Korea, former
defense secretary William Perry told the Senate this month that if
Pyongyang ``is willing to forgo its long-range missile program as
well as its nuclear weapons program, we should be willing to move
step by step on a path to a comprehensive normalization of
relations, including the establishment of a permanent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative strategy, a resort to military containment,
would be ``expensive and dangerous,'' Perry said. To avoid those
costs and dangers, Congress will have to muster bipartisan support
for the track leading to normalization, and the White House will
have to orchestrate cooperation among the United States, Japan, and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Peace in the Mideast, China's entry into the WTO, and the taming
of North Korea _ these matters are too serious to be decided by the
narcissistic feuds of domestic American politics.

   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's proposal to add the Atlantic
salmon to the endangered species list has put federal and Maine
officials at odds after several years of cooperation. A smooth
working relationship between the two levels of government is vital
if the species is to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict emerged earlier this month when a report by two
federal agencies found the wild Atlantic salmon close to
extinction. When Babbitt's office hinted it might change the status
of the salmon from ``threatened'' to ``endangered,'' Maine's
governor, Angus King, and Senator Olympia Snowe cried foul, calling
the move for tighter restrictions a betrayal of two years of
federal-state cooperation in restoring salmon stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The raw numbers are discouraging. Surveys of Maine rivers used
by salmon for spawning have found only 29 fish returning this year.
The issue is complicated by rapid growth of salmon aquaculture in
Maine, now a $60 million industry. Federal officials claim that
some of these fish are escaping and mating with wild salmon to the
detriment of the species. Maine officials counter that the problem
is European salmon escaping from Greenland hatcheries, over which
neither state nor federal officials have authority. In either case,
it is essential that dependable barriers prevent the escape of the
European hybrids used in Maine hatcheries, and spawning rivers must
be monitored against invasion by non-Atlantic salmon. Federal
officials also wisely recommend wider use of American hybrids,
which are less threatening genetically to Atlantic salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Fish farming can play a role in the economic recovery of Maine's
coast _ provided it is properly managed. The key is close
cooperation among governments and aquaculturists to preserve the
unique character of the Atlantic salmon, which is seriously
threatened despite what appeared only a few years ago to be good
chances of recovery.

 Starve-Abuses  Second triplet in abuse case dies  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Eight-year-old Gary Bass died at a hospital
early Friday, two days after police found him and his brother, both
emaciated and burned, inside their northeast Kansas City home.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Larry Bass, was pronounced dead Wednesday night at
the house. Gary was rushed to a hospital, but died about 2:15 a.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were triplets. The other triplet and two other siblings
who lived at the house were not abused, police said. The three
surviving children have been placed in protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' mother, Mary L. Bass, 31, was charged Thursday with 10
felonies for allegedly abusing Larry and Gary. The charges didn't
include murder and were not upgraded after Gary's death because
prosecutors were waiting for the medical examiner's report on Larry
and Gary.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time we will see if the charges need to be modified,''
said Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird. ``In any case, you need
to have a cause of death established scientifically.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said he expected the medical examiner's reports early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Because the boys' bodies will not be released by the medical
examiner until the reports are finished, funeral arrangements have
not been made. Alvin Brooks, president of the Ad Hoc Group Against
Crime, said Friday that he had called Mary Bass to ask whether any
family members could arrange the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Bass told him that her father, who lives in Kansas City, could
help, but she did not know that Gary had died. Brooks said he had
to tell her. She then asked him if he would visit her in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and others met with her for about 40 minutes late Friday
afternoon. She asked Brooks to call her supervisor at the Federal
Aviation Administration to tie up some loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   And she asked him to get apple cider and soda pop to her older
children for their school Halloween parties next week, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged abuse at the Bass home was brought to the attention
of police about 7:25 p.m. Wednesday, when Mary Bass found Larry
unresponsive and called police. When officers arrived, they saw
Gary was sick, too.
</P>
<P>
   Court records say Mary Bass told police that, to discipline the
boys, she had locked them in a bedroom for up to two weeks at a
time, feeding them only bread and water and allowing them out for
restroom breaks. Last Friday, the boys' feet were dunked in
scalding water, court records said. The wounds went untreated
except for some ointment and gauze pads, police said.
</P>
<P>
   All five of Mary Bass' children shared the name Bass, but the
siblings had different fathers. Relatives said Mary Thomas, her
maiden name, met Ronald Bass in high school and later became
pregnant, giving birth to a daughter in early 1987. She and Bass
married in May 1987 and had a son two years later. She then dated
another man and became pregnant with the triplets. Ronald stayed
with Mary and treated the triplets as his own, said his mother,
Gloria Bass of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald and Mary divorced when the triplets were about 2. Ronald
moved to Fort Wayne, Ind., Gloria Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ordered Ronald to pay $365 in child support each month,
but it was not clear Friday whether he complied. Gloria Bass said
her son last saw his children and the triplets when he was in town
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stayed here with me for a week,'' she said. ``All of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bass earned a certificate in accounting from Penn Valley
Community College, police said. In 1997, she got a job with the
FAA. An agency spokesman, Tony Molinaro, said she had started as a
secretary in the civil-rights office, but transferred to the Flight
Standards Division last year.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Mary Bass bought a four-bedroom, 2-story house
for $58,000. The house was kept clean and neat, but sparse: Police
said all the furnishings could fit into one room.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said Mary Bass' career prospects were looking up, but her
home life was troubled. Mary Bass also told police she had trouble
juggling the demands of a full-time job, going to school and
raising five children.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide Capt. Darryl Forte said Mary Bass told them she had
talked with Division of Family Services workers several times. It
was not clear what action, if any, was taken after the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Hendricks, a spokeswoman for the division, said the court
has ordered Bass' three remaining children put into foster care.
But she said state law prohibits her from saying whether the
division ever had contact with the Bass family.
</P>
<P>
   The triplets were enrolled at Swinney Elementary School this
year, but officials said only Jerry Bass attended regularly. The
school principal referred questions to the central district office.
No one was available there to say whether the school reported
Larry's and Gary's absences or whether any of the siblings showed
signs of abuse. But the mother of one student said classmates
commented on how skinny one Bass child was.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and other school officials are required to report
suspected child abuse to the state Division of Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Jones, Jackson County children services director, said
her agency is evaluating whether her staff acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for any reason our staff didn't do what it should have,
we'll take appropriate action,'' Jones said. ``That could involve
more staff training all the way up to termination.''
</P>
<P>
   Both boys' deaths also will be the subject of a Child Fatality
Review Panel, Jones said. The panel, which includes social workers,
prosecutors and advocacy groups, looks for ways to prevent similar
incidents.

 TV movie causing concern  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES, FINN BULLERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 2000, computers malfunction in unexpected ways,
causing global chaos, catapulting the Washington, D.C., Y2K crash
team into a nonstop race to keep the most frightening consequences
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Promos like that one began running this week for ``Y2K,'' a Year
2000 suspense thriller on NBC. Unable to resist the temptation to
exploit Y2K anxiety, NBC will air the made-for-TV movie on Sunday,
Nov. 21, during ratings sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   It has already alarmed some Y2K experts, whose greatest
remaining fear is the potential for public panic in the weeks
building up to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's akin to yelling fire in a crowded theater,'' said John
Castagna, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute in
Washington, a trade association of electric utilities that has
spent billions fixing year 2000 problems. ``It's absolutely the
wrong thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Edison Electric has launched an aggressive letter-writing
campaign to NBC affiliates urging them to either rethink airing the
movie or provide free rebuttal time.
</P>
<P>
   Relax, says NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a concern, it's only because people haven't seen
the movie yet,'' said Rosalyn Weinman, the network's executive vice
president for broadcasting, who has seen rough cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you, it's a classic thriller. And if people in
Y2K worry about this movie, it's like the transportation authority
worried about the movie `Speed' and what it says about buses.''
</P>
<P>
   KSHB-TV's programming director, Dana Boyd, said she wasn't aware
of any controversy and would take the issue up with her boss. And
Y2K planners with the Mid-America Regional Council also plan to
discuss what they can do to ease the potential for panic.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. studio had earlier rejected a similar Y2K
project.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBC movie, actor Ken Olin (``L.A. Doctors'') is
crackerjack computer expert Nick Cromwell, who is recruited to work
on the government's ``Z2'' (think zero-zero) project. And as the
minutes tick down, he persuades his boss to ground all airplanes,
just before the Eastern seaboard suffers a serious power outage.
</P>
<P>
   By using old-fashioned ingenuity, Cromwell saves the day. A
happy ending. ``Remember,'' one NBC spokeswoman says. ``We work for
General Electric, and they care very much about how this is
perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fear, the electric institute's Castagna said, is that
``some audiences will not be able to separate fact and fiction.''
And without disclaimers running before the show airs, he envisions
a ``War of the Worlds'' reaction in which some viewers will make
bad decisions based on ``bad television.''
</P>
<P>
   The North American Electric Reliability Council has added its
own words of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope NBC will be a good corporate citizen and recognize the
dangers involved in hyping a negative situation that could feed
people's concerns,'' spokesman Eugene Gorzelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Meyer, spokesman for the Senate's Y2K committee, doesn't
make too much of the movie, saying viewers are smart enough to
separate fiction from fact. ``The movie,'' he said, ``is not likely
to blur the lines anymore than the ripped-from-today's-headlines
genre we see on `Law &AMP; Order.' ''
</P>
<P>
   John Hall of the American Bankers Association, a group that in
the past has been thin-skinned about Y2K, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we would prefer the movie not be shown, but we're
confident that people will see this as strictly entertainment,'' he
said, ``just as they did with `Terminator II.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K on PBS
</P>
<P>
   If the disaster genre is too rich for your blood, public
television has a Y2K offering worth viewing this week.
</P>
<P>
   Robert X. Cringely, former high-tech gossip columnist for
/{InfoWorld/} and one of the first dozen employees hired by Apple
Computer in 1977, presents ``Y2K: The Winter of our Disconnect'' at
7 p.m. and midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-hour show, Cringely's car breaks down near St.
Helens, Ore., his rural backdrop for ``dissecting, decoding and
debugging'' the Y2K quandary.
</P>
<P>
   How low can you go?
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the Mid-America Regional Council's Y2K community
forums continues to be sparse.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 18 persons attended a forum at Longview Community
College after about 1,800 publicity fliers were sent to
neighborhood organizers. And two days earlier, five attended a
forum at Penn Valley Community College _ one member of the audience
for every three panelists.
</P>
<P>
   Forum organizers with the President's Year 2000 Conversion
Council say attendance is better in smaller rural communities,
where free barbecue is on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The next Y2K forum in the Kansas City area is scheduled from 7
to 9 p.m. Tuesday in the large conference room of Blue River
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Ripples of Y2K
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Maine, the secretary of state's office has issued
``horseless carriage'' titles to the owners and lien-holders of
about 2,000 modern-day vehicles after computers there lost track of
100 years of history.
</P>
<P>
   Confused computers thought the vehicle model year was 1900, and
titles were printed with the ``horseless carriage'' designation
used for vintage vehicles produced before 1916.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major systems that affect health and safety are in pretty
good shape,'' a spokesman for Gov. Angus King said. ``And we're
pretty sure if there is a problem, it will be this kind and not
something serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, a woman paid $15,440 to buy stomach pills from
scam artists after they told her they could cure the Y2k bug,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old woman, who apparently did not know whether the
bug was a computer problem or a physical ailment, handed over the
money after she was convinced she could make a tidy sum by
reselling the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hong Kong woman, police said, paid another large sum
this month to buy electrical components from three scammers,
thinking they could be resold for astronomical profits to fix the
Y2K problem.

TALK ABOUT NEW BALLPARK DOWNTOWN MAKES NO SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A couple of things distinguish David Glass
from most of the rest of Kansas City's sports fans and downtown
boosters. For one thing, he's got a lot more money. For another he
has a better sense of the area's needs when it comes to sports
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   His comments to The Kansas City Star sports columnist Jeffrey
Flanagan this week were a reminder of how lucky Kansas City is to
have Glass in charge of one of the community's most valuable civic
assets. As chief exec of the Royals, Glass seems dumbfounded by the
recent discussion of how wonderful it would be to build a new
downtown baseball stadium. His levelheaded reaction revealed the
extraordinary business savvy that put him on a career path to help
build the world's largest retail enterprise and ultimately head it.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Kauffman Stadium is ``one of the finest _ if not the
finest _ in baseball,'' he wondered, ``why...anyone would even talk
about a new baseball stadium in Kansas City is beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too. The reactive thoughts not only have focused on the lack
of need, but also on the community's spotty record of
accomplishment in such matters.
</P>
<P>
   If momentum for a new sports palace builds, has anyone thought
about where it would be situated? How about next to the snazzy
Power &AMP; Light District entertainment-retail-office complex proposed
for downtown? After the games, everyone could fall by Planet
Hollywood for a late dinner and nightcap. (Assuming, that is, the
Centertainment development gets built and Planet Hollywood doesn't
slide into oblivion.)
</P>
<P>
   South of Bartle Hall might have been another possibility, but
that area's recently been spoken for as a site for a performing
arts center. Given the promised development that hasn't come to
fruition there over the past couple of decades, though, it's a bit
early to start counting chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture? Those who call sports gabfest shows and chat
about building this or that sports facility don't seem to
understand how difficult it has become to make big Kansas City
dreams into big realities.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, nobody talking the talk seems able or willing to do
much more than talk. All the mindless palaver that occurs on sports
talkathons aside, those with power and money seem reluctant to do
big deals unless it's with other people's money.
</P>
<P>
   Union Station's rebirth, for example, certainly wouldn't have
been possible without average folk stepping up to the plate and
volunteering to be taxed to see this dream realized. Meanwhile, the
next big deal is occurring over in the other Kansas City as work
continues apace on the NASCAR track, which is a really big deal in
the annals of sports dreams coming true for a community.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-line message of recent history in these pursuits, it
seems, is that some dreamers are in bad need of a reality check.
Talk, as always, is cheap. When it ignores the value of existing
assets, however, it's the mark of a community badly in need of
can-do leadership.

 POLICE GIVE WOMAN A CHOICe: HER BROTHER OR HER GRANDKIDS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City was already on edge when Carl J.
Miera arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Pamela Butler had just been kidnapped. Then, Miera
_ a Colorado parolee convicted of sexually assaulting a 6-year-old
girl _ moved to the Hickman Mills area of south Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned that Miera was staying with his sister, Lucy
Aguirre, who baby-sits eight young children _ half of them her own
grandchildren _ at her home.
</P>
<P>
   Miera, 46, spent the last 16 years in a Colorado prison. Aguirre
said he called two weeks ago saying he needed a place to stay while
he got his life back together.
</P>
<P>
   Miera, she said, had received death threats since his release
Oct. 7, so she agreed to let him move in.
</P>
<P>
   To her it was simply helping out family.
</P>
<P>
   To Kansas City police the arrangement did not seem so benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has done his time,'' said Maj. Rachel Whipple. ``But
at the same time, I don't want him around kids. It's hard to
predict who is still dangerous and who isn't. But you just don't
put kids at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado authorities had alerted Kansas City police of Miera's
move. And upon his arrival Oct. 13, Miera registered as a sex
offender with the Jackson County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors were notified by the South Patrol Division. Police
also contacted the Missouri Department of Family Services, and on
Wednesday an officer and a social worker visited the Aguirre home.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, they told her, was that she could not continue
to watch the children while Miera lived at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was either him or my grandkids,'' Aguirre said
softly. ``They didn't even give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the children's safety comes first, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a responsibility to keep these kids safe while they
are in her care,'' said Family Services spokeswoman Deb Hendricks.
``We were just working with law enforcement to try to protect these
children.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Aguirre said, Miera packed his bags and
took the first bus back to Colorado to stay with another relative.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County sheriff's officials have since confirmed he has
left the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he is actually committing a crime, we have no authority
to bother him, nor should we,'' Whipple said. ``But this is one
where we felt that possibly children were in danger, so we're
obliged to be a little more proactive.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _Kansas City high school student Laura Prewitt
and her friends have heard the reassurances _ loss of state
accreditation won't keep qualified students out of good colleges.
But they're not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear one thing and something else always comes up, and I end
up asking more questions,'' said Prewitt, a junior at Lincoln
College Preparatory Academy who hopes to go to the College of
William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Board of Education voted this week to take away the
Kansas City School District's accreditation, effective next May.
</P>
<P>
   But admissions officers at area colleges say graduating from a
school that doesn't have state accreditation won't wipe out a
student's eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   If the student has good ACT or SAT scores, excellent grades in
hard classes and a strong class rank, the student's application
will be impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes personal interviews and college-administered entrance
tests in math or English also can help admissions officers decide
whether a student will succeed in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ways to get at the truth,'' said Mark
Kopenski, vice president for enrollment at Rockhurst University,
which enrolls several dozen district students each year. ``If you
see a terrific kid from the Kansas City public schools and they
have great test scores and they're highly motivated, we won't shut
them out. We want that kid here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Smith, director of admissions at the University of
Missouri-Columbia, said admissions officers will work with students
who show promise, regardless of their school's accreditation
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to leave the students in the lurch in a time
when the school district will be working toward reestablishing
their situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Home schools, as well as many private and charter schools,
aren't accredited, but colleges evaluate those graduates on their
scores on the ACT or SAT, their grades and which classes they took.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Gordon has been a guidance counselor for 10 years at
Lincoln, where more than nine of 10 students went on to a four-year
college last year and where the students' average ACT score of 23.4
was the highest in the district.
</P>
<P>
   She said students continue to worry even though they've been
reassured that colleges still will consider them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much emotion that they're not hearing everything
they need to hear,'' Gordon said. ``I think this should be an
incentive for them to really apply themselves even more. Eyes pop
open when scores are good and the curriculum is challenging and the
student has done well.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Lincoln is accredited by the North Central Association of
Colleges and Schools, which should help smooth the application
process, Lincoln's principal told students Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The North Central Association was established so that colleges
would know an applicant was coming from a school with good academic
standards, without investigating each high school themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Other Kansas City high schools _ Central, Paseo, Southeast and
Van Horn _ also have North Central accreditation. The association
does not accredit whole school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation through regional associations like North Central
is voluntary. The association looks at criteria including teacher
qualifications, school offerings such as classrooms and library
volumes, and students' academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shaw, Missouri director for the North Central
Association, said accredited schools are reviewed each year to
ensure they're meeting the association's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of state accreditation could hurt Kansas City schools'
reviews by North Central, if the loss further erodes teacher
qualifications and academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, it could have serious consequences, but it doesn't
mean that North Central would immediately say, `You're
unaccredited,' '' Shaw said. ``They'd say, for example, `You have
to clear this up before next year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainties frustrate students who are looking toward
college.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Bell is a Lincoln junior who plans to apply to Spelman
College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave Lincoln,'' she said. ``But I don't want
to stay if they lose accreditation and I can't go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Spearman, a Lincoln junior who hopes to be accepted at
Xavier University, said Kansas City high school students probably
should take the initiative and call the schools they want to go to
and ask how admissions officers will evaluate students from a

KC SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ARGUE IN COURT AGAINST LOSS OF
ACCREDITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple on Tuesday will hear arguments
on whether the Kansas City School District's loss of accreditation
will hinder its desegregation efforts and chances of being freed
from federal court control.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Board of Education voted unanimously Thursday to
strip the district of accreditation, effective May 1, after it
failed to meet any of 11 performance standards on the latest state
review.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are asking Whipple to block the state's action
and seeking to have the state once again named as a defendant in
the desegregation lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed this week, district lawyers argued that
the loss of accreditation _ the state's stamp of approval _ would
make it impossible for the district to improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain how Whipple will act. But in a January court
order that dismissed Missouri as a defendant in the desegregation
lawsuit, Whipple wrote: ``The state should be warned by its
twenty-one year involvement in this case against taking any actions
which might prevent the (district) from ultimately fulfilling its
court-ordered remedial goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren,
said Friday he thought the state's action certainly will have that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want for the district to meet its court-ordered
obligations sooner or later,'' Benson said. ``The state action may
have made later more likely.''
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Robert Bartman on Friday said he
did not think the state's action and the court's goals are mutually
exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court-ordered goals and our goals are about the same,''
Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said no one in Kansas City should have been caught off
guard by the state board's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was describe the condition of education in the
Kansas City district,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jay Nixon, whose office would represent the
state in the desegregation lawsuit, could not be reached for
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials contend losing accreditation would be
financially devastating, speed the student brain drain from the
district, upset efforts to maintain the racial balance in schools,
and make it harder to recruit and keep good teachers. Those factors
would combine to make it nearly impossible to narrow the
achievement gap between black and white students, something the
court has said the district must do if it hopes to return to local
control.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of accreditation also could prompt the district to request
a postponement of a January hearing to determine whether the
district should be freed from federal court control.
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation Monitoring Committee Chairman John Murphy said the
district would have a tough time arguing it had done everything it
could to eliminate segregation if it was unaccredited. Being
unaccredited would make it even more difficult to meet that
standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Catch-22,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the terms of the three-member Desegregation
Monitoring Committee expire in March and it's uncertain what would
happen to the advisory group if the district sought to postpone the
January hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all up in the air,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In a semi-annual report to the court filed Friday, the
Desegregation Monitoring Committee expressed hope about the current
administration's ability to make improvements. But the committee
warned that too many distractions are making it hard for new
Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. to focus on student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The Desegregation Monitoring Committee harshly criticized the
school board, accusing members of pursuing personal agendas and
playing to audiences instead of addressing crucial academic issues.
The report also accused the board of interfering with Demps'
leadership, trying to influence hiring and pushing favored
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those findings, Murphy said he was still disappointed by
the state board's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the district was beginning to make some progress,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a difficult hurdle for the new
superintendent to overcome even though none of it his fault. The
superintendent needs to rally community support for the school
system. That is extremely difficult to do when you demoralize the
entire community and that's what the loss of accreditation does.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some district officials fear the loss of accreditation
could be the death knell for the district.
</P>
<P>
   Once unaccredited, district students immediately would be able
to enroll in surrounding districts willing to accept them. The
Kansas City district would be responsible for tuition and
transportation costs for students who choose to attend other
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said the state hoped to stop any transfers this year by
delaying the effective date of the accreditation vote to May 1. He
thought it unlikely, however, that the district could show enough
improvement by then to avoid the loss of accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My presumption is if they can show some substantial efforts
that have the potential to lead to gains, they'll want to come back
and argue that the status of being unaccredited should be set aside
or at least delayed,'' Bartman said. ``But from my perspective, I
can't imagine the data changing by May 1.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials also fear the transfers could accelerate the
``devastating talent drain that has afflicted the (district)''
since a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that struck down the
interdistrict transfer portion of the desegregation remedy.
</P>
<P>
   District lawyers argued that the talent flight gathered momentum
as the district closed buildings and cut programs, reduced the
magnet school system and returned to predominantly neighborhood
schools. The advent this year of charter schools _ publicly funded
schools that operate free of many local and state regulations _
furthered accelerated the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest achieving pupils of the district have been
siphoned off and the transfer out provision will hasten the
departure of the remaining few,'' district lawyers wrote in their
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers argued that the retention of middle-class students is
important to the district not only because they tend to score
higher on standardized tests, but because they serve as peer models
for their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their departure will leave a more uniformly poor and lower
achieving student body behind and deprive the district of at least
one asset available to most Missouri school districts having a more
economically diverse student body.''

DIESELS GIVE VALLEY BROWN CLOUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new report, released just as the Phoenix area enters the
winter pollution season, traces the Brown Cloud directly to the
exhaust pipes of the very same motorists who lament the stain it
leaves on Phoenix's horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It documents that diesel engines spew out a disproportionate
share of the microscopic bits of soot and grime that create the
visible pollution. And it discounts the belief that the desert
terrain is the reason why the Phoenix metro area is bedeviled by
the Brown Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the report, prepared for the Maricopa Association of
Governments, targets diesel engines and fuels for cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings could lead to recommendations by MAG,
which represents Valley city, town and Maricopa County governments.
But one state lawmaker is prepared to act already.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Allen, chairwoman of the House Environment
Committee, said she'll take a hard look at the report's findings.
She may incorporate them into legislation, even if it means taking
on the powerful trucking industry and the business community that
increasingly relies on trucking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' the Scottsdale Republican asked. ``We have nothing
to lose but a Brown Cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Berry, vice president of Swift Transportation Co. and a
member of the technical committee that is overseeing the Brown
Cloud study, opposes requiring cleaner diesel fuel in Arizona. &QL; 
NATIONAL STANDARD SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Berry wants a national diesel-fuel standard. This would
set a uniform requirement for truckers, who travel cross-country,
and avoid a patchwork of clean diesel and dirty diesel states, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, could take an act of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phoenix's visual pollution has become as reliable a
winter phenomenon as the tourists who flock here.
</P>
<P>
   State studies show that the Brown Cloud is advancing, even as
the Valley has made big strides in meeting federal health standards
for two other major pollutants: ozone and carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Over five years, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality
found that average daytime haze is 40 percent dirtier. The news is
worse for the ``cleanest'' hours of the day. They are now 93
percent dirtier.
</P>
<P>
   If these trends continue, the agency predicts, what was
considered ``dirty'' air in 1998 will become the norm in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the (air-pollution) trends, and they've made
remarkable progress in everything,'' said Tom Moore, air-monitoring
manager for the DEQ. ``The exception is visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuous measurements made by the DEQ since 1993 paint a
deteriorating picture of Phoenix's visi bility.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only long-distance views that are obscured or
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``More importantly, if you're standing in it (the urban haze),
you don't see as well,'' Moore said. &QL; 
SIGHTS LOSE COLOR, FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   That means that the subtle red tones of Camelback Mountain are
blurred, and the dramatic folds of other urban mountains get ironed
out by layers of fine pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause: The 64 million miles traveled daily by Phoenix
area commuters.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown Cloud study, started three years ago in response to
growing concern about visible pollution, echoes the air-monitor
findings.
</P>
<P>
   A draft copy of the report identifies particulate matter that is
2.5 micrometers or smaller as the main ingredient of urban haze.
The carbon particles contained in the exhaust of both gasoline and
diesel engines absorb light, creating the dark color that gives the
Brown Cloud its distinctive hue.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny bits of exhaust also scatter light, creating a haze
which disrupts long-distance vision and detracts from the sky's
blue color.
</P>
<P>
   Other bits of particulate matter also mix into the Brown Cloud,
but in much smaller proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Dust, for example, makes up about half the particulate matter in
the metro area, but accounts for less than 10 percent of the
visible pollution. That's because natural dust is too large to
scatter light and create a Brown Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The fine particles in the Brown Cloud pose a health threat,
especially for the very young, the elderly and those with
respiratory problems. They threaten tourism, clouding the clear
views and blue skies that visitors expect of Phoenix winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about the quality of life,'' Allen said. ``Those of
us who live here don't like it.'' &QL; 
MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES
</P>
<P>
   On the medical front, the American Lung Association of Arizona
sees the Brown Cloud as a major health issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesel exhaust is to outdoor air what secondhand smoke is to
indoor air,'' program director Dave Feuerherd said.
</P>
<P>
   The study &UR; found that diesel exhaust makes up nearly one-third of
the total exhaust, even though only 3 percent of the registered
vehicles in Arizona are diesel powered, according to the state
Motor Vehicle Division.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the report suggests that cleaner diesel fuel,
cleaner diesel engines and diesel-exhaust controls should be the
focus of efforts to reduce the Brown Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   That's music to the ears of advocates such as Feuerherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clean up our gasoline for carbon monoxide, and you know
what?'' he asked rhetorically. ``We don't have any violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for ozone pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What entity, what force, is preventing us from cleaning up our
gasoline to deal with particulates?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Allen knows the force of the trucking lobby, but said last
week that she's willing to take them on again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she sponsored a bill that would have introduced to
Arizona a cleaner-burning diesel fuel mandated by the California
Air Resources Board. The bill died after a crowded, contentious
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Allen doesn't blame the trucking industry for protecting its
interests. Truckers large and small complained that a new fuel
would drive up their costs and possibly drive some out of
business. &QL; 
PUBLIC PRESSURE NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the general public puts more presure on the
Legislature,'' she said, ``I don't think we'll get CARB
(California-required) diesel.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, the trucking industry representative, said the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is working on a low-sulfur diesel
fuel, and ARCO is experimenting with a diesel formula that would
create emissions as clean as those from natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe you can get a better, cleaner fuel,'' Berry said.
``I don't care what the recipe is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuel issues aside, Berry questions whether the steps recommended
in the Brown Cloud report will make a noticeable difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the regional (MAG) council approves the report, then
what?'' he asked. ``Does the Brown Cloud go away? I understand it
does not.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be reviewed at a public workshop Oct. 25th at
1:30 p.m. at the MAG offices, 302 N. First Ave., Suite 200,
Phoenix. &QL;

BLACK CONGRESS MEMBERS LABEL SENS. ASHCROFT, BOND `RACIST' 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE KRASKE, SCOTT CANON, DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two black members of Congress, including Rep. William Clay of
St. Louis, have branded Missouri Republican Sens. John Ashcroft and
Kit Bond ``racist'' for their work in defeating Ronnie White for a
federal judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, in the final term of a 32-year congressional career,
lashed out first on Thursday. ``I don't have to bite my tongue,''
the Democrat told Fox News. Ashcroft and Bond ``both committed
racist acts in denying this individual (White) a chance to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, echoed
Clay and accused the senators of an ``evil, racist act.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the fresh allegations, the senators Friday defended
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, these smears have gone too far,'' Ashcroft said in a
statement. ``An accusation of prejudice or racism is meant to hurt,
and it does hurt. Every person is a special creation of God. I
believe that the same God who judges all of us by the contents of
our characters, not the colors of our skins, calls on me to do no
less.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bond aide referred reporters to an opinion piece the senator
wrote for The Kansas City Star this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, I was compelled to vote against Judge
White's confirmation,'' Bond wrote. ``In spite of the recent
attempts to sully my reputation with baseless renunciations, I
remain certain that my decision was the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he voted against White because of opposition from
Missouri's law-enforcement community.
</P>
<P>
   Clay said he did not know how voters would respond next year
when Ashcroft, a Republican, runs for re-election against
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. But, he said, ``I hope they would
reject a racist like Ashcroft to serve in the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting along party lines Oct. 5, the Senate rejected White, the
first black judge to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court, on a
54-to-45 vote. The opposition of Ashcroft and Bond, the two
senators from White's home state, was considered pivotal to White's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft led the opposition, citing what he called White's weak
record on capital punishment. Bond announced his dissent the day
before the vote. Other Republicans cited Bond's stand as the reason
for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Waters accused Bond of lying in an interview on WGNU Radio of
St. Louis. Black leaders have complained that Bond promised to
support White during his re-election campaign last year. Bond has
denied he made such a pledge.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Star the congresswoman also took aim at
Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went to his colleagues and told them this was a
re-election issue to him, I sincerely believe what he was saying
was, `I am appealing to the worst instincts in my white
constituents and pointing to this black man as not being competent.
My campaign will be built around how I stopped the black man,' ''
Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not apologize for calling him a racist and I will not
apologize,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has said political considerations played no role in his
opposition to White. On Friday, he continued to insist that White
was ``soft on crime.'' He also cited White's contention that
highway drug checkpoints are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nomination was rejected on the merits, principally the
nominee's poor record on the death penalty and drug enforcement,''
Ashcroft said. ``Americans of every color are entitled to effective
protection from violent criminals and illegal drugs. I will not
knowingly support any judicial nominee for a lifetime appointment
who is soft on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has refused to say whether he regards Ashcroft's
opposition to White as racist, but has said that political
considerations drove the rejection. White has not commented on the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, racially tinged rhetoric has been mounting in Congress
since White's defeat. Minorities have said they face tougher
scrutiny in gaining Senate approval for top appointments.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, black lawmakers in Congress called on President
Clinton to use ``recess appointments,'' a constitutional method by
which the president can bypass the Senate and put judicial
candidates on the bench. The legislators unveiled the unusual
strategy during a rally Thursday that was organized by
African-American lawyers and law students to protest the Senate's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Friday the administration
does not comment on the possibility of using recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv cited an Oct. 21 letter from the Missouri Fraternal Order
of Police to the National Sheriff's Association that objected to
the sheriff group's opposition to White.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more piece of evidence, if more was needed, that
Judge White's record was distorted for partisan political
reasons,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota
Democrat, complained that the GOP was demonstrating a pattern of
``anti-minority sentiment.'' The most recent example, Daschle said,
was the embattled nomination of former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, an
Illinois Democrat, as ambassador to New Zealand. He also cited
White's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, threatened to derail the Moseley-Braun
nomination if the former senator fails to apologize for critical
remarks she made six years ago about the Confederate battle flag
flying over the South Carolina capitol. Moseley-Braun was the
nation's first black woman senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of White's defeat, black leaders in Kansas City and
St. Louis have pledged to mount aggressive campaigns against
Ashcroft next year. They said statistics from the Missouri
Democratic Party prove that White's record on the death penalty is
similar to the records of several Ashcroft appointees to the
state's high court.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he has supported ``scores'' of blacks for judicial
nominations and for top jobs in the executive branch. Those
appointments include Fernando J. Gaitan Jr. as the first black on
the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, in Kansas City.
Gaitan now serves on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to support African-Americans for the federal
bench because America needs their strong minds,'' Ashcroft said. He
said he would not consider race as part of the appointment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American should recognize that African-Americans have
suffered discrimination and been victimized many times over,''
Ashcroft said. ``Because African-American leaders charge that
members of the community are victims of racism again, in the White
nomination, I can understand how some African-Americans believe
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their charge is both false and divisive.''

SEVENTY THEATERS TO GET `FANTASIA/2000'
</HEADLINE>

   VALENCIA, CALIF. -- Santa Clarita Valley moviegoing received a
status upgrade as The Walt Disney Co. announced the Edwards Imax
theater in Valencia will be one of only 70 theaters worldwide to
show ``Fantasia/2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant plans to keep the film limited to Imax
theaters for four months after it opens on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Valencia, located 30 miles from downtown Los
Angeles, the chain announced Friday it will show the updated
animated classic in three other Southern California theaters:
Cathedral City, Irvine and Ontario. The Valencia venue became the
second Imax outlet in Los Angeles County this summer, joining the
California Science Center south of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney and Toronto-based Imax have designated
about one-third of the world's 200 Imax theaters as sites for
``Fantasia/2000.'' It will screen at 38 U.S. locations and at 32
sites in 14 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The film will feature seven new segments plus ``The Sorcerer's
Apprentice'' from the 1940 original, a marriage of classical music
and animation that initially bombed before becoming recognized as a
breakthrough film. ``Fantasia/2000,'' supervised by Walt Disney's
nephew Roy Disney, includes interpretations of compositions by
Beethoven, Gershwin, Saint-Saens, Shostakovich and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets went on sale Friday along with the launch of the
fantasia2000.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Disney, who is vice chairman of the corporation and
executive producer of the film, is betting that filmgoers will be
attracted by the uniqueness of the Imax format, which uses
80-foot-high screens and a film image 10 times larger than the
conventional 35 mm frame. If Disney is right, ``Fantasia/2000''
could surpass the record $72million in grosses taken in during the
past two years by MacGillvray Freeman's ``Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney has not yet disclosed if it will take ``Fantasia/2000''
into conventional theaters once the four-month period has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Fantasia/2000' will play to packed houses for those
first four months,'' said entertainment analyst Kevin Skislock of
Laguna Research Partners, noting that the film could be a major
draw for school classes during daylight hours. ``It will create a
lot of fanfare because of the unique way it's breaking. Disney has
seized upon a new technology to reach audiences more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Skislock also said the performance of ``Fantasia/2000'' could
help relieve Wall Street concerns about Imax's future, including
whether the market for giant-screen venues is saturated and if
mainstream-type films can succeed in the Imax format. Its success
could spark other studios to make similar forays into the
giant-screen market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock and other analysts have also suggested that Disney may
eventually buy Imax if the partnership goes smoothly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States bestrides the globe like a colossus. It
dominates business, commerce and communications; its economy is the
world's most successful, its military might second to none.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, the colossus is uncertain. Having so much
power, it does not know how to behave. Should it act alone and
unhindered on the world stage, since it can? Or should it willingly
dilute its power in cooperation with others?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's vote against ratifying the Comprehensive Test-Ban
Treaty showed the dilemma at its height.
</P>
<P>
   Leave aside for the moment _ though it is hard _ the crass
partisanship of the Republican leaders in the Senate, who allowed
merely one day's debate on the issue before escorting it to the
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   The more reasonable divide over the treaty was whether America
should act like a sovereign state, rejecting an agreement that was
not watertight as far as its own security was concerned, or whether
it should, despite that, satisfy its allies by ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Those senators who voted against have been condemned, not least
by President Bill Clinton, as isolationists. It is an epithet that
flies around freely these days. But true isolationism no longer
exists in the wired and globalized world of the end of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who voted no were Gingrichian minimalists:
believers in the least possible state intervention either at home
or abroad. But most are better described as unilateralists: people
who believe that one of the perquisites of power is untrammelled
freedom of action on the world scene. And their influence is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The case for turning towards the world, rather than away from
it, is generally accepted in America. By contrast, the case for
multilateralism is often far from self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral institutions are often bureaucratic, ponderous and
inefficient. So America from time to time bullies them, ignores
them, refuses to pay its dues.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral treaties, such as most of those covering arms
control, have the effect of tying down the signatories while rogue
states roam free. So America balks. Smaller countries may
appreciate the protection offered by multilateral instruments; for
a superpower, they are drags on its independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's interventions in Kosovo and East
Timor are increasingly condemned by many politicians, especially
Republican ones, as multilateralism gone mad, a promiscuous
spending of American energy on tiny and distant causes. And in
recent days, Congress has made savage cuts even in America's
contribution to peacekeeping by others.
</P>
<P>
   America's allies sometimes imagine that America's superpower
status has transformed it, or ought to have transformed it, into
some giant disinterested force for peace and good. But America is a
nation like any other; its own interests almost always come first.
</P>
<P>
   The world may be shocked to witness American invasions of
Grenada or Panama, but this is the United States acting _ with or
without anybody's permission _ to police its own hemisphere. And
since it faces no direct threat from any particular enemy, the
greater threat may often seem to be the multilateral strings that
tie this Gulliver down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, since the collapse of the Soviet enemy _ for years, the
all-absorbing national priority _ nobody has spelled out what
America's interests are.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in confusion on this as on every other aspect of
foreign policy, does not know. President Clinton, undisciplined and
ever concerned with the here and now, cannot articulate them.
</P>
<P>
   From the way the unilateralists talk, freedom of action would
seem to be America's first priority. In fact, America's first
interest is that the world should be stable, increasingly
democratic, and at peace.
</P>
<P>
   So how is peace best achieved? Some, George W. Bush among them,
argue that the best strategy is sheer military preeminence. No
nation would be fool enough to compete with the United States in a
new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   By thus presiding mightily over the world _ rather than getting
bogged down in the ``social work'' of open-ended deployments or
permanent peacekeeping _ America can ensure everybody's
tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a chimera. A passive America, even massively
armor-plated, is not much use either to others, or to itself. In
order to impose stability on a chaotic, constantly surprising
world, America needs to work with allies.
</P>
<P>
   When Saddam Hussein threatened America's oil supplies, the
biggest alliance ever seen was put together at America's behest.
</P>
<P>
   When outlaw states such as North Korea or Iraq threaten the
peace with nuclear or biological weapons, international cooperation
is needed to try to contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Such cooperation is not created out of thin air. It needs a
constant process of negotiation, communication and mutual help:
help that may involve (as Clinton, for all his faults, has
understood) the putting of money and manpower into places where, on
the face of it, America has no interest.
</P>
<P>
   To insist on going it alone is not only unhelpful. It is
self-defeating, since a country without allies forfeits influence
the more it stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it creates a dangerous precedent. America's
freelancing is accepted by its friends _ to the extent it is _
because the United States shares their democratic values. But
unilateralism from any quarter may be both worrying and
destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if America thinks it can behave without constraints in
the world, how is it to persuade other states that they should
accept constraints themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had hoped to persuade India and Pakistan, two
antagonistic nuclear neighbors, to sign the test-ban treaty. Since
America itself has rejected it, his efforts seem likely to be in
vain. The preservation of sovereignty is not worth this loss of
leverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, too, the WTO meeting opens in Seattle: a grand
exercise in multilateralism for the best of purposes, the
liberalization of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   The host country is approaching it sulkily, with its credibility
as a treaty-maker damaged and in a spirit of defiance that will
hardly encourage others to lower their barriers to commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of posturing is much less effective than cooperation
might prove to be. Next year is unlikely to see much improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has definitively decided that partisanship no longer
stops ``at the water's edge''; foreign policy will be kicked back
and forth as savagely as the budget, if not always for bad reasons.
Clinton himself is weakened even more than would be normal at the
end of a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The American public, eyes fixed on the elections, will not
greatly care what happens beyond the seas. But they might consider
one thing. If America refuses multilateral entanglements, it may be
blissfully free; but it will also be alone.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a leader with no one to lead, in a world made
unstable by its very isolation. This is sovereignty, all right. But
a superpower should be bigger, and wiser, than that. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States bestrides the globe like a colossus. It
dominates business, commerce and communications; its economy is the
world's most successful, its military might second to none.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, the colossus is uncertain. Having so much
power, it does not know how to behave. Should it act alone and
unhindered on the world stage, since it can? Or should it willingly
dilute its power in cooperation with others?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's vote against ratifying the Comprehensive Test-Ban
Treaty showed the dilemma at its height.
</P>
<P>
   Leave aside for the moment _ though it is hard _ the crass
partisanship of the Republican leaders in the Senate, who allowed
merely one day's debate on the issue before escorting it to the
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   The more reasonable divide over the treaty was whether America
should act like a sovereign state, rejecting an agreement that was
not watertight as far as its own security was concerned, or whether
it should, despite that, satisfy its allies by ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Those senators who voted against have been condemned, not least
by President Bill Clinton, as isolationists. It is an epithet that
flies around freely these days. But true isolationism no longer
exists in the wired and globalized world of the end of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who voted no were Gingrichian minimalists:
believers in the least possible state intervention either at home
or abroad. But most are better described as unilateralists: people
who believe that one of the perquisites of power is untrammelled
freedom of action on the world scene. And their influence is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The case for turning towards the world, rather than away from
it, is generally accepted in America. By contrast, the case for
multilateralism is often far from self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral institutions are often bureaucratic, ponderous and
inefficient. So America from time to time bullies them, ignores
them, refuses to pay its dues.
</P>
<P>
   Multilateral treaties, such as most of those covering arms
control, have the effect of tying down the signatories while rogue
states roam free. So America balks. Smaller countries may
appreciate the protection offered by multilateral instruments; for
a superpower, they are drags on its independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's interventions in Kosovo and East
Timor are increasingly condemned by many politicians, especially
Republican ones, as multilateralism gone mad, a promiscuous
spending of American energy on tiny and distant causes. And in
recent days, Congress has made savage cuts even in America's
contribution to peacekeeping by others.
</P>
<P>
   America's allies sometimes imagine that America's superpower
status has transformed it, or ought to have transformed it, into
some giant disinterested force for peace and good. But America is a
nation like any other; its own interests almost always come first.
</P>

<P>
   It is not immediately obvious that the best person to lead a
country emerging from 32 years of autocracy and a further 17 months
of turbulent change should be an infirm Muslim scholar who has
suffered two strokes and can claim no direct mandate from the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, it should be said that the country is
Indonesia, whose 200 million people make it the
fourth-most-populous in the world; that it is still trying to
rebuild its economy after a devastating financial whirlwind; that
its 7,000 inhabited islands and 300 languages and dialects mean it
is, at the best of times, a difficult place to run.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, and now, as it happens, it is convulsed by the
secession of a distant ``province,'' East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cheer up: Abdurrahman Wahid was by no means the worst of
the possibilities. He may even turn out to be an excellent
president.
</P>
<P>
   The first task for Wahid, better known as Gus Dur, is to
establish his democratic credentials. Indonesia has had only one
democratic general election in recent years, and that was in June,
when the voters went to the polls to choose a legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The winning party was that of Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of
Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, and staunch critic of the
regime that succeeded him, which was led first by President Suharto
and then by his chosen successor, President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Megawati's party, however, failed to win enough votes to
give it a majority in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR),
which is the body that chooses the president. And after Habibie
withdrew his candidacy this week, a majority of the MPR's members,
some of whom are appointed, not elected, opted for Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   This has disappointed many of the protesters who helped to drive
Suharto from the presidency last year and who saw Miss Megawati as
the preeminent people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Their sense of having been cheated may perhaps be muted by the
selection of Miss Megawati as Wahid's vice-president. Yet it would
be quite wrong to see Wahid either as a supporter of the old regime
or as an enemy of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative he certainly is, but his opposition to Suharto is
long-standing. And, though he owes his public position to his
leadership of a large Muslim organization _ the world's largest _
he is a firm believer in secularism.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this makes it odd that he, as a Muslim leader,
should now become head of government, especially as only 30 percent
or so of Indonesians are in fact practicing Muslims, though
official statistics put the figure at 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is more conscious of this than Wahid himself, who
acknowledges that the great majority of even nominal Muslims are
uninterested in a Muslim agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, other Muslim leaders lament their compatriots' lack
of zeal and would like to see the country become more Islamized.
Moreover, Wahid owes his victory this week to the votes of some of
these people. He must now resist them if they demand any erosion of
the separation of mosque and state.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate preoccupation may be the economy, which is less
parlous than it was but still requires careful nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The banking system is in urgent need of reform and, more
generally, the country is imbued with a culture of corruption,
which has spread from the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's honesty is not in doubt. Aided by a court ruling this
week that allows parliament to see, and therefore publish, a report
into a recent banking scandal, he can now set about cutting out the
rot that did so much to bring about the collapse of the economy two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That may be painful for some: it will involve bringing to book
some prominent public figures. But it is necessary if Indonesians
are to feel they now enjoy the rule of law. And it will,
incidentally, also restore the lending at present suspended by the
IMF and other foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If the country's moral integrity will be one of Wahid's
concerns, its physical integrity will be another.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the annexed territory of East Timor, sanctioned
by the MPR this week, is to be welcomed; it lifts an incubus from
Indonesia which has prevented it from carrying the weight it
deserves in world councils. But it does not mean that other
restless corners of the archipelago, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya,
must also depart.
</P>
<P>
   If Wahid can persuade the dissidents in these far-off places
that rule from Jakarta is benign, not autocratic, Indonesia can
hold together. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, however, will involve bringing the army firmly under
civilian control _ no easy task in a country that has given the
armed forces a constitutional role in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although considered a candidate, General Wiranto, the armed
forces' commander, has won neither the presidency nor the
vice-presidency. That is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   He should now accept an end to the armed forces' entitlement to
make appointments to the MPR, and to their more general activities
in what should, in a democracy, be civilian affairs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can Wahid do all this?
</P>
<P>
   Frail, almost blind, with no experience of government, he will
find it hard. But he is intelligent, charming and witty; he has led
an organization with 30 million-35 million followers; and he has
shown an ability to practice the arts of politics _ sometimes
dallying with Miss Megawati, whose disdain for deal-making was her
undoing this week, sometimes with others.
</P>
<P>
   Honest, respected, widely known in Indonesia, he is above all a
clear break with the past. He deserves his country's, and his
country's friends', support. &QL;

should now become head of government, especially as only 30 percent
or so of Indonesians are in fact practicing Muslims, though
official statistics put the figure at 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is more conscious of this than Wahid himself, who
acknowledges that the great majority of even nominal Muslims are
uninterested in a Muslim agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, other Muslim leaders lament their compatriots' lack
of zeal and would like to see the country become more Islamized.
Moreover, Wahid owes his victory this week to the votes of some of
these people. He must now resist them if they demand any erosion of
the separation of mosque and state.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate preoccupation may be the economy, which is less
parlous than it was but still requires careful nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The banking system is in urgent need of reform and, more
generally, the country is imbued with a culture of corruption,
which has spread from the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's honesty is not in doubt. Aided by a court ruling this
week that allows parliament to see, and therefore publish, a report
into a recent banking scandal, he can now set about cutting out the
rot that did so much to bring about the collapse of the economy two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That may be painful for some: it will involve bringing to book
some prominent public figures. But it is necessary if Indonesians
are to feel they now enjoy the rule of law. And it will,
incidentally, also restore the lending at present suspended by the
IMF and other foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If the country's moral integrity will be one of Wahid's
concerns, its physical integrity will be another.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the annexed territory of East Timor, sanctioned
by the MPR this week, is to be welcomed; it lifts an incubus from
Indonesia which has prevented it from carrying the weight it
deserves in world councils. But it does not mean that other
restless corners of the archipelago, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya,
must also depart.
</P>
<P>
   If Wahid can persuade the dissidents in these far-off places
that rule from Jakarta is benign, not autocratic, Indonesia can
hold together. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That, however, will involve bringing the army firmly under
civilian control _ no easy task in a country that has given the
armed forces a constitutional role in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although considered a candidate, General Wiranto, the armed
forces' commander, has won neither the presidency nor the
vice-presidency. That is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   He should now accept an end to the armed forces' entitlement to
make appointments to the MPR, and to their more general activities
in what should, in a democracy, be civilian affairs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can Wahid do all this?
</P>
<P>
   Frail, almost blind, with no experience of government, he will
find it hard. But he is intelligent, charming and witty; he has led
an organization with 30 million-35 million followers; and he has
shown an ability to practice the arts of politics _ sometimes
dallying with Miss Megawati, whose disdain for deal-making was her
undoing this week, sometimes with others.
</P>
<P>
   Honest, respected, widely known in Indonesia, he is above all a
clear break with the past. He deserves his country's, and his
country's friends', support. &QL;

   DENVER _ As the latest set of dismal test scores was announced
in Colorado _ 41 percent of 11-year-olds failing to meet state
standards in reading, and 69 percent failing to meet them in
writing _ Bill Maloney, the state's education commissioner, had
sobering words: ``If we do not put our house in order, rougher
hands will do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rougher hands are the reformers who would like to
introduce vouchers and public-school choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another experiment going on in the state capital,
Denver, which might improve the public-school system from within _
and keep more radical alternatives at bay, for a while at least.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Denver became the first city in America to bring in
a plan linking teachers' salaries directly to their pupils'
performance. (Tony Blair's government wants to introduce such a
scheme in Britain's schools).
</P>
<P>
   The Denver scheme, approved by the local teachers' union, will
be tested in a handful of schools for two years. Its success, if it
does succeed, could pave the way for other troubled urban school
districts which are trying to break the relentless pattern of
pupils who fail to progress.
</P>
<P>
   Various merit-pay programs have been tested around the country.
Most of them were unsuccessful because they relied on subjective
evaluations of the teachers by school principals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Denver scheme, teachers will be judged by the
performance of their pupils in both standardized exams and tests
made up by teachers, as well as by their general progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan had to win the approval of the Denver teachers'
union, it is decidedly timid at present. Those volunteering to take
part receive a pay raise simply for doing so, and they will not be
penalized if pupils show no improvement at the end of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials in Denver are adamant that, if this
pilot project works, the city will completely overhaul the pay
scheme of its teachers in favor of one based almost entirely on how
their pupils fare.
</P>
<P>
   Will the unions let the city get away with that? Pay based on
seniority _ years served, nothing more _ is something they consider
sacred.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, teachers' unions have always defeated challenges to
traditional ways of paying teachers. Yet the movement all over
America towards paying by merit may gain momentum for one good
reason: the unions' leaders realize they have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   With more states and cities experimenting with radical school
reform, especially voucher schemes, the unions are finding it
politic to accept the smaller fiddles. That is why the head of the
National Education Association, America's largest teachers' union,
pays lip-service to the Denver experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers are also prepared to compromise because they now
genuinely understand that accountability is something that has to
be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Making teachers' pay dependent on student achievement, advocates
argue, at last gives teachers not only a financial stake in the
future of their pupils but also a greater sense of responsibility
for the tax dollars going into the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As with any system of competition, it rewards the best teachers,
and punishes the incompetent. And none too soon, most American
parents would say.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, much of the debate about merit pay involves the
question of how pupil achievement ought to be measured. Is it fair,
for example, to demand the same of poor pupils and rich ones?
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers are also concerned that pay-for-performance
schemes will increase reliance on statewide standardized tests,
which are already used to decide everything from whether pupils go
up to the next class at the end of the year to the amount of money
given to each school district.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians now advocate testing as the only objective way
to measure academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, said in a recent speech
that ``without testing, reform is a journey without a compass.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many teachers do not share Bush's views on navigation, and
believe it is unfair to use standardized tests to compare suburban
districts with inner-city schools. They are wary of staking their
own livelihood on such tests, and will no doubt fight for other
assessment methods in merit-pay schemes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a smallish fight, however. The bigger battle, about
reining in the power of the public-school bureaucracy, is already
being won by those rough hands of reform.

SHAQ'S ON-GOING LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Phil Jackson knows a lifetime of ill
free-throw shooting isn't fixed overnight, so he's taking a
measured approach where Shaquille O'Neal's percentage is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it right now? Twenty-four (percent)? I'd like it to be
25 tomorrow, 26 the day after,'' the Los Angeles Lakers coach said
Friday night before the Lakers played their final game in the Forum
_ a 112-100 exhibition loss to the Phoenix Suns before a
less-than-capacity crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has assigned assistant coach Tex Winter _ who once
tutored Dennis Rodman in the same manner _ to work daily with
O'Neal. The results so far have been, well, difficult to see.
</P>
<P>
   After going 5 for 15 Friday, O'Neal actually !ital!improved!off!
to 27.1 percent (13 for 48) in the exhibition season, making his
career mark of .536 look downright respectable by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging part is that O'Neal delivered in the clutch
Thursday. After missing his first 10 foul shots, he hit his 11th
try to force overtime in an eventual victory over Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   So what are Winter and Jackson advising O'Neal? Jackson is
mostly mum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say one word about that, and that's that he doesn't have
a rhythm when he's on the line,'' he said. ``It's all about finding
a rhythm and the timing of being into his shot.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, O'Neal chalks it up to lack of concentration but
said Winter is trying to get him to put more arc in his shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably need to take a little bit more time,'' said O'Neal,
who scored a game-high 37 points Friday. ``Usually when I try too
hard, I don't do well. I'm probably just trying too hard. Because
you know I want to shut all you guys up. ... That's the only `but'
I got in my life. Everything else I'm perfect at. Perfect albums,
perfect movies, perfect low-post game. Perfect life. But `he's not
a good free-throw shooter,' so I mean I always hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he welcomed the chance to take critical foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And most of the time when I'm put in that situation, the best
things always happen for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting Bison: Bison Dele, who in his previous life as Brian
Williams won a championship with Jackson's 1997 Chicago Bulls, is
retiring rather than play for the Detroit Pistons. Might he put off
retirement to rejoin Jackson? That's an idea Jackson wouldn't mind
pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great addition it would be for our team,'' Jackson
said. ``It'd be a luxury to have a player like him. But that's not
possible, he's retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic Dele has five years and $36.45million left on his
contract but is reportedly in Lebanon, running a water-treatment
plant he owns (``I heard he's going to desalinate the ocean near
Lebanon. That's some far-out stuff,'' quipped Jackson).
</P>
<P>
   But the coach isn't sure what to make of Dele, who he called
``one of my best students I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a special relationship with Brian Williams,'' he said.
``I don't know Bison Dele. I've never met him, we've never had a
conversation. If Brian Williams wants to talk to me about playing
basketball and he comes and tells me that he's Bison Dele, yes,
we'll have a conversation, we'll have lunch together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Robert Horry left the game in the first half
because of a sore left knee and did not return. Horry, who suffers
from chronic tendinitis in both knees, is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Knight's sprained right ankle is healing but Jackson
figures Knight won't be ready to open the season Nov. 2 and
predicted he would start the season on the injured list.

UFOs OVER LOS ANGELES IN NEW BOOK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, CALIF. -- The truth is out there.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to author and UFO researcher Preston Dennett, it
has hovered many times over Topanga Canyon, a mini-Roswell in Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Dennett's latest UFO book, ``UFOs over Topanga Canyon:
Eyewitness Accounts of the California Sightings'' is filled with
stories of strange lights in the sky and abductions by aliens, who
have performed unwanted medical procedures and imparted sage advice
to some of Dennett's interviewees. To a small crowd at Barnes and
Noble, Dennett contended that the flood of local sightings is a
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This UFO wave activity is a new phenomenon. They want to be
seen,'' said Dennett, 34.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of Dennett's book are sightings reported by dozens
of people of strange lights in the Topanga Canyon skies on June 14,
1992. Dennett brought tape recordings of calls to Los Angeles
County sheriff's dispatchers from that night. All the calls began
with disclaimers along the same line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are almost ashamed to tell you what we saw,'' said one
caller. ``My girlfriend and I have no psychotic illnesses
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer of 1992 was a banner time for sightings. One woman
interviewed by Dennett said aliens advised her that Ross Perot was
no good for the country. Perot was running for president that year.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she dropped her support for Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman told Dennett that aliens abducted her and cut her
arm, leaving a scar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I examined it just days after and there it was,'' he told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dennett was a skeptic until a publicized UFO sighting got him
asking family members about UFOs. To his surprise, he said, several
of them, and friends and co-workers all related their own UFO
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they had all these stories to tell me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The book chronicles classic UFO phenomena _ lights that
disappear in the blink of an eye, aliens with big heads, big eyes.
But what does he make of it? Maybe the rugged landscape of the
canyon is an ideal place for aliens to observe humans while
avoiding large-scale detection, he offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most common questions I get is, Why Topanga? _ and
I honestly don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennett's audience represented all points along the spectrum of
credulity. Karna Hanson of Oak Park wanted more substance, fewer
creepy accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more hype than a real communication of where we should
be at,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Luff, a member of some of the same UFO organizations
that Dennett belongs to, believes. He's been following UFO
phenomena since 1945, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep an open mind and approach it at face value,'' he
said.

   NAZARETH _ The millennium celebrations seemed to offer a golden
opportunity for Nazareth, Jesus's hometown and Israel's largest
Arab city. But the city still does not have a functioning council,
let alone the hotels or roads to cope with the millions of tourists
expected to arrive next year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is in the throes of a row between the Communist (and
Christian) mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, and his Islamist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew it,'' admits Lutfy Mashour, editor of a local paper.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute started in 1997 when Israel's tourist ministry gave
the council money to build a plaza on a small plot of land below
Nazareth's Basilica of the Annunciation, where, according to
tradition, the angel Gabriel appeared before Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists said the land belonged to al-Waqf (a Muslim
religious endowment) and pitched a tent-cum-mosque on the site in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, having gained a one-seat majority on the council,
they made the building of a mosque a condition for working with the
mayor. Jeraisi insisted that this was for the government, not the
council, to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, most viewed the squabble as a political
football in the wider contest between Israel's declining Communist
party (historically the main political tribune for Israel's 1
million or so Arab citizens) and the rising Islamist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Things got nastier when the Israeli referees started to play for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, who was then prime minister, hinted to the
Islamist leaders that a mosque could be built in exchange for a
call to their followers to abstain in the coming vote for prime
minister (Israeli Arabs supported Ehud Barak, not Netanyahu).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Israel's then-foreign minister, Ariel Sharon,
reportedly told the Vatican (which owns the Basilica of the
Annunciation) that a mosque would not be built.
</P>
<P>
   This mix of outside intrigue and inside tension led, last
Easter, to open fights between Christians and Muslims, in which 40
people were injured. But both sides were still waiting for the
decision of a ministerial committee, set up by Netanyahu but now
under the chairmanship of Shlomo Ben-Ami, the new internal security
minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, Nazareth's District Court ruled that the land in
question did not belong to al-Waqf but to the state, and it was
therefore up to the government to decide its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Wary about Islamist reaction (a wariness strengthened by the
discovery that the people behind a botched bomb attack in Israel
last month were supporters of the Islamist movement in Galilee),
Ben-Ami sought a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The council should build the plaza, he announced on Oct. 13. But
700 square meters (840 square yards) should be set aside for a
mosque to be built towards the end of next year, on condition that
the protest tent was removed by Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Solomonic ruling that pleased nobody. The Latin
Patriarch in Jerusalem deplored the decision, saying that it might
jeopardize the Pope's planned visit next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists said the tent would be removed over their dead
bodies, and muttered darkly about papal conspiracies stopping ``the
right of Muslims to build a mosque on Muslim land.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, Jeraisi was assaulted in the city for the second
time in four months.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of Nazareth (only 30 percent of whom are now
Christian), such incidents are a sad testimony to the fragmentation
of their city along religious lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some Israelis may not be too dismayed. Israeli governments
of whatever stripe have always preferred to treat their Arab
citizens less in terms of what they are _ a national minority of
Palestinian Arabs who stayed on their lands after the Jewish state
was established in 1948 _ than in terms of the religion they
espouse. &QL;

KINGS FALL TO COYOTES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray called
timeout early in the third period Friday night, he was one angry
parent.
</P>
<P>
   The team had blown a two-goal lead and now they trailed the
Phoenix Coyotes, who made a habit of beating up the Kings last
season.
</P>
<P>
   This was a new year and a new building and the Coyotes are a
team the Kings have to beat to reach the NHL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings lost 6-3 in front of a booing crowd of 16,572 at the
Staples Center. They weren't just beaten, they were outplayed.
Although Ian Laperriere scored two goals for the Kings, the Coyotes
scored short-handed in the second period and added the game-winner
early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Daron Quint blew past the Kings defense, went by Bryan Smolinski
and sailed a goal over the left shoulder of Kings goalie Stephane
Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse from there, when Phoenix had goals just 10
seconds apart by Keith Tkachuk and Mika Alatalo with less then six
minutes to go in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's jaw clenched during the timeout, but it didn't help.
After starting the season 3-1, the Kings are 1-2-2 in their last
five and winless in the last three.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset spared the Kings further damage when he stopped Rick
Tocchet on a breakaway midway during the third period, but it
didn't matter. The Kings had just four shots on Phoenix goalie
Mikhail Shtalenkov during the first 10 minutes of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov, elevated to No.1 goalie in the absence of holdout
Nikolai Khabibulin, stopped 23 shots to raised his record to 5-1-1.
Fiset, who has played in all but one period of the Kings first nine
games, had 28 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere's second goal, which beat Shtalenkoa close in after a
pass from Brad Chartrand, came just 1:13 into the second period and
gave the Kings a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Coyotes, who went 5-1-0 against the Kings last
season, no lead was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a man advantage with 15:35 left in the second
period when defenseman Keith Carney went off for hooking. But
Phoenix's captain Keith Tkachuk won the ensuing faceoff and passed
to Teppo Numminen, who got the puck to Dallas Drake at center ice.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kings' blue line, Drake fired a long shot past Fiset to
cut the lead to 3-2. Drake's shot tipped off defenseman Garry
Galley and the misdirection confused Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Numminen was at the center of the Coyotes' tying goal, digging
the puck out of the corner and setting up Trevor Lefkowski for a
25-foot slap shot that beat Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lefkowski's first goal of the season. It was Numminen's
third assist of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had vowed not to come out sluggishly Friday, the way
they had Wednesday in the home opener when they fell behind winless
Boston and had to struggle for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did that we could be looking at a long night,'' Murray
said. ``Phoenix is a very explosive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray found that out later, but in the first period, the Kings
scored first.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere, limited to one assist and a minus-four in eight
games, found himself in front of the net when the puck trickled off
Aki Berg's stick. He fired it through the legs of Mikhail
Shtalenkov to give the Kings a 1-0 lead with just 3:54 gone in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coyotes are off to their best start in franchise history
for a reason. Just five seconds after Brian Smolinski went off for
hooking, Travis Green tied the game with a power play goal.
</P>
<P>
   For Green, the former Duck who has taken over as first-line
center in the absence of suspended center Jeremy Roenick, it was
his fifth goal in the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, however kept the pressure on and scored in the final
minute of the first period to take a 2-1 lead. Ziggy Palffy, a
former teammate of Green's with the New York Islanders, poked in a
rebound with 17 seconds left after Rob Blake's blast from the point
got away from Shtalenkov.

GET READY FOR SOME GENUINE BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During the regular season a couple of Atlanta
Braves pitchers _ advertising pitch men for some product I've
forgotten _ told us that chicks dig the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it's World Series time, and we're about to find out
how chicks feel about the hit-and-run grounder to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves vs. the New York Yankees, beginning tonight at Turner
Field, shapes up as the sort of baseball that isn't celebrated much
any more in television commercials or the home run highlight shows
that fill the time in between.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're talking about Atlanta and New York, let's call it
good ol' city hardball.
</P>
<P>
   They're going to settle the question of who's the best team in
baseball. They might forget to set any records in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a coincidence, but the 60-home-run hitters with the
trademark trots, the 10-strikeouts-a-night pitcher who can't afford
a barber, the 3,000-hit man who kisses home plate and the rest of
the game's preening superstars are watching the World Series on TV
with the rest of us. They're just the sideshow, a six-month warmup
act.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Yankees are the real baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the Braves or Yankees hit 60 homers. Or 50, even.
Nobody's going to rip one 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody struck out 300 batters. Or knocked in 150 runs. Or stole
70 bases.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter led the American League in hits (219) and Mariano
Rivera led the league in saves (45). Chipper Jones will be the
National League MVP for all-around production, but for individual
titles, Jeter and Rivera are it among the 50 players astride the
baselines during this evening's introductions.
</P>
<P>
   All they do spectacularly is win.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it's funny the Braves and Yankees are supposedly
playing for the title, ``Team of the Decade.'' You want to ask,
Which decade?
</P>
<P>
   They seem out of step with the 1990s, when winning with the
starting rotation (Braves), the top of the order (Yankees),
coaching (Braves) and chemistry (Yankees) is passe.
</P>
<P>
   They're perfectly suited, though, to the style of baseball
played in the postseason, when pitching and little things usually
make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Check the scores of the playoff games so far. The losing team
usually scores 0 to 3 runs, shut down by good pitching.
</P>
<P>
   In 27 postseason games this year, the losers have scored five
runs or more just four times. Each of those slugfests came late in
the series when the pitchers are making their second starts.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Braves' pitchers are more likely to survive those
harder second starts. Tom Glavine (games 1 and 5) went 2-0 in the
team's 1995 World Series victory over Cleveland. Greg Maddux (games
2 and 6) recorded low ERAs when he has started twice in a series.
Kevin Millwood (games 3 and 7) kept the team in the decisive
extra-inning game against the Mets in his second start.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't have a starter who has won twice in a series.
David Cone (games 2 and 6) is better when he's well-rested. Andy
Pettitte (games 3 and 7) has an 0-2 blotch on his record from the
1997 AL Championship Series loss to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmakers favor the Yankees, who beat the Braves in the
1996 World Series and San Diego in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But these are hardly the same teams that met in the World Series
just three years ago. A more precise phrase for what's at stake
here would be ``Franchise of the Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996 the Yankees have said goodbye to John Wetteland,
Kenny Rogers, Jimmy Key, Charlie Hayes, Mariano Duncan and Cecil
Fielder. They've brought in Roger Clemens, Chuck Knoblauch and
Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Since '96 the Braves have lost Fred McGriff, Marquis Grissom,
Denny Neagle, Mark Wohlers and Steve Avery. They've gained
Millwood, Brian Jordan, John Rocker and Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   Plusses and minuses on both sides. The point is, picking the
Yankees because they beat the Braves three years ago makes as much
sense as picking the Yankees because they won last year.
</P>
<P>
   Or picking the Cubs because Sammy Sosa hit all those home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Braves in seven.

<P>
   JAKARTA _ He is frail, partially blind and sometimes says the
strangest things. But those are not the only reasons why
Abdurrahman Wahid, more popularly known in Indonesia as Gus Dur,
was considered such a long shot for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He was also supposed to be the closest ally of Megawati
Sukarnoputri, the popular daughter of Indonesia's first president
and the front-running opposition candidate in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after Indonesia's first free elections in four decades,
Megawati's party finished first, and Wahid's fourth. But in a
surprising vote in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) on Oct.
20, Wahid beat the favorite by 373 votes to 313. Megawati's
supporters immediately rampaged on to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Habibie, who had taken over when President Suharto was
forced from office in May 1998, had pulled out of the contest once
the MPR had in effect passed a vote of no confidence in his
leadership the day before. In a secret ballot, the MPR then went on
to elect Wahid as Indonesia's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
   He was backed by other Muslim parties and many supporters of the
former ruling party, Golkar, which decided not to field a candidate
to replace Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's supporters were crushed, and staged violent protests
in cities around the country. Two bombs exploded in Jakarta,
killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which had shot up by 10 percent when Habibie
withdrew his candidacy, quickly shed its gains.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Indonesians, still reeling from a series of tumultuous
events _ including this week the formal acceptance that East Timor
would be set free _ were left wondering what was going on in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to wait a little longer to find out. Indonesia's
transition towards democracy is not only momentous but also
experimental: much of it is being made up as the leading characters
stumble along.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's National Awakening Party is small and inexperienced. The
direction of the new government will be revealed only gradually as
the new president reaches out to other parties in order to fill
important positions.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, the MPR comfortably elected Megawati as
vice-president, a crucial position in Indonesia given Wahid's poor
health.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, General Wiranto, the chief of the armed
forces, and Akbar Tandjung, Golkar's chairman, dropped out of the
race leaving Hamzah Haz, the leader of another Muslim party, as her
sole challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Many Golkar party members gave their support to Megawati. Her
election as vice-president was widely seen as a way of keeping her
supporters in check, but what skills she will bring to the post
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wahid began doling out government jobs, his election
had stirred up two big fears.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the transition to democracy could be endangered.
After all, though Megawati's party had won the most votes in the
June election to Indonesia's lower house, she was then defeated in
the ballot for the presidency by the 700 members of the MPR, some
of whom are not elected.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear was the rise of Islamic power, long held in
check during Suharto's 32-year rule, in the world's biggest Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these worries have less to do with Wahid than with the
political jockeying that put him in office. As the former head of
Nahdlatul Ulama, a large grass-roots Muslim organization founded by
his grandfather, Wahid has long been one of Indonesia's most
respected and influential figures.
</P>
<P>
   During Suharto's rule he was one of the few people honest and
clever enough both to refuse the autocrat's enticements and to
dodge his blows.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is prone to conflicting statements, he has long
remained consistent on the role of Islam in politics: he does not
believe there should be one.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the parties that have swept him into power disagree, and
said so loudly during the general-election campaign and subsequent
political bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Some Islamist parties have questioned whether Megawati, because
she is a woman, has any right to lead Indonesia. Although more than
80% of Indonesians are nominally Muslim, less than half are devout
and many see no reason to bring religion into government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, resurgent Islamic parties could complicate efforts
to keep the country in one piece. With the granting of independence
to East Timor, even though its circumstances are different, there
are growing separatist demands from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these are mixed up with religious issues. In one
separatist province, Aceh, the right to apply Islamic law locally
is likely to be a demand in any autonomy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   To hold the country together, Wahid will have his work cut out
keeping Islamist supporters in check. But the respect he commands
among many Muslims, combined with his secular outlook, could make
him the ideal man for the job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (STORY CAN HERE AT 800; UNCUT VERSION IS 1,125 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He could also prove to be a more democratic choice than
Megawati. Although her party finished first in the June poll, it
was well short of a majority _ even among those who had voted
against Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   With 48 parties contesting the election, the opposition votes
were fragmented; so, arguably, Wahid will reflect many voters'
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, aloof and unwilling to get her hands dirty by
negotiating with other parties, showed huge political failings. She
alienated Wahid and Amien Rais, another reformist Muslim leader and
potential ally, who is now speaker of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
   Rais's role is another reason for optimism. Although he has been
less consistently secular than Wahid, he has been outspoken in
condemning the abuses of the Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesia is to forge a democratic system for itself, it must
rethink its constitution and create checks on executive power. Rais
seems well suited to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid could prove to be a popular leader who does not exacerbate
any of the conflicts still raging in Indonesia. But the task before
him is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from putting back together a wrecked economy, he also
needs to rein in the armed forces. This would mean bringing the
generals under civilian control and removing their political power,
exercised through their 38 parliamentary seats, among other ways.
</P>
<P>
   He must also root out corruption and create a more competent and
decentralized government. A huge scandal involving Bank Bali may be
the place to start; it swirls around people close to Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   A decision this week by the courts to release an audit of the
bank to parliament will allow aid to flow again from the IMF and
World Bank. It all seems an enormous task for a frail 59-year-old.
But Wahid's moral authority could be just what Indonesia now
needs. &QL;

RALLY MOUNTED IN SUPPORT OF ZACARIAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Backed by a slate of Latino elected officials and
community leaders, several hundred demonstrators demanded that the
Los Angeles school board rescind its action stripping
Superintendent Ruben Zacarias of direct control over the
700,000-student district.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting in Spanish and holding aloft signs, the protesters
presented a list of grievances at district headquarters in downtown
Los Angeles. Chief among their demands: Restore authority to
Zacarias and return newly appointed chief executive officer Howard
Miller to his position as facilities chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand respect and return of power to the superintendent,''
said Sigifredo Lopez, president and chief executive officer of the
Parent Community Coalition, a 10-year-old nonprofit group that
organized Friday's rally and bused in parents from throughout the
district.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles school board is expected on Thursday to ratify
its decision removing Zacarias from day-to-day oversight of the
district. Last week, the board voted 4-2 with one abstention to
appoint Miller CEO. The decision was made behind closed doors and
without public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Thursday, the school board has a chance to choose between
democracy or dictatorship. They can choose to have constituents or
subjects. We hope they make the right choice,'' Councilman Nick
Pacheco said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of seven board members _ president Genethia Hayes and
members Caprice Young and Mike Lansing _ said Friday they would not
change their minds regarding Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Rally organizers also collected signatures for a petition
seeking to keep Zacarias in office to ``continue and complete his
reforms.'' The petition will be submitted to the board. &QL; 
The rally attracted a slew of elected officials including state
Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles; U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra,
D-Los Angeles; county Supervisor Gloria Molina; Los Angeles City
Council members Jackie Goldberg, Rita Walters, Nate Holden and Mike
Hernandez; school board member Victoria Castro; and former board
members Barbara Boudreaux and George Kiriyama.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the rally criticized the board for failing to seek
public input before hiring Miller behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to rescind this action,'' county Supervisor
Gloria Molina told the cheering crowd. ``It's inappropriate and
disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public must be included,'' Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg
said. ``You cannot do this behind closed doors and have a public
school system.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Rita Walters attacked the three school board
members who form a majority voting bloc and whose campaigns were
financed by Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group elected by Richard Riordan's millions of dollars is
proceeding in the wrong way,'' Walters said. ``They cannot hire and
fire people behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Polanco called on the school board to reform its process of
making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand true reform,'' Polanco said. ``By defending this
tainted process . they're setting dangerous precedents for this
city, and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents at the rally said they have lost faith and confidence in
the school board and feel Zacarias has been unjustly treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a lot for the community,'' said Martha Alaniz,
whose two boys attend El Sereno School in Los Angeles. The board of
education ``broke the law. What are we going to teach our
children?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the parents. We are supposed to say whether Dr.
Zacarias is doing a good job or not,'' said Mara Avelar, a Sylmar
resident who has four teen-agers. ``I want (the school board) to
back off and let Dr. Zacarias do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said her fellow board members violated the proper process
by not seeking public input when they hired Miller and called on
them to rescind their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they re-evaluate their stance and change their
opinion,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also said she did not organize or lead the large protest
of students who marched to the Belmont Commission meeting on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said she learned of the protest when the students reached
LAUSD headquarters and came down to the commission meeting to
assist the group and make sure there were no incidents. The Daily
News reported on Thursday that Castro led the group after speaking
to about a dozen students involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Miller submitted a two-page report recommending
disciplinary actions for the employees blamed for the controversial
Belmont Learning Center, but the board refused to release the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Daily News the report was expected to recommend
administrative leave for the employees named.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ He is frail, partially blind and sometimes says the
strangest things. But those are not the only reasons why
Abdurrahman Wahid, more popularly known in Indonesia as Gus Dur,
was considered such a long shot for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He was also supposed to be the closest ally of Megawati
Sukarnoputri, the popular daughter of Indonesia's first president
and the front-running opposition candidate in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after Indonesia's first free elections in four decades,
Megawati's party finished first, and Wahid's fourth. But in a
surprising vote in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) on Oct.
20, Wahid beat the favorite by 373 votes to 313. Megawati's
supporters immediately rampaged on to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Habibie, who had taken over when President Suharto was
forced from office in May 1998, had pulled out of the contest once
the MPR had in effect passed a vote of no confidence in his
leadership the day before. In a secret ballot, the MPR then went on
to elect Wahid as Indonesia's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
   He was backed by other Muslim parties and many supporters of the
former ruling party, Golkar, which decided not to field a candidate
to replace Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's supporters were crushed, and staged violent protests
in cities around the country. Two bombs exploded in Jakarta,
killing two people.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which had shot up by 10 percent when Habibie
withdrew his candidacy, quickly shed its gains.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Indonesians, still reeling from a series of tumultuous
events _ including this week the formal acceptance that East Timor
would be set free _ were left wondering what was going on in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to wait a little longer to find out. Indonesia's
transition towards democracy is not only momentous but also
experimental: much of it is being made up as the leading characters
stumble along.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's National Awakening Party is small and inexperienced. The
direction of the new government will be revealed only gradually as
the new president reaches out to other parties in order to fill
important positions.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, the MPR comfortably elected Megawati as
vice-president, a crucial position in Indonesia given Wahid's poor
health.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, General Wiranto, the chief of the armed
forces, and Akbar Tandjung, Golkar's chairman, dropped out of the
race leaving Hamzah Haz, the leader of another Muslim party, as her
sole challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Many Golkar party members gave their support to Megawati. Her
election as vice-president was widely seen as a way of keeping her
supporters in check, but what skills she will bring to the post
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wahid began doling out government jobs, his election
had stirred up two big fears.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the transition to democracy could be endangered.
After all, though Megawati's party had won the most votes in the
June election to Indonesia's lower house, she was then defeated in
the ballot for the presidency by the 700 members of the MPR, some
of whom are not elected.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear was the rise of Islamic power, long held in
check during Suharto's 32-year rule, in the world's biggest Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these worries have less to do with Wahid than with the
political jockeying that put him in office. As the former head of
Nahdlatul Ulama, a large grass-roots Muslim organization founded by
his grandfather, Wahid has long been one of Indonesia's most

TROJANS LOOKING FOR WAY OUT OF MIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the nature of USC's topsy-turvy season that
satisfactory explanations have become the Trojans' latest casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Why has USC struggled in the fourth quarter of nearly every game
this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had an answer, I would shout it off rooftops,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   No one saw Hackett screaming atop Heritage Hall this week, so
the solution apparently remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes today's 12:30 p.m. game against Stanford at the
Coliseum even more important for the Trojans (3-3, 1-2), who are
still searching for an identity and struggling to remain bowl
eligible at the halfway mark of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A game with Stanford would normally be an elixir for any
problems, but in a role reversal, the Cardinal (4-2, 4-0) is atop
the Pacific-10 Conference and hoping today's contest will solidify
its status as Rose Bowl favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they're playing, they're pretty cocky and confident,''
USC free safety David Gibson said. ``And they should be. They know
what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Trojans. They want a victory, because a loss will
basically turn this season into a complete disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game, as important as it is for Stanford, it's huge for
us,'' Gibson said. ``This is a big momentum game for us. I wouldn't
have expected Stanford to be where it is, but we have to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're where we are, what you need to do is get a
victory,'' Hackett added. ``Just to find a way to get out of the
funk we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans may have lost three games, but they still haven't
lost their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be the turning point for us,'' wide receiver
Windrell Hayes said. ``There's probably more frustration for us
than anything else. We know we have the ability to play with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   One difference for the Trojans is that they play four of their
final six games at home. They are 1-3 this season away from the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this from the very beginning, playing on the road is
no fun,'' Hackett said. ``When you open the season with four out of
the first six games on the road, three of which are tough places to
play, you might come up short if you are not a real strong, strong
football team. And we just were not able to make the plays we
needed to make.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly been Stanford's problem, at least in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal has demonstrated it can win on the road, with
victories at Arizona and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still some skepticism that sooner or later, the
Cardinal's bubble will burst. Even Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham
admitted he didn't expect the Cardinal to be undefeated in the
Pac-10 in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat of a surprise because we've played some very
difficult opponents and had some some success against them and
probably in some of the places that have not been traditional
Stanford favorites,'' Willingham said.

TYSON PICKS ON SOMEONE HIS OWN SIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson. Part IV.
</P>
<P>
   Iron Mike, released from behind iron bars five months ago,
returns from his latest hiatus from boxing to face
not-so-threatening Orlin Norris tonight at the MGM Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   What can we expect?
</P>
<P>
   Probably a knockout. Norris, who at 5-foot-10 is about Tyson's
size, was selected as the comeback opponent because he's believed
to have neither the brawn nor the power to cope with the former
two-time champion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one thought Francois Botha could hang with Tyson
in his last fight, in January. However, Botha, boxing efficiently,
was winning until Tyson landed one big punch that instantly ended
the bout in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 33, admitted he's rusty for this $10 million payday (vs.
$800,000 for Norris) and that's no wonder. He hasn't fought in nine
months and has been in the ring only once in almost 2{ years
because of his suspension for biting Evander Holyfield and the
latest prison term, which almost guarantees some kinks unless he
lands the KO punch early.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he dropped 50-plus pounds in five months after
ballooning to about 280 during 3{ months in prison for assaulting
two motorists after a traffic accident adds to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's trainer, Tommy Brooks, said his protege is at about
seven on a scale of 1 to 10 after three months of intense training.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tyson seems to be in a relatively good frame
of mind.
</P>
<P>
   He can still be irresponsibly brash. He was quoted as saying
he'd bite again under certain circumstances but then said he was
merely trying to sell the fight. Only he knows whether he meant it.
</P>
<P>
   However, he also has spoken lovingly of his wife and children
and that his primary motivation is to provide for them _ as well as
to pay off debts _ and become a decent role model. He insists he
has matured after his latest brush with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Again, whether he's sincere or consciously trying to change his
image, only he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks doesn't care. To him, the important thing is that Tyson
has done everything asked of him in the gym, which hasn't been the
case with other trainers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson seems to understand that things will never again come as
easily as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for me to prepare now than when I was younger,''
said Tyson (46-3, 40 KOs). ``Before, I was more of a loose cannon.
I thought that I could conquer the world. When I was 20, I didn't
think a guy with a gun could beat me. Now, I still feel I can
conquer the world, but I know it takes a lot of hard work and
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris (50-5, 27 KOs) has done his share of sacrificing.
</P>
<P>
   The older brother of former junior middleweight champion Terry
Norris has waited for such an opportunity since he started fighting
professionally in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He's no pushover in spite of the fact he's an 8-1 underdog. He's
a former cruiserweight champion and has fared well as a heavyweight
contender because of his solid boxing skills. He's beaten Oliver
McCall and Tony Tucker and lost to Bert Cooper and Henry
Akindwande.
</P>
<P>
   And while Tyson for once isn't at a disadvantage because of his
height, the same can be said for Norris: It's little guy vs. little
guy.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Tyson also might have the intelligence and experience to
survive a while. His plan to avoid what most people believe will be
that inevitable knockout punch is to punch and move, move, move.
Don't stand in any one place too long, don't become careless as
Botha did.
</P>
<P>
   And, who knows, if he gets lucky and avoids Tyson's biggest
bombs, he could shock everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident going into this fight,'' said Norris.
``I've had some tough fights and I'm always in good shape, so the
difference this time is my mental approach. I'm more focused
because I realize what a fight like this will do to my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, it's Tyson who will receive the career boost.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to face Shannon Briggs in his next fight, on Jan.
29 at Madison Square Garden in New York. And, not long after that,
his plan is to win a world championship for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   For the meantime, just showing up Saturday is an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tyson: ``Not too many people could start over as many times
as I have.''
</P>

   TOKYO _ The electric organ broke into ``The Girl from Ipanema''
just as Carlos Ghosn was due to walk on stage at the Tokyo Motor
Show on Oct. 20. It was just a tease: the music switched to the
usual raucous backing-track as the diminutive, Brazilian-born Ghosn
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   In clear _ if scripted _ Japanese he pledged that the sick man
of the country's industry would become ``younger,'' more dynamic
and bolder.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, speaking to journalists in English, he had
declared that 21,000 jobs must go by March 2002 if the firm is to
survive. No fewer than 16,400 of the cuts will fall in Japan; five
Japanese factories must close.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Ghosn broke into Japanese again.
``There is no alternative,'' he said. ``Failure is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who is credited with restoring Renault chiefly by
cost-cutting, arrived as chief operating officer of Japan's
second-biggest car maker after the French firm had bailed it out
last March, injecting Yen643 billion ($5.4 billion) for a
controlling 37 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jac Nasser, the Australian boss shaking up Ford, Ghosn is
of Lebanese origin _ indeed, they look like cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanese by descent, Brazilian by birth, a French citizen and
Japanese by adoption,'' is how Ghosn puts it.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good mix, for if Ghosn is to succeed, he needs to
combine Arab deal-making, Latin energy, Gallic strategy and an
Asian feeling for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long, if inglorious, tradition in Japan of
bureaucrats using gaiatsu (foreign pressure) to achieve otherwise
unpalatable reforms. As more Japanese companies find that they have
neither the corporate structure nor the stomach to cut waste, close
factories and sack workers, gaiatsu is moving into business.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is not the only Japanese car maker to turn to foreigners.
General Motors has increased its stakes in Isuzu and Suzuki as the
core of its strategy to win 10 percent of the Asian car market.
Since Ford raised its stake in Mazda to one-third, it has run the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fuji Heavy Industries, owner of Subaru, which is affiliated
with Nissan, has acknowledged that its offspring needs a foreign
ally _ possibly GM again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the firm that has most abjectly thrown its lot in with a
foreigner, Nissan is the one being most carefully watched.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn admits that it is easier for an outsider to make changes,
especially as he had nothing to do with previous attempts to mend
Nissan. Even so, powerful plant managers with seats on the board
have thwarted one ``revival'' after another.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has lost money for four of the past five years. This is
probably its last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Nissan's revival was greeted with gasps of horror
and disbelief. Yet Nissan's bosses, and the analysts who follow the
firm, have known for a year that something like it would come along
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Like many firms that overinvested during the bubble, when
capital, in effect, cost almost nothing, Nissan has overcapacity of
30-40 percent. Like others, too, it has taken the easy path of
cutting working hours instead of closing plants and laying off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that a car
maker able to make 2.4 million vehicles a year in Japan, but
producing fewer than 1.3 million, is running its plants at a
disastrously low level.
</P>
<P>
   To reach 75-80 percent utilization, at which point most car
firms break even, capacity needs to shrink by at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ghosn's plan, Nissan's domestic capacity is to drop to a
more realistic 1.65 million units a year by 2002, maybe raising
utilization to 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First to go, by March 2001, will be the assembly plants at
Murayama near Tokyo, the Nissan Shatai factory in Kyoto and the
Aichi Kikai Minato plant in Nagoya. Next will be the Kurihama
engine plant in Kanagawa and the Kyushu engine shop in Fukuoka.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 Ghosn wants Nissan to be turning out a variety of models
using only 15 different ``platforms'' (the costly floor structures
that determine many components) at only four plants. Today, the
firm uses no fewer than 24 platforms at seven different plants.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest savings will come when Renault and Nissan start
sharing platforms. The first to be used jointly will come in 2002
with the replacement of Nissan's Micra and Cube models, and
Renault's new Clio and Twingo models.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Nissan and Renault then expect to churn out at
least 1 million units a year using one platform. By 2010, they aim
to concentrate their output on ten shared platforms. Yet even then,
Nissan would still be losing money on every car it built in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With materials and components accounting for more than 60
percent of the cost of making a car, Nissan has to do something
about its fragmented suppliers. So Ghosn intends to cut Nissan's
supplier list from 1,145 firms to no more than 600 within three
years. Suppliers can then spread costs over larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 this is expected to yield a 20 percent saving on
procurement costs, worth $1.7 billion a year. Nissan wants a
further 20 percent reduction in costs by, among other things,
ending the sales incentives that it offers dealers to shift all the
surplus cars it makes.
</P>
<P>
   It will sever relations with a fifth of its domestic-sales
affiliates, shut 10 percent of its retail outlets in Japan,
streamline dealer networks in America and Europe, and give its
advertising to a single agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn also intends to sell anything within the group that is
unprofitable or peripheral to its business. Even the firm's highly
regarded aerospace division could be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the revival aims to trim Nissan's costs by Yen1
trillion and to produce a consolidated operating profit of 4.5
percent of sales by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Will it? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot could still go wrong. Japanese interest rates cannot stay
low for ever, and with debt of Yen2.6 trillion (including Yen1.2
trillion in the firm's financing division) Nissan is horribly
exposed to any rise.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also be hurt more than most by any further
strengthening of the yen against the dollar. Each one-yen rise in
the rate knocks Yen7 billion off the firm's operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any guarantee that Nissan will be able to raise
enough from asset sales to reduce its debts by the Yen700 billion
planned. And Nissan cannot hope to dispose of 16,400 Japanese
workers simply by natural wastage and a freeze on hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming work forces costs around Yen24 million a job, five
times the rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from districts affected by plant closures will
inevitably respond. With a general election next year, the
government is already muttering about stopping Nissan from sending
Japan's record unemployment any higher. Nobody should underestimate
the influence of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Ghosn has a few advantages. Everybody knows that Nissan,
like so many Japanese companies, needs radical treatment. And
Nissan has a corporate style _ bureaucratic, elitist and urbane _
that may be more like Renault's traditional culture than any other
car firm inside or outside Japan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,300 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, Ghosn turned Renault around. If anyone can do
the same for Nissan, it is him. The rest of corporate Japan will be
observing closely from the sidelines _ and may be preparing to
follow his lead. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The electric organ broke into ``The Girl from Ipanema''
just as Carlos Ghosn was due to walk on stage at the Tokyo Motor
Show on Oct. 20. It was just a tease: the music switched to the
usual raucous backing-track as the diminutive, Brazilian-born Ghosn
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   In clear _ if scripted _ Japanese he pledged that the sick man
of the country's industry would become ``younger,'' more dynamic
and bolder.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, speaking to journalists in English, he had
declared that 21,000 jobs must go by March 2002 if the firm is to
survive. No fewer than 16,400 of the cuts will fall in Japan; five
Japanese factories must close.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Ghosn broke into Japanese again.
``There is no alternative,'' he said. ``Failure is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who is credited with restoring Renault chiefly by
cost-cutting, arrived as chief operating officer of Japan's
second-biggest car maker after the French firm had bailed it out
last March, injecting Yen643 billion ($5.4 billion) for a
controlling 37 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jac Nasser, the Australian boss shaking up Ford, Ghosn is
of Lebanese origin _ indeed, they look like cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanese by descent, Brazilian by birth, a French citizen and
Japanese by adoption,'' is how Ghosn puts it.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good mix, for if Ghosn is to succeed, he needs to
combine Arab deal-making, Latin energy, Gallic strategy and an
Asian feeling for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long, if inglorious, tradition in Japan of
bureaucrats using gaiatsu (foreign pressure) to achieve otherwise
unpalatable reforms. As more Japanese companies find that they have
neither the corporate structure nor the stomach to cut waste, close
factories and sack workers, gaiatsu is moving into business.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is not the only Japanese car maker to turn to foreigners.
General Motors has increased its stakes in Isuzu and Suzuki as the
core of its strategy to win 10 percent of the Asian car market.
Since Ford raised its stake in Mazda to one-third, it has run the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fuji Heavy Industries, owner of Subaru, which is affiliated
with Nissan, has acknowledged that its offspring needs a foreign
ally _ possibly GM again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the firm that has most abjectly thrown its lot in with a
foreigner, Nissan is the one being most carefully watched.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn admits that it is easier for an outsider to make changes,
especially as he had nothing to do with previous attempts to mend
Nissan. Even so, powerful plant managers with seats on the board
have thwarted one ``revival'' after another.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has lost money for four of the past five years. This is
probably its last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Nissan's revival was greeted with gasps of horror
and disbelief. Yet Nissan's bosses, and the analysts who follow the
firm, have known for a year that something like it would come along
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Like many firms that overinvested during the bubble, when
capital, in effect, cost almost nothing, Nissan has overcapacity of
30-40 percent. Like others, too, it has taken the easy path of
cutting working hours instead of closing plants and laying off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that a car
maker able to make 2.4 million vehicles a year in Japan, but
producing fewer than 1.3 million, is running its plants at a
disastrously low level.
</P>
<P>
   To reach 75-80 percent utilization, at which point most car
firms break even, capacity needs to shrink by at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ghosn's plan, Nissan's domestic capacity is to drop to a
more realistic 1.65 million units a year by 2002, maybe raising
utilization to 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First to go, by March 2001, will be the assembly plants at
Murayama near Tokyo, the Nissan Shatai factory in Kyoto and the
Aichi Kikai Minato plant in Nagoya. Next will be the Kurihama
engine plant in Kanagawa and the Kyushu engine shop in Fukuoka.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 Ghosn wants Nissan to be turning out a variety of models
using only 15 different ``platforms'' (the costly floor structures
that determine many components) at only four plants. Today, the
firm uses no fewer than 24 platforms at seven different plants.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest savings will come when Renault and Nissan start
sharing platforms. The first to be used jointly will come in 2002
with the replacement of Nissan's Micra and Cube models, and
Renault's new Clio and Twingo models.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Nissan and Renault then expect to churn out at
least 1 million units a year using one platform. By 2010, they aim
to concentrate their output on ten shared platforms. Yet even then,
Nissan would still be losing money on every car it built in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With materials and components accounting for more than 60
percent of the cost of making a car, Nissan has to do something
about its fragmented suppliers. So Ghosn intends to cut Nissan's
supplier list from 1,145 firms to no more than 600 within three
years. Suppliers can then spread costs over larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 this is expected to yield a 20 percent saving on
procurement costs, worth $1.7 billion a year. Nissan wants a
further 20 percent reduction in costs by, among other things,
ending the sales incentives that it offers dealers to shift all the
surplus cars it makes.
</P>
<P>
   It will sever relations with a fifth of its domestic-sales
affiliates, shut 10 percent of its retail outlets in Japan,
streamline dealer networks in America and Europe, and give its
advertising to a single agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn also intends to sell anything within the group that is
unprofitable or peripheral to its business. Even the firm's highly
regarded aerospace division could be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the revival aims to trim Nissan's costs by Yen1
trillion and to produce a consolidated operating profit of 4.5
percent of sales by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Will it? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot could still go wrong. Japanese interest rates cannot stay
low for ever, and with debt of Yen2.6 trillion (including Yen1.2
trillion in the firm's financing division) Nissan is horribly
exposed to any rise.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also be hurt more than most by any further
strengthening of the yen against the dollar. Each one-yen rise in
the rate knocks Yen7 billion off the firm's operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any guarantee that Nissan will be able to raise
enough from asset sales to reduce its debts by the Yen700 billion
planned. And Nissan cannot hope to dispose of 16,400 Japanese
workers simply by natural wastage and a freeze on hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Trimming work forces costs around Yen24 million a job, five
times the rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from districts affected by plant closures will
inevitably respond. With a general election next year, the
government is already muttering about stopping Nissan from sending
Japan's record unemployment any higher. Nobody should underestimate
the influence of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Ghosn has a few advantages. Everybody knows that Nissan,
like so many Japanese companies, needs radical treatment. And
Nissan has a corporate style _ bureaucratic, elitist and urbane _
that may be more like Renault's traditional culture than any other
car firm inside or outside Japan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,300 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, Ghosn turned Renault around. If anyone can do
the same for Nissan, it is him. The rest of corporate Japan will be
observing closely from the sidelines _ and may be preparing to
follow his lead. &QL;

COYOTES RIP KINGS, AS DOES MURRAY

By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Los Angeles Kings first-year coach Andy
Murray called timeout early in the third period Friday night, he
was one angry parent.
</P>
<P>
   The team had blown a two-goal lead and the Phoenix Coyotes
looked like they were ready to pour it on. When they did so, with
five consecutive goals in a 6-3 victory in front of a booing crowd
of 16,572 at the Staples Center, Murray really went off.
</P>
<P>
   He benched his top two lines for the final six minutes of the
game and blasted the entire team when it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to hear the crowd,'' he said. ``I wanted them to
see them leaving. There is a reason there are guys who have played
a lot of playoff games and there is a reason guys haven't. You saw
tonight why our guys don't have a lot of playoff games.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's strict style was brought here to end a string of five
non-playoff seasons in the last six years. The Kings have never
played well against the Coyotes, who went 5-1 against them last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first true test of the season that began 3-1, a
division opponent with just one loss in their first nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a measuring stick here,'' Murray said. ``We talk
about wanting to change things in Los Angeles and everything has
been positive. Then we put in an effort like tonight. It is a
pretty tough thing to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, whose timeouts have helped rally the team earlier this
year, knew the Kings were in trouble, but he had no idea how bad
the meltdown would be. With less than six minutes remaining,
Phoenix forwards Keith Tkachuk and Mika Alatalo scored just 10
seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that second one, they blew by us like we weren't even
there,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of third-line center Ian Laperriere, who
scored his first two goals of the season, they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   First-liners Luc Robitaille, Josef Stumpel and Ziggy Palffy had
one shot in the third period before they were benched. Palffy did
not have one after the first period. The Kings had just four shots
on Phoenix goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov during the first 10 minutes of
the period and 26 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov, elevated to No.1 goalie in the absence of holdout
Nikolai Khabibulin, stopped only seven shots in the third period to
raise his record to 5-1-1. Fiset, who has played in all but one
period of the Kings' first nine games, had 28 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not speak about the rest of the team,'' Fiset said. ``I
know I had a bad game and that is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere's second goal, which beat Shtalenkoa close in after a
pass from Brad Chartrand, came just 1:13 into the second period and
gave the Kings a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Coyotes, no lead was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a man advantage with 15:35 left in the second
period when defenseman Keith Carney went off for hooking. But
Tkachuk, the Coyotes' captain, won the ensuing faceoff and passed
to Teppo Numminen, who got the puck to Dallas Drake at center ice.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kings blue line, Drake fired a long shot past Fiset to
cut the lead to 3-2. Drake's shot tipped off defenseman Garry
Galley and the misdirection confused Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a turning point for us,'' Laperriere said. ``We
weren't the same after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said it was important to address the team before this
morning's practice at the Iceoplex. But now they are preparing for
San Jose on Sunday. The Sharks' 14 points are the most in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) really have to question themselves after this game,''
Murray said. ``We'll see what our team is made of. We have the best
team in the NHL coming in. We haven't faced any real crisis or
controversy. We'll see how we matchup under these circumstances.''

<P>
   The publishing world has offended Barbara Bush's family so much
this month, it's almost enough to make her regret her whole
literacy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush the elder was still reeling from ``Dutch,'' in which
Edmund Morris implied that the Bushes weren't on the coziest terms
with the Reagans, when his son learned about ``Fortunate Son:
George W. Bush and The Making of American President.'' The author,
J.H. Hatfield, alleges that Governor Bush was arrested for cocaine
possession in 1972. But amid reports that Hatfield served five
years in prison for hiring a hit man, St. Martin's Press last week
withdrew the book.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has called ``Fortunate Son,'' ostensibly based
upon him, ``science fiction.'' Edmund Morris has acknowledged that
his book ``Dutch,'' occasionally based on the Reagan White House,
is partly fiction, while the Bushes have said that some of the
non-fiction parts are fiction. ``Primary Colors,'' sometimes based
on the Clinton White House, actually is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   These books all play fast and loose with the truth, as
politicians tend to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd to see George Sr. and Junior feeling slandered; one
expects gossip-happy authors to latch on to more accessible
political dynasties, like the Kennedys, with their fast-lane life
styles and tremendous charisma.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late John F. Kennedy Jr. who attempted with his
magazine George to create a bridge between the glamor of politics
and the gloss of print, to take the dreams of his father's
``Profiles in Courage'' and T.H. White's ``The Making of the
President, 1960'' into a crass, celebrity-obsessed culture.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Politics and publishing have a lot in common. Both
thrive on promises and on sound bites. Both inspire personalities
to reinvent themselves, exaggerate their credits and lie about
their pasts. And both allow for folks to drum up large sums of
money in advance without disclosing too many details about the
project at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if politicians were more forthcoming, they would be
smeared less. The American people can be very forgiving. They might
even forgive candidates for trying drugs, if given the chance. But
candidates typically won't risk it.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bill Clinton, who insisted he never inhaled. This premise
is certainly possible, knowing his desire to please all of the
people all of the time: He appeared to puff, to placate his smoking
buddies, yet knew he wanted to enter politics and say he'd never
done drugs. So he simply held the joint to his lips, in a perfect
moment of bipartisan pandering and poignant self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush will specify only what he has ``not'' done _
that is, not used an illegal drug in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that denial and self-denial at the highest levels
bring the unauthorized biographers out of the woodwork. St.
Martin's pulled ``Fortunate Son'' off shelves on the ground that if
Hatfield were a convicted felon that would undermine his
credibility _ as if authoring such works as an unauthorized
``X-Files'' encyclopedia lent him much credibility in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The everyday lies expected in politics can loom larger when they
are under oath or inside the pages of a book. By offering books of
half-truths, publishing offers a moral mirror of politics. But
politics offers the distinct evils of sinning and lying about it.
In publishing, lying can be a crime in itself, since it can
constitute libel.
</P>
<P>
   If Hatfield invented the cocaine charge, that's a serious crime.
But if he's merely a convicted felon who hired a hit man, that
doesn't preclude him from being a successful writer. Indeed, St.
Martin's Press underestimates the forgiveness of the American
people. People might not mind a former convict writing a book as
long as the book is really good. The literati are especially
forgiving, as shown by Norman Mailer's fondness for ``Belly of the
Beast,'' written by the murderer Jack Henry Abbott. And three of
the world's greatest novels were written in prison; John Bunyan,
Cervantes and Dostoyevsky all did time.
</P>
<P>
   The American dream expressed in both politics and literature is
the dream of rebirth and redemption, the notion that anyone can
reform and move on: Former drug users can have political careers;
former felons like Hatfield can write non-fiction works with 54
pages of source notes. The public can forgive almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, that is, except a bad book.

   Scientists Find Enzyme Linked to Alzheimer's
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for years that to forestall or treat
Alzheimer's disease they needed to prevent hard balls of debris
from accumulating in the brain. Now researchers at Amgen have taken
the first step toward that goal. They found an elusive enzyme that
snips a brain protein in two, initiating the formation of the
debris. The next challenge, experts say, is to find a drug that
will block that enzyme. If the scientific theory is correct, such a
drug might halt the death of brain cells in people with the disease
and even prevent the disease in people destined to get it.
</P>
<P>
   A Drop in Gun Violence
</P>
<P>
   A seven percent drop in homicides last year was entirely
attributable to a decrease in killings committed with guns,
according to a report released by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. The decline appears to be the clearest evidence yet
that recent efforts to reduce gun violence through new laws and
police pressure are working. There was also a 10 percent drop in
robberies carried out with guns, accounting for the biggest
decrease of any one category of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Starr Resigns
</P>
<P>
   After overseeing the five-year, nearly $50 million investigation
that led to the impeachment of President Clinton, Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr resigned. He was replaced by
Robert W. Ray, a 39-year-old career federal prosecutor who vowed to
complete the inquiry of Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton ``in a
prompt, reasonable and cost-effective manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his resignation had been prompted by the ``intense
politicization'' of his office's work. White House aides have
already portrayed Ray as an ideologue. Starr rushed to his
successor's defense, saying the criticism should be met with
``sharp and immediate condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Exile Denied
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Papon's efforts to flee justice didn't last long. The
89-year-old former civil servant convicted last year of helping to
send hundreds of French Jews to Nazi death camps was supposed to
start serving his 10-year-sentence on Wednesday. Instead, he issued
a defiant statement saying his only honorable choice was to flee
France and go into exile. Papon was a fugitive for only a few hours
before Swiss police caught up with him in a Gstaad hotel on
Thursday night. Swiss officials handed him back to the French and
he was in jail by Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Money Game Widens
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and top Republican lawmakers agreed
to overhaul America's financial system, repealing Depression-era
laws that have restricted the banking, securities and insurance
industries from expanding into one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The deal paves the way for banking conglomerates to offer
consumer services like brokerage accounts and auto and casualty
insurance. It will enable other financial conglomerates to provide
public stock offerings to their corporate clients but loans as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Indicting McDonnell Douglas
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted McDonnell Douglas _ a unit of
Boeing, _ and a state-owned aerospace company in China on charges
of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale of American
machining equipment. The equipment was intended for a McDonnell
Douglas airliner project in China, but six of the machines were
diverted to a Chinese military plant, although they were never put
to use. The companies denied any wrongdoing and vowed to contest
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists Unite
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists normally help people who are depressed, but now,
as a result of the rise of managed care, some are feeling so
depressed they have taken an unexpected action _ they joined a
union. The New York State Psychological Association and its 3,200
members affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers. Their
hope is the million-member teachers' union will use its lobbying
clout in Albany and Washington to gain psychologists a better deal
from HMOs on reimbursements and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   A Faulty Antidote
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon may have moved closer to solving the mystery of
``gulf war syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   A report it commissioned said an experimental drug given to some
250,000 American troops sent to the Persian Gulf may be linked to
chronic symptoms afflicting thousands of veterans, including
fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss and sleep disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials tried to dampen expectations about the drug,
pyridostigmine bromide, saying more study was needed. But it was
the first time the Pentagon acknowledged a possible cause after
years of ruling out others, including gas attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One Less Candidate
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole pulled out of the presidential race _ before she
had even officially announced her candidacy and long before a
single ballot had been cast. She said she couldn't raise enough
money to compete with the financial fortunes raised by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas or inherited by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money is not the only way to grease a campaign. Mrs. Dole
failed to capitalize on her strengths. She boasted of an
``historic'' campaign as a woman but sent a mixed and uncertain
message about what that meant. She missed several opportunities to
build support. After making a splashy gun-control announcement in
front of a pro-gun crowd in New Hampshire, she did not follow
through. After coming in a strong third in the Iowa straw poll, she
vanished from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Reform Loses
</P>
<P>
   The Senate played its accustomed role in the struggle to
overhaul the campaign finance law: for the fourth consecutive year
Republicans used a filibuster to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The action left the effort to ban large dollar donations to the
political parties in limbo: test votes showed it had a majority of
53 senators behind it, though not the 7 more votes needed to break
the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has put the battle
against special interest money at the center of his presidential
run vowed the issue will not die. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
swore the legislation will not live.
</P>
<P>
   And the money chase for 2000 went ever on.
</P>
<P>
   Teen Worries, Up and Down
</P>
<P>
   Being an American teen-ager today seems both scarier and safer
than a few years ago, according to a new nationwide poll of more
than 1,000 teen-agers by The New York Times and CBS News. The
survey found that more than half believed that their school could
conceivably be struck by the kind of massacre that devastated
Columbine High School in Colorado. But in their more immediate,
everyday lives, teen-agers reported feeling safer: Only 24 percent
said they feared becoming a crime victim, compared to 40 percent in
1994, and concern about violence was generally down.

money to compete with the financial fortunes raised by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas or inherited by Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money is not the only way to grease a campaign. Mrs. Dole
failed to capitalize on her strengths. She boasted of an
``historic'' campaign as a woman but sent a mixed and uncertain
message about what that meant. She missed several opportunities to
build support. After making a splashy gun-control announcement in
front of a pro-gun crowd in New Hampshire, she did not follow
through. After coming in a strong third in the Iowa straw poll, she
vanished from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Reform Loses
</P>
<P>
   The Senate played its accustomed role in the struggle to
overhaul the campaign finance law: for the fourth consecutive year
Republicans used a filibuster to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The action left the effort to ban large dollar donations to the
political parties in limbo: test votes showed it had a majority of
53 senators behind it, though not the 7 more votes needed to break
the filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has put the battle
against special interest money at the center of his presidential
run vowed the issue will not die. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
swore the legislation will not live.
</P>
<P>
   And the money chase for 2000 went ever on.
</P>
<P>
   Teen Worries, Up and Down
</P>
<P>
   Being an American teen-ager today seems both scarier and safer
than a few years ago, according to a new nationwide poll of more
than 1,000 teen-agers by The New York Times and CBS News. The
survey found that more than half believed that their school could
conceivably be struck by the kind of massacre that devastated
Columbine High School in Colorado. But in their more immediate,
everyday lives, teen-agers reported feeling safer: Only 24 percent
said they feared becoming a crime victim, compared to 40 percent in
1994, and concern about violence was generally down.

   Travelers do it in the wake of a terrorist attack when they
decide to drive to Florida for vacation rather than get on a plane.
Diners do it when they forego a sandwich at lunch and then load up
on iced tea and fat-free cookies in the mid-afternoon. And Bobby
Valentine, the manager of New York Mets, did it during the sixth
game of the National League Championship Series, perhaps costing
his team a chance to advance to the World Series that began last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the misunderstanding of cumulative risk. People avoid a
big, obvious risk and instead chose a path that involves many
smaller risks, which taken together tend to be far more
detrimental. In our mathematically illiterate society, the problem
is epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball diamond, particularly during these tense games of
October, offers one of the more accessible examples: the overuse of
the intentional walk.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneered in 1896 by the captain of the New York Giants, William
(Kid) Gleason, it is a standard tool for managers who do not want
to pitch to an especially fearsome hitter. With one or two runners
already on base, the manager orders his pitcher to throw four
deliberate balls to the dangerous batter and instead face the next,
less imposing hitter.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Valentine did in the 11th inning of Tuesday
night's game versus the Atlanta Braves, loading the bases to pitch
to Andruw Jones rather than face Brian Jordan with runners on first
and third base. But as Valentine soon found out, the strategy can
do more harm than good _ as a few back-of-the-envelope calculations
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the score was tied 9-9, and a single run for the
Braves would end the game and the Mets' season with it. By filling
the bases, Valentine left his pitcher no wiggle room. Not only
would a base hit or sacrifice fly give the Braves their 10th run,
but so would an unintentional walk. Sure enough, the Mets' pitcher,
Kenny Rogers, threw four balls to Jones. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was clearly a threat worthy of concern. Versus
left-handed pitchers this year, like Rogers, he hit .331, compared
with Jones' average against lefties of only .271, according to the
Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, isn't the relevant comparison. Instead, one
should look at Jones' on-base percentage, the frequency with which
he gets a hit  &UR; or &LR;  a walk. It was .356 versus lefties,
significantly higher than Jordan's batting average. Remember,
Jordan needed to connect, not walk, to drive in the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   None of this even gets at the emotional aspect of Rogers' having
to pitch with no margin for error, when he was more likely to throw
an easily hittable pitch, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that poor pitcher,'' said Carl N. Morris, the chairman
of Harvard University's statistics department and a longtime
baseball fan. ``He's got to put the ball over the plate in the
biggest game of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Valentine, his decision was hardly an unusual
one, particularly because it created the possibility for a
force-out at any base as well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fans are very likely to see similar strategies again
this week in the World Series. Under their manager, Bobby Cox, the
Braves issued more intentional walks than any other team in the
National League this year. In game five against the Mets, in fact,
Cox intentionally walked the bases loaded and then watched his
relief pitcher walk in the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   The intentional walk often looks even worse when used earlier in
a game, when a high-scoring inning is more important to avoid than
a single run. At that point, the walk gives the batters a free
base-runner, who can become a free run.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier playoff series against the Boston Red Sox, Mike
Hargrove, the manager of the Cleveland Indians (who has since been
fired), had the shortstop Nomar Garciaparra walked to load the
bases in the third inning. The Indians were leading, 5-3, at the
time. The next batter promptly hit a grand slam, putting the Red
Sox ahead, 7-5, in a game they went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do people who are paid to make smart baseball
decisions often err here?
</P>
<P>
   There is actually a nice theory to explain it, Morris said. In
1982, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, then professors at Stanford
University, wrote that people often assess ``the probability of an
event by the ease with which instances or occurrences can be
brought to mind.'' They called this the principle of
``availability.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers envision a slugger crushing a home run before they
adequately consider a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, tourists worry about an apocalyptic plane crash, not
the far more likely fatal highway accident. Homeowners spend
hundreds of dollars on a burglar alarm when simply getting rid of a
gun they own would make their families much safer. And dieters
these days eschew food with fat in it _ fat they can envision
ending up on their midsections _ for low-fat foods that in fact
pack more calories that eventually will turn into body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``innumerate'' decisions, to borrow a word popularized by
John Allen Paulos, a math professor at Temple University, have
clear consequences. Thousands of people really do die on the
highways and from accidental gunshot wounds. The United States,
despite years of obsessing over weight, is more obese than ever.
And, though the stakes are of course far lower, pitchers do
sometimes walk in the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, criticizing a single decision at the end of one of
the most exciting playoff games in history may be a bit harsh.
After all, Valentine ordered an extraordinary five intentional
walks during the previous game, Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports
Bureau noted. No runs scored after any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger point stands: Even if intentional walks eliminate
a short-term problem, on average they may create more long-term
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That is cumulative risk. It's a concept worth pondering for
anyone who travels, eats or will be managing this week in the World
Series.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ The camp for amputees lies on a hill in
the most scenic stretch of Freetown, a favorite spot for British
vacationers before war destroyed Sierra Leone. The palms dotting
the surrounding hills, the nearby wide white beach, the faded
resorts promising respite, all stand in contrast to life inside the
camp: a one-legged girl hopping along one of the labyrinthine
walkways; a young man with one arm sitting on the porch of his
tarpaulin tent-house; an older man with arms hacked off below the
elbows; yet another with very short stumps.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the amputees in this camp _ there were 516 when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid a visit Monday _ were
mutilated by rebels who advanced on Freetown last January. Many
were taken to the city's main public hospital where they languished
for days; then many went to a refugee camp at the national stadium
where they languished for weeks. Eventually they arrived at this
camp, which is run by Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of another international relief organization,
Handicap International, the amputees are learning to use
prosthetics with surviving muscles, to wash themselves, to raise a
spoon to their lips. Some tasks the armless might never master,
though, like buttoning a shirt or tying a knot. But there is more
here than grinding work to relearn the basics. Isatu, a 13-year-old
girl with no arms, plays with her younger sister and friends on the
beach, touching them with her stumps, digging into the sand. A
46-year-old man, who in July said he would never wear unsightly
artificial arms with metal hooks, now takes a pen from a visitor
with his prosthetic and proudly writes down his name on a
reporter's notepad: Lamine Jusu Jarka. In a country where less than
a third of the people can write, isn't it a shame that Jarka's
handwriting is now barely legible? It will improve, he vows.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government has done almost nothing for the amputees.
A few months ago, rumors swept the camp that the government had
gotten German surgeons to come here, and that transplants were
being performed in Europe. They became angry at the government when
the Germans never came.
</P>
<P>
   If the current peace agreement between the government and the
rebels hold _ hopes were raised Friday by a United Nations decision
to send 6.000 peacekeepers _ what will happen to the amputees? Will
the government take care of the thousands who are estimated to have
lost limbs to machetes? Even if the will exists, what can the
government do in a nation that is regarded as the world's poorest
and where everything must be rebuilt? The question is complicated
by the peace agreement, which granted amnesty to all combatants.
Foday Sankoh, the head of the rebellion responsible for most of the
war's atrocities, acknowledged his group's guilt months ago.
Recently, though, he has been backpedaling. Atrocities? Not me. He
appears more interested in the commission on mineral resources that
he will head. He has never visited this camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the amputees might have to rely on the system that
the vast majority of ordinary Africans rely on: the extended
family. In the world's poorest continent, relatives help one
another out; sometimes a sole member supports a large number of
relatives or close friends. If someone lucky enough to have a job
loses it, 15 people suffer, the saying goes. Here in the camp, most
amputees live with their families, secure in the knowledge that
they will never be abandoned. A few of them, however, have lost all
their families. No one knows what will happen to them.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chileans like to call themselves the English
of Latin America, referring to their reserved social etiquette and
taste for afternoon tea, proper high-cut clothes and Tudor
architecture. Probing even deeper into the national psyche, Chilean
intellectuals identify national traits that hark back to another
English century entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us Latin Victorians,'' said Raquel Olea, a prominent
literary critic. But with a difference: ``The Chilean is totally
without anguish about his hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorians? Well, there is a strong similarity. Like the
outwardly proper classes in Britain a century ago, Chileans put on
a strait-laced front behind which all sorts of naughtiness go
undiscussed. But at the same time, as Ms. Olea points out, the
Protestant Victorians in Britain were guilt-ridden while the
overwhelmingly Catholic Chileans go to church, confess and leave
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how Chileans deal with and, in some cases, avoid
dealing with such difficult and morally charged matters as divorce,
abortion and teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is the last country in Latin America where divorce is
still illegal, even though the rich and middle class can easily get
annulments through well-connected lawyers who know which judges
will oblige and which will not. Most couples who break up do not
bother seeking annulment at all, since it is expensive and usually
requires lying in court. They simply separate and then match up
with new, common-law partners.
</P>
<P>
   The practice helps explain why almost half of the couples who
live together in this overwhelmingly Catholic country are not
married and almost half of the children born here are born out of
wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of abortion. Due to a 1989 decree by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet just before he left power, Chile is one of
only four countries _ El Salvador, Malta and Andorra are the others
_ that prohibit the procedure under any conditions, even in cases
involving rape or the life of the mother. A handful of women go to
jail every year after they are caught recuperating in hospitals
from the effects of botched abortions. Still, clandestine abortions
are so common that health experts estimate that the abortion rate
in Chile is among the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stop the clandestine abortions, conservatives
in the Senate proposed a law last year to increase the length of
jail terms for doctors, midwives and others convicted of performing
abortions. The conservatives lost by a single vote, and promise to
fight on.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant teen-agers are legally forbidden to seek abortions, of
course, and are given few other options. Moralistic high school
principals force many to quit their studies, at least until they
give birth, and girls who are showing are asked not to attend
graduation. In just one of many double standards, young fathers
study on and graduate without sanction. And sex education is almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public discourse is one thing, and the way people live is
another,'' said Mariana Aylwin, a former Christian Democratic
congresswoman and senior official in the Education Ministry. ``Our
social elite is very conservative, but I don't know a city in the
world with more motels and infidelity. This is a very hypocritical
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Jocelyn-Holt Letelier, an historian at the Santiago de
Chile University, calls double standards ``the Chilean solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile is traditional, but it is not an orthodox conservative
country,'' he added. ``It is a morally flexible country. If there
is a gay person in the family you accept it without ever talking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorian-like values also creep into the realm of public
expression. More than 50 films and 700 videos have been banned by
government censors in recent years, usually for their sexual
content or criticism of traditional religious practices. Martin
Scorsese's 1988 film ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' for
instance, could not be shown legally here until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Historians and social commentators say Chilean morality has many
roots, one of which is Chile's isolation; the separation from the
rest of the world by deserts, an ocean and Andean peaks, analysts
say, has slowed the spread of new social trends. Another reason is
the lasting Spanish colonial heritage, which gives the military and
the Catholic Church unquestioned authority. Still another is the
lasting shadow of the dictatorship of Pinochet, particularly in the
areas of abortion and reduced public support for family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to the conservatism of the media _ including two
Church-dominated television channels, one run by the Catholic
University and another by the conservative Catholic organization
Opus Dei.
</P>
<P>
   The church is a powerful institution in virtually every Latin
American country, but it fills a unique political space in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the church in neighboring Argentina, which supported the
military juntas of the 1970s despite violations of human rights,
the Church here was one of the few institutions to raise a public
voice against the excesses of the Pinochet dictatorship. The
liberal political role the Church played in the 1970s and 1980s,
paradoxically, now gives the Catholic hierarchy added weight in
defending many of the moral positions previously promoted by the
very military dictatorship it opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Chile is tradition-bound, social change is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress recently gave illegitimate children full legal
rights and struck down a law that made male homosexual intercourse
illegal. Two years ago the Chamber of Deputies passed a divorce law
similar to Spain's _ allowing divorce after a two-year separation.
But conservatives and church leaders have so far been able to block
enactment in the more conservative Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A nascent gay rights movement is beginning to make an impact,
and is even receiving government financial support to combat the
spread of AIDS. Just this month, seven transvestites protested
police brutality before the Supreme Court building and received a
surprising amount of media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been changes but it is much too slow,'' said
Soledad Larrain, a 50-year-old psychologist at the University of
Chile who has been living in a common-law marriage the last several
years, after having her first marriage annulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two children and a grandchild and I have effectively
been married two times,'' Ms. Larrain said. ``But according to this
society, I'm considered to have been single all my life. It's
totally absurd.''

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chileans like to call themselves the English
of Latin America, referring to their reserved social etiquette and
taste for afternoon tea, proper high-cut clothes and Tudor
architecture. Probing even deeper into the national psyche, Chilean
intellectuals identify national traits that hark back to another
English century entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call us Latin Victorians,'' said Raquel Olea, a prominent
literary critic. But with a difference: ``The Chilean is totally
without anguish about his hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorians? Well, there is a strong similarity. Like the
outwardly proper classes in Britain a century ago, Chileans put on
a strait-laced front behind which all sorts of naughtiness go
undiscussed. But at the same time, as Ms. Olea points out, the

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ It doesn't take a theologian to describe
the political role of Islam here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Muslims, but when we vote, we put Islam to one side,''
said Hasan Bisri, a 60-year-old fisherman, as he waited to cast his
ballot in a general election last June. ``In Indonesia we put the
nation first and our religion second.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound odd to many Americans, who for 20 years have
looked at Iran as the model for Islamic rule and are therefore wary
of the prospect of Islamic clerics taking power anywhere. Last
week, Indonesia's legislature elected Abdurrahman Wahid, a frail
Muslim cleric as president, and so it is fair to ask just what the
relationship of religion and politics is here. Indonesia is, after
all, the world's most populous Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Indonesia, Hasan, the fisherman, got it right.
Indonesians are quick to tell you that they form a determinedly
secular nation _ and that this is no anomaly. Islam, they say, is a
tolerant faith; the xenophobia and radicalism associated with it in
Iran, Afghanistan and parts of North Africa are, in their minds,
more Middle Eastern in origin than Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   Though close to 90 percent of Indonesia's 200 million people
describe themselves as Muslims, this will be the first time in
modern times that they will be governed by a religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dozen Muslim parties that contested the June
election e _ which selected the National Assembly that chose Wahid
_ called for an Islamic state. And even among these, Wahid's
philosophy is considered the most moderate and inclusive, so much
so that he may have more political trouble from other Muslim
parties than from secular nationalists and military leaders, who
also support him.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, 59, is the chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, a moderate
Islamic society that claims to have 30 million members. But his
power base is far broader. His backers included an old-guard
political party, at least part of the parliamentary bloc of the
military, and the bloc of Islamic parties. Once elected, he brought
the nation's secular nationalists under his big tent by choosing
their leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   M R. Wahid, who is popularly known by his nickname Gus Dur, ``is
the most tolerant and the most nationalistic among the Muslim
leaders and the one most trusted amongst the minorities,'' said a
prominent political scientist, Jusuf Wanandi, a member of the
ethnic Chinese minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore if we are going to have a Muslim leader, it's good
that we have this guy to see how it is going to play out,'' Wanandi
said. ``This might as well be the time to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ethnic Chinese political analyst, Arief Budiman, said:
``He is the hero of some Christians here. As a matter of fact, some
Muslim leaders are suspicious that Gus Dur is an agent of the
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimism about Wahid's presidency, among many people here,
extends to one of the most potentially destabilizing issues he will
face: an Islamic separatist rebellion in the northern Sumatran
province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Indonesia has for the most part responded to to the
rebellion in habitual style: through military repression. Wahid has
said he supports a degree of power sharing between the central
government and the provinces. Since he is a respected Muslim
leader, analysts here say, he might have a chance of reaching an
accommodation with the people of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   In a paradox that goes to the heart of the character of Wahid as
well as of Indonesian Islam, it is the Islamic political parties
that could pose the most troublesome challenge to the new
president. They consider him too moderate, too liberal, too
tolerant of other religions and other ways of thought, too
determined to separate religion from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using religious politics is a dangerous tendency,'' Wahid once
said. ``Let the government govern and let the religious groups take
care of their own affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts here are optimistic that Wahid's inclusiveness
is broad enough to embrace these theological antagonists as well.
Their chances for political influence were far weaker during the
32-year tenure of President Suharto, who worked hard to minimize
the political clout of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Wahid's branch of Islam and that of more
politically assertive groups has led to tensions, sharp words and
even small-scale violence in the past. But their differences are
only a matter of degree.
</P>
<P>
   All subscribe to Indonesia's basic philosophy of inclusion,
called Pancasila, that requires all citizens to claim a belief in
God but allows them to choose equally among five religions: Islam,
Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Atheism is not
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Indonesia offers the Muslim world a model quite
different from that of Middle Eastern regimes and one that is
epitomized by Wahid's inclusive liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very charmed by him because he can talk about civil
society and liberation theology and he himself is a democrat and he
loves classical music,'' said Olle Tornquist, a Scandinavian
scholar who studies Asian societies. ``He is the kind of Muslim
that we in the West would all like to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasir Tamara, deputy publisher of an Islamic newspaper,
Republika, covered the return from Paris to Iran of Ayatollah
Khomeini in 1979 and now, 20 years later, the election of Wahid. He
said the two events have nothing in common. There is no revolution
here, he said; nothing fundamental will change.
</P>
<P>
   He called the tolerant Indonesian model ``the largest social
experiment in Islamic history'' and ``the most important
interpretation of Islam in the 20th century.'' At least in terms of
sheer size, there is no arguing with him. More people claim Islam
as their religion in Indonesia than in the entire Middle East.

   This month marks the 30th anniversary of the Arpanet, the
Internet's predecessor. Then again, maybe it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Los Angeles was ground zero for
the Arpanet. Then again, maybe it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   This anniversary of the Internet has been a particularly
contentious one. Vice President Al Gore's misstatement to CNN last
spring that he ``took the initiative'' in inventing the whole thing
was roundly ridiculed by anyone with an inkling of the network's
true origins. But in recent months, several more genuine contenders
have stepped forward to stake a claim to this or that invaluable
piece of the invention, giving rise to a number of public spats.
</P>
<P>
   As barbs fly and longstanding friendships disintegrate, figuring
out just who did what when is more difficult than ever.
</P>
<P>
   I know about this problem at close range. In 1993, when I began
researching a history of the Arpanet, the story seemed a relatively
straightforward one. I scoffed when one of the Net's many fathers
said to me one day: ``Why are you even trying to write a history?
No matter what you write, it won't be the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true of history in general, anyone who tries
to write the real story of the Internet right now will encounter a
welter of contradictory material. Now graying, the scientists who
took part in building the Net are busier than they ever were, not
inventing new technologies but telling their side of the story to
reporters, putting up time lines and history pages on their Web
sites and shooting off e-mail messages. The goal, of course, is not
to get rich but to secure a spot in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're witnessing is a case of history getting revised in
real time,'' said Peter J. Denning, a computer science professor at
George Mason University who took part in the development of the
Internet but has remained a largely silent observer. ``We are
watching the process of myth-making as it happens around us.
Eventually certain people will emerge out of the myth and lots of
what's been accomplished will be ascribed to them, even if they
didn't do it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The revision of history while the principal participants are
still alive is not new. The author Stephen E. Ambrose said he
grappled with the phenomenon recently when writing about the
construction of the transcontinental railroad 130 years ago, an
immense project in which dozens of luminaries like Sen. Thomas Hart
Benton and the industrialist Leland Stanford had a hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see how those people fought each other,'' he said.
``They would write letters to The Railroad Journal, or Horace
Greeley's paper, saying, `I'm the one who first suggested it's
possible to build a railroad across the country.'''
</P>
<P>
   To try to sort it out for himself, Ambrose relied on a
well-established body of literature. His advantage was not having
to fend off calls from Leland Stanford's p.r. agency. Nevertheless,
he found no consensus. ``I threw up my hands,'' Ambrose said.
``Don't ask me who first thought of it. I could give you a lot of
entries into the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University,
says it's a common problem. ``History is constantly being revised
in informal ways, in popular culture and in private
conversations,'' he said. ``There are always many different
versions.''
</P>
<P>
   What's new, Brinkley said, isn't the revisionism as much as the
presence of the Internet as a revisionist's tool, providing an easy
way to spread one's own version of events. The latter-day
equivalent of fighting it out in letters to the editor is to spam
the world with your take, using the Internet as an amplifier.
Whoever is fastest with the send button, whoever has the lengthier
``cc'' list, is most likely to rise above the din.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars are wondering if the Internet will make the process of
historical inquiry more difficult. ``The word definitiveness comes
to mind,'' said Neil M. Postman, a professor of communications at
New York University. ``Print is more definitive. Books preserve
information. The Internet moves information. So with information on
the move, appearing and disappearing, and without gate-keepers, it
diminishes the credibility of claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do electronic versions of events have a way of drifting
more quickly and easily into the public's consciousness, but they
underscore how quickly other information can disappear from the
record.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the continuing paternity battle over the
Internet, Denning pointed to 1989, a more subdued time in the Net's
evolution, when a symposium commemorating the 20th anniversary of
the Arpanet took place at UCLA. Back then, the Net was still
relatively obscure and there was nothing much at stake. In
attendance were the very men slugging it out today. A transcript of
the event has them lavishing one another with praise and credit.
But that transcript exists not on the Internet but on paper tucked
away in the archive of the Charles Babbage Institute of Computer
History in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever remaining solidarity there might be among the Net's
founding fathers is increasing strained. There is one contingent
that stands by early September, when the network got its first
node, as the birth date of the Arpanet. Others continue to claim it
was late October, when the first electronic bits passed from UCLA
to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute, about 300 miles
to the north. Some profess to have invented packet-switching, the
data transmission technology that made it all possible. Still
others claim to have had the idea for a network in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brinkley does not believe the Internet will hamper
historians' ability to gather facts. ``I don't think the Internet
has reinvented history,'' he said. ``It's just expanding and
complicating it a bit. History is always contested, and over time
frivolous claims get discounted, and more serious claims get more
attention, and eventually there's a consensus around a particular
answer. You won't have the open-ended disputes that are going on
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Time may also slow the rush for recognition. Every so often, the
Internet is not glorified but blamed _ for inflation, for the slump
in dot-com stocks, for widening the gap between haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the true dark side comes along, you won't see people
scrambling to take credit for that part,'' Denning said. ``It will
be, `That's not the part I had anything to do with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll say that was Al Gore's part.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The news from Wall Street last week drew attention to probably
the most startling contrast imaginable in American popular culture:
Martha Stewart and the World Wrestling Federation, both going
public to investors on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Stock buyers were clearly more enamored with the mistress of
domesticity than with the minders &UR; 13 &LR;  of Stone Cold Steve Austin
and The Rock. She reportedly became a billionaire overnight, at
least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, Ms. Stewart and the WWF &UR; 9 &LR;  have a lot in
common, if you take a warped look at quotations from the current
issues of her magazine, Martha Stewart Living, and the wrestling
federation's two magazines, WWF &UR; 9 &LR;  Magazine and WWF &UR; 9 &LR;  RAW.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture Alterations  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: Inevitably you have more guests than dining-room chairs. So
you drag a couple of chairs in from another room, but they are a
different style. To unify this motley collection, make a matching
set of chair-back covers.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : At the 1999 Royal Rumble, Mick Foley was blasted 12
times by a chair swung by The Rock. A few weeks later, the Road
Dogg &UR; 14 &LR;  drilled Al Snow four times, swinging a chair on ``Raw.''
... Unprotected chair shots are metallic reservations for the
``Alzheimer's Hilton'' and competitors in this business try to
avoid them at all costs.  &QL; 
Aromas!  &QL; 
Martha: You can follow your nose the 15 miles between the two
shops; the irresistible smell of cinnamon sugar and hot biscuits
pulls you from one to the other.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : Nothing rejuvenates pure evil like the putrid smell of
his victims' blood.  &QL; 
A Love of the Wild &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: Do you know? Some species of cactus _ prickly pears _ grow
wild on well-drained, sunny sites as far east as Florida and
Massachusetts, and up into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : As Boss Man left the dressing room, Snow leaped onto
him from a platform _ blasting him with a steel chair and dragging
him into the dressing room, where Boss Man battered Snow with a
case containing his dog, Pepper, and hit him with a blackboard.
Snow rammed his rival's head into a glass case and a garage door,
and the pair continued their fracas onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   They soon wound up fighting at an outdoor cafe and in a downtown
Minneapolis bar ... Snow borrowed a chain from a customer to use as
a weapon, delivered a moonsault &UR; 15 &LR;  from the bar, hit the Boss Man
with a billiard ball and scored the pin on a pool table after
smashing the former corrections officer with his own nightstick.  &QL; 
Sandwiches  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: Open-face sandwiches are layered with roasted vegetables,
ham, turkey and Swiss, then heated until the cheese melts. They are
served with homemade dill pickles and sweet-potato wedges.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : A ``Rock sandwich'' doesn't consist of meat or tuna
fish but instead several fresh slices of smoked ``shut your mouth''
and some honey-baked ``smackdown &UR; 16 &LR; .'' There's no cheese _ The
Rock doesn't like cheese! Rolls  &QL; 
Martha: Today, with time in short supply, fresh-baked dinner rolls
are a particular treat. While they take a little more effort, rolls
are no harder to bake than bread. They are, of course, nothing more
than bread dough that has been formed, usually by being rolled in
the palms, into smaller, individual portions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : D'Lo &UR; 17 &LR;  countered with the Real Deal, a tilt-a-whirl
slam and legdrop &UR; 18 &LR; . When he tried somersaulting onto his rival,
though, Jarrett rolled out of the way. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Decorating  &QL; 
Martha: Ask the children to help decorate (the Thanksgiving table).
They can place felt finger puppets atop candy sticks for a sweet
yet simple centerpiece; older kids can cut and glue paper shapes
for a Mayflower centerpiece and help arrange plates and cutlery.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : ``As fans of body art,'' the wrestler Prince Albert
says, ``of course we're concerned about maintaining a clean and
safe environment when we pierce and tattoo. We wouldn't want
someone's nipple or tongue to get infected and turn green!''  &QL; 
Women Getting Together  &QL; 
Martha: I think I tasted some of Sara's food at a party in New
York, asked to meet her, and persuaded her, and her friend Jane
Stacey &UR; 19 &LR; , a baker, to come and work for me in Connecticut as
chefs in my growing catering business ... They immediately made the
parties I catered even more special.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : Smarting from a recent attack by the champion, Tori &UR; 20 &LR; 
came into the ring with fists swinging, debilitating her rival with
series of suplexes &UR; 21 &LR; . After bouncing off the ropes, Ivory slid
under her foe's legs, drove her face into the mat and executed a
giant swing.
</P>
<P>
   Tori &UR; 20 &LR;  tackled her opponent, spun her upside down and hoisted
her over her shoulders. When Tori &UR; 20 &LR;  tried a sunset flip, however,
Ivory shifted her weight and fell on top of the contender for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the humiliation, Ivory tried ripping off Tori's &UR; 20 &LR; 
outfit after the bell. Suddenly Luna _ absent from the Federation
for months _ stampeded into the ring and chased the Women's
Champion back to the dressing room.  &QL; 
Cravings &UR; 22 &LR;   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha: In some families, [Thanksgiving is) largely about stuffing.
After the first helping, the guests all wait for their fullness to
subside so they can have more.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : Gangrell &UR; 23 &LR;  has a hunger, a thirst, an appetite for
control over and complete domination of others. Within him is an
innate drive to lead a tribe of men he can manipulate _ bend to his
will.  &QL; 
Bluster  &QL; 
Martha: Even people who cherish the blustery winds of winter agree
that they are best left outdoors where nature intended.  &QL; 
The WWF &UR; 9 &LR; : You call yourself a fan? Well, son, if you're not a
member of the Squared Circle Club, you're just a piece of trash!

<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S.-VISAS (Moscow) _ Exclusive: The U.S. Embassy in
Moscow has sharply curtailed the number of visas issued to
Russians, particularly students and scholars, even as Washington
insists it wants to spread Western values in Russia. Embassy
officials say they need to be particularly vigilant after the
Russian economy collapsed last year, but critics say the embassy
has overreacted and that many worthy candidates have been cast
aside. By Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS-COLUMNIST (Soweto, South Africa) _ A former jitney
driver who now writes a newspaper column about living with HIV has
received an outpouring of support, which has surprised many in a
country where the taboos about discussing AIDS are often
impenetrable. By Rachel L. Swarns &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   IRAN-CLERIC-TRIAL (Teheran, Iran) _ At his trial next week,
Abdullah Nouri, a key figure in Iran's Islamic reform movement,
will face the most serious charges leveled against any Muslim
cleric since the Islamic takeover _ insulting the prophet Mohammed
and the Ayatollah Khomeini, backing banned political parties, and
``propagating'' friendly ties with the United States and Israel. By
John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ASSESS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Having anointed its new
leaders this week, Indonesia now finds itself facing the even more
daunting task of redefining and reconstructing a nation whose
institutions, politics, economy and sense of purpose had been
bankrupted by the long rule of former President Suharto. A news
analysis. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-POLITICS (Buenos Aires) _ Unemployment and crime are
up, wages are down, and polls show that a growing number of
Argentines think their politicians are stealing fortunes.
Argentines want change, and every recent poll shows that they will
get it, electing Buenos Aires Mayor Fernando de la Rua as president
on Sunday. By Clifford Krauss.

   WASHINGTON _ Although Al Gore has been on the national political
stage for decades, there is much that many voters still do not know
about him, and he has recently been drawing attention to one of
those blind spots: his military service in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign advertisements that began airing last week, Gore
highlighted that service. And for an article in the current issue
of Talk magazine, Gore gave hours of interviews on his decision to
go to war.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits seem designed to flesh out a man often seen as
wooden and perhaps to distinguish him from other presidential
candidates _ most notably, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has
long faced questions about whether his family pulled strings so he
could spend the Vietnam years as a pilot in the Texas Air National
Guard in Houston. But they raise a question, especially in the
context of the Oval Office's current occupant: Are voters impressed
much by a politician's military record or lack of one?
</P>
<P>
   Historians and political analysts said there is no simple
answer, but that in general a military record holds less sway than
before. These experts cited a variety of reasons, beginning with
the fact that more than half a century since the end of World War
II, serving in the military is more the exception than the rule for
most Americans, and is not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see plenty of candidates for the House and Senate, and they
all gives us a resume, and it may say National Guard duty,'' said
Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, a
nonpartisan newsletter that interviews and evaluates candidates.
``But most of the time, the candidates are crowing as to what
church they go to or whether they're in the Rotary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican who is arguably Bush's chief rival for the
party's presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, was a
prisoner of war in Vietnam. But that aura of heroism has perhaps
paled next to the famous surname and tens of millions of dollars in
campaign contributions that have helped propel Bush into the lead.
And Bush _ who has said he is not aware of any favoritism leading
to his noncombat Vietnam experience _ does not seem particularly
worried about voters homing in on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in 1992 gave Bill Clinton something of a pass for
avoiding Vietnam, just as voters have given passes to many
Republican and Democratic members of Congress who also found ways
out of that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although a letter to a draft board that showed Clinton worried
about his ``political viability'' contributed to his critics'
dismissal of him as ``slick Willie,'' it did not sink him at the
polls. In the primaries, he beat Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam. In the election, Clinton
beat President George Bush, a decorated World War II veteran, as
well as Ross Perot. In 1996, Clinton trounced a decorated World War
II veteran, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   There remain prominent politicians whose military backgrounds
undeniably burnished their credentials and smoothed their ascents
to office, among them Sens. McCain, Kerrey, Max Cleland, D-Ga., and
Chuck Hagel, R-Okla. But historians and political analysts noted
that those men were decorated heroes, and the political plus of
that special status does not mean that it is a political minus to
have no record of military service at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a presidential historian at Princeton
University, said that voters' reaction to a candidate's military
background depends on the type and details of the service. The
political historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. added, ``It depends
on the war.'' In the case of Vietnam, the conflict most relevant
for the largest number of politicians today, Americans' ambiguity
toward the war translates into a willingness to forgive men who
avoided it.
</P>
<P>
   David Doak, a Democratic strategist in Washington, said that
when he worked on the recent campaign of Gov. Gray Davis of
California, polling and focus groups suggested that Davis earned
points when voters learned of his service in Vietnam. But that same
research showed that he stood to lose points if he cited an
opponent's avoidance of service, Doak said.
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic suggests that Gore must be careful in how he
presents his own military history, which is not one of dramatic
combat. Rather, he was an Army journalist, an attractive assignment
that has attracted its own scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore plays it right, it could soften Gore's somewhat
stiff profile and also peg him in some voters' minds as a moderate,
Doak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think military service helps Democrats in particular,'' he
said. Rightly or wrongly, he said, ``It sends a signal that they're
not run-of-the-mill ultra-liberals.''  &QL;

   TOKYO _ The Nissan Motor Co. could well serve as a metaphor for
postwar Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, David Halberstam held up Nissan in ``The
Reckoning'' as a shining example of Japanese economic prowess in
marked contrast to American ineptitude. But in the last decade
Nissan has mirrored all that is wrong with this country .
</P>
<P>
   Staggering under Himalayan sized debts, an arthritic bureaucracy
and bloated inventories of boring cars, it reflects a Japan
burdened by massive public liabilities, an aging population, an
ossified corporate sector, one-party rule and a weak financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Nissan announced a radical plan to transform itself,
paring 20,000 workers, shutting down factories and embracing
foreign management know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, is changing, despite the conventional wisdom that
has written it off as a moribund economic power. Here, more than in
most places, changes in business portend widespread change in the
community because business is such an integral part of Japanese
society.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, even as its economy has gone from bad to
worse, Japan has evolved, beyond the West's field of view. Change
has come so far now that even if Japan wanted to keep it a secret,
it no longer could.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps popping out and exhibiting itself like the mischievous
alter ego of the solemn puppets that appear in Japan's highly
stylized bunraku, or puppet theater, creating embarrassment and
havoc for Japan but hope and excitement in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes have been overshadowed by the broader
economic landscape, which remains overcast. But they are startling.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few:
</P>
<P>
   _Japanese consumers are living better than they did during
Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s, and now they can demand
better prices, more choices and less government interference in
their economy. And they are increasingly likely to express their
displeasure at the polls: The party that has ruled Japan almost
exclusively since World War II has for the last several years
retained its grip on power only as part of a coalition, and it was
handed a humiliating setback in elections last year for the Upper
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   _Foreigners are being allowed to buy Japanese companies _
something once unthinkable. Japan's financial crisis has toppled
that barrier, and Japan has even allowed a crown jewel of its
industrial heyday, the Long-Term Credit Bank, to come under foreign
control. The hope is that foreign owners will bring in services
common outside Japan and force Japanese competitors to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   _Japan is continuing to place its bets on manufacturing
technology, and those bets are paying off with leadership in an
array of products, from cars that run on both electricity and
gasoline to higher-tech display screens used in computers and
cellular telephones. These investments are raising Japan's
productivity rates, with the result that Japanese workers are
working fewer hours than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Ezrati, an American who is chief investment officer at
Nomura Asset Management, is so convinced that change is afoot in
Japan that he named his new book on the subject ``Kawari: How
Japan's Economic and Cultural Transformation Will Alter the Balance
of Power Among Nations.'' Kawari means change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan was never going to eat us alive,'' Ezrati said. ``And
they aren't going to die a miserable death now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest single impetus for change that he cites in
his book is the deregulation of the financial sector, which started
in April 1998 and has allowed a flock of American and European
bankers to begin plying their wares and services here in direct
competition with Japanese financial services companies, which were
long accustomed to operating in a largely closed market. The GE
Capital Corp., General Electric's vast financial services arm, has
snapped up several large Japanese companies, and dozens of similar
deals have been struck.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most symbolically astounding advance by foreigners
was the purchase of Long-Term Credit Bank, the institution that
bankrolled the transformation of Japan after World War II, by
Ripplewood Holdings LLC. The bank became available for acquisition
because it got itself into trouble making speculative real estate
loans and failing to use proper credit analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ripplewood intends to use the bank as a sort of skeleton
from which it can offer innovative products and services like
private banking and securities services, as well as consumer
lending, which in Japan has been a province dominated not by banks
but by specialized companies that charge exorbitant interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Major political figures were afraid that a bank controlled by
foreigners would call the loans of major corporations and political
patrons, and might discover some of the less savory aspects of the
financial back-scratching that goes on between big companies here
and many politicians. But those objections lost out to the argument
that turning Long-Term Credit over to Ripplewood would raise the
bar for all Japanese banks in much the same way that Citibank's
introduction of 24-hour automated teller machines forced them to
adopt round-the-clock banking.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, competition is already forcing changes. Two Japanese
banks, Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank, announced a merger that
violated a long-held Japanese taboo against lending money outside
their particular keiretsu, or cluster of manufacturing and
financial companies. But the two banks had belonged to different
groups, and the merged bank put Japan on notice that keiretsu
loyalties would no longer be sacred.

</P>
<P>
   Another sign of change has been visible in a running fight this
year between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance _ a
result of a law that severed corrosive links between the two
institutions. Surprisingly for a country that has long kept policy
disputes behind closed doors, the bank and the ministry publicly
clashed last month when the bank refused to lower interest rates
any more, despite considerable political pressure. The battle
suggests that open, healthy debate on policy is becoming
increasingly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Change is also afoot in Japan's traditional stronghold, the
manufacturing sector. The country's auto manufacturers, which are
its pride and joy, have been hammered hard by the domestic
recession and the economic collapse of Asia, but they have also
brought out the world's first mass-produced cars that run at least
partly on electricity. Moreover, it's becoming commonplace for even
garden-variety domestic car models to have navigation systems built
into their dashboards. It is precisely to get hold of those sorts
of new technology that Renault S.A., the French car maker,
purchased a chunk of Nissan in the spring, and then pressed Nissan
to make the changes it announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the woes of high-tech giants like Toshiba,
NEC and Hitachi, and these companies have indeed suffered mightily
from self-imposed missteps and externally imposed hardships. But in
them, it is also possible to glimpse Japan's immense if undervalued
capacity to adapt. Their efforts to make ever better liquid crystal
displays, which are used in everything from computer screens to
cellular telephones, have allowed manufacturers like Hitachi and
NEC to roll in profits even as they stop producing money-losers
like home appliances. American companies, meanwhile, opted not to
invest in the technological development needed to manufacture
LCD's, which costs anywhere between five and eight times what it
costs to develop software.
</P>
<P>
   Eamonn Fingleton, an author and journalist who is often a lonely
optimist on the subject of Japan and its future, argues that
investment in such ``hard industries'' puts Japan in position for
far greater success than does American investment in ``soft
industries'' like the Internet. Because so much has been invested
in manufacturing here, he said, ``workers are working inevitably
with very sophisticated machines and their productivity is much
greater than it would be if they had less capital behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for Japanese workers has been a reduction in working
hours, while American workers, off the assembly line and ensconced
in their high-tech, wired offices, are working more. In general,
average Japanese consumers are also better off today than they were
during the heady days of the economic boom more than a decade ago _
partly because prices have fallen and partly because intrepid
Japanese tourists have come back from their voyages demanding
better and different goods and services. Houses are bigger, the
number of households owning a car has increased, and the number of
Japanese traveling abroad climbed throughout the '90s until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's low usage of the Internet is often trotted out
as an indicator of its supposed inability to innovate, there are
signs that is changing, too. Japan surpassed Germany last year as
home to the second-largest population of Internet users after the
United States. Japanese investors have opened almost 200,000 online
trading accounts already. And while the Japanese may be behind in
their use of the Internet, many of those that are wired connect
while commuting, using only a cellular telephone about the size of
a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as much as the Japanese understand that change is
necessary, they may never fully embrace it. Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and a host of other politicians have politely condemned
Nissan for the drastic impact its plans will have on local
communities. Japan honors and cherishes tradition, and so far many
of its economic adjustments have resulted in higher unemployment,
rising crime and more homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I truly tell my constituent to like change when, for her,
it may mean her husband gets laid off?'' asked Taro Kono, a young,
Western-educated legislator who is, in many ways, a firebrand. ``I
don't know.''

   SOWETO, South Africa _ For three years, Lucky Mazibuko obeyed
his society's unwritten rules. He kept silent about the virus in
his blood. He wept at night, when his mother could not hear him. He
hid his suffering from the world and waited quietly for death.
</P>
<P>
   On the dusty, bustling streets here, where at least one of every
four people carries the virus that causes AIDS, people still call
it the white man's disease, the gay man's disease, the foreigner's
disease. Even discussing the sickness is shameful, so shameful that
an advocate for people with AIDS in another township was killed by
her neighbors in December for disclosing that she was HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   But Mazibuko finally got tired of hiding. Earlier this year, he
called The Sowetan, the biggest daily newspaper in South Africa. He
wanted to write a weekly column. He wanted his photograph to run
with it. He wanted to show the nation that a black man could live
with the human immunodeficiency virus and still hold his head high.
The title?
</P>
<P>
   ```Just Call Me Lucky,' '' said Mazibuko, 30, his eyes dancing.
``Because I'm the luckiest man in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the killing of the activist, Gugu Dlamini,
Mazibuko became the first black person to be hired by a major
newspaper to shatter the culture of shame and silence surrounding
HIV. And to his astonishment, he has been embraced, not hounded
from town. Since the column began in March, he has been courted by
television shows, radio programs, magazines and local schools.
</P>
<P>
   He tells his audience that it is safe and sexy to use condoms.
He urges people to stay healthy. (``No fried food,'' he chides.
``No sugar, margarine, butter, oil or fat.'') And every Tuesday,
for the newspaper's overwhelmingly black readers _ a circulation of
over 200,000, but the editors estimate that shared copies reach 1.5
million people _ he chronicles a dying man's struggle to deal
passionately, mischievously and plaintively with the deadly illness
that has invaded his body and community.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a man who was dying of AIDS on television,'' he wrote
this month. ``His ribs looked like the strings of a guitar. His
head looked more like a rugby ball. His eyes were huge like an
owl's. I could see myself in that man's battered body.''
</P>
<P>
   People gasp when they read his words and see his face. He is an
ordinary man _ not a journalist _ who used to drive a jitney for a
living. (``Isn't that our hometown boy,'' they whisper as he walks
by. ``Isn't that the man with HIV?'')
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper employees, who once feared he might infect the Sowetan
newsroom, now share his meals. Wrinkled women squeeze beside him on
the jitneys he rides to work and share stories about sick children.
Social workers tape his columns to hospice walls, to give dying
patients hope. And with each unexpected handshake and each
tentative question, Mazibuko says he feels the winds of change
blowing across his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is more complicated. Deeply held hostilities fade
slowly. And advocates for people with AIDS emphasize that many
people here still die alone in hospitals or shacks, abandoned by
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But as the sickness sweeps through Soweto, and the faces peering
from the funeral announcements grow ever younger, it is becoming
harder to ignore the crisis. And with his column, the activists
say, Mazibuko is helping to open eyes that were once squeezed shut.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``His column cuts across all the myths: that it's somebody else,
somebody overseas, somebody in Zambia,'' said Glen Mabuza, the
project manager of AIDS Counseling and Training, a nonprofit group
that counsels and supports HIV-positive people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is somebody here, somebody in Soweto,'' Ms. Mabuza said.
``His picture is real. They can see he's a real person. And he's
speaking to us, to the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone loves the new column. Some church leaders have
condemned his endorsement of condoms, Mazibuko said. Some elders
have grumbled that he promotes premarital sex. A former girlfriend
called to complain that he had embarrassed her and possibly
infected her with the disease. (He suggested that she take an HIV
test. She never called back.) And his 8-year-old son, Nkululeko,
was peppered with questions by classmates, who had heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   The boy asked his father: ``I know you have it. But what does
having AIDS mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Mazibuko explained sadly: ``I just told him, it is like flu. The
only difference is that it doesn't go away; eventually it kills
you.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is healthy. He is short and stylish, with budding
dreadlocks, wire-rimmed glasses and a booming laugh that rumbles
through the newsroom. He was born in Soweto and never left. When he
finished 12th grade, he started driving a jitney.
</P>
<P>
   His mission is to spread the word through those familiar
streets, to the young men hawking tires, the giggling girls in blue
school uniforms and the barefoot children who race gleefully
through the dust.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He grew up poor, without electricity, without information. And
he rages against prominent white advocates for AIDS victims, who,
he complains, rarely bring their message to the townships.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people, they have all these galas, all these lunches in
posh places, but they've never been to Soweto,'' Mazibuko said.
``They are not reaching my people, the majority of people. This is
about bringing meaning to the people on the street, the ordinary
people like myself, the people who face the brunt of the disease.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   His columns are plain-spoken and no-nonsense. He urges
HIV-positive workers to study their legal rights. He attacks drug
companies for making medication too costly. He describes poignant
letters from parents who have abandoned children with AIDS. And he
tells readers they must take responsibility for their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are people still engaging in unprotected sex, thus
exposing innocent children to HIV infection through pregnancy?'' he
wrote in a column published in June. ``Is it not our own people who
have to understand that their behavior has to change?''
</P>
<P>
   Racheal Plo, who has been HIV positive for three years, was
stunned to read his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know, who was this man? Who was he?'' said Ms.
Plo, 24. ``I read it each and every time it comes out. I knew then
that I wasn't the only person with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the newsroom, some employees still viewed Mazibuko with
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Aggrey Klaaste, the editor of The Sowetan, explained that the
column would help the paper fulfill its goal of better informing
readers about HIV. The United Nations, which runs a program to
support HIV-infected workers, would help pay the salary. And
Mazibuko would counsel staff members about the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some workers worried: could you get infected by touching
him, eating with him, sitting next to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very uncertain about him being here,'' said Thembinkosi
Nxumalo, 34, the manager of building services. ``There are so many
myths. I didn't know what to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he decided to ask Mazibuko. The columnist told him all
he knew about HIV. And in the end, Nxumalo decided to take an HIV
test and to use condoms regularly. ``It was really an eye-opener,''
Nxumalo said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has also been an eye-opener for Mazibuko, who has
been forced to confront his sexual past. Earlier this year, he got
a phone call from another old girlfriend, who had seen his photo in
the paper. She asked whether he remembered her name.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed he could not. He has had sex with so many women _
without ever using condoms _ that he cannot remember them all.
``There was a time when I called them all darling because I had
forgotten their names,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered.
</P>
<P>
   They met seven years ago. He was driving a jitney and she was a
passenger. She was a beautiful woman, he said, and they had sex
several times. On the phone, she told him she had been infected
with the virus then, and that she had probably infected him. She
was already losing weight, feeling the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, he found himself face to face with his own
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't work,'' he said. ``I cried sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazibuko says he tries not to think about getting sick. There
are too many things he wants to do. He wants to write a book. He
wants to negotiate a raise. (He earns about $650 a month.) And he
wants to spend time with his son, daughter, mother and other
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But it is impossible to ignore the inevitable. His mother says
she plans to sell her house when he gets sick, to pay for
medication. His boy points at the neighborhood cemetery and asks
whether he will find his father there someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to want to be a top businessman, a rich black
businessman in this community,'' Mazibuko said. ``Now I just want
to live, you know?''

   What makes the brain unique among bodily organs is that its
cells are arranged in a very specific manner _ in delicate
constellations that somehow reflect the knowledge gained from being
alive. The result is a world of individuals, a place where the very
idea of a brain transplant is absurd. You are what you think, and
what you think is laid out in your own imitable neural structures.
</P>
<P>
   But just how malleable is this cellular filigree? How easily can
a person overcome the forces _ genetic and environmental _ that
shape a creature from birth? Over the last few weeks, evidence has
emerged from several laboratories that throws these questions into
a new light. And though the experimenters don't always welcome the
moral burden, their findings are destined to be incorporated into
longstanding debates over issues as practical as the importance of
early childhood education and as profound as the perfectibility of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions every society must make over how to rear and
educate its young or how to care for its neurologically disabled
are ultimately political. But the politicians look to the experts
and the experts look to the data. And what they find is a confusing
tension between the brain's need to be malleable _ or ``plastic'' _
enough for learning to occur and stable enough for the learning to
solidify into wisdom. The question is where nature has placed the
fulcrum. And what is ultimately being weighed is what it means to
be human.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, researchers at Princeton University issued a
report that threatens (or promises) to upset what has been one of
science's seeming certainties: that the adult brain cannot form new
neurons. Common wisdom holds that people are born with a fixed
allotment of these cells, which then die off one by one. While the
brain continues to form new connections, or synapses, between the
pre-existing components _ a process long believed to be the basis
of memory _ once a neuron is lost it is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by experimental evidence, the principle also seemed to
have logic on its side: If the essence of a brain is the precision
of its wiring, then generating hordes of new neurons might gum up
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier experiments had begun chipping away at the certainty
that the ban on adult neurogenesis, as it is called, is absolute,
at least in lower vertebrates or in the human brain's more
primitive regions. (Birds apparently generate neurons to encode new
songs.) But the Princeton findings went further: Dr. Elizabeth
Gould and Dr. Charles G. Gross found that thousands of new neurons
a day were being formed in the brains of monkeys, migrating to
areas including the prefrontal cortex, the seat of intelligence and
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   If a steady stream of fresh brain cells is continually arriving
to be incorporated into new circuitry, then the brain is more
malleable than hardly anyone has realized. Memories may be formed
not just by forging new synapses between old neurons but by weaving
in new ones as well.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows what these new neurons do. Stuck at the end
of the Princeton paper is an arresting speculation: that the
continuum of new neurons, arriving in one batch after another,
might be the brain's way of storing memories chronologically
forming the pages of the neurological book of life.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of adult brains cranking out a steady stream of new
parts is especially startling since it has become almost gospel
that the most important neurological action occurs in the first
three years. During this developmental window, the brain explodes
with a profusion of neural connections that is then pruned back by
experience into precise circuitry. Eyes deprived of light during
this crucial period will not stimulate the formation of the neural
pathways that allow the brain to see.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, it has been feared, the damage might be far more
subtle. Without enough stimulation _ classical music and shining
objects in the crib _ children might be permanently saddled with
inferior brains.
</P>
<P>
   Like most scientific folk wisdom (``You use only 10 percent of
your brain power,'' ``Right-brained people are more creative'') the
Mozart effect, as it is sometimes called, is extrapolated from
research whose meaning is open to debate. While there is indeed a
developmental window when the infant brain is forming, it's not
clear whether heroic efforts need to be made to encourage the
process.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Myth of the First Three Years'' (Free Press, 1999), Dr.
John T. Bruer, president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation,
which supports neuroscientific research, argues that only the most
severe deprivation causes real damage, and that even that can
sometimes be reversed. ``The brain is not `cooked' by age 3 or age
10,'' he writes. ``Our brains remain remarkably plastic and we
retain the ability to learn throughout our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Princeton results will inevitably be taken to support
this more sanguine view. But the arguments are only beginning. Last
week the Abecedarian Project, a long-term study tracking children
of African-American families in Chapel Hill, N.C., since 1972,
announced strong evidence that high-quality day care indeed
enhanced not only the ABC's and mathematical skills but one's
success in adulthood. But it's difficult to gauge how much of the
gains came directly from neural stimulation, putting the issue more
in the political than the scientific realm.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how far scientific opinion swings toward the image of
a more fluid brain, doctors will still be left with the harsh truth
that neural wounds do not heal so readily as wounds to the skin or
bones. To a small extent, brains can recover from injuries,
especially early in life. Lost functions like language can be
transferred to other undamaged regions. But a report to appear in
next month's issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience serves as a
reminder of how intransigent some trauma can be.
</P>
<P>
   A study led by Dr. Antonio Damasio at the University of Iowa
College of Medicine found that two people who suffered injuries in
infancy, when the brain is supposed to be at its most resilient,
seemingly lost the ability to tell right from wrong. Raised in good
homes, they were otherwise intelligent. But early damage to the
prefrontal cortex seemed to have disrupted some kind of morality
circuit. If new neurons have indeed been migrating to the
decision-making centers of their brains, there is apparently a
limit to the curative powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study involved only two people _ childhood injuries of
this sort are thankfully rare _ the researchers may have
accidentally stumbled across exceptions to some
yet-to-be-discovered rule. But if the trend of research keeps
pointing toward more plasticity, scientists will have to learn to
harness and enhance the process before the words ``permanent brain
damage'' come to have a less horrifying ring.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how malleable the brain turns out to be, it is still
governed by its genetic heritage. For new connections to form with
ease, the underlying machinery must be in order. And the design of
these biochemical cogs is encoded in the genes.
</P>
<P>
   But with advances in genetic engineering, even these constraints
are not necessarily permanent. Maybe the most striking of the
recent experiments was another one from Princeton in which a
scientist, Dr. Joe Z. Tsien, seemingly enhanced the memories of
mice by tinkering with their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   His lab raised mice with extra copies of a gene that carries the
instructions for making an important piece of a tiny structure
called an NMDA receptor, which acts like a memory switch. When two
neurons connected by the same synapse fire at the same time, the
receptors unleash chemical reactions that strengthen the
connection. This might be how two stimuli are linked into a memory.
</P>
<P>
   Mice with the genetically souped-up receptors performed better
on learning basic tasks _ like remembering the location of a
submerged platform _ inspiring discussions about the possibilities
of treating people with memory disorders or even enhancing normal
brains.
</P>
<P>
   And so the brain, barely at the level of understanding itself,
may be on the verge of changing its own architecture. It will be up
to us all to decide whether that is an intelligent thing to do.

WALL STREET CONNECTIONS PROPEL BRADLEY'S FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Texas, Ariz., Md., Ind., Calif., Conn.)  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the biggest surprises of this campaign year
has been former Sen. Bill Bradley's ability to be competitive with
Vice President Al Gore in the campaign cash sweepstakes. Bradley
has raised nearly $20 million this year and has more cash in the
bank than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's fund-raising prowess should come as no surprise,
despite his claim to be running as an insurgent candidate who
espouses an overhaul of campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   He was a legendary fund-raiser in the Senate _ raising $9
million a full year before his last Senate campaign, in 1990, and
outspending his opponent, Christie Whitman, now New Jersey's
governor, 15-1. He was one of the top congressional recipients of
money from corporate political action committees before forswearing
their donations this year. He was called ``king of the bundlers''
in 1990 by the Center for Responsive Politics for his ability to
gather scores of $1,000 contributions from individuals employed by
top investment banks, insurance companies, media concerns and law
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bradley's surprisingly strong challenge to Gore is backed
by numerous corporate titans, especially those from Wall Street.
But it is not only as a candidate that Bradley has benefited from
Wall Street's largess: When he left public office in 1996, he
earned $300,000 as a consultant for J.P. Morgan and reaped more
than a million dollars from paid speeches, many delivered to
audiences of financiers, bankers and health executives.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's generosity to Bradley is noteworthy for another
reason: It does not appear to be rooted in favorable legislative
treatment. While he was in the Senate, Bradley espoused proposals
that the financial world opposed, including an increase in the
capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   In his presidential quest this year, Bradley's list of top
fund-raisers includes John Thornton, co-chief operating officer at
Goldman, Sachs; Douglas Warner, chairman of J.P. Morgan; Richard
Fuld, chief executive of Lehman Brothers; John Steffens, head of
brokerage operations at Merrill Lynch; Joseph Flom, senior partner
at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, who is a
powerhouse in the world of corporate takeover battles; Sanford
Weill, co-chairman of Citigroup; Thomas Labrecque, recently retired
president of Chase Manhattan; and Louis Susman, a managing director
at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Each has enlisted dozens of bankers and traders from his firms,
as well as wealthy friends and relatives, as $1,000 contributors to
Bradley's campaign. Major Wall Street investment houses are the top
six sources of income for Bradley's campaign, accounting for nearly
$600,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the easiest fund raising I have seen in my
30-year history of raising money in politics,'' said Susman, the
unofficial national finance director for the Bradley campaign. ``We
don't have a Wall Street strategy per se, but Bill has had a
relationship with many of these people over many years and we
involved them early on to see what they could do among their
friends and associates.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of these top executives, their donations to Bradley
are not hedge contributions, in which a donor puts down money on
several candidates. None of the top bankers _ with the exception of
Susman, who also gave $1,000 to the candidacy of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., ``as a favor to a friend'' _ has so far contributed to any
other presidential candidate, according to records of the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fund-raising network extends well beyond Wall Street.
He has also used his contacts from 10 years as a player with the
New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association to recruit
top sports stars as fund-raising draws. He used a year as a
visiting lecturer at Stanford University in 1997-98 to nurture
relationships with lawyers and venture capitalists in the
technology corridor south of San Francisco; they have already
raised more than $2 million for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is the preponderance of New York banking and brokerage
firms at the top of Bradley's donor list that sets him apart from
the other leading candidates for the presidency. Only two Wall
Street firms are in Gore's and McCain's top 10 lists of
contributors; only one makes Gov. George W. Bush's list of 10
biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm to make the top 10 list for all four candidates is
Goldman, Sachs, whose partners and their families have contributed
$22,455 to McCain, $60,250 to Gore, $77,250 to Bush _ and $210,000
to Bradley. Bradley's success is even more notable because
Goldman's former chairman, Robert Rubin, was chairman of the
National Economic Council and treasury secretary in the Clinton
administration. Rubin is so far sitting out the 2000 presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's familiarity with top bankers, brokers and bond traders
grew from his 18 years of service on the Senate Finance Committee.
He was one of the primary authors of the landmark 1986 tax bill and
the architect of a plan to address the Third World debt crisis in
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bradley's opponents cannot point to anything specific
in his Senate career that would account for Wall Street's loyalty
and generosity. He proposed an increase in the capital gains tax,
advocated abolition of a variety of tax shelters and urged banks to
take substantial losses on their loans to struggling economies _
all positions that at times put him at odds with financial
executives.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for Bradley's popularity on Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   Partly it is geography: Bradley attended Princeton University in
New Jersey, represented New Jersey in the Senate and still lives in
northern New Jersey. Partly it is familiarity with the people and
the lingo of Wall Street _ J.P. Morgan hired him consultant within
weeks of his leaving the Senate in 1997. Partly it is his position
as the only Democratic alternative to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And he also helped to give New York something no other area
politician has ever delivered: two NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't any of the policies that make him popular,'' said
Mark Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association.
``Part of it is he was a Knick, and a very successful one at that.
A lot of the Street are sports fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used the two years between retiring from the Senate and
establishing his presidential committee late last year to lay the
political and financial groundwork for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work at J.P. Morgan, Bradley signed on as a
consultant with the Gartner Group, a telecommunications research
firm in Stamford, Conn. The company paid Bradley $131,000 in 1998,
according to the personal financial disclosure statement he
released this year.
</P>
<P>
   He took part-time appointments at the University of Maryland,
Notre Dame University and Stanford, earning $170,000 last year for
a handful of lectures at each school.
</P>
<P>
   He gave more than 60 speeches _ at an average of $25,000 each _
to a variety of corporations, law firms and interest groups. Among
them were Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a pharmaceutical company; Health
Care Information and Management Systems Society; the National Home
Equity Mortgage Association; the Association of Investment
Management Sales Executives; Key Bank; Barclays Global Investors;
the American Association of Health Plans, and First Union Capital
Markets.
</P>
<P>
   So last winter when he announced his intention to seek the
Democratic nomination for president, he had not only a rich list of
potential donors from three successful Senate campaigns, but a new
cache of contacts from his two years out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his proven ability to raise money and win elections,
Bradley seems to have benefited from disaffection among some
Democratic Party donors with Clinton and his chosen heir, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the initial interest in Bradley is the result of
Clinton-Gore fatigue,'' said Bonnie Reiss, a top New York
fund-raiser for Bradley and a member of his advisory board, ``a
feeling that they need to wash their hands of the whole
administration.''

COMMENTARY: WHY CAN'T A WOMAN ...  
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It could be a long time before we see a woman
president in Washington. But we'll see one in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   This is tinseltown's scenario about how it could finally happen,
as laid out in a script called ``Madame President'' being developed
by the producer David Foster:
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is ousted in a scandal. The president
appoints an old law school pal, Sen. Diana Bradley, in his place.
The president has a stroke. Diana cha-chas into the Oval Office.
Then our fabulous presidentress slaps around sexist Arab leaders
and takes revenge on a sexist, water-polluting billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would probably want to cast an Emma Thompson type, without
the accent,'' says Pierre Weidemann, Foster's director of
development. ``You wouldn't put Melanie Griffith in it. You're
looking for a powerful woman, like Meryl Streep in `The River
Wild.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Elizabeth Dole exits, everyone's wondering what sort of woman
will ever be able to crash through our stereotypes and tuck those
nuclear codes into her pony-skin Fendi Baguette.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is a man in a dress. A Margaret Thatcher type,
without the accent.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists, pointing to the paltry number of women running
states and the handful of female senators, are not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women would be much tougher in judging a woman
candidate for president than for senator or governor,'' says Bob
Teeter, a Republican pollster. ``People want to feel safe and
comfortable. They're picking the kind of person they can trust to
go sit in the Oval Office and make value judgments for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro's vice-presidential candidacy proved that
women do not vote for women just because they are women.
</P>
<P>
   One top Republican strategist bluntly asserts: ``It's been a
longtime secret among political consultants that women hate women
candidates. Women are bred to compete. It's the old thing: You get
12 guys, you've got a football team. You get 12 women, you've got a
riot.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more latitude in attitudes now. Younger women are
more willing to vote for women, and to cut checks.
</P>
<P>
   When there is the element of revenge, women do seem to respond
by gender. Women have flooded to Ashley Judd's ``Double Jeopardy,''
and they enjoy taking revenge on a no-good man in politics, too.
</P>
<P>
   After the white, male Judiciary Committee trashed Anita Hill,
women voters sent a passel of women to Congress. After Bill
betrayed Hillary, her polls shot up so dramatically she decided to
run for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Dole did not get much of a revenge ride when Bob
Dole belittled her and said he wanted to send money to John McCain.
She was just left with a disorganized campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's annoying to hear people argue that she was hurt because of
her gender. But it's even more annoying to see that George W. Bush
is helped because of his.
</P>
<P>
   A female candidate never could get away with confessing, as W.
did, that she's weak on foreign policy but knows whom to ask.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman running for president had said she would rely on the
kindness of advisers to tell her what to do in East Timor, or
stumbled on the pronunciations of several global hot spots, she
would have been immediately dismissed as a dizzy dame.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Ferraro confused the terms ``first strike'' and ``first
use'' in 1994, there was a ruckus. It evoked a picture of the
redheaded Lucy yakking into the red phone, desperately trying to
recall missiles launched because of a misplaced word. Dr.
Strangelucy.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbleheadedness and laziness didn't upend W.'s campaign for two
reasons. It is assumed (falsely) that he hung around his father's
White House long enough to pick up some knowledge, even
subliminally, on his dad's favorite topic. And W. shrugged off
foreign policy with the bravado of the cool football player who
isn't studying for his chemistry exam.
</P>
<P>
   Men can still wing it and be president. Women can't.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary wins a Senate seat, she'll immediately be cast by
liberals and feminists as ``Madame President.'' Emma Thompson,
without the accent.
</P>
<P>
   It would require a Sisyphean effort, though. A political
consultant once had an idea for a novel that might do the trick _ a
la ``Magnificent Seven'' or ``Ocean's 11.'' The most wily, grizzled
strategists come out of retirement and band together for one last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission impossible: the election of the first woman
president.
</P>

COMMENTARY: PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most important story out of Russia last week was buried in
the business pages: Russia's top stock-market watchdog quit after
declaring that Boris Yeltsin's government was simply not interested
in enforcing laws to protect shareholders in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if you picked up the paper and found that Arthur Levitt,
the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had
quit, saying that the New York stock exchange and our commercial
courts were so corrupt that you were better off going to Las Vegas,
and putting your money on red or black, than investing in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's what happened when Dmitri Vasiliev, who led
Russia's Federal Securities Commission, quit. This story gets to
the core of what is wrong with Russia today. Think of countries as
computers. Today we all have the same basic model _ the Free Market
PC. The real question is: Which countries will get the operating
system and the software to go with their Free Market computer so
that when they plug into the Electronic Herd of global investors
they can get the most out of it and cushion the worst. Operating
systems are the basic macroeconomic policies needed to succeed in
today's global economy and software is the rule of law, the courts,
regulatory agencies, a free press and democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is like a computer that plugged into the Electronic Herd
with no operating system _ not even the basic DOScapital 1.0 _ and
no software inside. If there is one thing we have learned since the
end of the Cold War it is how much more difficult it is for
developing countries to get the software and operating systems than
we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Russia even start when the head of its SEC is
quitting? I asked Bill Lewis, who heads the McKinsey consulting
firm's Global Institute and has just completed an extensive study
of the Russian economy. ``To start with,'' answered Lewis, speaking
from Moscow, ``you need a whole different group of people at the
top in Russia. Many people have pointed to the fact that Russia has
consistently held free elections as a sign that it is basically
going in the right direction. But the real question is, Do Russians
have people to vote for? Do they have politicians who understand
what Russia needs today and are ready to implement it? The answer
is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at Russia: Most of its economy has been privatized, prices
have been decontrolled and competition exists _ all the free-market
hardware is in place _ yet the economy is stalled. Why? The answer,
the McKinsey team found, lies in microeconomics. The Russian system
is so rigged and full of corrupt, arbitrary officials and rules
that an unproductive steel mill, based on outdated blast-furnace
technology, can pull strings so that the government gives it free
energy, just to keep its people employed. Meanwhile, a modern
Russian steel factory, which is both productive and could be
profitable, can't make a profit, grow its market share and drive
out unproductive firms because the market is saturated with
subsidized steel.
</P>
<P>
   In post-Communist Poland, the economy sagged and then surged as
reforms kicked in because the best companies were allowed to win.
In Russia, no such level playing field exists, so the most corrupt
companies win. ``In Russia today you don't do well by doing
better,'' said Lewis. ``You do well by seeking favors, tax
preferences and subsidies. This reduces the government's income and
increases the deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been said of America that it is a system designed by
geniuses so that it could be run by idiots. What Russians need most
from America today is not aid, and it is not advice per se, notes
Lewis. Rather, it is an understanding of what is the real source of
American prosperity _ that it's in the quality of the U.S. system,
its legal and market software that usually allows the most
productive player to win. Secret: One of the most important
competitive advantages a country can have is a lean, flexible,
honest civil service. The Russians not only don't have it; they
don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Russia needs most is their version of our Roosevelt,''
says Lewis. ``They need a shrewd, honest, savvy pol who can attract
the right technocrats around him and lead a democratic process to
put in place the social policies and limited, but enforceable,
regulations that are the necessary foundation for growth.
Unfortunately, that Russian Roosevelt doesn't exist today, and it's
not clear when he will emerge.''

<P>
   As Internet users stampeded to visit the Encyclopaedia
Britannica's sleek new Web site last week, the venerable
intellectual icon was nearly road kill on the information highway.
</P>
<P>
   Britannica.com is busily adding computers to handle the more
than 10 million people who tried to peruse its site. But the
company also faces a much bigger question: Will its vaunted
reputation for rigor be compromised by its decision to give free
access to its vast stores of knowledge?
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this decade, annual sales of the familiarly
bound volumes plummeted by roughly 80 percent as Britannica
miscalculated, refusing to produce a cheap, computer-based version
of the storied publication , from which most adults in America used
from grade school on and cribbed at least one science report.
</P>
<P>
   While Britannica was charging up to $2,000 for a 32-volume
edition of books, Microsoft was often giving away CD-Rom versions
of its Encarta encyclopedia to buyers of new computers. When
Britannica produced a CD-Rom, it was $1,000 initially versus $50
retail for Encarta. And when Britannica first joined the World Wide
Web, it did so with a subscription-only site, charging a fee for
access in a medium where nearly all information sites are free.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Britannica.com has joined the Internet mainstream with a
free site that is supported by the sale of advertising and by links
to an array of products for sale. But whether the new economics of
the Internet age will allow the Encyclopaedia Britannica to support
itself as a living document, constantly updated and renewed, is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly face an uphill battle,'' said Thomas S.
Wurster, a vice president at the Boston Consulting Group and
co-author, with Philip Evans, of ``Blown to Bits: How the New
Economics of Information Transforms Strategy'' (Harvard Business
School Press), which is expected to be published next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britannica was always thought of as a trusted adviser, known
for its rigorous quality,'' Wurster said. ``But on the Internet,
others, like Yahoo, have a better identity with core users. Because
Britannica will no longer be getting any revenues from their
content, their success will very much depend on whether they can
attract eyeballs to the site,'' and therefore be able to charge
advertisers higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the main competitors for Britannica.com are not
other encyclopedias but online services like Yahoo and America
Online is not lost on Britannica. By offering free content, it
removes any advantage gained by serviceable but generally lesser
products like Encarta, based on the old Funk &AMP; Wagnalls
encyclopedia. And Britannica.com includes not only its entire
encyclopedia but also articles from magazines like The Economist,
Esquire and Sports Illustrated, news links, stock quotes, an
Internet search service, links to Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore
and other commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to be the premier knowledge destination
site,'' said Kent Devereaux, senior vice president for product
development and editorial at Britannica.com, based in Chicago. ``We
have found that the entire definition of the encyclopedia has to
change. If that puts us into the same space as Yahoo and America
Online, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working to insure that its intellectual edge is not lost will
be, in addition to the traditional team of Britannica researchers,
a second group of content specialists. Their focus will be
preparing weekly updates on current events _ a vast improvement
over the biennial updates of the old print version _ plus taking
advantage of the Internet's audio and video capabilities. While
adding researchers, it has eliminated the door-to-door sales staff
that accounted for most of the cost of the printed version.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response to Tuesday's unveiling of
Britannica.com showed that the name Britannica retains its cachet
in this country and around the world. If Britannica.com can
continue to attract a passionate audience among the information
generation, it will serve as a stellar example of how companies
that are late adapting to new technologies can end up on top _ if
they have a superior product. But such a brainy product must still
compete in a medium based on entertainment and commerce as much as
information.
</P>
<P>
   And just think what might have been: Even if Britannica.com
eventually completes an initial public offering of stock, it will
probably never catch up to Yahoo's $46 billion market value. For
succor, Britannica.com might consult its own Web site. The
Encyclopaedia Britannica has no entry for ``business failure.'' But
type in those words on its search engine and a visitor will be
offered the chance to buy a potentially helpful book _ titled
``When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures &AMP; Breakdowns.''

advertisers higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the main competitors for Britannica.com are not
other encyclopedias but online services like Yahoo and America
Online is not lost on Britannica. By offering free content, it
removes any advantage gained by serviceable but generally lesser
products like Encarta, based on the old Funk &AMP; Wagnalls
encyclopedia. And Britannica.com includes not only its entire
encyclopedia but also articles from magazines like The Economist,
Esquire and Sports Illustrated, news links, stock quotes, an
Internet search service, links to Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookstore
and other commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to be the premier knowledge destination
site,'' said Kent Devereaux, senior vice president for product
development and editorial at Britannica.com, based in Chicago. ``We
have found that the entire definition of the encyclopedia has to
change. If that puts us into the same space as Yahoo and America
Online, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working to insure that its intellectual edge is not lost will
be, in addition to the traditional team of Britannica researchers,
a second group of content specialists. Their focus will be
preparing weekly updates on current events _ a vast improvement
over the biennial updates of the old print version _ plus taking
advantage of the Internet's audio and video capabilities. While
adding researchers, it has eliminated the door-to-door sales staff
that accounted for most of the cost of the printed version.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response to Tuesday's unveiling of
Britannica.com showed that the name Britannica retains its cachet
in this country and around the world. If Britannica.com can
continue to attract a passionate audience among the information
generation, it will serve as a stellar example of how companies
that are late adapting to new technologies can end up on top _ if
they have a superior product. But such a brainy product must still
compete in a medium based on entertainment and commerce as much as
information.
</P>
<P>
   And just think what might have been: Even if Britannica.com
eventually completes an initial public offering of stock, it will
probably never catch up to Yahoo's $46 billion market value. For
succor, Britannica.com might consult its own Web site. The
Encyclopaedia Britannica has no entry for ``business failure.'' But
type in those words on its search engine and a visitor will be
offered the chance to buy a potentially helpful book _ titled
``When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures &AMP; Breakdowns.''

ANALYSIS: POLITICS AND FOREIGN POLICY TANGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of his unusually pointed speech
challenging the Republicans as new isolationists, the national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, vowed to keep up the drumbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to slide silently into isolationism,'' Berger
told a packed room at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York
on Thursday night. ``We're going to rant and rail all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who added the aura of a campaign to his speech by
appearing afterward on a late-night television interview show, said
he was hoping to provoke a national debate on foreign policy.
Judging by the early reaction to his address, he succeeded, at
least in the short term. But the debate that Berger initiated
centered as much on politics as on policy.
</P>
<P>
   To many critics it seemed that if Berger was serious about
initiating this kind of debate, he could have started much earlier
_ for example, after President Clinton signed the global nuclear
test ban treaty in 1996, rather than after it was rejected this
month by the Senate. To these people, the campaign now seemed too
little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Berger contrasted what he referred to as the
engagement of the Clinton administration with the retreat to
isolationism of the Republicans. He castigated the opposition for
forging a ``survivalist foreign policy'' that was short on foreign
assistance and loath to live up to responsibilities abroad. And he
singled out the defeat of the test ban treaty as the moment that
distinguished those who were responsible from those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who was using the occasion at the Council on Foreign
Relations to make a comeback after harsh criticism of the White
House's management of the treaty vote, had barely stopped speaking
when the responses began.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Berger
was speaking on behalf of a ``frustrated'' administration that had
been unable to get what it wanted out of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Others wondered aloud whether Berger's intention was truly about
fundamental foreign policy issues, including reversing the decline
in money for foreign programs, or whether it was to gain a
campaign-year advantage for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants the money, but whether this is a serious tactic to
get the resources for foreign policy, I'm deeply skeptical,'' said
Morton Abramowitz, a former U.S. ambassador to Thailand and Turkey.
``The decline in resources on foreign aid can't be blamed in one
shot on Congress. The president does not know how to reverse it and
doesn't show much interest in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most startled reaction came from Republicans who see
themselves as supporters of U.S. involvement abroad but who do not
believe that opposition to the test ban treaty should be used as a
litmus test of isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does is lump everyone together,'' said Robert Kagan, a
fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a
contributing writer at the Weekly Standard, a conservative
political magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're skeptical about China, for Berger that's a
manifestation of isolationism,'' he said. ``If you worry about
Russia, that's another manifestation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan said it was a misreading to state that isolationists in
the Republican Party caused the downfall of the test ban treaty.
``Look who voted against the treaty _ Senators Chuck Hagel, John
McCain, Richard Lugar _ that's the international wing of the
Republican Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a potential for Berger to exploit the differences
between the two wings of the Republican Party on foreign policy,
several Republicans said. But instead, Kagan said, the speech ran
the danger of unifying the Republicans in a presidential election
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Berger's speech came as the White House was beginning
negotiations with the Republican leadership on the budget and after
Clinton vetoed legislation the week before last that fell $2
billion short of the White House request for foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy demands, including money pledged to Israel
and the Palestinians for going ahead with last year's peace deal
and for the United States' dues and debts at the United Nations,
emerged last week on the short list of White House priorities.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be slight movement toward winning agreement on
the U.N. financing, Republican congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief delegate to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke,
continued to press Republicans to stop an amendment that banned
U.S. financing of family planning clinics abroad from being
attached to the U.N. legislation. Clinton vetoed such legislation
last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republicans stressed that members had little to
gain in an election year by appearing in favor of spending money on
the United Nations. If Washington fails to pay part of its dues by
the end of the year, the United States will lose its seat in the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has shepherded legislation that calls
for payment of the arrears in exchange for administrative reforms
at the United Nations. But his spokesman, Marc Thiessen, pointed
out the quandary for Republicans in taking a positive position on
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hasn't made Helms a hero in conservative circles,''
Thiessen said. ``How many Republicans lose sleep if we lose our
vote in the General Assembly? A handful. But the Clinton
administration cares, and if they want it to happen, it's up to
them. They've got to be flexible to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some skepticism about whether the Clinton administration
would follow through on a foreign policy debate, Berger's speech
and his pledge to persist recalled a campaign by Henry Kissinger in
his last two years as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between liberals who complained about U.S. intervention
in Vietnam and conservatives who were concerned about detente with
the Soviet Union, Kissinger tried to invigorate the loss of
momentum in foreign policy by making a series of speeches around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   He articulated his view of the United States' role in the world
and tried to address newer issues of the period, including energy.
</P>
<P>
   If Berger decided to keep his pledge to persist with a foreign
policy debate and Clinton joined him, they could make an important
contribution, said Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the Clinton administration to keep pressing on this
point, or the idea of having a national debate won't work,'' Gelb
said.

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has sharply curtailed the
number of visas issued to Russians, particularly students and
scholars, despite Washington's avowed desire to spread Western
values in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of Russian students who sought to study in the
United States using private funds were refused visas this year,
about twice the rejection rate of previous years. Embassy officials
suggested that students from impoverished Russia _ potentially part
of the country's opinion-making elite _ will be tempted to try to
settle permanently in the affluent United States.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the reason given for refusing a visa _ that the
applicant appeared to have insufficient ties, such as children, to
Russia _ echoed the Soviet practice of allowing citizens to travel
abroad only if their loved ones stayed behind to insure the
relative's return.
</P>
<P>
   The tightened visa policy followed the August 1998 economic
collapse in Russia and is part of a broader and increasingly
rancorous debate over the procedures for inviting foreign students
to the United States. Applicants from nations like South Korea and
Thailand, which have also undergone economic crises, have reported
increasing problems too in obtaining visas.
</P>
<P>
   But the visa policy has especially important implications for
Russia, where the United States has has been struggling to
encourage democracy and influence public opinion. The Clinton
administration has defended its policy of engaging Russia and
treating the country as a partner, and recently announced a
vigorous campaign against what it calls the ``new isolationists''
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, U.S. Embassy officials deny that they have been
overly strict. Laura Clerici, the consul general, asserted that
consular officials needed to be particularly vigilant after the
1998 collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Russians think that bureaucracy is something to be gotten
around,'' she said in an interview. ``They give us all sorts of
paper that is false.''
</P>
<P>
   But American educators and former diplomats say that the embassy
has overreacted and that many worthy candidates have been cast
aside.
</P>
<P>
   They note that the embassy's statistics do not show Russians
hurrying to flee abroad after the ruble collapsed. Overall, visa
applications have not increased since August 1998 _ although the
number of rejections have _ and student applications have actually
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visa policy is at cross-purposes with U.S. foreign
policy,'' said Greg Guroff, the former director of a U.S.
government office that encourages educational and cultural
exchanges. ``The American policy had been to expand contacts. Now
the consular policy appears to be to turn down young people,
particularly on private education exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   The visa policy has been a shock to many young Russians. Despite
a general upsurge in anti-American sentiment _ most evident in the
street protests outside the U.S. Embassy during the Kosovo conflict
_ educated Russians, particularly the young, are still attracted to
the United States. They find it hard to understand why they have
suddenly become undesirables.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a number of ways to attract Russian
students. There are government-financed exchange programs that can
last for a few weeks or for years. In 1998, 6,000 visas were
granted to Russians under such programs. But Russians also attend
American universities and colleges using F-type visas, where the
education is paid for by the student or other private sources or is
supported by a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 83 percent of all F-type visas applied for during the
prime student application months of June through August were
granted. This year, the acceptance rate for that period slipped to
62 percent.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ruslan Shevdov, 27, is a case in point. He had appeared to catch
a lucky break when the small Moscow-based trading and agricultural
company he joined after leaving the food service division of the
Russian army offered to send him to the United States at its
expense to earn a degree in business administration and to perfect
his English.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted by Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., Shevdov had
hoped to begin his studies this fall. But his request for an F visa
was rejected three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I didn't fit the student profile,'' Shevdov said.
``Maybe they think I am too old. I tried to assure them that I plan
to return. My parents live here. This is the country where I grew
up. I can call my friend here at any time and he will come. How
would I live there?''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials said they would not discuss individual cases.
The six-member team that handles nonimmigrant visas at the Moscow
consulate makes hundreds of decisions like this, often on the basis
of a five- or 10-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looking for fraudulent applications, they try to divine
if a student or scholar has an unbreakable tie to the homeland that
will spur return. Interviews often amount to hurried discussions of
an applicant's marriage status, family life and assets, often
conducted by a junior Foreign Service officer.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of proof that a Russian has no plans to emigrate,
even legally, falls on the applicants. They may find it hard to
argue that what appear to an American to be meager rewards are
sufficient for a decent living in Russia. Shevdov, for instance,
earns about $900 a month, low by American standards, but a
respectable sum for a Muscovite.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have also had problems. Taras Ivchenko, a 34-year-old
assistant professor at Moscow University, is a specialist in
Chinese linguistics who graduated from Beijing University and wrote
his doctorate in Chinese. Encouraged by several American
professors, he wanted to visit the United States for several weeks
last summer to help translate a Ming dynasty manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 10-minute interview in May, Ivchenko was unable to
persuade the U.S. Embassy to grant him a tourist visa. He earns
$150 a month and has no substantial property. His wife, father and
sister live here, but that apparently was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ivchenko said the consular officer who interviewed him suggested
his chances for a visa would be better if he had children he could
leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of Soviet times,'' the soft-spoken Ivchenko
said in an interview. ``I would like to work on a project or two in
the United States, but I am not interested in emigrating there. I
belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   American academics report increasing problems in obtaining visas
for Russian students or faculty members. The University of
Pittsburgh had to campaign for one of its Russian graduate students
to complete a doctorate program after he returned home for the
funeral of his father.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Southern California fought hard to overturn
the denial of a visa for a promising student it had recruited for
its graduate program in Russian literature. The student was told
there was no point in studying in the United States since there was
plenty of Russian literature at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the universities do not always win. The University of
Maryland was recently left without a Russian instructor when the
candidate it picked was denied a visa.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Lekic, director of the university's graduate program in
Russian language, said the faculty had gone through a careful
selection process and had never experienced a problem with Russians
refusing to return home when their visas ran out.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Embassy concluded that the university salary the
Russian instructor was being offered was too appealing compared
with his modest pay at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the Soviets would not let people leave,'' she said.
``Now when Russia is opening up, we are behaving like Soviets.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials insist that they need to be vigilant
because there has been talk in Moscow of many Russians ``jumping
ship,'' and the black market price of forged visas has risen.
</P>
<P>
   But student applications for F visas between June and August
declined to 1,645 this year, compared with 2,181 in 1998. Embassy
officials also concede that there has never been a comprehensive
study to determine whether Russian students eventually return, or
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   The tough U.S. visa policies are driving Russian students to
other countries. ``We are really shooting ourselves in the foot,''
said Dennis Whelan, a Moscow-based lawyer who advises visa
applicants. ``We are simply ensuring that all the upper and middle
managers in Russia get their training in Europe so that they make
their primary business contacts with our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half a million tuition-paying foreign students were
enrolled in American institutions in the 1997-98 academic year.
They bring in money, as countries like Britain increasingly
recognize, loosening up visa regulations to attract foreign
students.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, Britain won in the case of Maria Ushakova, 17, the
daughter of a leading Russian businessman. Ms. Ushakova wants to
become a psychoanalyst and take over her mother's practice, but her
request for a visa to attend college in Pennsylvania was repeatedly
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, her family says, she was told there was no point
in studying in the United States since Russia did not have a
tradition of psychoanalysis and a foreign-trained specialist would
never find employment at home. Her father then obtained a letter
from a Russian clinic saying it would gladly hire his daughter once
she finished her training.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ushakova received a visa on her fourth try. By then,
however, she had missed the start of the school year in the United
States. Offended, her father said, by all the refusals and worried
that she might not be able to renew her visa to finish her
education in the United States, she is now studying in London.

   BRAIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ What makes the brain unique among
bodily organs is that its cells are arranged in a very specific
manner _ in delicate constellations that somehow reflect the
knowledge gained from being alive. The result is a world of
individuals, a place where the very idea of a brain transplant is
absurd. You are what you think, and what you think is laid out in
your own imitable neural structures. But just how malleable is this
cellular filigree? By George Johnson.

   JAPAN-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ In the last decade, even as its economy
has gone from bad to worse, Japan has evolved, beyond the West's
field of view. Change has come so far now that even if Japan wanted

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ News highlights of the week.

<P>
   WAR-HEROES-REVIEW (Washington) _ American voters have long known
Vice President Al Gore as the son of a distinguished politician, as
an avowed environmentalist with a best-selling book on the topic
and as President Clinton's loyal liege. But recently, Gore has been
reminding the electorate of another, less commonly cited dimension
of his history and identity: his military service in Vietnam. But
does anyone care about war heroes anymore? By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-RISK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Travelers do it in the wake of
a terrorist attack when they decide to drive to Florida for
vacation rather than get on a plane. Diners do it when they forego
a sandwich at lunch and then load up on iced tea and fat-free
cookies in the mid-afternoon. And Bobby Valentine, the manager of
New York Mets, did it during the sixth game of the National League
Championship Series, perhaps costing his team a chance to advance
to the World Series. Call it the misunderstanding of cumulative
risk. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ENCYCLOPEDIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Internet users stampeded to
visit the Encyclopaedia Britannica's sleek new Web site last week,
the venerable intellectual icon was nearly road kill on the
information highway. Britannica.com is busily adding computers to
handle the more than 10 million people who tried to peruse its
site. But the company also faces a much bigger question: Will its
vaunted reputation for rigor be compromised by its decision to give
free access to its vast stores of knowledge? By Edward Wyatt.

<P>
   INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ This month marks the 30th
anniversary of the Arpanet, the Internet's predecessor. Then again,
maybe it doesn't. As barbs fly and longstanding friendships
disintegrate, figuring out just who did what when is more difficult
than ever. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBS-IPO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The news from Wall Street last
week drew attention to probably the most startling contrast
imaginable in American popular culture: Martha Stewart and the
World Wrestling Federation, both going public on the same day.
Investors were clearly more enamored with the mistress of
domesticity than with the minders of Stone Cold Steve Austin and

   CHILE-IDENTITY-REVIEW (Santiago) _ Chileans like to call
themselves the English of Latin America, referring to their
reserved social etiquette and taste for afternoon tea, proper
high-cut clothes and Tudor architecture. Probing even deeper into
the national psyche, Chilean intellectuals identify national traits
that hark back to another English century entirely. By Clifford
Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-RELIGION-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ It doesn't take a
theologian to describe the political role of Islam here. ``We are
Muslims, but when we vote, we put Islam to one side,'' said Hasan
Bisri, a 60-year-old fisherman, as he waited to cast his ballot.
``In Indonesia we put the nation first and our religion second.''
This may sound odd to many Americans, who for 20 years have looked
at Iran as the model for Islamic rule and are therefore wary of the
prospect of Islamic clerics taking power anywhere. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE-REVIEW (Freetown) _ The camp for amputees lies on a
hill in the most scenic stretch of Freetown, a favorite spot for
British vacationers before war destroyed Sierra Leone. Most of the
amputees in this camp _ there were 516 when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright paid a visit Monday _ were mutilated by rebels
who advanced on Freetown last January. Many were taken to the
city's main public hospital where they languished for days; then
many went to a refugee camp at the national stadium where they
languished for weeks. Eventually they arrived at this camp, which
is run by Doctors Without Borders. By Norimitsu Onishi.

<P>
   Hungary has asked Yugoslavia for permission to send floating
cranes down river to lift the debris and open passages before
winter sets in. Governments from the 11 Danube countries also want
the river cleared because the obstructions are costing them huge
amounts of money in lost shipping revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian answer so far has been no, according to officials at
the Hungarian Ministry of Transport.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government has said it does not have the money to
clear the debris, and it cannot get help from Western countries
that have imposed an embargo on economic aid to Yugoslavia,
including on funds for the Danube cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs said first they will do no cleaning unless they get
help to rebuild,'' said Zoltan Illes, chairman of the Hungarian
Parliament's environment committee. ``Now they say they will not
cooperate with the ice issue. This is certainly a kind of
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats here said that American and European
government officials have taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the need to clear the river may lead at least
some European countries to break the economic embargo against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the makings of a crisis, of a public relations crisis
and a genuine disaster, which could be laid at our doorstep,'' a
diplomat of a NATO country said.
</P>
<P>
   Heads of government of Central European countries meeting in
Budapest on Wednesday called for urgent measures to clear the
river.
</P>
<P>
   The three bridges that cause greatest concern are in Novi Sad.
Their twisted iron frames and huge fallen concrete blocks have
choked off trade on the 1,800-mile river, which crosses from
southern Germany through the Balkans to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been pressures from all sides to reopen the
river,'' said Miroslav Spasojevic, an official of the Yugoslav
Ministry for Development and Environment who attended the
conference. ``But we will not just open passage without getting
help to rebuild the bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   While lost revenues had been the main complaint, Hungary also
says the threat that ice will form ``corks'' and cause floods has
given new urgency to the need to remove the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Although the river rarely freezes over, large sheets form every
few years between December and February.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has bought a fleet of icebreakers that patrol its own
stretch of the Danube and portions in Croatia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Gyorgy Droppa, a river engineer and chairman of the
environmental group Danube Circle, said that if the Danube waters
back up at Novi Sad, the areas most at risk are the low-lying
portions of Serbia and Croatia and parts of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Yugoslavia allows floating cranes into Novi Sad, the
equipment could not get to work immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials said that the Belgrade government has told
them there are still unexploded missiles and other ordinance in the
Danube. ``Before any operations can start, the weapons must be
located and removed from the water or exploded,'' said an official
at the Hungarian Transport Minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hungary is a member of NATO, the official said that the
government did not have such crucial information about the
whereabouts of the munitions and hopes that it will get this from
the United States and other NATO countries involved in the bombing
at Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists attending the conference on the environment and the
Danube said that once the work on the bridges starts, they could be
lifted in three weeks.

WITH IRAN'S REFORMS AT STAKE, A MODERATE DIGS IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Eight months after winning more votes than any
other candidate in Tehran's municipal elections, Abdullah Nouri, a
key figure in Iran's Islamic reform movement, has been spending
much of his time in recent days closeted with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they have been working on strategies for a trial next
week at which they will attempt to save the newspaper Nouri
controls from court-ordered closure and Nouri from what could be a
lengthy prison term. Beyond that, they hope, by winning Nouri's
acquittal, to protect the reform movement from a setback that could
undermine its prospects of winning crucial parliamentary elections
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is a confidant of President Mohammad Khatami, probably
Khatami's most important ally. Both men are Muslim clerics with
political pedigrees that go back to the Islamic revolution of 1979,
when they were trusted lieutenants of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the cleric who led the upheaval that ousted the Shah. Now, they
lead the May 23 Movement, a coalition that aims at bringing
democracy and tolerance to the harsh system of Islamic rule they
helped build.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, 50, and Khatami, 53, are considered apostates by extreme
Islamic conservatives, some of whom have threatened publicly to
kill those they consider ``enemies of Islam.'' Khatami goes nowhere
without an elaborate security entourage, but Nouri, after being
ousted from Khatami's Cabinet by conservatives last year, must
provide for his own safety. Since he was indicted earlier this
month by the Special Court for the Clergy, a powerful,
conservative-controlled body that meets in closed session to
consider cases involving clerics, he has gone nowhere without
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of bowing before conservative attempts to silence
him, he has gone on the offensive, saying things that seem unlikely
to help him when his trial begins Wednesday. At a meeting with
students at the University of Science and Technology in Tehran last
week, he described his indictment as illegal and politically
motivated. Then, using an analogy that seemed certain to enrage his
critics, he compared their tactics unfavorably with those of the
shah, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, who fled Iran in 1979 and died in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as one speaks of freedom, these gentlemen raise the
issue of depravity,'' he said, referring to the conservatives. ``If
freedom is the propagation of depravity, then there was much more
freedom under the Shah.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Nouri will face the most serious charges leveled
against any Muslim cleric since the Islamic takeover. He has been
accused of using Khordad, his newspaper, to insult the Muslim
prophet, Mohammed, and his direct descendants, the imams who are
Shiite Muslims' principal saints. He is accused as well of
insulting Ayatollah Khomeini, of backing banned political parties
that want a secular Iran, and of ``propagating'' in support of Iran
seeking friendly ties with its two main adversaries, the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, Nouri faces certain imprisonment, and the
closure of Khordad, a pro-reform newspaper that has so far survived
a crackdown in which four pro-reform newspapers have been closed by
the conservative-controlled press court in the last 12 months. But
Nouri's associates say the real purpose is broader. By punishing
Nouri, they say, conservatives aim to halt growing defections among
the clergy to the reformers, thereby consolidating the clerical
hierarchy that inherited the shah's authoritarian powers.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict, or even a decision by the court not to reach a
verdict, would bar Nouri from political life, and thus prevent him
from organizing the reformers' campaign and from being a candidate
in the parliamentary elections that are scheduled for Feb. 18. With
Nouri excluded, reformers would lose their biggest vote-getter, and
the man most likely, after a reform victory, to take the powerful
post of parliamentary speaker from Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the
conservative who lost the 1997 presidential election to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranians believe that reformers are poised to repeat their
two previous election successes _ the 1997 presidential ballot,
which Khatami won with 69 percent of the vote, and elections in
February of this year for 200,000 seats on village, town and city
councils, which reformers swept by a similar margin in the popular
vote. But conservatives, responding with increased efforts to
weaken, discredit and frighten reformers, have made no secret of
their determination to use all means available to avoid losing
control of the 270-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Khatami and his associates have long been beleaguered. Last
year, a popular Tehran mayor with close links to the president,
Gholam Hossein Karbaschi, was sentenced to five years in jail and a
lifetime ban from politics at a corruption trial that many Iranians
saw as a political vendetta. In June 1998, Nouri, then the interior
minister, was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote. In May
this year, the culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani, another
cleric, narrowly survived impeachment by parliamentary
conservatives angry at his failure to control pro-reform
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mohsen Kadivar, another dissident cleric, was
imprisoned on the clergy court's orders on charges of ``defaming
Islam,'' in part by writing a newspaper article in which he
compared the authoritarian society favored by the conservatives
with the rule of the shah.
</P>
<P>
   In July, police and vigilante gangs attacked University of
Tehran students protesting the closing of a pro-reform newspaper,
killing at least one and possibly three students, injuring scores
of others and ransacking a university dormitory. Dozens of
students, possibly hundreds, remain under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But for reformers, perhaps the most threatening conservative
move ahead of the parliamentary vote has been the threat to use
another powerful body, the Council of Guardians, to use a religious
test to disqualify large numbers of reform candidates. The council,
which has made sweeping use of the power in past elections,
recently vetoed a new law that would have curbed its power by
requiring it to give written reasons for rejecting candidates,
heightening reformers' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The battle over who can run in the parliamentary elections is
not likely to be settled before January, when nominations close.
Much may depend on the attitude of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
country's supreme religious leader, who has sweeping executive
powers that far exceed Khatami's. Earlier this month, Khamenei,
hitherto considered the conservatives' main standard-bearer,
stunned the country by calling Khatami a ``pious man'' and urging
conservatives not to block his efforts for ``the rebirth of
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranians were left to wonder whether Khamenei had had a change
of heart, or made the speech to allay reformers' concerns while
conservatives work through bodies like the clergy court, the press
court and the Guardians' Council to consolidate their power. The
indictment of Nouri, less than two weeks after Khamenei's speech,
has done little to encourage optimism that the religious leader was
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Mohajerani, the culture minister, has said he feared the worst
from the Nouri trial. ``I'm not optimistic,'' he said. Khatami
seemed to voice his own dismay when he spoke recently to a youth
gathering in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a world free of ``discrimination, despotism and
lies,'' he said there would always be people, in every society, who
would oppose change. ``Unfortunately, there are people who will
always want to protect their own power and wealth and privilege by
erecting barriers against others,'' he said.

<P>
   At butler boot camp, Lisa Meyers, who wants to work for a very
rich family in a Fifth Avenue apartment with a view of Central
Park, was singled out from her classmates and scolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a little too slick for this profession, missy,'' said
Mary Louise Starkey, founder of the Starkey International Institute
for Household Management, a school in Denver that markets itself as
the Harvard of high-end household help. ``The lady of the house
will get rid of you in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A discerning household manager, which is the Starkey Institute's
gender-neutral term for butler, would never, ever look more
fetching than the lady of the house, especially if that lady is one
of those young ``trophy'' wives, who tend toward insecurity and
prickliness, Mrs. Starkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers, a fit and attractive woman of 35, nodded
compliantly. She conceded that she may have to retool her
appearance to land the $60,000-to-$120,000-a-year salaries that
household managers command in Manhattan. Having left her career as
a chiropractor, Ms. Meyers is paying about $7,200 for an eight-week
course in the elegant care and feeding of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   These are lucrative and stressful times in the annals of
household help in the United States. Never before have there been
so many wealthy Americans with so many big houses that need
tending. Yet many of these new rich need as much schooling in the
art of living large as the students in butler school, according to
Mrs. Starkey and many others in the service trade.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American households worth $10 million or more has
quadrupled in the last decade, jumping to 275,000 from 65,000, said
Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University and
an expert on wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of people who can afford a butler has
no precedent in the country's history, except perhaps in the boom
years of the 1920s, Wolff said. He estimated that up to a fifth of
those worth at least $10 million _ about 55,000 households _ are in
the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   There has likewise been an unparalleled swelling in the size of
the American house. When the Census Bureau began measuring in 1984,
only 7 percent of new houses were larger than 3,000 square feet
(often considered the size threshold for household help). By the
second quarter of this year, 17 percent of new houses were at least
that big, and many were much, much bigger, according to the
National Association of Home Builders. Its surveys show that the
largest and most expensive of these houses are concentrated in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers scream for good help.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starkey's 10-year-old school, based in a Georgian mansion
near the Colorado Capitol dome, now graduates about 60 certified
household managers a year. She plans to expand next year with a
second training mansion in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had more students and more applicants, because I
could place them all,'' said Carol Scudere, who owns Professional
Domestics in Columbus, Ohio, and is the director of training at the
four-year-old school, which competes with Mrs. Starkey's.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Washington and Los Angeles, placement agencies that
specialize in servants for the rich say that the demand for
experienced household managers exceeds the supply.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many household managers are working in the United
States is not known. Until Mrs. Starkey's school opened in Denver,
most had either been trained in the great homes of the very rich or
had emigrated from England, where there are training schools and a
long tradition of butlers learning their craft as underbutlers.
After a long postwar slump for butlers in Europe (when the number
of butlers in England shrank to the hundreds from more than
18,000), demand there appears to be rising. The International Guild
of Professional Butlers plans to open a school in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to deal with vendors, they don't want to
cook, they don't want to hear about bickering and jealousy among
the staff,'' said Keith Greenhouse, president of the Pavilion
Agency in Manhattan. ``They want the butler to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a persistent and sometimes destabilizing
undertow in this flood of big money, big houses and big demand for
Grade-A help.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans new to wealth _ and three out of four households
worth more than $10 million were minted in the past decade _ say
they are uncertain about how to manage their servants, how to pay
them, and even how to talk to them. Their parents, in many cases,
were not rich. They did not grow up with servants in the house.
They sometimes are too chummy with the servants or too demanding,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs among the multimillionaires and downstairs among their
better-trained servants, there can be grumbling, miscommunication
and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned not to include servants in family functions,''
said Mary Campbell, who grew up in a two-bedroom house and now
lives in two large homes, in Boston and the Berkshires. Her husband
is Lewis Campbell, chief executive of Textron Inc., which makes
Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been burned through the years,'' added Mrs. Campbell,
who three months ago hired a household manager trained at the
Starkey Institute. ``People took advantage of our niceness. They
took advantage of friendship. They lied about their hours. They
told other people about our business.''
</P>
<P>
   An experienced Manhattan butler says that working for the newly
rich is almost always annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nouveau riches tell you the price of things,'' the butler said
with a sniff. ``I have worked for people who brag in front of their
kids about how much their statuary art costs; then their kids brag
to their friends. Americans also don't know how to draw the line
about being too familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   The butler, who was born in England, complained that many
wealthy Americans do not even know basic table manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know how to use silverware. People leave their
knives and forks on table at all different angles instead of
putting them together to show they are finished.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To iron out wrinkles in wealthy households, Mrs. Starkey
preaches professional management and personal boundaries. Her
students are taught to trim their nose hairs, wax their eyebrows,
use a yardstick to space plates at the dinner table and always call
their employers by their surnames and use the proper courtesy
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starkey also drills her clients. During home inspections,
she advises prospective employers to tell their household managers
many details about their personal lives, from how they like their
coffee in the morning, to favorite television shows, to which child
is related to which ex-spouse. Mrs. Starkey repeatedly alerts
clients to the insidious dangers of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have chosen the profession of service,'' Mrs. Starkey told
Ms. Meyers and seven other aspiring household managers at the
Starkey Institute. ``You are about to be propelled into a world
many of us never see, a world of plenty, of power and of
indulgence. Remember, you are going to be paid as a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning course in ``boundaries'' at the Starkey Institute
raised these sticky questions: What if the lady of the house asks
the household manager for help in adhering to a strict low-fat
diet? And what if the household manager, while working in her
employer's bedroom, finds an empty container of double-chocolate
ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it in the trash and keep it to yourself,'' said Jenny
Hookey, a former household manager for Michigan Gov. John Engler
and an instructor at the school. ``You are not supposed to be your
employer's conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hookey rose from her chair in a basement classroom of the
mansion-cum-school and wrote these initials on the blackboard:
YBYJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet your job if you cross a boundary,'' Mrs. Hookey said,
explaining what is perhaps the most dismal fact of life in the
service trade. Servants have almost no job security. If an employer
does not like your look, your attitude or your work, you are out,
no matter how well trained or highly paid you may be.
</P>
<P>
   In a class on ``personal style,'' taught by Mrs. Starkey,
students were asked to describe the character of the wealthy people
for whom they hope to work. The class volunteered these words:
selfish, intelligent, aggressive, rushed, motivated, stuck-up,
philanthropic and judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   Why would you want to work for people like that? Mrs. Starkey
asked her class.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, gleaned from separate interviews with all eight
students in the class, seems to be as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Those who aspire to the butler trade are middle-aged people in
post-marriage, post-child-bearing phases of their lives. Ms. Meyers
was the exception, and she has been advised to compensate for her
relative youth. A beautician who consults for the Starkey Institute
told her: Trim the blond, highlighted hair. Lose the showy
earrings. Lay off the dark red lip-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students said they enjoyed taking care of expensive
things. Many have worked for restaurants or in catering, luxury
sales or property management. They are intrigued by the idea of
working for a very rich family with many houses and jetting around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   One student, Chief Petty Officer Samuel Sutton, 39, has worked
for several generals and admirals in Washington as a chef and a
senior household manager, and he was hoping to go to work soon in
the White House. He said he went to the Starkey Institute to polish
his skills and prepare for 2003, when he will leave the Navy and
look for a household manager job that will double his military pay
of about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical student was Ingrid Lawrence, 56, who is divorced
with no children. In ``personal image awareness'' class, Ms.
Lawrence, a tall German-born woman with ramrod posture and an
expensive but understated wardrobe, was judged to have a near
perfect look for service: tasteful, elegant and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of fussy,'' said Ms. Lawrence, who recently quit her
job at Neiman Marcus in San Diego, where she sold china, crystal
and silver. ``I love housework. I love to be surrounded by
beautiful things. It will give me pleasure to take care of these
beautiful things in a private house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lawrence explained that in her own house in San Diego, she
used only fresh linen napkins, never paper. She kept her linen damp
in plastic bags in her refrigerator, she said, so that she could
iron it as needed, obtaining the crispest and most wrinkle-free
napkins possible.
</P>
<P>
   In ironing class at the Starkey Institute, when a teacher
mentioned the linen-in-the-refrigerator trick, Ms. Lawrence smiled
knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a grueling 12-hour day at the Starkey mansion, all
the students gathered in the basement over dinner to watch ``The
Remains of the Day,'' the 1993 film in which Anthony Hopkins plays
an emotionally remote English butler.
</P>
<P>
   The butler, Stevens, resolutely refuses throughout the film to
judge the character of his employer, Lord Darlington, even as he
makes a national fool of himself by appeasing the Nazis in the days
before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the film, the butler is asked how he could
endure working for such a despicable man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his butler,'' Stevens replies. ``I was there to serve
him, not to agree or disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the students laughed during parts of the film,
especially when servants ironed The Times of London, it struck most
of them as profoundly sad.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in class, however, Mrs. Starkey said that Stevens
had had it exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start judging your employers,'' she said, ``your days
are numbered.''

NOW FOR THE HARD PART: RECONSTRUCTING INDONESIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Having anointed its new leaders this week,
Indonesia now finds itself facing the even more daunting task of
redefining and reconstructing a nation whose institutions,
politics, economy and sense of purpose had been bankrupted by the
long rule of former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the national assembly elected a new president,
Abdurrahman Wahid, ending the 17-month transitional leadership of
B.J. Habibie, who took the first steps to liberate political
discourse, freeing the press and setting in motion a freewheeling
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   But in his public stature, Habibie never managed to break free
of his close association with his mentor, Suharto, and his tenure
was fixated on political succession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the real transition has taken place to an elected successor
and the post-Suharto era can truly begin.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, an Islamic leader, is one of the few major figures who
gained prominence independent of either his connection with or
opposition to Suharto. He brings the opportunity for Indonesia to
start to look forward rather than back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a newborn baby,'' said a prominent economist, Emil
Salim, at a recent conference. ``Giving birth involved some pain
and some blood but now a new Indonesia is born.''
</P>
<P>
   But as with other emerging democracies, the agenda now is almost
entirely defined by the need to overcome the legacy of repression
and military rule, of corruption and of the devaluation of
government institutions during Suharto's 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto is gone but his evil genius is still all around,
wherever you look,'' said James C. Clad, an expert on Southeast
Asia at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Suharto's repression of political discourse
heightened a tendency toward eruptions of violence around the many
islands of this huge nation of more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the election, in a reminder that none of the old
problems have gone away and that new ones continue to emerge,
nearly 10,000 people demonstrated on the eastern island of Sulawesi
demanding independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Already the separation of East Timor as an independent nation
has sharpened separatist demands in the provinces of Irian Jaya and
Aceh, posing urgent problems of national stability for the new
President.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to lead to a perception that balkanization is
beginning to take root in Indonesia, and that is going to scare
away investors,'' said James Van Zorge, who heads an economic
consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Wahid's task of reconstruction is comparable to that
of the leaders of East Timor, which was granted its independence
this week by Indonesia but only after vengeful anti-independence
militias had virtually leveled its towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing they've got to do is to rebuild their
institutions,'' said Daniel S. Lev, a professor of political
science at the University of Washington. In bending the nation to
his will, he said, Suharto perverted its basic institutions to
serve his own interests, rendering them corrupt and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to rebuild the bureaucracy, the courts, the
police,'' Lev said. ``They've got to do something about the
regional bureaucracies and deal with issues of decentralization.
They've got to figure out how to begin attracting foreign money
again; people have to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic reforms will involve extremely difficult steps in
reforming the banking sector and reducing a huge burden of private
foreign debt as well as carrying out structural changes required by
international lenders.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger and much longer-term sense, they will require
cultural changes _ an end to crony capitalism that closes off
competition and drives away foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here see Wahid as a democrat at heart. But
whatever his personal leanings, Indonesia has demonstrated over the
last 17 months a popular momentum for openness and democratization
that is likely to continue to influence government policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic,'' said Eric
Bjornlund, who represents the National Democratic Institute in
Jakarta. ``This is a different country than it was a year and a
half ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjornlund's agenda for Wahid is similar to that of many other
outside observers.
</P>
<P>
   It includes constitutional reform to build in checks and
balances; a reform of the electoral system, primarily to institute
direct presidential elections; a reduction in the overpowering
political role of the military; the creation of an independent
court system along with investigations of past abuses; the
strengthening of national and provincial legislatures; the
providing of greater autonomy to the provinces, and, more broadly,
the fostering of a more open and democratic civic culture.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's first step as president was to select as his vice
president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, forming an alliance with
Indonesia's most popular politician and the standard bearer for
opposition to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, 59, is frail and nearly blind and many people here say
that his vice president could well succeed him before his five-year
term is up.
</P>
<P>
   His second and most important step will be to select his
Cabinet, which will help define the character of his government and
which is likely to play a particularly strong role because of
Wahid's frailty.
</P>
<P>
   He has already made it clear that national reconciliation is his
priority and there is an expectation that he will choose a
wide-ranging group that represents a variety of interests. In the
short run, this could insure social peace after two years of
turmoil. In the long run, several analysts say, it could lead to
infighting and paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wahid's desire for reconciliation could cause him
not to pursue vigorous investigations into the corruption of the
Suharto years and the human rights abuses committed by the military
both in East Timor and elsewhere. That would slow Indonesia's
progress toward an embrace of economic transparency and human
rights and would also be likely to reignite some of the anger that
brought down both his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from the Suharto era also offers a new
opportunity to peer into what Sidney Jones, the Asia director for
Human Rights Watch, called ``the dark shadows of Indonesia's
past.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is truly to liberate itself and move forward, Ms. Jones
said, Indonesia must examine and shed light on a long list of
abuses and mysteries that had been buried as long as Suharto or his
friend, Habibie, remained in office.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these are the massacres of 1965 and 1967 that
accompanied Suharto's rise to power, in which hundreds of thousands
of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But in an indication of the difficulty of making a clean break
with the past, Ms. Jones pointed out that such an investigation
could implicate a youth group closely affiliated with Wahid.

SOUR ON STATUS QUO, ARGENTINES VOTE FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Crime and unemployment are up, wages
are down, and polls indicate that a growing number of Argentines
think their politicians are stealing fortunes. Voters want change
after 10 years of Peronist rule, and every recent poll suggests
they will get it, by choosing the decidedly downbeat mayor of
Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, as president in the elections on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As in every Argentine political campaign, the candidates have
led the obligatory gaucho processions through the pampas and danced
in the streets of Buenos Aires with tango stars. But unlike so many
campaigns of the last century, there has been virtually no
violence, no charges of fraud, no capital flight and no
interference from the military.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the deepest recession of the decade, the political
oratory has been mostly muted and moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after military rule ended, the sobriety of the
campaign suggests that civilian democracy has been completely
consolidated in Argentina and a centrist consensus has emerged in
economic and foreign policy. If de la Rua does win, he will end a
decade of rule by the Peronists, who have never left power
peacefully before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics have become routine in Argentina,'' said Rosendo
Fraga, a leading pollster. And that is saying a lot in a country
that less than a generation ago was a cauldron of infighting
between Peronist labor leaders, right-wing military officers and
radical students marching beneath the slogans of Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   But neither de la Rua nor his main rival, the Buenos Aires
governor, Eduardo Duhalde, appears to have inspired much interest
among the voters. Attendance at political rallies has been smaller
than in other election years, and polls indicate that there is
increasing cynicism about politicians and their ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has been downright boring,'' said Roberto
Bacman, another Argentine pollster, who drew a sharp distinction
between the current campaign and ``the last three elections in
which strong slogans defined the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants change,'' he added, ``but moderate change, with
more transparency and honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what de la Rua, who represents the center-left
Alianza coalition, has said he will offer. He has pledged to sell
the presidential jet, Tango 01, as a sign of austerity, prosecute
tax evaders and dishonest politicians, and impose federal control
over corrupt local police forces.
</P>
<P>
   He has also promised to cut a growing government budget deficit
while keeping the peso pegged one-to-one to the dollar, the
cornerstone of President Carlos Saul Menem's economic policy over
the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a moral force that will confront frivolity and
trickery,'' de la Rua promised at a rally in the city of Rosario on
Tuesday, repeating his sweeping critique of the current government
as a stronghold of fraud and privilege. ``We are going to end this
party for the few.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to shrug off polls showing him 15 points behind, Duhalde
of the governing Justicialist Party has pledged to slash the
value-added tax from 21 percent to 15 percent, reject demands by
the International Monetary Fund to cut public spending by nearly $2
billion, and grant unemployed housewives a minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duhalde has had trouble finding a coherent campaign
message, and for months has feuded with Menem over leadership of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicated that de la Rua and Duhalde were in a close race
until three months ago. Then, trying to energize the traditional
labor base of the Justicialist Party, which was founded by Juan
Domingo Peron, Duhalde lunged toward traditional Peronist populism.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about Argentina's mounting foreign debt, he
suggested a worldwide one-year suspension of debt-servicing by
Third World countries. It was a line that used to win applause in
the 1980s. This year, the response was an 8 percent fall in the
Argentine stock market, which forced Duhalde to beat a hasty
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   With Duhalde looking reckless and capricious, his poll ratings
plunged in early July and he never recovered. He was further hurt
last month when his provincial police force botched a hostage
rescue, needlessly killing two hostages in an uncontrolled spree of
gunfire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde sought to revive his campaign at a mass rally in the
Plaza de Mayo last Sunday by playing the populist card again. He
implicitly lashed out at the International Monetary Fund, which is
currently pressing Argentina for budget cuts in exchange for an aid
package that could reach $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people say enough to the adjustments, enough to the
tightening of the belt,'' Duhalde said. ``We're not against having
more rich people, we're against having more poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the event was upstaged by Menem, who remains titular leader
of the Justicialist Party and who wanted the Justicialist
nomination himself despite a constitutional ban against a third
consecutive term. Menem refused to attend the rally, choosing
instead to dine with several labor leaders in the resort of Mar del
Plata in a well-publicized planning session for a presidential run
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Menem aides leaked to the press last week that as soon as
Duhalde is defeated, ``Menem 2003'' posters will be plastered
across Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, senior Economy Ministry officials
have said it would be no tragedy if de la Rua won.
</P>
<P>
   To win the presidency on Sunday, a candidate needs at least 45
percent of the vote, or at least 10 percent more than the
second-place candidate. Otherwise, the top two candidates face a
runoff next month. The new president will be inaugurated Dec. 10. A
variety of recent polls suggest that de la Rua will not need a
second round to win.
</P>
<P>
   Economic issues have dominated the campaign, with the country in
its deepest recession of the decade and unemployment running near
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua has promised to improve the economy by increasing
investor confidence, thereby bringing down interest rates. His
approach is orthodox, promising to reduce a current government
deficit of $5 billion by at least $1.5 billion by cutting wasteful
spending and corruption and prosecuting tax cheaters. He promises
tax incentives for small and medium-size businesses to spur
employment.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will lower production costs to make Argentine
companies more competitive on world markets by deregulating public
services, which he argues will cause communications and energy
costs to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The most detailed economic plan has been offered by former
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, who has urged an across-the-board
cut in taxes and government regulations. With little campaign money
and a small organization, he is expected to come in third with
about 10 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in case Duhalde should make a last-minute comeback and force
a second-round runoff, Cavallo could become the kingmaker by giving
his support to one candidate or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde proposed his economic platform as a bill to Congress _
one that would reduce the value-added tax to 15 percent from 21
percent and give tax cuts to companies that did not lay off
workers. But he could not even mobilize enough members in his own
party to reach a quorum in the House of Deputies for the bill to be
debated. The program's failure in Congress only served to highlight
the divisions within the Justicialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Justicialist Party is roundly rejected, it will
continue to control the Senate until at least the 2001 elections.
It will also control most of the gubernatorial seats as well as the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of divided government has most analysts
predicting that de la Rua will not take Argentina in a sharply
different direction even if he does win the landslide victory
predicted by the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And with Menem leading the Justicialist Party at least for the
next several months, it is probable he will continue to have a say
in what happens in the presidential palace even after he clears his
desk.

PAKISTAN'S NEW LEADER STRUGGLES TO ASSEMBLE CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's new military ruler remained
holed up Saturday as he had been for almost a week, trying to
figure out whom he would name to a seven-person council of military
commanders and technocrats that is likely to govern the country for
the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The army chief, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who took over in a
bloodless coup 12 days ago, promised in a speech to the nation last
Sunday that he would stamp out public corruption, repair the
country's broken-down economy and eventually restore democracy. But
he is still struggling to put together his team.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Rashid Qureshi, spokesman for the armed forces, said
Friday that the members of the National Security Council, to be
headed by the general, would be made public Saturday. Then on
Saturday, he said he hoped it would be Sunday, but he made no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Musharraf does make his final choices, he has no
immediate plans to hold a news conference. Instead, the military's
media office will release a list of names that may also include
some of those who will serve in other capacities in the new
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to explain the thinking behind it,'' said
Qureshi. ``He could do that if it was one, two, three individuals.
But how do you talk about a group of 10 to 15 people?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was
overthrown, the general has given two nationally televised
addresses to the nation and made photo-op appearances, including
one with his family and their two Pekinese dogs, Dot and Buddy. He
has offered no time frame for when he will allow new elections to
be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not with an ulterior motive,'' Qureshi said. ``He doesn't
want to say it will be six months, a year or two years, and not be
able to fulfill it. He's said it will be done as soon as possible
once the major reforms are put in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time since the coup, Musharraf has been out of
sight, conferring with other generals and with financial, political
and legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he sat through a five-hour series of briefings from
economists. The country is mired in a deep recession and is
perilously close to defaulting on its debts to international
lending institutions. In the aftermath of the coup, it is not clear
that the International Monetary Fund will continue a $1.56 billion
line of credit to Pakistan that had made it possible for the
country to pay back earlier debts to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generals know the economy is make or break for the future
of Pakistan,'' said Maleeha Lodhi, the editor in Islamabad of the
English-language daily, The News, which has been very supportive of
the coup. ``They understand that explicitly. They talk to me about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The now-deposed prime minister, Sharif, remains under house
arrest, as do a number of his closest advisers, at undisclosed
locations. In a statement on Thursday, Sharif's party, the Pakistan
Muslim League, did not condemn the coup, but said rather mildly
that it regretted what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The party demanded a return to democracy and the release of
Sharif, but it also said it did not want a confrontation with the
army.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no organized opposition to the military
take-over. Islamabad's streets were completely quiet Saturday.
There were no protests, no banners, no proclamations of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, an alliance of 19 political parties that had
united before the coup in their opposition to what they considered
the dictatorial, corrupt rule of Sharif have praised the general's
policy agenda.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tellingly, they have not called for immediate elections. ``In
the west, people think this is the death of democracy,'' said Imran
Khan, the cricket star who has thus far had an unsuccessful career
in politics. ``Here we think democracy now has a chance. The
political process had been hijacked by a political mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the general named three retired military officers
and a judge to serve as the governors of Pakistan's provinces.
Their relatively advanced age and their military ties have led some
political analysts to speculate that Musharraf is trying to keep a
tight hold on power, despite his pledge to devolve power from the
central government to the restive provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The country now waits to see whom Musharraf picks for the
National Security Council that he will head. The general, now
referred to here in headlines as the ``CE'' since he named himself
``chief executive'' of Pakistan, is still army chief. The council
will also include the chiefs of the naval and air staffs, as well
as four specialists in law, foreign policy, finance and national
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a preponderance of civilian technocrats of
extremely high integrity and professional ability,'' said Qureshi _
who later called back to say he had been instructed to make it
clear that he was not ruling out the inclusion of politicians of
high moral character.

ISRAEL MAKES PROGRESS TOWARD U.N. PRIVILEGES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Israel, isolated at the United Nations for 50
years, is very close to securing a place in a regional group from
which it can compete for a Security Council seat and other
positions, Israeli and Western diplomats said last week.
</P>
<P>
   These diplomats said that members of the regional group known as
Western Europe and Others _ which includes countries as far afield
as Australia and New Zealand _ are nearing unanimity on an
agreement to give Israel at least temporary membership. Only one or
two countries are holding out against the move, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is not likely before next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finally getting close to the finish line,'' said Dore
Gold, Israel's chief delegate to the United Nations. Gold, whose
term is about to end, said in an interview that he had spent a lot
of time over the last two years struggling ``to eliminate this
collective discrimination against the Jewish state in the U.N.
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 15 Security Council seats _ those not occupied by the
five permanent members, which are Britain, China, France, Russia
and the United States _ rotate among all other nations, which must
be nominated by regional groups to maintain regional balance on the
council.
</P>
<P>
   While many nations are never nominated for a seat, only Israel
has effectively been barred from the competition altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Under the essentially Victorian world view that prevailed when
U.N. regions were established half a century ago, Israel should be
part of the Asian regional group.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arab nations in that group _ which covers everything
``east of Suez,'' as Orientalists once described more than half the
world _ have resisted all efforts by Israel to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have been cool for several reasons to Israel's request
for membership, diplomats say. Some did not want additional
competitors for the Security Council's rotating seats. Others were
concerned about potential Arab retaliation if Israel were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some European diplomats said the idea of
admitting Israel was dying of its own accord as Middle East peace
talks faltered and the government of the former prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, was blamed for a lack of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of peace efforts under the new Israeli government
of Prime Minister Ehud Barak has changed the atmosphere, diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which has government-to-government relations with most
U.N. members, has nevertheless been vulnerable, especially during
the Cold War, to collective attacks in the organization by groups
of nations such as the old Soviet bloc or the Nonaligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's place in the organization was most severely set back,
along with U.S. attitudes to the United Nations, when in 1975 the
General Assembly passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism.
That resolution remained on the books until the first Clinton
administration, when Madeleine Albright, as the U.S. representative
here, was able to get it rescinded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Diplomats say that when Richard Holbrooke arrived in August as
the U.S. representative, one of his first tasks was to finish the
job of bringing Israel the full benefits of U.N. membership. U.S.
officials say that some of his earliest meetings were with Gold and
Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question but that the credit for the final push
belongs to Ambassador Holbrooke,'' Gold said Friday.

COLUMBINE SPURS COMPUTER PROGRAM TO SPOT POTENTIALLY VIOLENT
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Colo., Conn., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio _ Spurred by the deadly rampage at Columbine
High School, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is
working with a threat-evaluation company to develop a computer
program to help school administrators spot troubled students who
might be near the brink of violence.
</P>
<P>
   When the national pilot program, known as Mosaic-2000, begins
testing at more than 20 schools in December, its technique of
confidentially vetting and rating potentially violent students on a
scale of 1 to 10 will come not a moment too soon for Steve Dackin,
principal of Reynoldsburg High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine forever changed things for all of us,'' Dackin said
of the school in Littleton, Colo., where two students shot 13
people to death before killing themselves in April.
</P>
<P>
   Dackin knocked on wood in his office as he explained that his
school, like most in the nation, had been spared gun violence yet
had suffered very real waves of post-Columbine panic and concern
for safety that must now be dealt with through safeguard programs
like Mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as being a useful tool,'' Dackin said of the
program, which is based on systems now variously employed by Yale
University and federal courthouses to evaluate the potential for
violence of individuals who make threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has
criticized the pilot program as a ``technological Band-Aid'' driven
by profiteering in parental fears. ``We are understandably hesitant
about any program designed to classify students or anyone else in
society as potentially dangerous based on supposedly credible data
fed into a black box,'' said Raymond Vasvari, legislative director
of the Ohio ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ohio attorney general, Betty Montgomery, who favors the
pilot project, noted that school administrators must already
maintain confidential files on troubled students who might veer
toward violence. Mosaic, she said, will be a wonderful additional
tool based on a wide range of objective experience. Far from Big
Brother, she said, Mosaic is nothing more than highly useful
software _ a ``three-ring notebook'' to help worried school
officials delve better into an existing area of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings together the shared experiences of many experts plus
an evaluative piece,'' Ms. Montgomery said. ``It says, `Look, we've
gone back and spoken to X number of people who have committed these
crimes, and these are the risk factors we feel are present in their
lives.' It collects these risk factors based on actual cases and
organizes them in a way so we can have a consistent approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosaic programs, which are based on carefully worded questions
about student behavior based on case histories of people who have
turned violent, are designed by Gavin de Becker Inc., a private
software company in California. They are intended to help officials
discern a real threat amid the innocuous, if frightening, outbursts
that regularly cause concern. For the last 10 years, the company
has tailored risk-assessment programs for special law-enforcement
concerns like threats of domestic violence and threats to the
safety of members of the Supreme Court and the governors of 11
states, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful tool that has a great deal of
potential, and I hope it's properly used by the schools,'' said
Andrew Vita, associate director for field operations of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who found the Mosaic approach
useful in investigating bombings at abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get some of our focus and resources up front
of violence, in violence prevention, violence avoidance,'' Vita
said. He noted that his bureau was also developing a program with
the Department of Education to train school officials to cope with
another area of concern underlined at Columbine _ homemade
explosives in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic school program promises to provide questions
carefully crafted from case histories by 200 experts in law
enforcement, psychiatry and other areas. A variety of concerns
beyond alarming talk or behavior will be included, from the
availability of guns to a youngster's abuse of dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   The questions allow a range of answers, from a student who has
``no known gun possession,'' for example, to one who has ``friends
with gun access.'' Not all the questions might be effectively
answered by administrators who control the software, officials
conceded. But they said the more that were, the greater the
credibility of the rating would be in the hands of principals
facing the responsibility of deciding when to step in and call for
help from specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Dackin, the principal here, said Mosaic's immediate virtue would
be in producing detailed documentation of its evaluation of a
troubled student so that doubting parents could no longer challenge
an administrator's judgment as too subjective. But Mosaic, he
stressed, will at best be a useful instrument, with the school
community's ultimate safeguard being in making sure that all
student feel fully involved in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to put up metal detectors,'' Dackin said, ``but
harder to create a system where students feel connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is still being formulated, is to be tested
from grades one through 12, with the main focus being in high
schools. All the sites have not been determined. It will involve
only students who give cause for special concern, school and
law-enforcement officials emphasize. ``We certainly wouldn't want
to develop any kind of tool for labeling students in any way,''
Vita said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   School officials here expressed confidence that the
confidentiality of student records required by law would not be
breached by Mosaic. They emphasized that the software would not be
connected to any central data program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds OK, so long as you don't wind up labeling kids,''
said Shelly Darby, who works at the Sun Tang Luck restaurant and is
the mother of a second-grader here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of scary stuff out there,'' Ms. Darby said. ``But
there can be a real fine line between a kid out to get attention
and a really troubled kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She drew an empathetic nod from Aron Ross, the assistant
superintendent of schools in Reynoldsburg, a city of 35,000 just
east of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few dramatic, sad incidents have spawned hysteria,'' he
explained, describing a nightmarish week of baseless rumors and
countless alarms that caused midnight checks on school lockers
after the Columbine killings. And through repeated meetings with
anxious parents, Ross said, the question remains: What else can we
do so it doesn't happen here?
</P>
<P>
   ``School people in my situation must respond to this new reality
directly,'' he said. ``It used to be a platitude, but no longer,
about creating an environment where students and teachers are safe
and feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The de Becker company describes itself as a specialist in
high-stakes assessments. On its Internet site (www.gdbinc.com), the
company has posted a detailed series of explanations and
reassurances about the school software. ``School administrators
would use Mosaic-2000,'' the company asserts, ``only in situations
that reach a certain threshold (e.g., a student makes a threat,
brings a weapon to school, teachers or students are concerned a
student might act out violently).''
</P>
<P>
   The system ``merely brings organization and expert opinion to a
process every principal already has,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not determined the overall cost of the program,
but Ms. Montgomery, the attorney general, described it as ``very
affordable'' at less than $10,000 for the high school.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic systems are ``very well thought out and valuable
tools,'' said James Perrotti, chief of police at Yale University,
which for five years has used the Mosaic-2 program to assess
threats received by professors and students.
</P>
<P>
   Perrotti, one of the experts helping to shape the Mosaic-2000
questions, said the system had offered effective warning about
potentially violent situations that were nipped in the bud. ``It's
not a real predictor but it's the next best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita, the federal firearms official, says school officials need
Mosaic and other tools to deal with an ever more complex threat in
which relatively good students with access to guns may erupt
because they feel victimized by bullies or by the school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the hard ones for the school administrators to
identify,'' Vita said. ``It's easy to pick out the gang members
with tattoos. It's these other people that kind of surprise
administrators, and these are the ones they really need to
identify.''

EX-PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY ACQUITTED OF MAFIA-RELATED CHARGES  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Closing a chapter in Italian postwar history, a
three-judge panel in Palermo on Saturday acquitted Giulio
Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy, of charges that he
was the Sicilian Mafia's main protector in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The tensely awaited verdict was a vindication for the
80-year-old Andreotti, who has spent much of the last decade in
court. ``Obviously I am delighted,'' he said after watching the
verdict, announced live on national television, in his Senate
office in Rome. ``It was not so great to have to wait so many
years. I consider the case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was not entirely unexpected. In a trial in Perugia
last September, Andreotti was acquitted of conspiring in the 1979
murder of a muckraking journalist. In Palermo, as in Perugia,
prosecutors relied heavily on the testimony of ``pentiti,'' Mafia
members turned cooperative witnesses. The prosecution presented
more hearsay than hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict in Sicily was not quite the full exoneration
that Andreotti won in Perugia, where he was acquitted of committing
the crime. Judges in Palermo instead concluded that there was
insufficient evidence to convict. In Sicily, where the grip of the
Mafia is still felt, that distinction may have reflected suspicions
that organized crime could not have thrived so long without some
help from the powers-that-be.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year trial in Palermo, which involved more than 300
witnesses, including 30 cooperative Mafia witnesses, was viewed as
Italy's ``trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti was the power broker of the Christian Democratic
Party, which governed Italy for almost 50 years. He remains the
personification of a system that disintegrated in the early '90s
under the weight of its own corruption. In some ways, Italian
society was on trial alongside the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved,'' said Sergio Romano, a former ambassador who
writes frequent editorials on Italian politics. ``Had he been
condemned, the entire country would have been held responsible. It
is absolutely impossible to be governed for such a long time by
people in collusion with organized crime and not know it. It would
have cast a horrible shadow on the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a shadow is growing over Italian prosecutors, who are under
fire for what their critics call politically motivated zeal and an
over-reliance on Mafia witnesses, whose credibility has eroded in
recent years. The Sicilian prosecutors failed to prove that
Andreotti had reached a tacit ``pact of power'' with mob-connected
politicians, turning a blind eye to organized crime in exchange for
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensational allegation, that in 1987 Andreotti traveled
secretly to Sicily to meet and exchange a ritual kiss with
Salvatore ``the Beast'' Riina, a top Mafia boss who was then a
fugitive and is now in jail, also did not hold up. That charge was
based on testimony given by Baldassare Di Maggio, a minor Sicilian
mobster, who claimed he witnessed the embrace. Di Maggio himself is
now back in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mafia maxi-trials of the 1980s, ``pentiti'' helped
prosecutors capture and convict hundreds of mobsters. But the
generous immunity deals many won in exchange for testifying led
many critics to charge that Mafia witnesses would say whatever
prosecutors wanted. Witness-protection programs have proved lax.
Several mobsters, including Di Maggio, managed to kill rivals and
commit other crimes while under the program. Both magistrates and
their critics agree the law needs to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, Andreotti, who was made a senator for
life in 1991, juggled his many court appearances with politics,
interceding in parliamentary debates on NATO expansion and the
European Union with his usual acerbic verve.
</P>
<P>
   A slight, stooped man known for his erudition, his cynicism and
his cunning, he skillfully brokered alliances that kept the popular
Communist Party out of government throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   A devoted Catholic who courted cardinals and popes, Andreotti
never lost favor in the Vatican. ``I repeat the satisfaction of the
Holy See, which was already expressed over the acquittal in
Perugia,'' Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Vatican spokesman, said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti's critics have long portrayed him as a wily, sinister
figure. ``There has always been a theory, primarily on the left,
that throughout the Cold War, Italy was ruled by two states _ a
visible government, and an invisible power structure with shady
connections to organized crime, secret services and the CIA,''
Romano explained. ``Some people will go on believing it, but this
verdict is a victory for Andreotti, and inevitably, a defeat for
the other side.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Memo to Hollywood executives: You might want to
reconsider the $20 million-plus salaries you're paying A-list
talent and the nine-figure movies you're green-lighting.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by a Rutgers University economics professor that
will appear in the next issue of the Journal of Business finds that
stars don't help a film's profitability, nor did big budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, movies with big stars or lots of special effects sell more
tickets. But because the costs are so much greater, they rarely
turn a profit for their studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study leaves us wondering why the star system is such a
cornerstone of Hollywood and why studios keep turning out
big-budget films loaded with (costly) special effects,'' said S.
Abraham Ravid, author of the study and a panelist at a conference
on Hollywood economics Friday at California State University,
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Ravid, who analyzed close to 200 films with budgets greater than
$1 million released during the 1990s, conducted the study to test
the two major reasons why studios hire stars: To signal that the
movie is a high quality project and to assure that the star's
drawing power will bring in enough moviegoers to justify the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he discovered, is that major stars do indeed boost
revenues, but that is due mostly to the fact that they participate
in big-budget films. Additionally, there's no significant
relationship between a film's budget and its profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stars do very well for themselves and their agents, but they
do not do much for the studios,'' Ravid asserted.
</P>
<P>
   So why do studios continue to make such expensive gambles in the
first place? Ravid, who is scheduled to teach a course in economics
at UCLA in January, believes such choices stem from the difficulty
in forecasting the success of an individual movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A star may be hired simply because the industry faces extreme
uncertainty and executives wish to be covered in case a project
fails,'' he said. ``If everybody is after a given star, signing him
or her to a project may be a safe bet for an executive who is
concerned about job security.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cyffka, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of
finance and the single studio executive on the panel, defended
studios, saying they spend big money on stars and special effects
hoping to launch the next ``Titanic,'' even if it means too many
``Wild Wild West''s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a limit to what you can lose on a project,'' once
you've paid salaries and the special effects budget, Cyffka said.
``What you can make on a hit is so much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   As for stars, Cyffka noted, they represent a form of insurance
that boosts the probability of a strong opening. ``You pay a lot
for that insurance,'' he explained. ``There's a limited supply of
really top stars, so it creates an imbalance that allows stars and
agents to get the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravid isn't the only one questioning the budgets of Hollywood's
movies. Studio executives have been claiming they have been cutting
costs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Motion Picture Association's figures showed that
the average production cost per film slid 1.3 percent to $52.7
million, but that had followed a stunning 34 percent jump for 1997
films. Additionally, average marketing costs jumped 14 percent to
$25.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ravid said one area that clearly generated above-average
returns: movies with G and PG ratings, particularly due to their
ability to generate significant home video revenues. Ravid noted
that Disney's ``The Lion King'' cost $55 million to make in 1994,
then produced $313 million in domestic box office, $454 million in
foreign box office, $520 million in video revenues and $3 billion
in merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is likely that, if anything, most studies and lists
underestimate the revenues of G movies, which are more amenable to
ancillary products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that two other areas have a slight positive
impact on the bottom line _ sequels and movies that generate large
numbers of reviews, even if the critics don't like the film. ``Even
with low quality and less stars, a sequel still works better than
the average film,'' Ravid noted.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the study paints Hollywood executives in a
less-than-flattering light. ``The fact that stars do not increase
return on investment but sequels seem to be weakly more profitable
supports the view that the industry is run not by knowledgeable
insiders . . . but by uninformed insiders who guess and fail in
projecting the success of a movie,'' Ravid said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur S. DeVany, an economics professor at the University of
California, Irvine, echoed Ravid's conclusions about stars and
their impact, noting that their presence creates a paradox by
raising expectations and lowering potential profitability. He
stressed that Hollywood needs to focus more on content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real star is the movie,'' DeVany said. ``Budgetary
decisions ought to be made on creative content.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists also stressed that executives face a complicated
task in predicting a film's success. ``It's like trying to predict
the next earthquake,'' DeVany said.

in forecasting the success of an individual movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A star may be hired simply because the industry faces extreme
uncertainty and executives wish to be covered in case a project
fails,'' he said. ``If everybody is after a given star, signing him
or her to a project may be a safe bet for an executive who is
concerned about job security.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cyffka, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of
finance and the single studio executive on the panel, defended
studios, saying they spend big money on stars and special effects
hoping to launch the next ``Titanic,'' even if it means too many
``Wild Wild West''s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a limit to what you can lose on a project,'' once
you've paid salaries and the special effects budget, Cyffka said.
``What you can make on a hit is so much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   As for stars, Cyffka noted, they represent a form of insurance
that boosts the probability of a strong opening. ``You pay a lot
for that insurance,'' he explained. ``There's a limited supply of
really top stars, so it creates an imbalance that allows stars and
agents to get the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravid isn't the only one questioning the budgets of Hollywood's
movies. Studio executives have been claiming they have been cutting
costs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Motion Picture Association's figures showed that
the average production cost per film slid 1.3 percent to $52.7
million, but that had followed a stunning 34 percent jump for 1997
films. Additionally, average marketing costs jumped 14 percent to
$25.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ravid said one area that clearly generated above-average
returns: movies with G and PG ratings, particularly due to their
ability to generate significant home video revenues. Ravid noted
that Disney's ``The Lion King'' cost $55 million to make in 1994,
then produced $313 million in domestic box office, $454 million in
foreign box office, $520 million in video revenues and $3 billion
in merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is likely that, if anything, most studies and lists
underestimate the revenues of G movies, which are more amenable to
ancillary products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that two other areas have a slight positive
impact on the bottom line _ sequels and movies that generate large
numbers of reviews, even if the critics don't like the film. ``Even
with low quality and less stars, a sequel still works better than
the average film,'' Ravid noted.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the study paints Hollywood executives in a
less-than-flattering light. ``The fact that stars do not increase
return on investment but sequels seem to be weakly more profitable
supports the view that the industry is run not by knowledgeable
insiders . . . but by uninformed insiders who guess and fail in
projecting the success of a movie,'' Ravid said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur S. DeVany, an economics professor at the University of
California, Irvine, echoed Ravid's conclusions about stars and
their impact, noting that their presence creates a paradox by
raising expectations and lowering potential profitability. He
stressed that Hollywood needs to focus more on content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real star is the movie,'' DeVany said. ``Budgetary
decisions ought to be made on creative content.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists also stressed that executives face a complicated
task in predicting a film's success. ``It's like trying to predict
the next earthquake,'' DeVany said.

COLUMBINE SPURS COMPUTER PROGRAM TO SPOT POTENTIALLY VIOLENT
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Colo., Conn., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio _ Spurred by the deadly rampage at Columbine
High School, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is
working with a threat-evaluation company to develop a computer
program to help school administrators spot troubled students who
might be near the brink of violence.
</P>
<P>
   When the national pilot program, known as Mosaic-2000, begins
testing at more than 20 schools in December, its technique of
confidentially vetting and rating potentially violent students on a
scale of 1 to 10 will come not a moment too soon for Steve Dackin,
principal of Reynoldsburg High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine forever changed things for all of us,'' Dackin said
of the school in Littleton, Colo., where two students shot 13
people to death before killing themselves in April.
</P>
<P>
   Dackin knocked on wood in his office as he explained that his
school, like most in the nation, had been spared gun violence yet
had suffered very real waves of post-Columbine panic and concern
for safety that must now be dealt with through safeguard programs
like Mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as being a useful tool,'' Dackin said of the
program, which is based on systems now variously employed by Yale
University and federal courthouses to evaluate the potential for
violence of individuals who make threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has
criticized the pilot program as a ``technological Band-Aid'' driven
by profiteering in parental fears. ``We are understandably hesitant
about any program designed to classify students or anyone else in
society as potentially dangerous based on supposedly credible data
fed into a black box,'' said Raymond Vasvari, legislative director
of the Ohio ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ohio attorney general, Betty Montgomery, who favors the
pilot project, noted that school administrators must already
maintain confidential files on troubled students who might veer
toward violence. Mosaic, she said, will be a wonderful additional
tool based on a wide range of objective experience. Far from Big
Brother, she said, Mosaic is nothing more than highly useful
software _ a ``three-ring notebook'' to help worried school
officials delve better into an existing area of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings together the shared experiences of many experts plus
an evaluative piece,'' Ms. Montgomery said. ``It says, `Look, we've
gone back and spoken to X number of people who have committed these
crimes, and these are the risk factors we feel are present in their
lives.' It collects these risk factors based on actual cases and
organizes them in a way so we can have a consistent approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosaic programs, which are based on carefully worded questions
about student behavior based on case histories of people who have
turned violent, are designed by Gavin de Becker Inc., a private
software company in California. They are intended to help officials
discern a real threat amid the innocuous, if frightening, outbursts
that regularly cause concern. For the last 10 years, the company
has tailored risk-assessment programs for special law-enforcement
concerns like threats of domestic violence and threats to the
safety of members of the Supreme Court and the governors of 11
states, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful tool that has a great deal of
potential, and I hope it's properly used by the schools,'' said
Andrew Vita, associate director for field operations of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who found the Mosaic approach
useful in investigating bombings at abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get some of our focus and resources up front
of violence, in violence prevention, violence avoidance,'' Vita
said. He noted that his bureau was also developing a program with
the Department of Education to train school officials to cope with
another area of concern underlined at Columbine _ homemade
explosives in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic school program promises to provide questions
carefully crafted from case histories by 200 experts in law
enforcement, psychiatry and other areas. A variety of concerns
beyond alarming talk or behavior will be included, from the
availability of guns to a youngster's abuse of dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   The questions allow a range of answers, from a student who has
``no known gun possession,'' for example, to one who has ``friends
with gun access.'' Not all the questions might be effectively
answered by administrators who control the software, officials
conceded. But they said the more that were, the greater the
credibility of the rating would be in the hands of principals
facing the responsibility of deciding when to step in and call for
help from specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Dackin, the principal here, said Mosaic's immediate virtue would
be in producing detailed documentation of its evaluation of a
troubled student so that doubting parents could no longer challenge
an administrator's judgment as too subjective. But Mosaic, he
stressed, will at best be a useful instrument, with the school
community's ultimate safeguard being in making sure that all
student feel fully involved in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to put up metal detectors,'' Dackin said, ``but
harder to create a system where students feel connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is still being formulated, is to be tested
from grades one through 12, with the main focus being in high
schools. All the sites have not been determined. It will involve
only students who give cause for special concern, school and
law-enforcement officials emphasize. ``We certainly wouldn't want
to develop any kind of tool for labeling students in any way,''
Vita said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   School officials here expressed confidence that the
confidentiality of student records required by law would not be
breached by Mosaic. They emphasized that the software would not be
connected to any central data program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds OK, so long as you don't wind up labeling kids,''
said Shelly Darby, who works at the Sun Tang Luck restaurant and is
the mother of a second-grader here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of scary stuff out there,'' Ms. Darby said. ``But
there can be a real fine line between a kid out to get attention
and a really troubled kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She drew an empathetic nod from Aron Ross, the assistant
superintendent of schools in Reynoldsburg, a city of 35,000 just
east of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few dramatic, sad incidents have spawned hysteria,'' he
explained, describing a nightmarish week of baseless rumors and
countless alarms that caused midnight checks on school lockers
after the Columbine killings. And through repeated meetings with
anxious parents, Ross said, the question remains: What else can we
do so it doesn't happen here?
</P>
<P>
   ``School people in my situation must respond to this new reality
directly,'' he said. ``It used to be a platitude, but no longer,
about creating an environment where students and teachers are safe
and feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The de Becker company describes itself as a specialist in
high-stakes assessments. On its Internet site (www.gdbinc.com), the
company has posted a detailed series of explanations and
reassurances about the school software. ``School administrators
would use Mosaic-2000,'' the company asserts, ``only in situations
that reach a certain threshold (e.g., a student makes a threat,
brings a weapon to school, teachers or students are concerned a
student might act out violently).''
</P>
<P>
   The system ``merely brings organization and expert opinion to a
process every principal already has,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not determined the overall cost of the program,
but Ms. Montgomery, the attorney general, described it as ``very
affordable'' at less than $10,000 for the high school.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic systems are ``very well thought out and valuable
tools,'' said James Perrotti, chief of police at Yale University,
which for five years has used the Mosaic-2 program to assess
threats received by professors and students.
</P>
<P>
   Perrotti, one of the experts helping to shape the Mosaic-2000
questions, said the system had offered effective warning about
potentially violent situations that were nipped in the bud. ``It's
not a real predictor but it's the next best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita, the federal firearms official, says school officials need
Mosaic and other tools to deal with an ever more complex threat in
which relatively good students with access to guns may erupt
because they feel victimized by bullies or by the school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the hard ones for the school administrators to
identify,'' Vita said. ``It's easy to pick out the gang members
with tattoos. It's these other people that kind of surprise
administrators, and these are the ones they really need to
identify.''

CONNECTICUT INDIANS BECOME RICH ALLIES IN AN ABORIGINE WIDOW'S
CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia, Switzerland, Britain, Conn.)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When Letty Scott, an Australian who traces her
maternal ancestry to a community of desert Aborigines, decided to
go international with her campaign against what she sees as
persistent police brutality against her people, she found help in
some unexpected places. Not least was Foxwoods, the Connecticut
casino resort run by Pequot Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``God took me there,'' said Ms. Scott, whose husband, Douglas,
was found hanged in a prison cell in the northern Australian city
of Darwin in 1985 after he had been detained on a charge of using
obscene language. The police said it was a suicide. She calls it
another case of killing under torture.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, armed with the results of official and
unofficial Australian investigations, reams of paper devoted to
still-unanswered questions about her husband's case and police
photographs of the death scene released to her by a former prime
minister, Paul Keating, Ms. Scott began looking for international
attention to a cause she says is not just hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death rates of my people have skyrocketed,'' she said in
an interview last week. She thinks too many are recorded as
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   In her search for allies, or at least sympathetic audiences, Ms.
Scott, whose grandmother came from the Anmatyerre aboriginal nation
in Australia's Central Western Desert region, has joined many other
indigenous peoples around the world who are building bridges to one
another, aided by easier communications.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, for example, a group of Cree Indians from
Canada went to Nepal to teach mountain villagers how to organize to
oppose a large hydroelectric project that threatened to disrupt
their homes, traditional life and livelihood. Jose Ramos-Horta, the
East Timorese independence leader, has contributed time to teaching
tribal people and indigenous minorities how to deal with large
international organizations. There are many other examples.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott, an artist who says she is about 46, started her
campaign on her own. She pulled together enough money to come to
the United States _ a sympathetic former police officer in
Australia was one of her benefactors _ to try to get a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived in New York with only one contact, an American
marine biologist she had met on Australia's north coast, she said.
He, in turn, told her about the Shinnecock Indians of Long Island.
She had also heard about them through Indian cultural organizations
found in a phone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Shinnecocks said to me, `We'll take you to the brothers on
the other side _ they've got money,' '' she said. The brothers were
the Mashantucket Pequots, a small tribe that had become fabulously
rich on its casino profits.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Thomas, a Mashantucket Pequot tribal council leader, got
the call. ``People from the Shinnecock reservation contacted me and
said, `Michael, you have to hear this lady's story,' '' he said in
an interview Thursday. `` `You will probably want to help her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas arranged for Ms. Scott, her son, Nathan, 15, and Daniel
Taylor, a family friend who volunteered to help her with
correspondence and logistics, to stay at the Foxwoods Resort Casino
in Mashantucket, Conn. He also called together tribal staff members
to devise a game plan for Ms. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequot then paid for Ms. Scott to return to Australia and
plan a trip to meet with U.N. human rights panels in Geneva and New
York, with a stop in London to meet other human rights groups. That
trip was also a gift from the tribe, which has been generous in
supporting the cultures of other indigenous groups in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, she was put in touch with American Indians working on
international projects for indigenous people. The United Nations
has set aside a decade to promote these varied cultures. The
American Indians in Geneva gave Ms. Scott a place to stay and got
her a hearing at a U.N. human rights subcommission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she is back in the U.S., where I am in the process of
setting up meetings with various and sundry congressmen and
political leaders,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without getting terribly corny,'' he added, ``we've been
taught to believe that when we are blessed we are meant to share
those blessings, or they are taken by the creator.''

REVERED ICON BECOMES MYSTERIOUS TARGET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She stands resplendent in her green robe, the
protective patron of Mexicans everywhere, painted in a bright mural
on the wall of the Gonzalez Party Supplies store on San Pedro and
22nd streets in South-Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago, in the dark of night, somebody obliterated
the face and praying hands of this image of the Virgin of Guadalupe
with a wide roller of white paint, and scrawled in blue: ``666''
and the words, ``La Bestia,'' Spanish for the devil.
</P>
<P>
   It was actually the second attack on the mural, one of more than
a dozen on the walls of bodegas and storefronts in this bustling
Hispanic neighborhood south of downtown to have been defaced in
recent weeks. The first time, the Gonzalez family promptly
repainted the Virgin, a revered talisman of the Roman Catholic
faithful who, believers say, came as an apparition of the Virgin
Mary to Juan Diego, an Aztec convert to Christianity, in the hills
outside Mexico City in 1531.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't even last a week,'' said Juan Gonzalez, who owns the
electronics store that adjoins his mother's party goods shop.
``They came back and painted her face and hands. I think it's
local. It's some religious thing. It's hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why it's happening, or who is responsible. Up and
down San Pedro Street and Central Avenue, the spines of a
neighborhood that was once heavily black but has been flooded in
recent years by immigrants from Mexico, merchants expressed alarm
and bewilderment, wondering why anyone would attack a symbol so
universally admired in their community that even Hispanic gang
members wear tattoos and T-shirts with the image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any idea,'' said Marta Rocha, who works with her
father, Ismael, at their Restaurant Familiar at San Pedro and 41st
Streets, where an image of the Virgin was defaced about a month
ago. ``We had just finished repainting it.''
</P>
<P>
   But this peculiar urban mystery has prompted no civic outrage.
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is a devout Roman Catholic, with
a prayer chapel in his back yard, but he was unaware of the
vandalism in South-Central until a reporter called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' said the mayor's press secretary, Deputy
Mayor Noelia Rodriguez, who said the reporter's call was the first
City Hall had heard of it. ``It's tragic. I know the mayor doesn't
know about it. In that community, especially, the Virgin is
protected and respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Camilo Jose Vergara, a sociologist and photographer who has
recorded life in inner cities from the Bronx to the barrios here,
noticed the vandalism on a recent visit. Vergara, whose exhibition
``El Nuevo Mundo: The Landscape of Latino Los Angeles,'' closed at
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum of the Smithsonian
Institution in New York last month, has spent years driving the
avenues and alleyways of South-Central, tracking the importation of
familiar Mexican iconography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin is the sweetest symbol, and also the most powerful
symbol for Mexico,'' Vergara said. ``It's their mother. I mean,
everyone else can let them down, but not the Virgin.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is all the more puzzling that anyone would deface such a
revered symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants wondered if it might be the work of Hispanic
evangelical Protestants, angered by the Catholic icon. Some
speculated that it might be teen-agers. Others wondered about
Hispanic gang members, or ``cholos,'' and some of the murals are
pocked with the graffiti of the 38th Street gang.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Phillips, a lecturer in anthropology at the University
of California at Los Angeles, who just published ``Wallbangers''
(University of Chicago Press, 1999), a book on the graffiti of Los
Angeles gangs, said she highly doubted that gang members were
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange,'' Ms. Phillips said. ``Typically, if there's
a whole mural, and there's any part of the Virgin on it, the rest
may be written over but she's spared. But this time, it's like
she's the target. I think that it's just one person. It's localized
within that area. I toyed with the idea for a while that it could
be a racial thing, but in that particular neighborhood, those two
populations have been living close together in relative peace for
such a long time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most merchants said they had not even bothered to complain to
the police. Gonzalez's fiancee, Elvia Partida, said she had called
the local police station and was told that unless there was overt
evidence of a hate crime, there was nothing the police could do.
</P>
<P>
   One police sergeant on patrol with his partner in the
neighborhood the other day, who declined to give his name, said he
was unaware of the vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   When a visitor pointed to an example of fresh blue paint over
the image of the Virgin painted on the wall of the L.A. Meat Market
at Central Avenue and 49th Street, the sergeant said: ``I mean,
it's a liquor store. Graffiti around here is so common. Unless it's
a church or a house of worship, people don't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Dwaine Roberson, the supervisor of the Newton
Division's burglary and vandalism detective unit, said he had not
heard of any complaints about defaced images of the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally foreign,'' Roberson said. ``I haven't heard
anything, I haven't seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Partida said she first noticed the vandalism about a month
ago, at the time of a procession on Olvera Street in downtown Los
Angeles to welcome a reproduction of an image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe brought from the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in
Mexico City for an American tour. Legend has it that after
appearing to Juan Diego, the Virgin left an imprint of her image on
his cloak; that original image lies inside the Basilica, and on his
visit to Mexico earlier this year, Pope John Paul II commissioned
the reproduction and elevated Guadalupe's feast day, Dec. 12, to a
higher level feast day for Catholics in North America and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the archdiocese of Los
Angeles, had not heard of the defacement. He said that even
storefront churches in South-Central without a tradition of
religious imagery often painted the Virgin of Guadalupe on their
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of this graffiti makes me think that it could be
coming from some non-Catholic or anti-Catholic Christian sect,''
Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the mystery lingers, and rankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows,'' said Margarita Pacheco, an elderly woman
pushing a stroller with a baby down San Pedro Street the other day,
frowning at a defaced Virgin on the wall of Wally's Liquor Market.
``It's very bad. It's the mother of God.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ At first glance, the headquarters of the United
Nations looks nearly as new as the day it was built. The black and
white tile floors sparkle. Fresh paint adorns the walls. The
paneled chambers of the General Assembly and the Security Council
still glow with the elegance of the dreams that inspired them.
</P>
<P>
   But half a century after the cornerstone was laid on Oct. 24,
1949, a closer look reveals that the most prestigious symbol of New
York City's claim to international stature is deteriorating at its
core, beset by hundreds of millions of dollars in structural and
environmental problems and without the money to fix them. In fact,
if the United Nations had to abide by city building regulations _
diplomatic immunity spares it _ it might well be shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Roofs leak. A marble wall in the Dag Hammarskjold Library has
threatened to collapse. Asbestos insulation needs to be replaced.
Plastic sheeting was installed to protect library desks and
computers from dripping water. And some motors and water pumps that
keep the building running are so antiquated that spare parts are no
longer made.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more alarming is that among New York City's high-rise
office buildings, the 39-story U.N. headquarters is singularly
without a sprinkler system, as the city's fire code normally
requires. One of the emergency exits available to delegates in case
of fire is the third-floor roof of the Conference Building, which
``has deteriorated beyond repair and needs to be replaced,''
according to a proposed new budget.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations acknowledged the obsolescence of its
headquarters in a proposed budget, for 2000 and 2001. It reported
that ``new safety and environmental standards require the
renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such
areas as fire safety, access for the disabled, interior air
quality, asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic
materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Connor, the undersecretary-general for management, said
that the complex was made with good materials and has been
maintained as magnificently as possible.
</P>
<P>
   When the building was erected, it was considered an
architectural masterpiece, the product of collaboration by an
international team of 11 architects, including Le Corbusier and
Wallace Harrison. At the brink of the 21st century, to bring it up
to standards would cost about $800 million, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, which persuaded the United Nations to
settle in New York and provided an interest-free loan for building
the headquarters, shows no interest in helping. It has yet to pay
more than $1 billion owed to the world organization in back dues
and assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to do it outside the regular budget,''
said a U.S. official, ``because I don't see the climate of Congress
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly could levy a special assessment on member
countries. If so, Washington would be expected to pay its customary
25 percent of the cost. The U.S. official doubted that Congress
would consent, and suggested that the renovation be subsidized with
donations from foundations and the general public. Congress, as a
condition of appropriating the U.S. dues, has insisted that the
United Nations' regular budget not increase.
</P>
<P>
   The building's decay dates to the onset of the United Nations'
now-perennial cash squeeze in the mid-1980s, after the Reagan
administration pushed the government's fiscal year back from
January to October, in effect stiffing the United Nations out of
nine months worth of dues.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a shortage of cash, exacerbated by Congress'
unwillingness to pay up, has forced the United Nations to finance
peacekeeping missions and other political crises at the expense of
housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chronic poverty of the U.N. has bugged them from the
beginning,'' said William Luers, the chairman of the U.N.
Association of the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Renovating the complex has become a question of not just money
but also logistics, in finding alternate work space for 6,000
employees in New York. The options under consideration include the
once unthinkable _ whether to move out of the headquarters, at
least temporarily.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Relations with New York City have cooled since Mayor William
O'Dwyer welcomed the United Nations in 1949 by proclaiming Oct. 24
U.N. Day. In April 1997, during a dispute over diplomatic parking,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suggested that it would not be so terrible
if the United Nations left town, though its presence generates an
estimated $3 billion a year in business and other revenue for New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has since refused to intervene in the new controversy
over Donald Trump's plan to erect a high-rise apartment tower at
U.N. Plaza that would dwarf the United Nations, prompting a protest
from the secretary-general, Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters now costs nearly $10 million a year to heat in
winter and cool in summer, in part because of 5,400 windows
installed back when energy was cheap. And asbestos insulation in
place for nearly 50 years is drying out, prompting second thoughts
about gutting the familiar glass-and-marble landmark. ``If we do
that,'' a U.N. official fretted, ``we would spread environmental
hazards all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri Madarshahi, the president of the U.N. Staff Council, an
umbrella group of unions representing U.N. employees, described the
asbestos problem more succinctly. Fifty years ago, she said, ``they
used asbestos behind every air conditioner in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget identifies some other areas of more
immediate concern, totaling over $22 million in repairs over the
next two years. They include work on the roofs of the Conference
Building, the General Assembly and the Secretariat, and structural
repairs to the Dag Hammarskjold Library and its glass facade.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs add up. A new sprinkler system could cost as much as
$50 million. Just upgrading the fire alarms to eliminate
deficiencies identified during an internal inspection would cost
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wein, a spokesman for the city's Department of Buildings,
said that the federal government does not require diplomatic
facilities built before 1993 to comply with local mandates, which
exempts the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The codes cannot not be enforced in any case, because an
agreement signed by the United States prevents inspectors from
entering the U.N. compound without consent. A second agreement on
diplomatic immunity and privileges shields the United Nations from
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Bender, the officer in charge of managing the U.N.
headquarters, pointed out that it met all codes when it was built
50 years ago. He said that he has worked with the city to correct
problems. Except for the absence of sprinklers, and fire alarms
that are not state-of-the-art, Bender said, ``the building is by
and large code-compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials emphasized that the renovation would not only
correct the building's long-term deterioration but also bring it up
to the city's building and fire code standards.
</P>
<P>
   Electromagnetic fields generated by transformers and power lines
in machine rooms have also caused morale problems. Employees in the
vicinity complain of headaches and nausea as well as jittery
computer monitors. Some worry about the risk of more serious
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that we are not breathing clean air and enjoying a
healthy environment,'' Ms. Madarshahi said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether electromagnetic waves pose a health hazard is still
unproved. And Binder said that the building's air quality, tested
twice a year, has been found safe.
</P>
<P>
   By next spring, the 188 member countries of the United Nations
will begin sifting through the alternatives for the headquarters.
Summing up the debate, Assistant Secretary-General Toshiyuki Niwa
said: ``Would you like the U.N. to operate for the next 50 years,
in which case what do you do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't take it for granted that this building can last
for the next 50 years.''

AS WEST APPEALS FOR CALM, RUSSIA PRESSES WAR IN CHECHNYA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Rebuffing Western appeals that it seek a political
solution in the North Caucasus, Russia continued its attacks in
Chechnya Saturday and proceeded with plans to increase its forces
in and around the breakaway republic to 100,000 men _ a jump of
40,000 from just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Chechnya said that Russian planes had bombed the
airport at Grozny and that Russian forces had severed a key road
between Chechnya and its western neighbor Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   There was still no indication whether Russian troops outside
Grozny would escalate the conflict further by trying to fight their
way into the Chechen capital. Russian military officials have sent
conflicting signals on this key question, saying they do not plan a
frontal assault on the city but that their presence there is just a
matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Russian and Chechen rebels might replay
their bloody confrontation of 1994-96 in Grozny, which was largely
destroyed, has alarmed the West, whose concern about the Chechnya
fighting increased markedly with the massive explosions on Thursday
that leveled a marketplace in the Chechen capital, killing many
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen leaders said the explosions were caused by a Russian
rocket attack, an account supported by some reporters on the scene,
and that 143 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials first denied any role in the explosions, then
said the blasts were the work of Russian special forces trying to
destroy an arms cache in the capital. Prime Minister Vladimir V.
Putin then denied any Russian involvement, putting the blame on
Chechen gangs.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
warned in a statement late Friday that the increase in violence in
Chechnya had ``raised concern'' about prospects for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, the American point man on Russia, said that Russia's
last war in Chechnya indicated that a purely military solution was
not possible and that the Kremlin should initiate talks with
Chechen leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright reinforced the message
Saturday. Ending a visit to Africa, she said she would speak to the
Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, probably during her
flight back to the United States from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last 36 hours have been of great concern,''
Albright said in Nairobi, according to Reuters. ``We consider the
action deplorable and ominous.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication Saturday, however, that the Kremlin was
about to heed the American desire for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving a meeting with European leaders in Helsinki on
Friday, Putin, a potential successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin,
said that Russia intended to press its fight against Islamic
militants. His ratings in the polls have climbed as Russia has
pressed ahead with a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly after the September bombings of apartment blocks in
Russia that killed some 300 people, many Russians accept the
Kremlin's line that it has little choice but to pursue the military
option in Chechnya, which has been largely lawless since the 1996
war ended with Russia's withdrawal and the breakaway republic's
official status left in limbo until 2001. Russian authorities have
blamed Islamic militants in Chechnya for August incursions into
neighboring Dagestan _ where Moscow's rule is more accepted than it
is in Chechnya _ and for the apartment bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Russian politicians have urged that the Kremlin
begin negotiations. Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko
party, said Russia should try to achieve an ``inter-ethnic
compromise'' in the region and his party was willing to serve as a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed alarm that the war could turn in a brutal struggle
between Russia and Islam. Yavlinsky's party was initially very
hawkish but became more critical of the military campaign after the
Russian military began a ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov also said that Russia
should be prepared to talk. Primakov has opposed an all-out ground
war and pointedly refused an invitation to meet with President
Boris N. Yeltsin earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary to begin negotiations from a position of
strength,'' Primakov said, adding that it is not clear who Russia's
negotiating partner in Chechnya might be.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from the North Caucasus also met Saturday in southern
Russia. Ruslan Aushev, the president of Ingushetia, said he would
present proposals from Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov. Maskhadov
is discredited in Russia, where many politicians believe he has no
control over the Islamic militants and worry that the Chechens
would take advantage of any let-up in fighting to regroup their
forces.

MIDNIGHT TALKS HELPED TO CLOSE DEAL ON BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn., Texas, Md., S.D., Ind., N.Y., Iowa)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a fund-raiser at the home here of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., shortly after 6 o'clock on Thursday evening,
President Clinton asked one of his closest friends in the Senate,
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., how the talks were going with
Republicans over the most important financial legislation since the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd was not optimistic about the bill, which had reached the
point of do or die. After four days of bitter polemic between Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,
and administration officials, the two sides were stuck over highly
symbolic and racially tinged community lending rules that
threatened to rip the legislation apart.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions had become so poisoned by Thursday night that
Gramm threatened both the White House's top economic adviser, Gene
Sperling, and the head of Citigroup that he would pull the plug on
the bill, something neither the administration nor Wall Street
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodd returned to the Capitol and, with a handful of other
Democrats from the Banking Committee, slowly managed to turn Gramm
around in an emotional confrontation in a tiny back office crammed
with three dozen lawmakers, aides and administration officials.
There, they agreed to split a critical difference _ giving Gramm
one provision he wanted that would make community lending advocates
more accountable, and giving the White House what it wanted by
making sure banks provided credit in poor communities before
entering new lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 o'clock on Friday morning, a few scant hours after his
pessimistic report to the president, Dodd and other exhausted
Democratic lawmakers placed a telephone call to a weary Lawrence
Summers, the treasury secretary, to report that they had clinched a
deal with Gramm to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. After
eluding its advocates for decades, the agreement to deregulate Wall
Street, favored by many of the nation's most powerful business
interests, was struck.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in the middle of the night was the final chapter in
a saga that began in 1934, when Sen. Carter Glass himself tried to
undo the law that put his name into the history books. The meeting
capped a month of posturing, brinkmanship and deal-making in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And its outcome is expected to bring about one of the most
important changes in decades in the laws governing the nation's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   This account of the roller-coaster ride of the Financial
Services Act of 1999 is based on interviews with leading Democratic
and Republican lawmakers, senior officials at the White House, the
Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, and industry
executives and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Their horse-trading involved several deals. One, over a new
regulatory system that may wind up governing the nation's banks for
much of the next century, was reached two weeks ago between Summers
and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, after
months of debate about their visions of the marketplace. The
agreement between Summers and Greenspan to share regulatory powers
is a centerpiece of the legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall
Act.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy of the Great Depression, the act shattered the House of
Morgan and divided Wall Street into investment banks and commercial
banks on the theory that this would lower the risks of economic
catastrophes like the stock market crash and banking crisis of the
time. Later laws would make it difficult for banks to sell
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Wall Street sought to repeal Glass-Steagall, and
for decades Congress was unable to deliver, largely because the
three competing industries, at war over the shape of the
legislation, lobbied the lawmakers into a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1997 when three leading banking and
securities lobbyists met at lunch and formed an alliance. A few
months later, lobbyists from the insurance industry joined the
group. Slowly the industry battle faded, and as the united alliance
approached Congress and the White House, a new momentum developed
to repeal Glass-Steagall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obstacles remained. Foremost was a turf battle between
the Treasury and the Fed. Both agencies supervise banks, but it was
not clear which would have the lead over the financial
conglomerates that would now be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The White House took the position that Treasury needed to play
an important role in bank regulation in order for the Executive
Branch to implement economic policy. But Greenspan said that for
financial conglomerates, the Treasury's formulation would enable
securities firms and insurers to unfairly take advantage of the
special government subsidies intended only for federally insured
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Summers took office early in July, he decided he
would take a stab at the issue, and ordered Gary Gensler, the
undersecretary of the Treasury, to prepare options for a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new legislation, congressional leaders urged Greenspan
and Summers to come up with their own solution to the regulatory
question or have one foisted on them. Two months into Summers'
term, the two men sat for the first of many discussions on economic
theory aimed at a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were two world-class economists who were trying to find
a solution,'' said one top administration official involved in the
negotiations. ``They were both willing to grind this down to the
facts, to the point where they both allowed each other's agency to
share data even if that data contradicted what they were saying
about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has told associates that he believed the talks
ultimately succeeded because the two men spoke the same economic
language, looking at such issues as marginal costs, subsidies and
equities. He concluded that such a deal could never have been cut
by lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours of Oct. 14, Greenspan and Summers
brokered a complex arrangement. Both agencies would share authority
under a regime in which new financial conglomerates would not be
able to take broad advantage of the economic subsidies that are
provided to federally insured banks.
</P>
<P>
   That resolved a fundamental difference between the House and
Senate versions of the legislation and propelled the measure into
high gear. Still, by the beginning of last week, there were a few
remaining barriers to a deal between Gramm and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton returned on Monday night from a trip to New Jersey,
he was informed that there had been no significant progress between
Gramm and the administration over the Community Reinvestment Act.
``It's going to be a long night of baseball and CRA,'' he told his
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Detested by Gramm, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was
intended to eradicate discrimination in lending. Gramm vowed that
his bill would never expand the application of the act, and
insisted that the new measure should exempt thousands of smaller
institutions from its provisions. At the urging of civil rights
groups, the administration insisted that the new law could do
nothing to roll back the 1977 act.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the administration insisted that any bank
interested in expanding into new lines of business must have and
maintain a satisfactory record of community lending. For his part,
Gramm was also insisting that community groups be forced to
disclose any agreements that they reached with banks to increase
their lending to minorities and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night it became clear that House and Senate
negotiators still faced a wide gulf over the Community Reinvestment
Act. Gramm summoned Summers and Sperling. But two hours of talk
accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In later meetings with White House aides, the senator made clear
that he thought Clinton would never veto a financial services bill
just as Hillary Rodham Clinton was preparing to run for the Senate
from New York, whose biggest industry is Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials believed that Gramm's political
calculation was flawed. While Wall Street is an important
constituent of any New York senator, they figured, so are the
minorities and disadvantaged New Yorkers who now benefit from the
Community Reinvestment Act. (Both Democrats in Congress and
administration officials said that Mrs. Clinton played no role in
the legislative battle.)
</P>
<P>
   The talks fared no better on Tuesday. They began with
discussions between Sperling, Summers and Gramm. After Sperling
left the discussions to conduct talks on the budget in another
corner of the Capitol, he was summoned back by Summers, who sent a
dire message. ``Larry wants you back,'' Sperling was told. ``It's
all blowing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gramm put forward what he called his final
proposal. At 10 that night, the Treasury Department rejected it,
issuing another threat of a presidential veto in a statement
largely drafted by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., the ranking Democrat
on the Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that Gramm would try to corral some Senate Democrats,
top White House officials met on Thursday morning with Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, and the nine Democrats on the
Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House concerns were well grounded. That same day,
Gramm held a teleconference with top business executives from
around the nation, urging them to call three of the Senate
Democrats most favorably disposed toward the legislation: Charles
Schumer of New York, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tim Johnson of South
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services industry's top lobbyists trooped to
Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon to implore the majority leaders
in the House and Senate to postpone any final votes for fear that
they would unravel the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to hold all of his Republican colleagues in line, a
frustrated Gramm was also beginning to show signs that he would
pull the legislation, just as he had killed it last year.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a pivotal vote early Thursday evening that sought
to get the deal that had been rejected by the White House inserted
in the legislation anyway, Gramm issued an ultimatum to the chief
lobbyist for Citigroup, Roger Levy. He told the lobbyist that if
Sanford Weill, the company's top executive, did not call Clinton
promptly, the legislation would be killed. Weill had been in touch
with senior administration officials at least four times that day,
but it is not known whether he placed any calls in response to
Gramm's threat.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Gramm took a telephone away from a White
House aide who was talking to Sperling, and repeated his ultimatum
that absent a quick offer from the administration for a workable
deal, he intended to kill the legislation in the next 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling pleaded for more time, telling Gramm that Dodd and
Schumer were working on a new compromise. Gramm apparently
softened, for as he hung up the telephone, he turned to an aide and
said: ``Where's Chris? I've got to find Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding Dodd, Gramm handed him the amendment that just had
failed and asked that he begin reworking it. Schumer had begun to
enlist the support of other Democrats and Republicans for his own
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The group closeted itself in the tiny office of the House
Banking Committee's staff director with top officials from the
Treasury and the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   At several points, Gramm and Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., the
ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, threatened to walk
out. They were cajoled to stay by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who
headed the conference committee, and Dodd and Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tempers had begun to fray.
</P>
<P>
   When Schumer got animated, Gramm pointedly observed, ``I'm an
old man, but I still have my hearing.'' That prompted Dodd to
observe: ``He's from Brooklyn. That's how they talk there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they whittled away their differences, ending with an
agreement over the last remaining issue, a relatively minor
provision that would require community groups to make some public
disclosures about their financial arrangements with the banks they
have pressed to make more loans to the underserved.
</P>
<P>
   The final agreement gave Gramm what he had ultimately sought _ a
statement in the legislation that the community groups would have
to be more accountable by requiring that they had to disclose their
arrangements with banks. Earlier in the bargaining, Gramm had
acquiesced to the administration's request that no banks with bad
community lending records be allowed to enter into the securities
or insurance businesses. The two sides also agreed to split the
difference on exempting small banks from the Community Reinvestment
Act. Small banks with the best lending records would get fewer
reviews for compliance with the act by federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 in the morning, the business of many years was
done.

   Hughes wrote 12 books _ six on intellectual and cultural history
with a focus on modern Europe, two general histories, three
collections of essays and an autobiography. Six, including his
memoir, ``Gentleman Rebel: The Memoirs of H. Stuart Hughes,''
remain in print.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, as a history professor at Harvard University,
Hughes spoke out for nuclear disarmament and against American
military involvement in Vietnam. He was co-chairman with Dr.
Benjamin Spock of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy,
and later was chairman of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Hughes campaigned for the Senate as an independent,
calling for nuclear disarmament and the abolition of war. He
appealed to internationalists, whereas his opponent, Kennedy,
focused on domestic concerns, like education and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the FBI asked the State Department to have its
embassies monitor Hughes' activities while he was in Europe on a
sabbatical. His case helped bring that practice to public attention
and prompted the department to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   He was a native of New York and a grandson of the former Chief
Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes, whose first name was Henry,
graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College in 1937 and received
a doctorate in history from Harvard in 1940. He also studied at the
universities of Heidelberg and Munich.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Hughes served in the army and was discharged in
1946 as a lieutenant colonel in the Office of Strategic Services.
After two years as chief of research for Europe at the State
Department, he returned to Harvard to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was Gurney professor of history and political science
until 1975, when he joined the San Diego faculty. He assumed
emeritus status in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Prof. Judith Markham
Hughes; their son, David M., of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter and
son from a previous marriage, Sandra L. Hughes of Chevy Chase, Md.,
and Kenneth S., of Arlington, Va., and five grandchildren. Hughes'
previous marriage, to the former Suzanne Rufenacht, ended in
divorce.

REDISTRICTING RAISES STATES' ELECTION STAKES  
 A FAILED TRUCE AMONG LEAPFROGGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Va., Ariz., Iowa, N.H., La., Mich. ,S.C., Wash., Texas)  McCAIN WELCOMES RIVAL TO WEB SITE

<P>
   Most states will not hold legislative elections until next year.
But Virginia is an exception. It will vote this year, on Nov. 2,
with all 140 seats in its Senate and House of Delegates up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the stakes been higher.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Southern states, Virginia has been trending
Republican. The party already controls the state Senate and the
three top state jobs _ governor, lieutenant governor and attorney
general _ and it has big hopes that it can gain control of the
House of Delegates.
</P>
<P>
   How big?
</P>
<P>
   Big enough for President Clinton to travel to Virginia on Friday
to raise money for the Democratic defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Democrats have a difficult time in Virginia,'' Clinton
said, alluding to his failure to carry the state in 1996 and the
Republican's subsequent success in winning the top three elective
jobs and a one-seat edge in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   What the president did not dwell on but every Democrat at the
gathering knew was that come Nov. 2, all the Republicans need to do
to seize full control of the state is maintain that narrow hold on
the Senate and pick up two seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In the long history of the Old Dominion, Republicans have never
controlled the state legislature and all of the top state elective
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But history is not the real issue. History has nothing to do
with why the stakes are so high in this election.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is raw political power. And Virginia is but one
of 50 states that will be caught up in the struggle for such power
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   The party that controls Virginia, or any other state, going into
the new millennium will pretty well decide how that state's
legislative and congressional districts are drawn after the 2000
census. And if the control extends from the governor down through
the legislature, almost anything the party does to district lines
will probably stand, barring a successful court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It goes almost without saying, too, that a state party with that
kind of control can also push through almost any governing agenda
it wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting takes place only once every 10 years, making it
relatively rare in politics. A rough rule of thumb holds that the
political party that controls both the governor's office and the
legislature in a state can redraw district lines so that one of
every five districts tilts in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, that formula could result in a change of control in
Congress. To take an extreme example, in California, which has 52
congressional districts, redistricting could change party control
in as many as 10 districts, a crucial number in a Congress as
closely divided as the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Given stakes so immense, it is little wonder that when
Virginia's governor, James Gilmore, was trying to pump up his
troops last Tuesday for a final pre-election push, he did not
hesitate to reach deep for hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire future of Virginia,'' Gilmore declared, ``will be
decided in these elections.''
</P>
<P>
   A Failed Truce Among Leapfroggers
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked as though the war between the states over
next year's schedule for presidential caucuses and primaries was
over. The dozen or so upstart states that had been leapfrogging
each other in the headlong scramble to be the first to caucus or
hold a primary seemed by last weekend to have sorted themselves out
or to have given up hope that national party leaders, especially
Democratic leaders, would countenance more leapfrogging.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional old nominating schedule, it appeared, would be
retained for Election 2000. Iowa would hold the first caucuses, as
always, and New Hampshire would hold the first primary, as always.
</P>
<P>
   True, the nominating process would start almost a month earlier
because of all the leapfrogging already approved, and the nominees
might be known little more than a month after that. But however
early the process might start or end, Iowa and New Hampshire would
still go first, Iowa on Jan. 24 and New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The armistice lasted just five days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Louisiana Republicans announced that they, not
Iowa, would hold the first caucuses, on Jan. 15. They said their
state party rules required it. (Louisiana Democrats are sticking
with a March 14 primary.)
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Republicans countered by recalling that Louisiana tried the
same ploy in 1996 but only a couple of candidates showed up to
campaign, hardly enough to make the contest a genuine first test.
The other candidates, according to Iowa Republican leaders, were
scared off by threats that Iowa voters might punish them if they
strayed south, something the Iowans warned could happen again in
the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   So will Iowa now try to leapfrog ahead of Louisiana's new date,
or stay put?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to be pretty comfortable where we are,'' Kayne
Robinson, Iowa's Republican chairman, replied confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Good thinking, said Mike Francis, Louisiana's Republican
chairman. ``Otherwise,'' he warned on Thursday, ``we'll just keep
hopping.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the Democratic National Committee moved
determinedly on Friday to restore some nominating stability and
head off more Louisiana-like hopping. It ruled that Arizona,
Michigan, South Carolina and Washington could not move their
primary and caucus dates forward several weeks to join or get ahead
of other states that had leapfrogged from March into February.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed by the decision, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan told
the committee that the nation's nominating process had become a
``cockamamie'' ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   McCain Welcomes Rival to Web Site
</P>
<P>
   This being the age of the computer, almost every presidential
candidate has a site on the World Wide Web, some fancier than
others but all of them overflowing with self-serving biographical
data and the latest on what the candidate is thinking and doing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, pull down Sen. John McCain's site _
www.mccain2000.com _ and the Arizona Republican serves up ... click
here for the latest speech ... or here for today's campaign
schedule ... or here to make a donation ... or here if you are from
the Bush campaign ... or ... say what?
</P>
<P>
   Just trying to ``make it easier for the Bush campaign to surf
our site,'' a note to users explains.
</P>
<P>
   As the senator's computer people tell it, the McCain site
received more than a million ``hits,'' or visits, in the first half
of October, with more than 4,500 of them coming from the Bush
campaign, twice as many as from any other source.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush people counter that they have ``better things to do
than spy on who's using our Web site.''

SPORTS COLUMN: EVEN PLAYERS HAVE THEIR WORLD SERIES MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz recalls the acrid smell of burning
automobiles. Jim Leyritz still tries to will Carlton Fisk's fly
ball foul. Kevin McGlinchy shudders at the televised horror of
Mookie's grounder going under Buckner's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the World Series memories drive athletic little boys to
become major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series is different. The 50 Braves and Yankees who
began the 1999 World Series on Saturday night were united in
knowing that the baseball season shifts a mighty gear after the
league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   These games are not ``the finals.'' These games are the World
Series. No matter how much the television people yammer about
``post-season records,'' it is just a case of some network having
too many computers for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   It is irrelevant if modern players approach the records of Berra
and Mantle and Ford and Gibson and Fingers. Nowadays a batter or
even a relief pitcher could play 19 post-season games in October,
whereas the old Yanks and Dodgers never played more than seven at a
time. It is like comparing kumquats to persimmons.
</P>
<P>
   Those players earned their World Series statistics when there
was no prelude _ no league championship series, no division series,
just the best teams from the American League and National League
deciding it all.
</P>
<P>
   Even with league playoffs, the World Series brings the little
boy back in these grizzled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, only a few minutes after his current team, the
Mets, had lost a crushing 11-inning decision to the Braves, Turk
Wendell from Pittsfield, Mass., was asked if he had been looking
forward to a Subway Series in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm a Red Sox fan, and I was hoping they'd get in,''
Wendell blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   And Wendell was not alone. Last week, Tom Glavine from Concord,
Mass., who would start for the Braves Saturday night, admitted,
``My sister, who still lives up there, must have called me 15 times
during the course of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I still keep an eye on the Red Sox; obviously, the kid
in me is happy for the Red Sox,'' Glavine added, shortly before the
Red Sox went to their preordained defeat to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Many players insist they gave away those childlike fantasies
when they began earning major league paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rooted for the Reds and the Yanks when I was a kid, but that
kind of dies out,'' said Walt Weiss of the Braves, who grew up just
north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first World Series memory? The Yankees winning the World
Series,'' said Paul O'Neill, from Columbus, Ohio, who now plays
for, but of course, the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is the romantic concept of the Red Sox, those doomed
regional heroes, that stays alive longest in the hearts of a few
ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger, the Dartmouth graduate who has had a fine season
as the Braves' left-handed reliever, still quivers at the
recollection of a certain home run by Bucky Dent of the Yankees in
1978, not in a World Series but in a special playoff with the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the East Coast rivalries are more intense,'' noted
Remlinger, who grew up around Plymouth, Mass. ``I remember crying,
`How can he do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger added, ``The World Series is what all kids grew up
on,'' but he admitted that post-season plays like the fantastic
stop and throw home by Weiss to help the Braves beat the Astros, or
the two extra-inning thrillers with the Mets, are as good as
baseball gets.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the World Series stands apart. John Smoltz, the
bearded sage from Warren, Mich., recalls his father taking him to
Tiger Stadium to see if their team could wrap up the 1984 World
Series in the fifth game. They could, and fans near the stadium
burned cars and menaced the neighborhoods that long and ugly
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad showed me how people react to victory,'' Smoltz said
the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he still rooted for the Tigers, Smoltz seemed to fight
a very human inclination to say yes. What he said was: ``I still
root for the three other Detroit teams. And since I live here now,
I root for the three Atlanta teams, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, the prodigal Yankee, knew where his boyhood heart was _
with the Reds, against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up near Cincinnati,'' he said. ``I remember staying up
late in 1975 to watch the sixth game. I remember Fisk's home run. I
was very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Leyritz is treated like General Sherman in these parts for
the way he torched the Braves with his three-run, game-tying homer
in the fourth game of the 1996 World Series. To some children in
Atlanta, he is the latter-day version of Carlton Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy, the fine young Atlanta relief pitcher from Walden,
Mass., also had a baseball memory. It was 1986, and he stayed up
late with his parents on a Saturday night to watch their New
England team put away those upstarts from Shea Stadium, only to
have the awful event take place close to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, McGlinchy was the Braves' pitcher when the Mets
staged their comeback in the stirring 15-inning game last Sunday in
that very same Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed an inhumane stretch for a journalist to bring up that
linkage to McGlinchy. Besides, Mookie's moment happened in a World
Series whereas McGlinchy's bad inning took place in a championship
series. The Red Sox never recovered whereas the Braves have moved
on to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody will make baseball history, wonderful or hideous, in
the next week or so. What happens now is a season unto itself. It
is the World Series.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: RECALLING THE ORIGIN OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Andruw Jones went for a walk, the dream of a Subway Series
was nice while it lasted. Maybe next year.
</P>
<P>
   During that dream, in a recent column about past Subway Series,
it was written here that ``hardly a man is now alive who saw the
first one in 1921.'' But at least one man was not only alive, he
was on the telephone from Miami Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Nat Potamkin,'' he said. ``I'm 94 and I saw all
eight games at the Polo Grounds that year.''
</P>
<P>
   All  &UR; eight &LR;  games? Yes, that original Subway Series was played
in the third and final year of an experimental five-of-nine-game
format. The New York Giants won the last three games for a 5-3
verdict over the New York Yankees, who had acquired Babe Ruth from
the Boston Red Sox in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last out of the last game,'' Potamkin recalled, ``was made
at third base on a tag by Frankie Frisch for an unusual double
play.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the ninth and John McGraw's Giants leading, 1-0,
behind the little left-hander, Art Nehf, second basemen Aaron Ward
walked. On a hit-and-run, the Giants' second baseman, Johnny
Rawlings, made a spectacular stop of Yankee third baseman Frank
(Home Run) Baker's sharp grounder and threw to George (High
Pockets) Kelly at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rawlings got him by half a step, then Kelly saw Ward trying
for third and threw to Frisch,'' Potamkin said. ``Ward made a high
Ty Cobb slide, but Frisch held onto the ball for the double play.''
</P>
<P>
   But who is Nat Potamkin, how did he happen to attend all eight
games of that first Subway Series when he was 16 years old, and
what else does he remember about the New York of that era?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid from South Philadelphia, where all the tough guys
were,'' he said. ``The Philadelphia Inquirer had a contest for
selling subscriptions. The top 50 would get a trip to the World
Series that year. Not just kids, old guys, anybody. I sold 200,
maybe 300 subscriptions, I forget exactly, but I finished 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up to New York in a bus and stayed at the Breslin
Hotel, 29th and Broadway. We not only went to the Series, we went
to the Hippodrome; they had elephants on the stage. We went to the
movie `When Knighthood Was in Flower' with Marion Davies. We went
to fights at the old Garden over near the real Madison Square.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Polo Grounds, where both teams played home games during
the season, Potamkin and the other prizewinners sat in what he
called the ``pavilion'' behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``During batting practice we went down to the box seats and
kibitzed with Babe Ruth,'' he said. ``He wasn't much of a talker
except to say, `Hiya, kid.' I had seen him before in South Philly,
out on the town at night after playing against the A's in the
afternoon. He'd be eating hot dogs and looking for a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller Huggins' Yankees, who had won their first American League
pennant that year, took the first two games, 3-0 on Carl Mays'
five-hitter and 3-0 on Waite Hoyt's two-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mays threw a submarine ball, underhand; he won 27 that
season,'' Potamkin said. ``Mays had killed the Indians' Ray Chapman
the year before, but it was Chapman's fault. He always bent over
the plate. Hoyt was a cute pitcher, like Whitey Ford. Not
overpowering, a good curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won the next two games, 13-5 and 4-2, despite the
Babe's only homer in Game 4. During the season he had hit a record
59 with 171 runs batted in and a .378 average. (Harry Heilmann of
the Tigers hit .394).
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 the Babe bunted for a hit and beat it out as Hoyt
allowed the Yankees a 3-2 lead, but by Game 6 the Babe was out of
the lineup with an infected elbow and a sore knee. As the Giants
won the last three games, the Babe's only appearance was as a
pinch-hitter in the finale. He grounded out before Ward's walk and
the Series-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nehf won that last game, a nice left-hander, he knew every
hitter,'' Potamkin said. ``Shufflin' Phil Douglas and Jesse Barnes
each won two games. Wally Pipp was the Yankee first baseman, a tall
thin guy. He didn't do much. Oh, I got arrested. We had some extra
tickets that we were scalping, but when they took me before the
magistrate, he said, `Get outta here.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Nat Potamkin was a dropout from South Philadelphia
High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents never knew it,'' he said. ``My friends got me
report cards and I filled 'em in. I boxed a little in the burlesque
shows in South Philly. I was a boxing commissioner here in Miami
Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   For exercise now, Potamkin hits the heavy bag twice a week at
the Eden Roc Hotel spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never finished high school, but I loved going to libraries.
I got in Dickinson Law School and passed the bar in West Virginia.
You probably know of my youngest brother, Victor, the big New York
auto dealer. When he started it, I put up some money to help him.
His boys run it now and I still get my checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nat Potamkin laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot to tell you, I saw the 1922 Giants-Yankees Series at
the Polo Grounds too,'' he said. ``I finished 23rd in the Inquirer
subscription contest that year.''

CLAYTON WILLIAMS, EX-INMATE   WHO HELPED PEERS REJOIN SOCIETY, DIES
AT 65  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clayton Williams, who used his experience as a
criminal and a convict to help others like himself rejoin society,
died on Oct. 14 in a Bronx hospital. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from emphysema, kidney failure and
heart disease, his sister Rosalie Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who lived in the Bronx, played a prominent managerial
role in programs begun by the Vera Institute of Justice, a
nonprofit group that works to improve the criminal justice system.
One program, called Project Wildcat, helps released convicts
readjust to society through work programs. It was a path Williams
knew well.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Harlem, and once said that he began to take heroin
at 11. He bounced from juvenile homes to correctional centers for
youths, and, as his crimes became more serious, ended up in state
prison by his early 20s. His picture was on a wanted poster for a
charge of murder in 1964 when he jumped parole on a robbery
sentence he was serving in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was captured in Houston in 1969 on the murder charge.
There was not enough evidence against him to proceed with a trial,
but he was sent back to prison as a parole violator. He was
released in 1973, and the next year, he participated in Vera's
Wildcat program. By 1975, he was hired to be foreman of a Wildcat
work crew, doing demolition and light construction.
</P>
<P>
   Williams later worked for Vera's Community Service Sentencing
Project, which began in 1979 to help provide nonviolent offenders
with alternatives to prison. This organization, like Wildcat, later
became independent.
</P>
<P>
   When the community sentencing program was absorbed by the Center
for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services, a nonprofit
organization independent of Vera, Williams served as a deputy
director until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Williams developed a reputation for tenacity, said Michael
Smith, a former president of Vera who is now a law professor at the
University of Wisconsin. In one notable incident in 1979, he helped
give the Wildcat program credibility with judges by combing the
Bronx to find a man who did not show up for his community
sentencing work obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams strove to combine his devotion to helping people with
his love for the Bronx. David Anderson wrote in ``Sensible
Justice'' (The New Press, 1998), ``He roamed the neighborhoods of
New York City looking for promising patches of urban decay: a
vacant lot in need of greening, a dilapidated building intended to
house the homeless mentally ill, a parochial school's leaf-strewn
play yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is survived by his sisters, Ms. Knight and Dorothy
Kearney, both of Manhattan; his daughter, Roslyn Brown, and one
grandson in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As a 19-year-old with a wife and two children, William Rodriguez
was hired as an intern by Williams. ``He was tough, but at the same
time, he really cared,'' Rodriguez recalled. Today, Rodriguez is
executive director of the Crime and Justice Foundation, a group in
Boston modeled on Vera.

BRAVES' GENERAL MANAGER CONTINUES TO MEET RISING EXPECTATIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Texas, Mass., Ga.)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the age of 59, John Schuerholz is a dinosaur. His
colleagues represent an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tyrannosaurus rex, Schuerholz is not extinct, but he has
become a throwback to another age, a time when baseball general
managers could reasonably expect to hold on to their jobs as long
as they were not stealing money or their boss' wife. These days
general managers are jettisoned as easily as managers.
</P>
<P>
   Not Schuerholz. He recently celebrated his ninth anniversary as
general manager of the Atlanta Braves, matching his previous tenure
with the Kansas City Royals, a team he left voluntarily. For 18
years he has run major league organizations, signing players,
trading them, building championship teams. None of his peers has
done it as long or as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Schuerholz keeps watching his peers change. In
the past few months, five general managers, one-sixth of the major
league population, have been fired or resigned. Milwaukee and
Colorado have named new general managers; Anaheim, Baltimore and
Seattle still have vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a natural development,'' Schuerholz said of the
volatility of the job. ``With all of the money owners have invested
in these teams, there's a lot more at stake. They have expectations
that whoever is running it, they expect that person to be very
proficient and very effective and very productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners, he added, are not as willing to be patient as they once
were when the money involved was a fraction of what it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably comes with what's happening in the industry,'' he
said, ``how much more we're paying, how much more franchises cost,
how much more is invested in these enterprises. They expect us to
be better at what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased costs are not new, but the escalation of the increase
in costs has had an impact on owners' thinking and nerves. As
payrolls have risen dramatically, a select circle of teams has
emerged as perennial challengers for the World Series, the Braves
and the Yankees included.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a handful of us,'' Schuerholz said of some teams,
``who have been so good for so long and whose expectations are so
high internally and externally, that the bar has been set higher
for all of us in these organizations _ general manager, manager,
coaches, players. Expectations go higher and higher and higher.
More is expected of us. That is a fact. The bar is set higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar sometimes is set inordinately high, the dean of general
managers said. ``We should be congratulated on one hand for
building a team and an organization that so much is expected of,''
he said, ``but on the other hand, there should be a little
understanding about what the pressures are that come with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Schuerholz's stewardship, the Braves have never seen the
post-season take place without them. Ten general managers who have
been in their positions longer than a month have never seen their
team play in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   One general manager, Frank Wren, did not reach his first
anniversary on the job in Baltimore Saturday. If the Yankees do not
win the World Series, another, Brian Cashman, may not make it to
his second anniversary in February.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a fired manager seeks another chance and another and
another, once a general manager has general managed, the job gets
in his blood. How else explain the desire of Pat Gillick, 62 years
old, to get the Seattle Mariners' job that became vacant with the
departure of Woody Woodward, who had been the longest-serving
general manager with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick retired once, leaving the Toronto Blue Jays after the
1994 season, then was lured back into active duty a year later when
Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, offered him $750,000 a
year for three years. The end of that term could not come soon
enough for Gillick, but here he is back in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the people out there,'' he said of the Mariners.
``They're all good people. I get along real well with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillick has wavered in his desire to compete for the
Mariners' position. ``I had some interest,'' he said, ``but after I
thought about it for a while, I pulled out of it. Then I talked to
them again. So the thing is up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick acknowledged that he still has the ``itch'' to do the
job, though he said, ``It certainly has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some way,'' he added, ``as far as putting a team together
to win, I think you can do it more easily than before because of
free agency. Unfortunately, because of the economics of the game,
they're moving people around faster.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EXECUTIVE GRAPEVINE
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Bob Watson, former general manager of the Houston
Astros and the Yankees, seemed to be headed for the Anaheim Angels'
job, or so went the word along the baseball grapevine. Now Bill
Stoneman, a Montreal Expos' executive, is viewed as being on the
verge of being hired.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Stoneman, who has been the Expos' vice
president for baseball operations for 15 years, would come as a
surprise to executives, player agents and players who experienced
his executive style when he briefly served as the Expos' general
manager in the late '80s. His style was so abrasive that the Expos
changed his duties so that he would not deal directly with players
and with agents whose players the club wanted to sign.
</P>
<P>
   One executive who knows Stoneman well said he has not changed
since those days. The Angels' interest in Stoneman did not surprise
the executive. He said Stoneman and Tony Tavares, the Angels'
president, are ``like two peas in a pod.''
</P>
<P>
   CHECKING TORRE'S FINANCES
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Torre signed a two-year contract extension with the
Yankees this year, his salary for 2000 and 2001 was believed to be
$2 million each year. However, information on managers' salaries
distributed to the clubs lists Torre's pending salary as 50 percent
more, $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The lower figure would have matched Jim Leyland's salary with
Colorado before he resigned, though $500,000 of his $2 million was
deferred, and the amount Felipe Alou basically receives from
Montreal, though his salary is listed as $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figure puts Torre far ahead of other managers.
</P>
<P>
   The new salary certainly is insurance against Torre's being
fired.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for, say, the Detroit Tigers to pay Larry Parrish
his $425,000 salary for next season; it's another for George
Steinbrenner to pay Torre $3 million not to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Torre's new salary in perspective, the seven lowest-paid
managers will earn a collective $2.65 million next season, and it
will take the next salary on the scale to put the pay of eight
managers beyond Torre's.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Torre will earn more than Bobby Valentine ($1
million) and Tony La Russa ($1.8 million) combined.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' manager worked for $1.3 million this year, fourth
highest on the managerial pay scale. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GIVE THE RED SOX CREDIT
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the Boston Red Sox could not live out their
once-in-a-lifetime fantasy: beat the Yankees in the American League
Championship Series, avenging 1978 and every other dirty deed the
Yankees have perpetrated against them, then beat the Mets in the
World Series, gaining revenge for Bill Buckner and the rest of the
1986 gang.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox, or more specifically their general manager, Dan
Duquette, deserve recognition for a remarkable job this year. The
loss of Mo Vaughn was supposed to render the Red Sox offensively
impotent and doom them to a finish lower than dirt, but they had an
immensely better year than Vaughn did as Duquette recast the team
in a different image.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox batted .002 below their 1998 average, hit 29 fewer
home runs and scored 40 fewer runs. But they won two more games
than they did last season. They did not make up for the missing
offense by playing better defense. They committed 22 more errors
and allowed 18 more unearned runs than a year ago. It was the
pitching that carried the Red Sox to their unexpected success.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff, led by the incomparable Pedro Martinez, had
a lower earned run average this year, the lowest in the league;
allowed fewer home runs and runs; walked fewer batters, and struck
out more.
</P>
<P>
   But once the pitchers got the Red Sox to the playoffs, their
hitters erupted, scoring 44 runs in winning the last three games
against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   With Vaughn leading the offense a year ago, the Red Sox scored
11 runs in beating the Indians in the first game of the division
series, then scored a total of &UR;  &LR; nine in three consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   How did Vaughn do with Anaheim?
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was to blame, but the Angels won 15 fewer games than
they did last year and finished 22 games farther away from first
place. Vaughn, hampered by an ankle ailment most of the season,
batted .281, his lowest average in seven seasons, and hit 33 home
runs, his lowest output in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Vaughn could lead an Anaheim resurgence next season,
but a healthy Ramon Martinez could join his brother in making the
Boston pitching even stronger and position the Red Sox to finish
ahead of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the same as beating the Yankees in the playoffs
and taking their place in the World Series, but that scenario would
play in Boston.  &QL;

FAR FROM FASSEL, WHEATLEY FINDS HIS NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Mich., Texas)  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Tyrone Wheatley began his comeback with the Oakland
Raiders this season, pounding his way to a conference-leading five
rushing touchdowns, there was a time last year when he fought to
overcome the chaos in his football life, a chaos that almost caused
him to quit the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   His impressive season with the Raiders, which continues Sunday
against the Jets, is all the more remarkable considering his
mind-set in September of last year. The Giants were playing the
Raiders in Week 2 and Wheatley, then with New York, was inactive
for the game because, he says, coach Jim Fassel wanted to look at
other players. Wheatley did not complain. Instead, he cheered his
teammates from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost, 20-17. During a team meeting one day later,
Wheatley and other players said, Fassel exploded at the team for
its lackluster play. It was deserved criticism. But what he said to
Wheatley disturbed the running back. Wheatley says that Fassel
yelled, ``Tyrone, you need to stop crying about playing time and
focus on losing weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley had been through battles with the former Giants coach
Dan Reeves. Reeves had not wanted to draft him, preferring running
back Rashaan Salaam, who is now a bust after being cut by the
Raiders before this season. Then came disputes with Fassel.
Wheatley thought that if Fassel was going to chastise him even when
he was not in the game, then he would never get a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley made up his mind to quit after the stormy team meeting.
He planned to inform general manager George Young and Fassel the
next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Then something interesting happened. To boost his sagging
spirits, Wheatley popped in videotapes of himself playing at the
University of Michigan and watched as he sliced and diced across
the field. It was that Wheatley whom the Giants considered worth
selecting in the first round of the 1995 draft. Next Wheatley put
in another tape, from his days at Robichaud High School in Inkster,
Mich., where he played eight different positions and was the
state's player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley was suddenly energized. He asked his brother, who was
sitting next to him, ``Do I stink?''
</P>
<P>
   No, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say that just because I'm your brother,'' Wheatley
replied.
</P>
<P>
   His brother said no again. Then Wheatley called friends in
Michigan and asked the same question. He got the same answer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week what had kept him from leaving the game,
Wheatley said, ``Watching those tapes made me stubborn, and I
believed in myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, who is listed at 227 pounds with the Raiders compared
with 235 or more last season, was right all this time. He was a
good player. Now, he may be the best power runner in football.
</P>
<P>
   He is a key part of a Raiders team that has a solid chance of
making the American Conference playoffs. He has rushed for 403
yards on 97 carries, and his five running scores have tied him with
Jacksonville's James Stewart for the conference lead. Wheatley has
put up his numbers despite splitting time with Napoleon Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley, one of the most intelligent players in the league as
well as one of the nicest, spoke honestly during an extensive
interview about himself, Reeves, Fassel and his topsy-turvy NFL
career.
</P>
<P>
   On Reeves: ``Reeves always talked about how I didn't work that
hard. But he didn't work that hard his last few years in New York.
Reeves allowed some players not to work hard, but then would try to
make an example of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley said that during a practice in his rookie year, 1995,
he was running hard up the middle and a veteran defensive player
told him after the play: ``What are you doing, rookie? Don't run
like that. You're making us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley also said that Reeves never let him forget that he
pulled a hamstring muscle while running sprints on his first day of
training camp. ``Reeves has a long memory,'' Wheatley said. ``If a
player makes a mistake, you will never hear the end of it. But when
Reeves made mistakes, he never admitted to them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fassel: ``I just didn't catch his eye. I guess he didn't see
anything special. He never had an open mind with me. From the
moment we met, he said, `This is a new start.' But he wasn't
telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley admits he deserves some blame for his problems with
Reeves and Fassel. ``Yes, I was wrong some of the time,'' he said.
``But I saw some situations and I said, `This is not going to get
better.' I could have moved Mount Rushmore and Fassel would not
have believed in me. So I purposely became ho-hum. The way I
walked, the way I talked. I didn't give up on my teammates, I just
stopped trying to impress Fassel because he had his mind set.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, asked to comment, said his relationship with Wheatley
started on a sour note and never recovered. But he said he had no
bitter feelings about Wheatley and wished him the best. Reeves
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley's history presents a conundrum: Did he lack motivation?
Or did he never get an honest chance from either coach, thus
sapping his motivation?
</P>
<P>
   His success in Oakland seems to indicate the latter. Wheatley is
now happier than he has ever been. The Oakland coaching staff told
him his past was not relevant and for the first time during his
professional career, he believed his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley looks back on the day he almost quit the Giants, and
cannot believe how close he came to leaving the sport he loves. The
Raiders are happy he changed his mind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Price of Pass Rushing
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Michael Strahan, in addition to being perhaps the
best defensive end in football, is also a skillful boxer. He knows
a good right hook when he sees one, and against Dallas last Monday
night that's exactly what he was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, the Cowboys' Pro Bowl offensive tackle,
Erik Williams, hit Strahan in the face while attempting to block
him. At least once Williams flat-out punched Strahan, in full view
of officials. On another occasion, Williams jammed his hands under
Strahan's face mask, scratching him.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward, Strahan's face showed a slight
bruise under his eye, in addition to a scratch. It was just another
day at the office with Williams, who has a reputation as one of the
league's leading cheap-shot artists.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan was asked what strategy a defender could use when a
blocker aggressively puts his hands in a defender's face and the
officials do not call a penalty. ``You take it and hopefully the
referee will notice,'' he said. ``That didn't happen this time.''
Then the Giants' Pro Bowl lineman added that the officials'
``contacts must have fallen out.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan's frustration is understandable. Defensive linemen are
the last truly unprotected football species. They are still kicked,
chop-blocked and punched, and officials still often let the abuse
happen without throwing a flag.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union is trying to persuade the league to make the
rules tougher. That may happen in the next few years. Until then,
players like Strahan should start wearing an iron mask under their
helmets.

AT THE CENTER OF THE RANGERS' PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Canada)   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching P.J. Stock cover Eric Lindros is like watching a
barking terrier chase a sport utility vehicle. What would the
terrier do if it actually caught the SUV? What would the SUV do to
a terrier that accidentally slipped beneath its moving wheels?
</P>
<P>
   Stock was recalled from the minor leagues by the Rangers last
week after Lindros and his Flyers bullied and beat the Rangers by
5-0 in Philadelphia on Wednesday night. Although half a foot
shorter and 46 pounds lighter than Lindros, Stock has the moxie to
harass Big No. 88. He helped neutralize him Friday night, and so
the Flyers won by only 2-0 in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Stock sensed some success when Lindros ``kept turning to the ref
and saying, `Get this kid off my back,' and the ref came by and
told me, `Kid, I don't know what you're doing, but if you want to
keep playing, you stop that.' Kind of gave me a hint things were
going all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Rangers should assign Stock to check Mark Messier
when his Vancouver Canucks visit Sunday night. You remember
Messier: older fellow, big, bald and sometimes scowling? He was the
captain when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1994, and he left
them as a disenchanted free agent in 1997. Like Lindros, Messier
also enjoys bullying Petr Nedved, the Rangers' top center. It was a
Lindros attack on Nedved that led to Stock's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Although rude treatment of Nedved is symbolic of current Ranger
difficulties, it is hardly their only concern. They have lost four
of their last five games and three in a row, the last two by
shutouts. They are 4-6-1 with a league-leading payroll of almost
$59 million. Expensive free agents like Tim Taylor and Valery
Kamensky have missed games with injuries. Their most expensive free
agent, Theo Fleury, is underachieving and pressing, and so is
Nedved.
</P>
<P>
   Their captain, Brian Leetch, the attacking defenseman, has no
goals in 11 games on a team desperate for goals. Leetch is a master
of the power play, but the Rangers' power play is 4 for 51, one of
the worst in the league. Acknowledging that ``our top guys have got
to be on the scoresheet,'' Leetch added: ``It's my job, it's Petr's
job and Theo's. And we haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rangers may lack clubhouse leadership, it was
interesting to see Leetch showered and dressed Friday night only 22
minutes after the final boos echoed around the Garden. Perhaps he
had an appointment with his old pal, Messier, in town to play the
Islanders last night. Maybe Mess can help Leetchie find a way to
stop a slump that could endanger the jobs of the Rangers' coach,
John Muckler, and their general manager, Neil Smith.
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to jump to conclusions and declare that
the Rangers are regressing and that their roster is a doomed
mixture of past-prime talent, it is also a fact that their roster
would be seriously flawed even if all their current players were
healthy and performing well. They do not have enough good centers
or young veterans in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Without a strong No. 2 center, the lead role may demand too much
from Nedved, who is more suited to a No. 2 role anyway. Manny
Malhotra, last season's promising rookie center, was little used
Friday, a sign that Muckler is dissatisfied with a kid Smith touts
as a future star. Taylor, a veteran checker, has been injured a lot
in recent years. Smith must have known this when he signed him for
more money than any other team was willing to pay. Mike York, the
other center, is an unproven rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recently signed another center, Alexandre Daigle, a
top draft choice of 1993 who has washed out with three teams. He
plays in the minors in Hartford. The Rangers actually considered
adding Daigle to their roster last week. In international
communications code, there are three declarations of distress:
``SOS,'' ``mayday'' and ``We've just signed Alexandre Daigle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulf Samuelsson, the former Ranger signed by the Flyers last week
as a free agent for less money than Smith is paying Kevin Hatcher,
has been unimpressive since arriving via a trade from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Samuelsson. As a Ranger, he used to battle Lindros
and take his abuse. With Friday's game nearly over and the Rangers
pressing, Samuelsson raked his stick across Kamensky's face, then
crunched Fleury into the glass.
</P>
<P>
   By then, half the Garden fans had left and even the booing
seemed halfhearted. Do Ranger fans expect failure after missing the
playoffs for two consecutive springs? The Rangers play 10 more
games before the quarter mark of their schedule. That will be the
time to seriously evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the slump, Fleury said, ``It's not the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not, but you can see it from here.  &QL;

JAMES S. MORAN, MASTER OF THE PUBLICITY STUNT, DIES AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Va.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Sterling Moran, who became a legend in the publicity
business with stunts like selling a refrigerator to an Alaskan
Eskimo, died on Monday at a retirement home in Englewood, N.J. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   His life might be described by two symbols: the exclamation
point and the dollar sign.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed outrageousness to the outer limits to seize the
attention of the buying public. He once searched for a needle in a
haystack for 10 days to publicize a piece of real estate that was
for sale. In 1946, he sat on an ostrich egg for 19 days, 4 hours
and 32 minutes before finally hatching it, all to publicize ``The
Egg and I,'' a best-selling book that was soon to become a film
comedy starring Claudette Colbert.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1944 presidential campaign, he changed horses in
midstream _ literally _ in a Nevada river to make a now forgotten
political point.
</P>
<P>
   He got the attention he desired. In 1989, Time magazine called
him ``the supreme master of that most singular marketing device _
the publicity stunt.'' Bob Thomas, who has covered Hollywood for 55
years for The Associated Press, called him ``the last of the great,
flamboyant press agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his colleagues in the publicity business, a species not
given to promoting much of anything without being paid, gave him
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Moran is a folk hero in the P.R. business,'' said Howard
J. Rubenstein, the Manhattan public relations executive. Rubenstein
said that earlier in his career he tried to imitate Moran, citing
the time he took live alligators to City Hall during a political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a chimney maker, Moran was born in 1907 in Woodstock,
Va., according to Mimi Brace, a longtime friend. He was married
several times and had no children. His only survivor is a brother,
Paul, of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Moran's idiosyncratic course was set early, Ms. Brace said. At
12, he was hit by a car while riding a bicycle. The driver,
ecstatic that the boy was alive, was said to have given him a $100
bill. He immediately took a train to New Orleans, the story goes,
not reappearing in his family's kitchen until two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Moran did not attend college. Among his early jobs was working
as a tour guide in Washington. He later became an airline executive
there and then operated a studio where members of Congress recorded
speeches for local radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems to remember exactly how Moran got into public
relations. But his clients were a diverse lot: Washington
politicians, Hollywood studios, New York City department stores.
</P>
<P>
   He opened an ``embassy'' in Washington for a mythical country to
publicize the premiere of the 1959 film ``The Mouse That Roared,''
which was about a mythical country. To promote a Broadway show in
the late 1940s, he rigged a cab so that a chimpanzee appeared to be
driving it _ as Moran secretly drove from the back seat. He once
walked a bull through Ovington's, a Fifth Avenue china shop.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, rotund prankster with a flowing white beard, he played
classical guitar, liked Champagne and read two or three books a
week. His friends included show business figures like Burl Ives,
Lee J. Cobb and John Henry Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the day for his sort of publicity stunt is past. ``He
did all the weird stunts that would never work today,'' said Cy
Preston, a publicist who is quick to tell of the time he himself
took a giant to a Missouri cavern he was promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein begs to differ. He says the proliferation of
television outlets, not to mention the Internet, makes visual
stories all the more compelling. ``His stunts would now go
worldwide through multiple media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Moran's cleverest schemes went nowhere in its own time.
An avid kite flier, he hit upon the notion of using kites to fly
midgets over Central Park. The police refused to grant him a permit
and nipped the scheme in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   Moran was outraged. ``It's a sad day for American capitalism
when a man can't fly a midget on a kite over Central Park,'' he
declared.

<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The crowd in the small, overheated hotel
meeting room sighed when Douglas Stewart described a meeting on
year 2000 computer problems that he had helped organize in Santa
Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chamber of Commerce invited 1,100 small businesses, but
only 30 people showed up,'' said Stewart, 67, who works as a
management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   They listened sympathetically as Lesleigh Lippitt reported the
recent demise of a year 2000 forum that had been meeting on
Thursday nights since March in a suburban Milwaukee cafe. ``No one
is coming anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was shocked to hear about the collapse of an effort to
promote year 2000 preparedness neighborhood by neighborhood in
Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready for people not to listen, but I wasn't ready for
my fellow workers to go south on me,'' said Alan Jones, describing
how backers of the effort seemed to evaporate this past summer as
he tried to organize it.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for the thinning ranks of grass-roots
activists trying to convince Americans and their local leaders that
the year 2000 computer problem, better known as Y2K, poses risks
that demand serious family and community preparations. So tough
that about 40 of them from around the country decided to take time
out at a three-day weekend gathering here last week for some
face-to-face commiseration, planning and emotional refueling with
their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we leave here a little less depressed, a little
energized,'' said Paloma O'Riley, one of the meeting's organizers,
in welcoming the group. ``Mostly I want us to feel a little less
isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals might seem modest but they were readily embraced by
the group, which included many who talked privately during meals of
finances and personal relationships severely strained by their
commitment. There was conversation about retirement accounts cashed
in and second mortgages to cover expenses that resulted from a
complete loss of income for those who left jobs to work full time
on year 2000 issues, to thousands of dollars spent on books and
preparedness items passed out to fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering came amid a steady diet of upbeat progress reports
on year 2000 repairs and contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
   Though the American Red Cross has recommended that households
equip themselves as they would for a major storm or earthquake,
banks and other industry groups have begun telling customers to
think of the long New Year's weekend as just that, a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they are advising us not to run out of beer and
chips,'' Steven Davis, a prominent year 2000 consultant to local
governments in the Washington area, complained earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, the attendees had for the most part existed
for each other only as e-mail correspondents or names in news
clips. Jim Brown, the police chief of Hudson, Ohio, is often quoted
in news articles because he has been among the most outspoken
members of his profession on the need for preparations. When he
introduced himself, there was applause. One woman burst out
happily, ``Oh, it's you!''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was thrown together on a shoestring. Boulder seemed
a natural rendezvous site because it has been a hotbed of year 2000
preparedness advocacy _ and as one organizer, Kathy Garcia, head of
a Boulder County year 2000 group, noted, it is often described as
``27 square miles surrounded by reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Public advocacy has always been a job for industrial-strength
citizens, as many of those who attended the meeting knew well from
work on other causes dating to the 1960s _ though perhaps none,
like this one, with a built-in deadline. Some came looking to close
this chapter of their lives. Dan E. Strimer, a songwriter,
carpenter and coffeehouse worker who helped found a grass-roots
year 2000 preparedness group in Nashville, said he planned to focus
on getting his new organic farming venture going in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put your soul into Y2K and you don't necessarily get
anything back,'' said Strimer, who added that he would be plunging
back into year 2000 work if the rollover to next year brings
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But most were looking for reasons to continue the fight against
what they see as mainstream complacency on one side and
survivalist, head-for-the-hills lunacy on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mostly concerned about people who don't have the money to
stockpile,'' said Carl Johnson, a Bloomfield, N.J., high school
math teacher who founded the grandly named Essex County Coalition
2000 last spring but has little to show for months of networking
efforts to various community groups.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an airing of frustrations, the weekend included
opportunities for sharing high points and ideas that seemed to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, for example, had been able to write a monthly year 2000
column in his local newspaper in El Dorado, N.M., a town 10 miles
south of Santa Fe. Stewart said the heightened awareness that he
and concerned neighbors generated had led to a number of
preparedness steps that had once seemed unlikely, including a
decision by a local bank to install a backup generator to make sure
it could operate during a power failure.
</P>
<P>
   Others spoke of neighbors who seemed to ignore the information
they passed out and invitations to meetings on year 2000
preparedness, only to thank them months later. Frequently,
strategies that had worked in one area were reported to have run
into stone walls in other communities. The Santa Fe Community
Foundation proved to be helpful in reaching out to nonprofit groups
in New Mexico, but Boulder advocates struck out when trying to
persuade the United Way to take on that job in their town.
</P>
<P>
   Some attendees reported strong support from emergency management
officials in their communities, while others said they had been
brushed off as crazy amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird what works and what doesn't,'' said Rosa
Zubizarreta, a translator and veteran of anti-nuclear and bilingual
education battles. She received a modest grant this year from the
Center for Y2K and Society that allowed her to work full time on
year 2000 preparedness in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts at mutual support were not relentlessly earnest.
Saturday night appeared on the agenda as ``Fun, Fun, Fun.'' Ms.
O'Riley passed out silly hats and year 2000 door prizes, after
which the Nashville duo of Strimer and Nell Levin led the group
through a series of parody songs with lyrics by Stewart. The Notre
Dame fight song, for example, became five verses beginning with:
</P>
<P>
   Three cheers for Olde Y2K,
</P>
<P>
   Stock up on Twinkies without delay,
</P>
<P>
   Get some water and firewood too,
</P>
<P>
   We'll spend a fortune before we are through.
</P>
<P>
   Later the group turned out the lights, created an indoor
alternative to a campfire with flashlights, and shared year 2000
horror stories.

CLINTON RETREATS FROM PLAN TO INVEST RETIREMENT FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton dropped one of the most
contentious elements of his plan for bolstering Social Security's
finances on Saturday and called on Congress to break the partisan
deadlock over how to prepare the retirement system for the aging of
the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he would send Congress
legislation based on a proposal he first floated earlier this year
to shore up Social Security with projected federal budget
surpluses. But the new version will not include Clinton's
long-standing call for the government to invest some Social
Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve more than confusion, double talk
and delay on this issue,'' Clinton said. ``So it's time to have a
clear, straightforward bill on the table, and next week I plan to
present one _ legislation that insures that all Social Security
payroll tax will go to savings and debt reduction for Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is now taking in more than $100 billion a year
above what it is paying to retirees, but as the baby boomers
retire, payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of his desire for bipartisan cooperation, White
House officials said Clinton was withdrawing for now his plan to
seek higher returns for the system by having the government invest
as much as 15 percent of Social Security's reserves in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had rejected the idea of the government's investing
in equities, saying it would amount to federal ownership of private
industry. Most Republicans have rallied instead around alternatives
under which people would be able to invest part of their Social
Security payroll taxes on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans are sure to welcome Clinton's concession,
they long ago dismissed the rest of the president's basic approach,
which is built around reducing the national debt and then capturing
some of the interest savings on the retirement system's behalf.
Republicans have often said Clinton's underlying plan is nothing
more than an accounting shell game that fails to address the
fundamental mismatch between promised benefits and the revenues to
pay them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said its plan would extend Social Security's
solvency from 2034, when under current projections it would be able
to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits, to 2050, beyond the
life span of most of the 76 million Americans born in the 18 years
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is present what we feel is the most
solid, bipartisan, hopefully uncontroversial proposal to lock away
the Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, and use those
interest savings to extend the solvency of Social Security,'' said
Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement was in part a last-ditch effort to make
some progress this year on dealing with Social Security, which has
more than lived up to its reputation as the most politically and
ideologically charged of issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clearly also an effort to put the White House back on
the offensive after several weeks in which Republicans in Congress
have used Social Security to attack Democratic spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences, rallies on Capitol Hill and television
commercials in the districts of 10 House Democrats, the Republicans
have made a case that Democrats want to spend so much money on
government programs that they are raiding Social Security's
reserves to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties routinely agreed for decades to spend excess Social
Security payroll tax revenues on general government operations. But
this year the two parties have pledged to balance the budget
without using any of the Social Security money, and they have been
trading bitter accusations in the last few weeks about the
inability of the other to show how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has been less about Social Security itself _ the
retirement system's long-term health is only indirectly connected
to whether some of its excess revenues are spent on other programs
in a given year _ than about exploiting an issue that both sides
believe can play to their benefit in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of both parties have come up with a variety of
approaches to dealing with Social Security's underlying problems,
none of the plans has enough support to have been given serious
legislative consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said Clinton's plan was intended to be a start on the
broader goal of insuring Social Security's viability for at least
75 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get this significant down payment now, we will
have done something historic and important in the time remaining,
and we could still come back next year, or in the future, to get
the rest of Social Security reform,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is based on the idea that by using the Social
Security surplus to pay down the national debt in coming years, the
government's interest bill will decline substantially.
</P>
<P>
   By the White House's estimate, the government's interest expense
will be $107 billion lower in 2011 than it would be if the Social
Security surplus were not used, starting this year, to reduce the
debt. Clinton's proposal would take the money saved because of the
lower amount of debt, starting in 2011, and earmark it to shore up
Social Security's finances.
</P>
<P>
   From 2011 through 2015, the total savings in interest dedicated
to Social Security would be $544 billion, Sperling said, and
savings would continue accruing beyond 2015 at around $189 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The savings would at first go to further reductions in the
national debt. After the debt was paid off _ around 2015 under the
White House's current scenario _ the savings would continue to be
transferred to Social Security in the form of a government IOU that
would later be redeemed to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the plan would still require that the
government eventually pay Social Security benefits using general
revenues. In that way, they said, Clinton's plan would merely defer
tough choices about raising taxes, cutting benefits or again
increasing government borrowing.

AFTEREFFECTS OF SHOOTINGS STILL CLAIM CASUALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also VIOLENT-STUDENTS) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The shooting stopped last April when the two Columbine
High School students finally turned their guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the devastation that left 12 other students and a teacher
dead in Littleton, Colo., continues to claim victims, and when the
mother of a student injured by the gunfire shot and killed herself
on Friday, she simply became the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in mass tragedy say that often the aftereffects of
killings can endure for months, even years, as relatives and
friends of the victims struggle to absorb their losses and define a
new sense of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we often see after a mass tragedy is higher
divorce rate, an increase in alcohol and drug use, and more car
accidents, all because of the trauma people suffered,'' said Krista
R. Flannigan, a victims services consultant in Idaho Springs,
Colo., who works with many of the families of students who were
killed or injured in the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the mother, Carla June Hochhalter, 48, walked into a
pawn shop in Englewood on Friday and asked to see a revolver,
friends saw disturbing signs and wondered how deeply she had been
affected by the shootings. Mrs. Hochhalter's daughter, Anne Marie,
a Columbine senior, was shot in the chest and back in the rampage
on April 20. She is paralyzed from the waist down. As one of the
most severely injured of 23 people who survived bullet wounds, she
spent four months in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Only this month, Anne Marie regained some movement in her legs
and, along with her parents and brother, Nathan, a student at
Columbine, moved into a house that volunteers renovated to
accommodate her wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Michalik, the mother of another Columbine student who was
shot, said of Mrs. Hochhalter Saturday: ``Six months of being
heartbroken just got to her.'' Mrs. Michalik's son, Richard
Castaldo, is confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Michalik became a close friend of Mrs. Hochhalter and her
husband, Ted, an emergency management specialist with the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation, after the shootings. But she said she always
found it easier to engage Hochhalter in conversation than his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I met her, she was distraught,'' said Mrs.
Michalik, who considers parents as the second victims of the
shootings. ``We were all basket cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see her as any different from any of us, all upset
mothers,'' she said. ``But she never got to a point past that, and
moving was very traumatic for her. It was too much at once, and I
think she was just worn out and couldn't take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hochhalter entered the pawn shop around the same time that
Anne Marie and her father were visiting Leawood Elementary School,
several blocks from Columbine, to thank students who had raised
money for her rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Mrs. Hochhalter asked to look at handguns
and then pointed to a .38-caliber revolver in a glass case and said
she wanted to buy it. As the clerk turned to begin the paperwork,
the police said, Mrs. Hochhalter apparently loaded the gun with two
bullets she had carried into the shop. She shot once into a wall
and then pointed the gun at her head and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hochhalter's death came three days after a 17-year-old
Columbine student was arrested after classmates reported to school
officials that he had been threatening to ``finish the job''
started on April 20 by the two shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold. The student, who was not identified by the authorities
because of his age, was being held Saturday on a $500,000 bond.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months, officials have grappled with other issues that
reflect the enduring anguish of the shootings. The family of one
victim, Isaiah Shoels, is suing the families of the shooters. More
than a dozen families have notified the school district and
Jefferson County that they intend to sue them over tactics used by
the police on the day of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   And some families have even squabbled over how to memorialize
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an extremely trying time,'' said Rick J. Kaufman, a
spokesman for Jefferson County schools. ``It's important that we
focus on getting back to normal again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Flannigan, the consultant, said the concept of
``normal'' had forever changed for the families of the victims
because of how the shootings have affected their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to prepare ourselves,'' she said. ``The trauma is not
over. We will continue to see traumatic responses, and no one knows
how long it will be until they end.''

BARBER THINKS HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THE BIG PLAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tiki Barber remembers turning to look for the pass,
his back to the defense, and thinking: catch it and get out of
bounds. There were 27 seconds left in a tie game. The Giants were
on their own 41-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Barber grabbed the ball and turned for the sideline. Out of the
corner of his eye, he saw an opening. It wasn't the biggest
opening. He would have to instantaneously split two defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still thinking: `Out of bounds, stop the clock,'''
Barber said last week, recounting what became the pivotal play in
the Giants' upset of the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night. ``But
there was a way to get past those guys if I could just get there
fast enough. It flashed into my head: `There really is no other way
we'll go 60 yards in 20 seconds. I'm going. I'm going, right
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barber turned up field, knowing better than anyone the risk he
was taking. He was about to call on a player not seen inside the
Giants' jersey No. 21 since 1997. That Tiki Barber of two years ago
routinely made chancy dashes, running headlong into an
over-pursuing gang of defenders _ shooting the rapids, the players
call it _ and coming out the other side unharmed. He looked
swifter, smoother, shiftier.
</P>
<P>
   But one day the rapids jumped up and bit him. Barber hurt his
knee. He recovered but he did not look the same. He did not feel
the same. Worst of all, he did not think about himself the way he
once did. It was as if the brace on his right knee smothered the
creativity once so evident.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, nothing seemed to work the way it once did. People
in the pro football community started to say that the darting,
flashy Tiki Barber of 1997 was gone forever, the victim of an
incurable bum knee.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a Monday night against Dallas almost exactly a year
ago that Barber had turned to catch four passes and dropped each
one. Now, a season later, he had not only caught the ball, he was
going to find out just who was inside his jersey, inside his
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Which Tiki Barber would make this burst up field?
</P>
<P>
   He sliced between the defenders, ran away from another, broke
outside to the sideline, alone but for his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this,'' he said he thought at the time. ``We're
going to win. I've just won this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber was knocked out at the 3-yard line by the fastest man on
the field, Deion Sanders. Seconds later the Giants won the game,
13-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans came up to me on the street last year and said, `I'm
scared to death whenever you get the ball,''' Barber said in an
interview from his Manhattan home last week. ``Stuff like that
hurts. I know it's just the way some fans can be. But it makes you
realize nobody's going to help you get back to where you were
except yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game, which also included an 85-yard punt return
for a touchdown, does not make Barber's 1999 season the year to
erase all of Barber's 1998 failings. He's still just the third-down
back and the punt returner, a small piece of a stumbling Giants
offense. But there is something devilish about how Barber has gone
about this season. Privately, he has predicted how it would unfold
for him step by step. He said he would have a quiet training camp,
and he did, albeit with flashes of brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago, as the Giants prepared to open their season
with the rookie Sean Bennett as the new starter at running back,
Barber watched the hub-bub enveloping Bennett from his locker a few
feet away and said: ``That was me two years ago. Now I'm going
right under everybody's radar. I don't mind. Because I'll tell you,
this team is going to need me. I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of those comments this week, Barber nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew people felt I had become expendable,'' he said. ``We
had two, quote-unquote, hot-shot draft picks. I thought, `OK, we'll
see.' I knew what I had done to get better and I knew I would
surprise everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What Barber had done was strengthened the muscles around his
damaged right knee. He had lost weight, weight he had gained
intentionally on the foolish notion he needed it to be more durable
in the National Football League; in fact, he said, all it did was
slow him down. He worked out ceaselessly.
</P>
<P>
   When he got married this spring and honeymooned in Europe, he
called ahead to arrange high-tech workouts at gyms in various
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was really angry and hurt,'' Giants safety Percy
Ellsworth, a former teammate of Barber's at the University of
Virginia, said. ``He worked out this off season like someone trying
to fix an injustice. He's a soft-spoken, intelligent guy, but don't
let him fool you. He's got a tough, hard streak.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also got something up his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Monday's game to be the highlight of my season,''
Barber said. ``I've got 10, hopefully more, games left.''

U.S. MEDIATOR EXTENDS EFFORT TO RESCUE ULSTER ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ George Mitchell, the former U.S.
senator turned mediator, extended his attempt to rescue the
faltering Northern Ireland peace agreement past its expected end
Saturday night, saying more time was needed ``in view of the
gravity of what is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after daylong talks with Ulster's feuding
politicians, Mitchell warned that ``there should be no false
optimism _ significant differences remain.'' But he said
conversations in the last few days of his formal review, now seven
weeks old, had persuaded him that ``the parties are making a
sincere and serious effort to bridge those differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the new British secretary for Northern Ireland,
said the exchanges between the rival politicians had become more
promising. ``They trust each other more now than they have
before,'' he told reporters outside the Stormont Castle Buildings,
scene of the talks. ``The politicians are talking more seriously
and in a more mature way than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The main difference that continues to deadlock progress in
putting into place the April 1998 peace accord centers on the
refusal of the province's largest party, the Ulster Unionists, to
permit Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish Republican Army,
into government without a beginning to IRA disarmament. Sinn Fein
argues that no such condition was included in the agreement and
that it cannot compel the paramilitaries to turn over weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has resisted increasing calls to signal its willingness
to disarm or to declare an end to its war, including one this week
in a long editorial in the Dublin-based Irish Times. At the same
time, many Ulster Unionists have toughened their stance on the
issue, warning their leader, David Trimble, not to give any ground.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust and polarization had appeared to be deepening in the
last week, producing gloom where 18 months before there had been
euphoria and provoking pessimistic statements about the outlook for
any success in Mitchell's review.
</P>
<P>
   All the parties fear being identified as the cause of the
breakdown of an arrangement that has rid Ulster of most political
violence for more than two years, after three decades in which more
than 3,300 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was the chairman of the original talks and began the
current review on Sept. 6 at the request of the British and Irish
prime ministers. He returned to the United States overnight but
said he would be back on Wednesday for a final push.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trimble has been under pressure from dissident members of his
party not to compromise the position known in Unionist shorthand as
``no guns, no government.'' Two former allies, John Taylor, the
party's deputy leader, and Jeffrey Donaldson, a member of the
British Parliament with designs on the party leadership, have both
withdrawn their support for the peace agreement and faulted Trimble
for pressing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Trimble struck back in a feisty signed article in
the Belfast News Letter. ``At every stage in the process,'' he
said, ``there has been no shortage of advice from prima donna
Unionists about the dangers and pitfalls of taking risks or of
negotiating with our opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, who are largely Protestants, are so called because
they believe in keeping Ulster as part of the United Kingdom, while
Republicans, most of whom are Catholics, want to see Northern
Ireland ultimately become part of the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble cited no names, saying simply, ``Certain elements within
the Unionist family do not know how to cope with change.'' He added
that ``presently Sinn Fein refuse to accept that they need to
change.'' The likening of Unionist behavior to that of Republicans
is something unfamiliar in the politics of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also reflected one of the intriguing products of
the drawn-out talks _ the association between Trimble and Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Until this past year, the
Protestant leader would not speak directly to Adams, but they now
regularly hold meetings and on Friday night they dined together
with Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly difficult session on Sept. 21, Adams
emerged to say with irritation that the Ulster Unionists must start
accepting the fact that Sinn Fein is their ``best bet'' for
achieving political compromise with Republicans. And Republicans,
he added notably, must recognize that Trimble is theirs.

TITLED ITALIAN BUYS PROMINENT LONG ISLAND WINERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore.)  (mk) 
 By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hargrave Vineyard, perhaps New York state's most
famous winery and the one that gave birth to the 26-year-old Long
Island wine industry, has been sold to a titled Italian citizen and
his American wife.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, Marco Borghese, a prince, and Ann Marie
Borghese, who have no previous experience in the wine business,
acquired the 80-acre estate, in Cutchogue, on Friday. Borghese said
the sale price was ``in the neighborhood of $4 million.''
</P>
<P>
   That figure tops all the others in a burst of sales this year.
Since January, the turnovers of three Long Island wine estates _
Corey Creek for $1.5 million and Laurel Lake and Peconic Bay for $2
million each _ and bids on another have drawn the international
wine world's attention to the Suffolk County industry's potential
for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Lake was acquired by a consortium of Chilean investors;
New Yorkers bought the other two. The sales have driven up the
prices for a dwindling supply of open farmland, real estate sources
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island industry is also being expanded by major
enterprises like the new Martha Clara Vineyards, owned by the
former bakery owner Robert Entenmann. He plans to break ground for
a $4 million, 25,000-square-foot tasting room in Mattituck next
spring, to be followed by a $2 million or $3 million winery.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Alexander, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., and is the
owner of the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets,
also plans to build a winery. This summer he bought farms totaling
86 acres, in Cutchogue and Mattituck, for a reported $1,481,500,
and said that he expected to close soon on a third, a 68-acre farm
in Mattituck.
</P>
<P>
   Borghese, interviewed Saturday in Manhattan, said that he
planned to triple production, which has ranged from 6,000 to 11,000
cases of wine a year; to create a local and national sales force,
and to expand sales beyond New York state, probably first into New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   He said the first new grapes to be planted would be nebbiolo,
the grape used in Piedmont, Italy, to make Barolo and Barbaresco,
and sangiovese, the primary Tuscan grape used in Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   The Borgheses plan to overhaul the public areas, including the
tasting-and-sales room and a baronial dining room, and to bring
some winemaking equipment from the cellars into a huge barrel room
that is visible to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners have no experience in the wine business and are
undertaking on-the-job training not only in grape growing and
cellar work but also in marketing and sales. They said they bought
the property to enter a new business and create a new lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   They won't lack for winegrowing advisers. ``I think I have
access to anybody in Italy,'' Borghese said with a laugh. ``Members
of my family are already scouting.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisa Hargrave said that she and her husband, Alex, would
remain as consultants for two years and that the winery staff was
expected to stay in place during and after the transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Borgheses inherit the 1999 vintage. The harvest and
processing of the grapes were finished in the last two weeks.
Although the new company that owns the property is called Castello
di Borghese LLC, the Borgheses said they expected to retain the
Hargrave Vineyard name at the property.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw in this deal is going back to my roots,'' Borghese
said. They include a boyhood on a family estate of thousands of
acres in Scarperia, near Florence. The family moved to Rome when he
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   His Roman family traces to 12th-century Siena. It produced a
pope, Paul V, cardinals and a number of prominent citizens. The
Borgheses were famed as patrons of the arts and letters. Cardinal
Scipione Borghese built the Villa Borghese gardens in Rome, and the
family home, in the gardens, had been a palace and is now a museum,
the Galleria Borghese.
</P>
<P>
   The Hargraves put the property up for sale in the spring of 1998
at a $3.3 million asking price. Negotiations with the Borgheses
began last April.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alex and Louisa Hargrave founded the East End's first modern
wine estate, on Route 48, in 1973 when they planted European wine
grapes in what had been potato fields. Their red and white wines
have always reflected their Francophile leanings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as a consequence of their early gamble, the North and
South Forks of Long Island are home to 25 producers, with 2,786
acres of vines owned or leased by them and small-scale grape
growers. In 1998, 221,000 cases of wine were made, and this year
the industry has projected about 255,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Hargraves' influence, wine experts say, has extended to the
entire Northeast. By planting vinifera grapes like cabernet
sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay, they say, the Hargraves gave
heart, in a risky business, to winegrowers who had tied their
futures to safer but commercially unpromising French-American
hybrid grapes like Seyval blanc and baco noir, and to old
indigenous varieties like Concord and Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Borgheses live in Philadelphia. Borghese sold his interest
in a luxury leather goods company early this year. Mrs. Borghese
sells luxury jewelry to private customers. The new owners, who have
three children and expect to move to the estate in the next few
days, acquired 80 acres, 20 of them planted by the Hargraves and 35
more used under contract with other owners, as well as the winery,
its tasting room and the Hargraves' house in the rear of the
sprawling property.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Hargraves' choice of new owners may seem surprising to their
colleagues, because many had surmised that the estate would be
turned over to experienced professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone European,'' Mrs. Hargrave said.
``I've said that Long Island needs a European investor. It
validates us all.'' Other Long Island producers, as well as
vintners in New York's two other major winegrowing areas, the
Finger Lakes and the Hudson Valley, have often expressed hope for
foreign investment because of the confidence it implies in the
future of the state's sizable wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Their model is California, which has long been awash in European
investment, and, to a smaller degree, Oregon, whose wine industry,
which specializes in pinot noir, was given a boost when the
Burgundian producer Robert Drouhin founded Domaine Drouhin there in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Italian surnames now occupy an even larger niche than before in
Long Island's wine industry: Gristina, Macari, Pellegrini and
Pugliese, along with John Petrocelli, who is building the $6.1
million Raphael, a merlot-oriented winery in Peconic.

 REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio: Vita said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   School officials here expressed confidence that the
confidentiality of student records required by law would not be
breached by Mosaic. They emphasized that the software would not be
connected to any central data program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds OK, so long as you don't wind up labeling kids,''
said Shelly Darby, who works at the Sun Tang Luck restaurant and is
the mother of a second-grader here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of scary stuff out there,'' Ms. Darby said. ``But
there can be a real fine line between a kid out to get attention
and a really troubled kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She drew an empathetic nod from Aron Ross, the assistant
superintendent of schools in Reynoldsburg, a city of 35,000 just
east of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few dramatic, sad incidents have spawned hysteria,'' he
explained, describing a nightmarish week of baseless rumors and
countless alarms that caused midnight checks on school lockers
after the Columbine killings. And through repeated meetings with
anxious parents, Ross said, the question remains: What else can we
do so it doesn't happen here?
</P>
<P>
   ``School people in my situation must respond to this new reality
directly,'' he said. ``It used to be a platitude, but no longer,
about creating an environment where students and teachers are safe
and feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The de Becker company describes itself as a specialist in
high-stakes assessments. On its Internet site (www.gdbinc.com), the
company has posted a detailed series of explanations and
reassurances about the school software. ``School administrators
would use Mosaic-2000,'' the company asserts, ``only in situations
that reach a certain threshold (e.g., a student makes a threat,
brings a weapon to school, teachers or students are concerned a
student might act out violently).''
</P>
<P>
   The system ``merely brings organization and expert opinion to a
process every principal already has,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not determined the overall cost of the program,
but Ms. Montgomery, the attorney general, described it as ``very
affordable'' at less than $10,000 for the high school.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic systems are ``very well thought out and valuable
tools,'' said James Perrotti, chief of police at Yale University,
which for five years has used the Mosaic-2 program to assess
threats received by professors and students.
</P>
<P>
   Perrotti, one of the experts helping to shape the Mosaic-2000
questions, said the system had offered effective warning about
potentially violent situations that were nipped in the bud. ``It's
not a real predictor but it's the next best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita, the federal firearms official, says school officials need
Mosaic and other tools to deal with an ever more complex threat in
which relatively good students with access to guns may erupt
because they feel victimized by bullies or by the school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the hard ones for the school administrators to
identify,'' Vita said. ``It's easy to pick out the gang members
with tattoos. It's these other people that kind of surprise
administrators, and these are the ones they really need to
identify.''

 WASHINGTON: his campaign. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it is the preponderance of New York banking and brokerage
firms at the top of Bradley's donor list that sets him apart from
the other leading candidates for the presidency. Only two Wall
Street firms are in Gore's and McCain's top 10 lists of
contributors; only one makes Gov. George W. Bush's list of 10
biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm to make the top 10 list for all four candidates is
Goldman, Sachs, whose partners and their families have contributed
$22,455 to McCain, $60,250 to Gore, $77,250 to Bush _ and $210,000
to Bradley. Bradley's success is even more notable because
Goldman's former chairman, Robert Rubin, was chairman of the
National Economic Council and treasury secretary in the Clinton
administration. Rubin is so far sitting out the 2000 presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's familiarity with top bankers, brokers and bond traders
grew from his 18 years of service on the Senate Finance Committee.
He was one of the primary authors of the landmark 1986 tax bill and
the architect of a plan to address the Third World debt crisis in
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bradley's opponents cannot point to anything specific
in his Senate career that would account for Wall Street's loyalty
and generosity. He proposed an increase in the capital gains tax,
advocated abolition of a variety of tax shelters and urged banks to
take substantial losses on their loans to struggling economies _
all positions that at times put him at odds with financial
executives.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for Bradley's popularity on Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   Partly it is geography: Bradley attended Princeton University in
New Jersey, represented New Jersey in the Senate and still lives in
northern New Jersey. Partly it is familiarity with the people and
the lingo of Wall Street _ J.P. Morgan hired him consultant within
weeks of his leaving the Senate in 1997. Partly it is his position
as the only Democratic alternative to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And he also helped to give New York something no other area
politician has ever delivered: two NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't any of the policies that make him popular,'' said
Mark Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association.
``Part of it is he was a Knick, and a very successful one at that.
A lot of the Street are sports fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used the two years between retiring from the Senate and
establishing his presidential committee late last year to lay the
political and financial groundwork for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work at J.P. Morgan, Bradley signed on as a
consultant with the Gartner Group, a telecommunications research
firm in Stamford, Conn. The company paid Bradley $131,000 in 1998,
according to the personal financial disclosure statement he
released this year.
</P>
<P>
   He took part-time appointments at the University of Maryland,
Notre Dame University and Stanford, earning $170,000 last year for
a handful of lectures at each school.
</P>
<P>
   He gave more than 60 speeches _ at an average of $25,000 each _
to a variety of corporations, law firms and interest groups. Among
them were Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a pharmaceutical company; Health
Care Information and Management Systems Society; the National Home
Equity Mortgage Association; the Association of Investment
Management Sales Executives; Key Bank; Barclays Global Investors;
the American Association of Health Plans, and First Union Capital
Markets.
</P>
<P>
   So last winter when he announced his intention to seek the
Democratic nomination for president, he had not only a rich list of
potential donors from three successful Senate campaigns, but a new
cache of contacts from his two years out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his proven ability to raise money and win elections,
Bradley seems to have benefited from disaffection among some
Democratic Party donors with Clinton and his chosen heir, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the initial interest in Bradley is the result of
Clinton-Gore fatigue,'' said Bonnie Reiss, a top New York
fund-raiser for Bradley and a member of his advisory board, ``a
feeling that they need to wash their hands of the whole
administration.''

 UNDATED: are finished.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To iron out wrinkles in wealthy households, Mrs. Starkey
preaches professional management and personal boundaries. Her
students are taught to trim their nose hairs, wax their eyebrows,
use a yardstick to space plates at the dinner table and always call
their employers by their surnames and use the proper courtesy
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starkey also drills her clients. During home inspections,
she advises prospective employers to tell their household managers
many details about their personal lives, from how they like their
coffee in the morning, to favorite television shows, to which child
is related to which ex-spouse. Mrs. Starkey repeatedly alerts
clients to the insidious dangers of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have chosen the profession of service,'' Mrs. Starkey told
Ms. Meyers and seven other aspiring household managers at the
Starkey Institute. ``You are about to be propelled into a world
many of us never see, a world of plenty, of power and of
indulgence. Remember, you are going to be paid as a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning course in ``boundaries'' at the Starkey Institute
raised these sticky questions: What if the lady of the house asks
the household manager for help in adhering to a strict low-fat
diet? And what if the household manager, while working in her
employer's bedroom, finds an empty container of double-chocolate
ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it in the trash and keep it to yourself,'' said Jenny
Hookey, a former household manager for Michigan Gov. John Engler
and an instructor at the school. ``You are not supposed to be your
employer's conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hookey rose from her chair in a basement classroom of the
mansion-cum-school and wrote these initials on the blackboard:
YBYJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet your job if you cross a boundary,'' Mrs. Hookey said,
explaining what is perhaps the most dismal fact of life in the
service trade. Servants have almost no job security. If an employer
does not like your look, your attitude or your work, you are out,
no matter how well trained or highly paid you may be.
</P>
<P>
   In a class on ``personal style,'' taught by Mrs. Starkey,
students were asked to describe the character of the wealthy people
for whom they hope to work. The class volunteered these words:
selfish, intelligent, aggressive, rushed, motivated, stuck-up,
philanthropic and judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   Why would you want to work for people like that? Mrs. Starkey
asked her class.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, gleaned from separate interviews with all eight
students in the class, seems to be as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Those who aspire to the butler trade are middle-aged people in
post-marriage, post-child-bearing phases of their lives. Ms. Meyers
was the exception, and she has been advised to compensate for her
relative youth. A beautician who consults for the Starkey Institute
told her: Trim the blond, highlighted hair. Lose the showy
earrings. Lay off the dark red lip-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students said they enjoyed taking care of expensive
things. Many have worked for restaurants or in catering, luxury
sales or property management. They are intrigued by the idea of
working for a very rich family with many houses and jetting around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   One student, Chief Petty Officer Samuel Sutton, 39, has worked
for several generals and admirals in Washington as a chef and a
senior household manager, and he was hoping to go to work soon in
the White House. He said he went to the Starkey Institute to polish
his skills and prepare for 2003, when he will leave the Navy and
look for a household manager job that will double his military pay
of about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical student was Ingrid Lawrence, 56, who is divorced
with no children. In ``personal image awareness'' class, Ms.
Lawrence, a tall German-born woman with ramrod posture and an
expensive but understated wardrobe, was judged to have a near
perfect look for service: tasteful, elegant and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of fussy,'' said Ms. Lawrence, who recently quit her
job at Neiman Marcus in San Diego, where she sold china, crystal
and silver. ``I love housework. I love to be surrounded by
beautiful things. It will give me pleasure to take care of these
beautiful things in a private house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lawrence explained that in her own house in San Diego, she
used only fresh linen napkins, never paper. She kept her linen damp
in plastic bags in her refrigerator, she said, so that she could
iron it as needed, obtaining the crispest and most wrinkle-free
napkins possible.
</P>
<P>
   In ironing class at the Starkey Institute, when a teacher
mentioned the linen-in-the-refrigerator trick, Ms. Lawrence smiled
knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a grueling 12-hour day at the Starkey mansion, all
the students gathered in the basement over dinner to watch ``The
Remains of the Day,'' the 1993 film in which Anthony Hopkins plays
an emotionally remote English butler.
</P>
<P>
   The butler, Stevens, resolutely refuses throughout the film to
judge the character of his employer, Lord Darlington, even as he
makes a national fool of himself by appeasing the Nazis in the days
before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the film, the butler is asked how he could
endure working for such a despicable man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his butler,'' Stevens replies. ``I was there to serve
him, not to agree or disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the students laughed during parts of the film,
especially when servants ironed The Times of London, it struck most
of them as profoundly sad.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in class, however, Mrs. Starkey said that Stevens
had had it exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start judging your employers,'' she said, ``your days
are numbered.''

 BUENOS AIRES, Argentina: of gunfire.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duhalde sought to revive his campaign at a mass rally in the
Plaza de Mayo last Sunday by playing the populist card again. He
implicitly lashed out at the International Monetary Fund, which is
currently pressing Argentina for budget cuts in exchange for an aid
package that could reach $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people say enough to the adjustments, enough to the
tightening of the belt,'' Duhalde said. ``We're not against having
more rich people, we're against having more poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the event was upstaged by Menem, who remains titular leader
of the Justicialist Party and who wanted the Justicialist
nomination himself despite a constitutional ban against a third
consecutive term. Menem refused to attend the rally, choosing
instead to dine with several labor leaders in the resort of Mar del
Plata in a well-publicized planning session for a presidential run
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Menem aides leaked to the press last week that as soon as
Duhalde is defeated, ``Menem 2003'' posters will be plastered
across Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, senior Economy Ministry officials
have said it would be no tragedy if de la Rua won.
</P>
<P>
   To win the presidency on Sunday, a candidate needs at least 45
percent of the vote, or at least 10 percent more than the
second-place candidate. Otherwise, the top two candidates face a
runoff next month. The new president will be inaugurated Dec. 10. A
variety of recent polls suggest that de la Rua will not need a
second round to win.
</P>
<P>
   Economic issues have dominated the campaign, with the country in
its deepest recession of the decade and unemployment running near
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua has promised to improve the economy by increasing
investor confidence, thereby bringing down interest rates. His
approach is orthodox, promising to reduce a current government
deficit of $5 billion by at least $1.5 billion by cutting wasteful
spending and corruption and prosecuting tax cheaters. He promises
tax incentives for small and medium-size businesses to spur
employment.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will lower production costs to make Argentine
companies more competitive on world markets by deregulating public
services, which he argues will cause communications and energy
costs to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The most detailed economic plan has been offered by former
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, who has urged an across-the-board
cut in taxes and government regulations. With little campaign money
and a small organization, he is expected to come in third with
about 10 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in case Duhalde should make a last-minute comeback and force
a second-round runoff, Cavallo could become the kingmaker by giving
his support to one candidate or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde proposed his economic platform as a bill to Congress _
one that would reduce the value-added tax to 15 percent from 21
percent and give tax cuts to companies that did not lay off
workers. But he could not even mobilize enough members in his own
party to reach a quorum in the House of Deputies for the bill to be
debated. The program's failure in Congress only served to highlight
the divisions within the Justicialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Justicialist Party is roundly rejected, it will
continue to control the Senate until at least the 2001 elections.
It will also control most of the gubernatorial seats as well as the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of divided government has most analysts
predicting that de la Rua will not take Argentina in a sharply
different direction even if he does win the landslide victory
predicted by the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And with Menem leading the Justicialist Party at least for the
next several months, it is probable he will continue to have a say
in what happens in the presidential palace even after he clears his
desk.

 TEHRAN: 270-seat Parliament.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Khatami and his associates have long been beleaguered. Last
year, a popular Tehran mayor with close links to the president,
Gholam Hossein Karbaschi, was sentenced to five years in jail and a
lifetime ban from politics at a corruption trial that many Iranians
saw as a political vendetta. In June 1998, Nouri, then the interior
minister, was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote. In May
this year, the culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani, another
cleric, narrowly survived impeachment by parliamentary
conservatives angry at his failure to control pro-reform
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mohsen Kadivar, another dissident cleric, was
imprisoned on the clergy court's orders on charges of ``defaming
Islam,'' in part by writing a newspaper article in which he
compared the authoritarian society favored by the conservatives
with the rule of the shah.
</P>
<P>
   In July, police and vigilante gangs attacked University of
Tehran students protesting the closing of a pro-reform newspaper,
killing at least one and possibly three students, injuring scores
of others and ransacking a university dormitory. Dozens of
students, possibly hundreds, remain under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But for reformers, perhaps the most threatening conservative
move ahead of the parliamentary vote has been the threat to use
another powerful body, the Council of Guardians, to use a religious
test to disqualify large numbers of reform candidates. The council,
which has made sweeping use of the power in past elections,
recently vetoed a new law that would have curbed its power by
requiring it to give written reasons for rejecting candidates,
heightening reformers' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The battle over who can run in the parliamentary elections is
not likely to be settled before January, when nominations close.
Much may depend on the attitude of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
country's supreme religious leader, who has sweeping executive
powers that far exceed Khatami's. Earlier this month, Khamenei,
hitherto considered the conservatives' main standard-bearer,
stunned the country by calling Khatami a ``pious man'' and urging
conservatives not to block his efforts for ``the rebirth of
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranians were left to wonder whether Khamenei had had a change
of heart, or made the speech to allay reformers' concerns while
conservatives work through bodies like the clergy court, the press
court and the Guardians' Council to consolidate their power. The
indictment of Nouri, less than two weeks after Khamenei's speech,
has done little to encourage optimism that the religious leader was
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Mohajerani, the culture minister, has said he feared the worst
from the Nouri trial. ``I'm not optimistic,'' he said. Khatami
seemed to voice his own dismay when he spoke recently to a youth
gathering in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a world free of ``discrimination, despotism and
lies,'' he said there would always be people, in every society, who
would oppose change. ``Unfortunately, there are people who will
always want to protect their own power and wealth and privilege by
erecting barriers against others,'' he said.

 MOSCOW: 62 percent.  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Ruslan Shevdov, 27, is a case in point. He had appeared to catch
a lucky break when the small Moscow-based trading and agricultural
company he joined after leaving the food service division of the
Russian army offered to send him to the United States at its
expense to earn a degree in business administration and to perfect
his English.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted by Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., Shevdov had
hoped to begin his studies this fall. But his request for an F visa
was rejected three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I didn't fit the student profile,'' Shevdov said.
``Maybe they think I am too old. I tried to assure them that I plan
to return. My parents live here. This is the country where I grew
up. I can call my friend here at any time and he will come. How
would I live there?''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials said they would not discuss individual cases.
The six-member team that handles nonimmigrant visas at the Moscow
consulate makes hundreds of decisions like this, often on the basis
of a five- or 10-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looking for fraudulent applications, they try to divine
if a student or scholar has an unbreakable tie to the homeland that
will spur return. Interviews often amount to hurried discussions of
an applicant's marriage status, family life and assets, often
conducted by a junior Foreign Service officer.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of proof that a Russian has no plans to emigrate,
even legally, falls on the applicants. They may find it hard to
argue that what appear to an American to be meager rewards are
sufficient for a decent living in Russia. Shevdov, for instance,
earns about $900 a month, low by American standards, but a
respectable sum for a Muscovite.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have also had problems. Taras Ivchenko, a 34-year-old
assistant professor at Moscow University, is a specialist in
Chinese linguistics who graduated from Beijing University and wrote
his doctorate in Chinese. Encouraged by several American
professors, he wanted to visit the United States for several weeks
last summer to help translate a Ming dynasty manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 10-minute interview in May, Ivchenko was unable to
persuade the U.S. Embassy to grant him a tourist visa. He earns
$150 a month and has no substantial property. His wife, father and
sister live here, but that apparently was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ivchenko said the consular officer who interviewed him suggested
his chances for a visa would be better if he had children he could
leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of Soviet times,'' the soft-spoken Ivchenko
said in an interview. ``I would like to work on a project or two in
the United States, but I am not interested in emigrating there. I
belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   American academics report increasing problems in obtaining visas
for Russian students or faculty members. The University of
Pittsburgh had to campaign for one of its Russian graduate students
to complete a doctorate program after he returned home for the
funeral of his father.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Southern California fought hard to overturn
the denial of a visa for a promising student it had recruited for
its graduate program in Russian literature. The student was told
there was no point in studying in the United States since there was
plenty of Russian literature at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the universities do not always win. The University of
Maryland was recently left without a Russian instructor when the
candidate it picked was denied a visa.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Lekic, director of the university's graduate program in
Russian language, said the faculty had gone through a careful
selection process and had never experienced a problem with Russians
refusing to return home when their visas ran out.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Embassy concluded that the university salary the
Russian instructor was being offered was too appealing compared
with his modest pay at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the Soviets would not let people leave,'' she said.
``Now when Russia is opening up, we are behaving like Soviets.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials insist that they need to be vigilant
because there has been talk in Moscow of many Russians ``jumping
ship,'' and the black market price of forged visas has risen.
</P>
<P>
   But student applications for F visas between June and August
declined to 1,645 this year, compared with 2,181 in 1998. Embassy
officials also concede that there has never been a comprehensive
study to determine whether Russian students eventually return, or
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   The tough U.S. visa policies are driving Russian students to
other countries. ``We are really shooting ourselves in the foot,''
said Dennis Whelan, a Moscow-based lawyer who advises visa
applicants. ``We are simply ensuring that all the upper and middle
managers in Russia get their training in Europe so that they make
their primary business contacts with our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half a million tuition-paying foreign students were
enrolled in American institutions in the 1997-98 academic year.
They bring in money, as countries like Britain increasingly
recognize, loosening up visa regulations to attract foreign
students.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, Britain won in the case of Maria Ushakova, 17, the
daughter of a leading Russian businessman. Ms. Ushakova wants to
become a psychoanalyst and take over her mother's practice, but her
request for a visa to attend college in Pennsylvania was repeatedly
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, her family says, she was told there was no point
in studying in the United States since Russia did not have a
tradition of psychoanalysis and a foreign-trained specialist would
never find employment at home. Her father then obtained a letter
from a Russian clinic saying it would gladly hire his daughter once
she finished her training.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ushakova received a visa on her fourth try. By then,
however, she had missed the start of the school year in the United
States. Offended, her father said, by all the refusals and worried
that she might not be able to renew her visa to finish her
education in the United States, she is now studying in London.

PARCELLS TO START MIRER AGAIN, BUT FOR HOW LONG?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ For the ninth time in only 39 games, Bill
Parcells is changing quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The ball will be back in the hands of the bemused Rick Mirer
when the Jets play the Raiders on Sunday _ a week after it had
suddenly and unexpectedly been handed to Ray Lucas. Parcells had
turned to Lucas because he was looking for more of a spark than
Mirer had provided, and the strategy worked up to a point. But
Lucas was injured on the final play of a 16-13 loss to the
Indianapolis Colts, so Mirer is back as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is among five different players who have started at
quarterback in the two-and-a-half seasons of the Parcells era, but
only one seems to have got it right, and he is out for the season.
That, of course, is Vinny Testaverde. It has been a continuum from
Neil O'Donnell to Glenn Foley to Testaverde to Mirer to Lucas and
back to Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason to think Mirer can do anything different
this time around? In two of his previous four starts, the Jets
failed to get a touchdown. After Mirer's last start, a 16-6 loss to
the Jacksonville Jaguars in a Monday night game, Parcells
complained that Mirer was not going downfield enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer retorted that he was not supposed to go downfield, that
the idea when he became a Jet was to use the various weapons the
club had. Don't try to do everything yourself. ``It's what he told
Vinny when he came,'' Mirer said. But of course no two situations
are similar. Testaverde had Wayne Chrebet and an otherwise healthy
supporting cast _ offensively and defensively. Seven Jets starters
have missed at least one game, eight if you count Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer will have one advantage this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his previous starts, he can throw to Chrebet, who had
missed the first five games with a broken foot and is perhaps the
best third-down receiver in the game. Against the Jaguars, Mirer
did not complete a single third-down pass when Keyshawn Johnson and
Dedrick Ward were his primary targets.
</P>
<P>
   In Chrebet's first game back, last Sunday, Lucas connected with
him five times in the first half and overthrew him at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet's return gives Mirer nearly a full complement of the
Jets' top offensive players: Johnson and Chrebet as the starting
receivers, Ward as the third receiver, running back Curtis Martin,
Eric Green at tight end and Richie Anderson at F-back. The only
player missing is Leon Johnson, the change-of-pace runner, who is
out for the season with a torn knee.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer has lighted up neither the skies nor the scoreboard. He
has barely completed half his passes. His average pass attempt is
under six yards. He has been sacked once for every eight passes and
has tossed seven interceptions to three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But almost any quarterback on a losing team has miserable
numbers. What he should benefit from is in an area apart from the
obvious addition of Chrebet, or of Martin, who enjoyed his
strongest game of the season against Indianapolis with 128 yards
rushing. Mirer should also be helped because the Jets' special
teams are coming back to the dominating level they showed in
Parcells' first season two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because of John Hall's touchbacks as well as the kickoff
coverage, Jets opponents are backed up following kickoffs farther
than any team in the American Conference. Their opponents' average
drive begins on the 22-yard line. On the other side, the Jets have
become the third-best team in bringing the ball out, starting, on
average, past the 28.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets the ball in better field position, Mirer will not
have to open it up, even though he says, ``If that's what they want
me to do, I'll do it.''

BRAVES' GENERAL MANAGER CONTINUES TO MEET RISING EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Texas, Mass., Ga.)   (Eds: UPDATES Angels item with Stoneman meeting with Eisner and
Watson back in contention.) 
 (DW) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the age of 59, John Schuerholz is a dinosaur. His
colleagues represent an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tyrannosaurus rex, Schuerholz is not extinct, but he has
become a throwback to another age, a time when baseball general
managers could reasonably expect to hold on to their jobs as long
as they were not stealing money or their boss' wife. These days
general managers are jettisoned as easily as managers.
</P>
<P>
   Not Schuerholz. He recently celebrated his ninth anniversary as
general manager of the Atlanta Braves, matching his previous tenure
with the Kansas City Royals, a team he left voluntarily. For 18
years he has run major league organizations, signing players,
trading them, building championship teams. None of his peers has
done it as long or as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Schuerholz keeps watching his peers change. In
the past few months, five general managers, one-sixth of the major
league population, have been fired or resigned. Milwaukee and
Colorado have named new general managers; Anaheim, Baltimore and
Seattle still have vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a natural development,'' Schuerholz said of the
volatility of the job. ``With all of the money owners have invested
in these teams, there's a lot more at stake. They have expectations
that whoever is running it, they expect that person to be very
proficient and very effective and very productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners, he added, are not as willing to be patient as they once
were when the money involved was a fraction of what it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably comes with what's happening in the industry,'' he
said, ``how much more we're paying, how much more franchises cost,
how much more is invested in these enterprises. They expect us to
be better at what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased costs are not new, but the escalation of the increase
in costs has had an impact on owners' thinking and nerves. As
payrolls have risen dramatically, a select circle of teams has
emerged as perennial challengers for the World Series, the Braves
and the Yankees included.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a handful of us,'' Schuerholz said of some teams,
``who have been so good for so long and whose expectations are so
high internally and externally, that the bar has been set higher
for all of us in these organizations _ general manager, manager,
coaches, players. Expectations go higher and higher and higher.
More is expected of us. That is a fact. The bar is set higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar sometimes is set inordinately high, the dean of general
managers said. ``We should be congratulated on one hand for
building a team and an organization that so much is expected of,''
he said, ``but on the other hand, there should be a little
understanding about what the pressures are that come with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Schuerholz's stewardship, the Braves have never seen the
post-season take place without them. Ten general managers who have
been in their positions longer than a month have never seen their
team play in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   One general manager, Frank Wren, did not reach his first
anniversary on the job in Baltimore Saturday. If the Yankees do not
win the World Series, another, Brian Cashman, may not make it to
his second anniversary in February.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a fired manager seeks another chance and another and
another, once a general manager has general managed, the job gets
in his blood. How else explain the desire of Pat Gillick, 62 years
old, to get the Seattle Mariners' job that became vacant with the
departure of Woody Woodward, who had been the longest-serving
general manager with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick retired once, leaving the Toronto Blue Jays after the
1994 season, then was lured back into active duty a year later when
Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, offered him $750,000 a
year for three years. The end of that term could not come soon
enough for Gillick, but here he is back in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the people out there,'' he said of the Mariners.
``They're all good people. I get along real well with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillick has wavered in his desire to compete for the
Mariners' position. ``I had some interest,'' he said, ``but after I
thought about it for a while, I pulled out of it. Then I talked to
them again. So the thing is up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick acknowledged that he still has the ``itch'' to do the
job, though he said, ``It certainly has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some way,'' he added, ``as far as putting a team together
to win, I think you can do it more easily than before because of
free agency. Unfortunately, because of the economics of the game,
they're moving people around faster.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EXECUTIVE GRAPEVINE
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Bob Watson, former general manager of the Houston
Astros and the Yankees, seemed to be headed for the Anaheim Angels'
job, or so went the word along the baseball grapevine. Then during
the week, Bill Stoneman, a Montreal Expos' executive, was viewed as
being on the verge of being hired. Now the Angels may be back to
considering Watson following Stoneman's meeting last Thursday with
Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Co, which owns the team.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Stoneman, who has been the Expos' vice
president for baseball operations for 15 years, would come as a
surprise to executives, player agents and players who experienced
his executive style when he briefly served as the Expos' general
manager in the late '80s. His style was so abrasive that the Expos
changed his duties so that he would not deal directly with players.
</P>
<P>
   One executive who knows Stoneman well said he has not changed
since those days. The Angels' interest in Stoneman did not surprise
the executive. He said Stoneman and Tony Tavares, the Angels'
president, are ``like two peas in a pod.''
</P>
<P>
   CHECKING TORRE'S FINANCES
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Torre signed a two-year contract extension with the
Yankees this year, his salary for 2000 and 2001 was believed to be
$2 million each year. However, information on managers' salaries
distributed to the clubs lists Torre's pending salary as 50 percent
more, $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The lower figure would have matched Jim Leyland's salary with
Colorado before he resigned, though $500,000 of his $2 million was
deferred, and the amount Felipe Alou basically receives from
Montreal, though his salary is listed as $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figure puts Torre far ahead of other managers.
</P>
<P>
   The new salary certainly is insurance against Torre's being
fired.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for, say, the Detroit Tigers to pay Larry Parrish
his $425,000 salary for next season; it's another for George
Steinbrenner to pay Torre $3 million not to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Torre's new salary in perspective, the seven lowest-paid
managers will earn a collective $2.65 million next season, and it
will take the next salary on the scale to put the pay of eight
managers beyond Torre's.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Torre will earn more than Bobby Valentine ($1
million) and Tony La Russa ($1.8 million) combined.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' manager worked for $1.3 million this year, fourth
highest on the managerial pay scale. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GIVE THE RED SOX CREDIT
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the Boston Red Sox could not live out their
once-in-a-lifetime fantasy: beat the Yankees in the American League
Championship Series, avenging 1978 and every other dirty deed the
Yankees have perpetrated against them, then beat the Mets in the
World Series, gaining revenge for Bill Buckner and the rest of the
1986 gang.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox, or more specifically their general manager, Dan
Duquette, deserve recognition for a remarkable job this year. The
loss of Mo Vaughn was supposed to render the Red Sox offensively
impotent and doom them to a finish lower than dirt, but they had an
immensely better year than Vaughn did as Duquette recast the team
in a different image.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox batted .002 below their 1998 average, hit 29 fewer
home runs and scored 40 fewer runs. But they won two more games
than they did last season. They did not make up for the missing
offense by playing better defense. They committed 22 more errors
and allowed 18 more unearned runs than a year ago. It was the
pitching that carried the Red Sox to their unexpected success.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff, led by the incomparable Pedro Martinez, had
a lower earned run average this year, the lowest in the league;
allowed fewer home runs and runs; walked fewer batters, and struck
out more.
</P>
<P>
   But once the pitchers got the Red Sox to the playoffs, their
hitters erupted, scoring 44 runs in winning the last three games
against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   With Vaughn leading the offense a year ago, the Red Sox scored
11 runs in beating the Indians in the first game of the division
series, then scored a total of &UR;  &LR; nine in three consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   How did Vaughn do with Anaheim?
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was to blame, but the Angels won 15 fewer games than
they did last year and finished 22 games farther away from first
place. Vaughn, hampered by an ankle ailment most of the season,
batted .281, his lowest average in seven seasons, and hit 33 home
runs, his lowest output in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Vaughn could lead an Anaheim resurgence next season,
but a healthy Ramon Martinez could join his brother in making the
Boston pitching even stronger and position the Red Sox to finish
ahead of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the same as beating the Yankees in the playoffs
and taking their place in the World Series, but that scenario would
play in Boston.  &QL;

MARK RUDIGER ENTERS THE VOLVO OCEAN RACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Fla., Britain, Germany, Australia, New
Zealand)   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the tender age of 6, in company with his parents and three
sisters, Mark Rudiger shoved off to sail around the world. The
Rudigers had a grand adventure, but their absolute goal was denied
when an onboard fire in the Mediterranean Sea cut short the cruise
and the family eventually returned home to California. But the
smell of salt air and the taste of offshore voyaging left a lasting
impression on the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Rudiger finally closed the circle on his
first circumnavigation. As the navigator for the skipper Paul
Cayard's EF Language _ the surprise winner of the seventh running
of the grueling Whitbread Round-the-World Race _ he did so in
stunning fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that the 45-year-old Rudiger's thirst to race
before the wild winds and epic seas of the Southern Ocean has not
yet been slaked. This Wednesday, in a reception at the San
Francisco Yacht Club, Rudiger will announce plans to lead his own
entry in the next edition of the quadrennial race around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Volvo Ocean Race _ as it's now called to reflect its new
title sponsor _ will set out from Southampton, England, on Sept.
23, 2001. Before its conclusion in Kiel, Germany, some nine months
later, it will take competitors on a winding, 36,000-nautical-mile
passage. The course is made up of 10 legs with nine stopovers on
five continents, including United States calls at Miami and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco Bay Area native who works as a sailor and
sailmaker, Rudiger has laid out several financial scenarios for the
campaign. His ultimate goal is to raise $18 million in corporate
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to build two new identical boats, and obtain an
existing boat from the last race for initial sailing,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``We'd then use the new boats for sail
testing and crew testing, and pick one to use for the event. If
another sponsor came in, we could make the other boat available to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Rudiger is one of 19 entrants to have posted the
initial 1,500 pounds (about $2,500) registration fee. Although the
final entry fee has yet to be established, Lizzie Green, a race
spokeswoman, said she expected it to be in the neighborhood of
250,000 pounds (about $416,900), payable next June.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Conner, who participated in the last two Whitbreads, is
the only other official U.S.-based entry thus far, though another
San Franciscan, John Kostecki, is heading up a team based in
Germany. ``But we have a lot more interest from the States,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger is not the only Californian with round-the-world racing
experience beating the boards for corporate sponsorship. In July,
the veteran Around Alone single-handed skipper Brad Van Liew, of
Los Angeles, launched his search for funds to build an Open 60
yacht for solo events.
</P>
<P>
   As every U.S. America's Cup syndicate head will testify, the
competition for corporate dollars is fierce, but Rudiger is
undaunted. Like Kostecki, he plans to pitch international firms as
well as American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding the money is a big deal,'' he said. ``But in reality
the hardest part about getting to the starting line comes after you
get the money. There are so many logistics involved, from designing
and building the boat, to putting together the crew and a great
shore team, to testing and training. It's a phenomenal
undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   In his quest to lure a backer, Rudiger wants to find a company
that will take more from the effort than media impressions. ``We'd
hope our corporate partners would enjoy the journey on a personal
level as well as meeting their marketing goals,'' he said. ``We
want to make this a syndicate where everyone can ride along for the
whole process. We'll have regular updates on the Internet and will
welcome input and suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the last Whitbread, Rudiger has sailed in the Transpac,
and aboard the software mogul's Larry Ellison's maxi-yacht Sayonara
in the Fastnet Race, and in last winter's tragic Sydney-Hobart
race, in which six sailors were lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eye-opener, a reality check,'' he said. ``I'd seen
my share of nasty weather but nothing that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger turned down offers from both San Francisco-based
America's Cup campaigns _ Cayard's America One and Dawn Riley's
America True _ to take part in the current competition in New
Zealand. ``I'm just more offshore oriented,'' he said. ``For all
that time and effort, I'd like to see a bit more of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wouldn't mind teaming up with Cayard again on a
long-distance effort. ``When Paul wins the cup, he'll be pretty
busy keeping it here in the Bay Area,'' Rudiger laughed. ``But
maybe he'll come sail with me for a couple of Volvo legs.''

A CANOE TRIP TO A FAMILY HIDEAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we reached the west shore of Maine's Salmon Stream Lake,
there was only about an hour of daylight left, so we made haste to
load our canoe and make the crossing to the family camp on the tip
of the peninsula on the opposite shore.
</P>
<P>
   There was a stiff northeast wind blowing, but the venerable
20-foot Grumman aluminum canoe I leave upside down and tethered to
a spruce at the road's end was more than adequate for the half-mile
trip. Pushed by a two-horsepower outboard, we traversed the water
in less than 15 minutes, putting up a flight of eight Canada geese
on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly unloading, we went back to our four-wheel-drive pickup
for the second load and had all our gear and grub under cover
before darkness. Only then did my companion, Ruth Kirchmeier, have
a chance to have her first look at the camp, which might be more
properly called a lodge, because it is bigger than many one-family
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, I had virtually emptied the cookie jar to purchase
the lodge and the peninsula upon which it sits. On the peninsula
are a series of ``islands,'' mostly softwood, that cover about 100
acres. The remaining 100 or so acres is a glorious bog, or, as it
is described in the deed, a heath.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early summer, my sons Steve and Jeff, my
grandsons and their young friends made several work trips to the
place. The lodge, built about a decade ago, needed to be closed in
on its south gable end, dormer windows needed to be installed and
several doors and windows had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   All the materials, including a generator to run our power tools,
couches, chairs, tables, beds and tanks of propane gas, had to be
transported across the lake by skiff and canoe, after being hauled
down more than seven miles of logging roads to the lake's west
shore. The man who got the structure three-quarters completed
before calling it quits had used a helicopter to move workmen and
materials, but that was too rich for our blood.
</P>
<P>
   The lake _ about 60 miles north of Bangor and west of Interstate
95 _ is more than a mile long and a half-mile wide, and our camp is
the only building on its shores. In Penobscot County, the peninsula
is bounded by the lake on one side and Salmon Stream on the other.
</P>
<P>
   My sons and I had little chance to explore the place or to fish
it this summer and fall, although the teen-agers did find a little
time on some evenings for angling. They caught smallmouth bass up
to five pounds, pickerel and yellow and white perch, but no trout,
although an area resident, Jason McLaughlin, said that trout are
taken in late spring and early summer just below where the
south-flowing stream leaves the lake.
</P>
<P>
   My trip with Ruth was timed for just after the Oct. 1 opening of
the ruffed grouse and duck seasons up there. I also planned to do a
bit of fishing and to become familiar with the property.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the last light play over the summit of Mount
Katahdin about 30 miles to the northwest, Ruth and I went indoors,
tested the hand pump that pulls water from the lake, lighted the
propane and kerosene lamps and kindled a blaze in the metal
fireplace installed on a previous trip. We slept in front of the
fire that night as the wind moaned in the towering white pines
beside the camp.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny dawn greeted us and we went up the lake's east shore to
try to find our boundary marker. We failed in that, but in our
wanderings along the edge of the heath we found pitcher plants so
numerous that it was difficult to avoid stepping on them. We also
marveled at several white pines that were more than 3 feet in
diameter. Walking under the gloom of tall spruces and pines, I put
up a pair of grouse and shot one of them. In the canoe, we then
went up Salmon Stream on the other side of the peninsula to where I
had found wild cranberries in August.
</P>
<P>
   The stream and the lake had come up more than a foot since then,
but wearing waders, we quickly picked a quart of berries even
though moose and deer had preceded us. We were Millet's ``The
Gleaners,'' without the cloud of deprivation. For supper we had the
grouse and wild cranberry sauce, rice pilaf, carrots and parsnips
from our garden at home, and a tossed salad, all enhanced by an
excellent white wine.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six days, the weather determined our activities.
For two days the wind blew so hard that it would have been
foolhardy to go out in the canoe. Waves and whitecaps stormed down
the lake, leaving skeins of foam on the lee side of the peninsula,
and the rains came. At one point it blew so hard that trees were
snapped off or uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   The following dawn there was nearly two inches of snow on the
ground and the branches of spruces, pines and cedars were sagging
with their wet burden. Then the sun emerged and we were greeted
with brilliant fall colors against a white backdrop and the summit
of Katahdin draped in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, we managed to visit all the
peninsula's ``islands,'' but the woods were too dark and wet to
hunt grouse successfully. We set up a duck blind and put out
decoys, but the whistlers, mallards, teal and mergansers had
departed.
</P>
<P>
   I assembled a spinning rod, but never had the opportunity to use
it: too cold or too windy. We were content, nonetheless, with
chores and inside projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and a near gale from the southwest greeted us the morning
we departed, so I headed directly into the waves while crossing
until I reached the lee shore. Moose and deer tracks were in the
mud around the truck, and a ruffed grouse thundered from the edge
of the clearing and dove into the twilight under the spruces.

EDITORIAL: A NEW WORLD OF FINANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Even without new laws enacted by Congress, the financial world
has hurtled through many changes in recent years. Now with the
agreement in Washington on Friday to overhaul the nation's banking
laws, American businesses and consumers face even more
transformation. Legislation agreed to by the White House and the
Republican leadership will sweep away the Depression-era curbs that
have kept banks, securities firms and insurance companies from
moving into one another's arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deregulation is designed to help American companies
expand abroad and become more efficient at home. But the
breakthrough agreement was made possible by the lawmakers'
willingness to try to protect consumers and poor communities from
being trampled in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Congress has attempted without success
to overhaul the nation's banking laws, while American financial
institutions found loopholes to get around some of the old
regulations. Banks have already moved in a limited way into the
securities business, which was barred by the Glass-Steagall Act of
1933. The Travelers Group-Citibank merger seemed a harbinger of
greater change. But as such steps accelerated, consumers had reason
to worry about access to credit, as well as technological threats
to their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The needed legislative overhaul was delayed as the various wings
of the financial industry waged expensive lobbying campaigns. Often
it seemed as if lawmakers were engaged in a big tease designed to
shake down the industry for campaign contributions, overlooking the
needs of consumers. Partisan hatreds in Congress at times made an
agreement unlikely. But in the House, Rep. Jim Leach, chairman of
the Banking Committee, managed to bring all sides together and
craft a bill that was mostly acceptable to the White House. Another
step forward came this month when the Treasury Department and the
Federal Reserve reached an accord to share oversight of banks
entering into new financial activities.
</P>
<P>
   The final impediment to a new bill was a series of disputes over
the right to privacy of consumers and the rights of long-neglected
poor communities not to be discriminated against. Both issues got
resolved in a way that was, on balance, positive. But it remains to
be seen how well the new regulations are to be enforced and what
penalties will be available. The agreed-upon bill requires
financial institutions to disclose their policies on collecting and
using financial information, and gives customers the right to stop
them from sharing information with other companies. States were
left with the right to regulate insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, a White House veto threat forced Sen. Phil
Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to drop his
attempt to eviscerate laws that have long required banks to lend in
the same minority areas where they receive deposits. The White
House, in turn, accepted compromise language on enforcing the law
against redlining, pushed by Sens. Christopher Dodd and Charles
Schumer, two Democrats with insurance and banking industries among
their most powerful constituents. Finally, Speaker Dennis Hastert
and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, also pressed Gramm to
accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A sweeping deregulation like this one comes along rarely. There
are sure to be unintended and adverse consequences, just as there
were after the telecommunications deregulation of 1996. The bill
that was put together over the last several weeks, with a marathon
negotiating session into the early hours of Friday, was testimony
to reasonableness on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually certain to be passed in the Senate and House and
signed by President Clinton. But it will also be important for
Congress to continue monitoring the trends in the financial
industry. The principle of freer competition is the economic engine
of this era. But the other imperative is to demand openness,
financial prudence and safeguards so that the vast new
concentrations of wealth and power do not create new abuses. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Strong, cold winds from the northwest will sweep across the
Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states in the wake of potent low
pressure over eastern Canada. Although there will be ample morning
sun near the coast, clouds will be plentiful for much of the day
over the interior. Snow squalls will whiten the mountains of
northern New England and the Adirondacks while scattered rain and a
few wet snowflakes occur farther south near the central
Appalachians and eastern Great Lakes. Some clouds and a few
sprinkles may reach coastal areas during the afternoon. Daytime
readings will average more than 10 degrees below seasonal
temperatures throughout the region. Wind gusts over 25 mph will be
common, adding to the chill of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly breezes and sunshine will cover most of the Southeast as
sprawling high pressure moves east from the Mississippi Valley.
Clouds will form near the Appalachians as the heated air near the
ground rises into the cold air aloft.
</P>
<P>
   After a cold dawn in the Missouri and northern Mississippi
Valleys, developing breezes from the southwest and plentiful
sunshine will sponsor a marked warming trend. Afternoon
temperatures will surge above normal over much of the northern and
central Plains. The milder air will spread toward the east Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A moisture-starved front will bring some clouds, gusty winds and
a few mountain showers to the interior Northwest. Meanwhile, most
of the Western states will be unseasonably warm with abundant
bright sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Frost Above Freezing
</P>
<P>
   Frost can coat the landscape when the official reading is above
32 degrees. On Sunday night in the interior Southeast, the first
frost will occur in spots where the mercury hovers above freezing.
Official thermometers are placed 5 feet above the ground. On a
clear night with light winds the air at the ground cools rapidly as
it loses radiation to space. As the night goes on, the layer of
cold air gets deeper, but the coldest and, thus, densest air hugs
the ground. The difference between the temperature near the ground
and the official air temperature can often be more than five
degrees.

6 KILLED ON UNUSUALLY VIOLENT NIGHT IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an unusually violent night Friday on the
streets of New York City, full of shootings, stabbings and arson.
Within seven hours _ from 9:30 p.m. Friday to 4:30 a.m. Saturday _
the Police Department reported six killings across the city,
including the discovery of a woman gagged inside a burning house.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of homicides reflects a more general surge in the
murder rate this year, one that has concerned city officials who
have long believed that the department's concentration on
quality-of-life crimes and specialized anticrime units would keep
the rate on its six-year course of decline. Although the murder
rate is still down nearly 67 percent over the last six years, there
were 540 homicides from Jan. 1 to Oct. 17 this year, according to
the most recent statistics, a 7.5 percent increase from the 502
homicides during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's violence began not with a death but with the
critical injury of a man in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.
The man, Errol Webster, 35, was standing on a corner when, police
said, an unknown man walked up and shot him three times, once in
each eye and once in the knee. Webster was taken to Coney Island
Hospital, where he remained in extremely critical condition
Saturday morning, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn,
Charles Dantzler, 25, began to argue with a man who then pulled out
a gun and fatally shot him in the back, hand and leg, police said.
A man leaving a grocery store on the corner was also shot in the
leg, apparently by accident, police added. They said that man was
taken to Wycoff Hospital, where he was in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, at 10:35 p.m., a man was fatally shot as he stood
in the threshold of his Brooklyn apartment, police said. They said
two men were involved and that one of them shot the man once in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes passed before the next report of shots fired,
this time at an apartment building in the Astoria section of
Queens. Officers found Ronald Bradley, 33, of Brooklyn, shot in the
back, buttocks and arm. He died at Elmhurst Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-a-half hours later, at 2:40 a.m. Saturday, police were
called to another shooting in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Lamale Lawson, 28, had an argument with another man at a party
and the shot Lawson once in the chest and fled, police said. Lawson
bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, police and firefighters were called to a burning
building in the Jamaica section of Queens. The body of a
39-year-old woman was found inside with her head wrapped in duct
tape that covered her mouth and nose, police said, adding that the
fire appeared to be arson.

   FALLING FROM THE SKY
</P>
<P>
   Part One of a six-part investigative series by The Dayton Daily
News on the the recent rise in military air crashes and their
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.

   CRASH-MAIN _ The U.S. military routinely sends planes and
helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems. An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that
planes keep falling from the sky for the same reasons, that
hundreds of crashes can be linked to maintenance errors, and that
the military keeps hundreds of crashes off its yearly accident
totals. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)

   CRASH-CASE _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina

the engine had been on two other F-16s and removed after pilots
reported smoke and fumes in their cockpits. (Carollo, Dayton Daily

   HARRAHS _ NEW ORLEANS _ Four years after a land-based casino in
downtown New Orleans went bankrupt, admitting that far too few
gamblers were losing far too little money, the re-structured
company is going against all odds and re-opening. Sure, it's
prettier and smaller and in a slightly more convenient location
than the first attempt, but just to stay afloat, Harrah's will have
to make far more in daily revenues than any other casino in the
region. When the doors open on Canal Street Thursday (Oct. 28), the
old questions will be asked again: Do New Orleanians or the
tourists who visit here really need another attraction? Is the
casino enticing enough to lure people away from Bourbon Street and
its bars and nightlife? And how will it compete against the
glittering offerings of the Mississippi Coast casinos, which are
just an hour away? (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BIOTECH-TRADE _ WASHINGTON _ A major trade dispute between the
United States and European countries over genetically engineered
food products is gathering steam. U.S. trade representatives have
charged that requiring labels that disclose the presence of
products grown from crops containing transplanted genetic material,
such as corn with a bacteria gene to kill insects, is an illegal
restriction under international trade law. But European officials
say they are adamant that they will insist on labeling, and in some
areas ban the products altogether. Billions of dollars in trade
ride on the outcome of the dispute. (Nesmith 1000).

   UNITEDNATIONS _ With U.N. forces trying to keep the peace in
Kosovo and create it in East Timor, this much is obvious: On
occasion, at least, the U.S. government finds the U.N. to be a
fairly useful organization. Yet the United States, which was one of
the founding members of the international body 54 years ago this
Sunday, is just 10 weeks away from losing its vote in the U.N.
General Assembly. Under the organization's rules, the U.S. owes too
much money _ $1.7 billion, by the U.N.'s reckoning _ to retain its
voting power. But that debt will soon be paid if Ted Turner has his
way. When Turner announced in 1997 his gift of $1 billion over 10
years to U.N.-related causes, he wanted some of his money to go to
U.N. projects that help women, children and the environment. But he
also wanted to create a political climate conducive to having the
U.S. pay its U.N. arrears. And he has created an organization to
try to accomplish that goal. (Melvin, Atlanta

through the night by eight weeks, and spank children as young as 18
months. The pair have written a controversial Bible-based parenting
curricula that includes the popular book ``Growing Kids God's
Way,'' which has been used by more than a million parents. But Dr.
Penelope Leach, the so-called Dr. Spock of Britain, calls the two
Americans child abusers. She abhors spanking and has called on the
British government to stop the Ezzos from coming. (Emling, Cox News

   CHINA-MACAU _ MACAU _ The checkered history of this indolent old
Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are weeping as China
prepares to take over. Four hundred years ago Macau was far richer.
Portuguese traders dined on plates of gold because for a century
Portugal had a world monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and
silver with Japan and China. Twelve years ago, China and Portugal
had no trouble agreeing that the Portuguese should end their
occupation just before the millennium. Both sides have stuck to
this pact with little friction. And so on the evening of December
19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau and China are due to gather
here just before midnight to toast the end of nearly 450 years of
Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral
strikes 12 times, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and
oldest Western enclave in Asia. (Kunstel/Albright, Atlanta

BATON ROUGE BEGINS DOWNTOWN RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREA NEIGHBOURS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Planning officials and community leaders in
this state capital call a hotel now under construction on the
Mississippi River the first significant expression of confidence by
a private investor in their long-term planning for downtown
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The developer-owner, Argosy Gaming Co., a riverboat casino
operation with gaming boats in five states, already operates Argosy
Casino Baton Rouge, one of two gambling boats docked downtown. The
company's $20 million, 305-room convention-center hotel now under
construction, the first hotel built downtown in 50 years, marks its
latest investment in the riverfront area, called Catfish Town.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening the casino in 1994, the company has invested $80
million in Catfish Town in the gambling boat, dock, garage and
100,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space that currently
houses only a restaurant and some meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   To secure licensing for its riverboat five years ago, Argosy
promised to begin construction of the hotel _ as yet unnamed _
within two years of completing the casino. But Jim Perry, president
of Argosy, said it had not been possible to get a bank to
underwrite the project.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the financial commitment made this year by the
state and city to begin a major expansion and renovation of the
Baton Rouge Centroplex, the city's three-building civic center, he
decided to start construction with the company's own funds. The
start of construction in August ended the company's liability for a
$300,000-a-month fine that it had been paying since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel doesn't work without the civic center and vice
versa,'' Perry said. ``The city created the right incentive to get
a hotel started.''
</P>
<P>
   The new riverfront and downtown developments implement Plan
Baton Rouge, the city's downtown revitalization program, developed
by Andres Duany, a pioneer of the New Urbanism movement, which
emphasizes pedestrian-friendly downtown environments.
</P>
<P>
   For Argosy, the most important part of the initiative is a
$30-million expansion and renovation of the 23-year-old Centroplex,
which is a block away from the new hotel. The Centroplex buildings
are connected by outdoor plazas and terraces in a block between
River Road and St. Louis Street.
</P>
<P>
   The building that fronts River Road has a 30,000-square-foot
arena where the Kingfish, Baton Rouge's professional hockey team,
and the Louisiana Bayou Beast, its professional arena football
team, compete.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a 30,000-square-foot exhibition hall for trade
shows, conventions and banquets. Behind this structure, a second
building holds the 2,000-seat theater where the Baton Rouge
Symphony and Baton Rouge Ballet perform. The Centroplex's 10-story
governmental building houses the mayor's office, district courts
and two floors of parking.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Post of Post Architects, the principal architect for the
Centroplex project, said its most significant part involves a new
exhibition hall, whose size has not yet been determined. The
current exhibition hall will become a grand ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Post's second priority will be to ``work on connectivity.''
River Road will be rerouted to remove a high-speed curve that cuts
between the new hotel and Centroplex, and pathways, sidewalks and
pedestrian bridges will be redesigned to guide Centroplex visitors
to two grand entrances to the complex _ one facing the river, the
other facing St. Louis Street.
</P>
<P>
   While the design phase has just begun for the Centroplex, a
half-mile away cranes have been at work since August on another
early phase of the downtown renewal. The state has broken ground
for the first two buildings in a $170 million expansion of Capitol
Park. There will be six new buildings in all, scheduled for
completion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Located on Lafayette Street, a bluff that works as the river's
natural levee, the new LaSalle office building and a separate
540,000-square-foot parking garage will look out over the river,
nearly a mile wide as it passes downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of the Louisiana commissioner of
administration, Mark Drennen, and Duany, the new state buildings
have been conceived as a campus and they will maintain the art deco
style of the existing capitol buildings, which went up during the
reign of Gov. Huey P. Long in the 1930s, said Allen Eskew, whose
firm bearing his name is teaming up with CSRS Architects on the
LaSalle building.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-story, 367,000-square-foot office building will be clad
in stone and precast concrete to replicate the color and texture of
the state capitol's limestone. It will house the Departments of
Revenue and Natural Resources. The ground floor will include a cafe
as well as an exhibit on Sieur Robert Cavelier de La Salle, the
French explorer who named Louisiana for King Louis XIV.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Drennen said, ground will be broken for
a third building, an eight-story, 475,000-square-foot office
building on North Third Street to house the Department of
Administration. Construction of the other three buildings _ two
office structures totaling 430,000 square feet and a
630,000-square-foot parking garage that will also accommodate a
public market _ will start soon, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Drennen had begun plans for the new state buildings before Plan
Baton Rouge, but they were reconceived under the influence of
Duany's community-oriented approach.
</P>
<P>
   In one change, another floor was added to the LaSalle garage.
``If we're able to attract a movie theater, they'll be able to use
this public parking garage,'' Drennen said. The garage will include
1,920 parking spaces and 10,000 square feet of commercial and
retail space _ most of which is reserved for a YMCA fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Planning also has started for a downtown visitors' center, a
20-acre riverfront park, a state museum and an arts center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if the state made these investments, the private
sector would step forward,'' Drennen stated.
</P>
<P>
   Recent property sales on Main Street indicate that
private-sector activity has picked up. There have been seven sales
in the last four months, totaling over $1 million. Main Street has
shaped up to be a design corridor, with three professional design
firms, a stained-glass shop and a hand-made furniture operation.
</P>
<P>
   On Third Street, a local entrepreneur, Bob Dean, has bought
eight buildings, calling the collection Deanopolis. The buildings
include an upscale office building, now called Dean Plaza, and a
reception hall, Lyceum Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, downtown Third Street was home to Dalton's and
Rosenfield's department stores, Sears, J.C. Penney, the original
Piccadilly Cafeteria _ the foundation for what is now a chain of
more than 250 restaurants _ the Paramount Theater and numerous
smaller shops and eating establishments.
</P>
<P>
   All of the larger establishments either went out of business or
moved to the suburbs, but the presence of government employees
allowed a few lunch operations and stores to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Several new retailers and restaurateurs have capitalized on the
momentum, including Joey's Java coffee shop and M's Fine and Mellow
Cafe, a casual eating spot with blues and folk music in the
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   But the hotel is the most ambitious of the private ventures so
far. Perry, the developer-owner, said that he expected the
clientele to include people who come to do business downtown,
government employees visiting the capital from other parts of the
state, and convention-cisitors.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy projects revenue this year of $60 million, up from $49
million in 1998, an increase that came about in part because East
Baton Rouge parish recently made video poker illegal.
</P>
<P>
   With the hotel under way, the planners' grand vision of a
pedestrian-centered downtown community is one step closer to
realization. Hotel guests will stroll from the hotel to Centroplex
or the casino, and on a calmer River Road to the recently
renovated, Gothic-style Old State Capitol, a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually one of their destinations will be a state-of-the-art
planetarium, for which ground is to be broken in January. They will
all be accessible on foot, in five minutes or less from the hotel.

OWNING A CO-OP IN SPLITSVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Franck Amsallem was going through a divorce in
1992, the last thing he was concerned about, he says, was what
would eventually become of the co-op apartment in Brooklyn that he
and his wife had bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intentionally avoided dealing with it,'' Amsallem said.
``We just wanted to get the divorce over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Amsallem wants to sell the apartment, but the co-op board
will not permit a transfer of the shares and proprietary lease
without his ex-wife's signature. The only problem, he said, is that
his ex-wife is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do when somebody just disappears?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Amsallem's predicament might seem unusual, real estate and
matrimonial lawyers say that situations like this are more common
than most people think. In fact, they say, couples going through
stressful divorces often make decisions about the division of their
real estate that could later come back to hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the lawyers say, problems in transferring co-op shares
can come about as the result of even the most ordinary
circumstances, such as when one spouse dies and the survivor fails
to make sure that ownership of the co-op shares is registered
properly in his or her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had these kind of nightmares,'' said Arthur
Weinstein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer and vice president of the
Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said that with co-op apartments, it is always
necessary for all registered shareholders to sign the documents
needed to transfer the shares and proprietary lease when the
apartment is being sold. That is usually not a problem when all
shareholders are alive and available, and agree to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Problems can arise, however, when one of the shareholders has
died, disappeared or, for whatever reason, declines to cooperate.
For example, Weinstein said, a common problem occurs when a husband
and wife own shares to an apartment in a form of ownership known as
``tenants in common.''
</P>
<P>
   With that form of ownership, he said, each spouse's ownership
interest is independent of the other's. Accordingly, he said, if
one spouse dies, that individual's interest in the shares passes
through his or her estate to heirs or beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   And when a shareholder's ownership interest passes to someone
else _ even a surviving spouse _ it is necessary to confirm the
transfer and record it on the co-op's books and records. That is
done, Weinstein said, by having the executor or administrator of
the deceased spouse's estate sign the necessary documents after the
estate has gone through probate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon, however, he said, for a surviving spouse to
forgo the probate process entirely _ particularly when the only
significant asset the couple owned was the apartment itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the surviving spouse then tries to transfer the shares to
the apartment years after the other spouse's death, the process is
far more complicated,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, when shares to an apartment are owned by a
couple as tenants in common, and one of the owners dies, it is
usually necessary to obtain documents from the New York State Tax
Commission indicating that no outstanding estate taxes are due.
Those documents, known as tax waivers, are routinely obtained in
the probate process. Trying to get them years after a death for an
estate that was never probated is far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back and reopen tax records that are years
old,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, most lawyers who represent co-op boards will
not permit the transfer of shares held by a surviving spouse
without some assurance that the deceased spouse's estate was
properly distributed. And the only way to be certain of that,
Weinstein said, is to have the surviving spouse go through the
process of probating the deceased spouse's estate _ even if that
means that the estate must go through probate years after the
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the co-op wants is heirs of the decedent coming
out of the woodwork after the shares have been transferred,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid such a problem, Weinstein said, is for
co-owners of a co-op to hold title to their shares as ``joint
tenants with right of survivorship'' or as ``tenants by the
entirety,'' a form of joint ownership available to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   With such forms of ownership, Weinstein said, if one joint owner
dies, the survivor automatically becomes the sole owner of the
shares, thereby making it unnecessary to transfer the decedent's
interest through probate and avoiding the need for tax waivers.
</P>
<P>
   William Selsberg, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn., said
that problems with title to real estate can also occur when a
couple, dividing property as a result of a divorce, fail to follow
through on things they agreed on in the divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen many instances where people have property settlement
agreements that say title to property will be transferred from one
spouse to the other, but for some reason, the transfer is never
made,'' Selsberg said. ``I can tell you that trying to get a deed
out of an ex-spouse years after a divorce is usually sheer
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that many couples overlook when dividing property
during a divorce is that while one spouse might agree to transfer
title to a house into the other spouse's name as part of the
divorce agreement, it is unlikely that the bank that holds the
mortgage on the house will take the first spouse's name off the
mortgage and note.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that a person who transfers title to a former
spouse is still on the hook for the mortgage,'' Selsberg said,
adding that such a situation could pose problems because the
outstanding mortgage will be considered an outstanding liability
for credit purposes. And that could make it difficult for the
ex-spouse without the house to buy a property as an individual.

   ATTN: News editors, national editors
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: Updates first day's budget lines.)
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service is preparing to distribute another compelling
investigative series on the U.S. military by The Dayton Daily News.
``Falling From the Sky,'' a six-day series that starts Sunday, Oct.
24, concerns the recent rise in military air crashes and its
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the stories is likely to have a national impact.
The Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for a series uncovering
problems with the military's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Falling From the Sky,'' CoxNet will produce a Focus page
for Sunday, Oct. 24, based on the comprehensive first day of the
series. That page will be available Friday afternoon for a download
charge at www.nytsyn.com/pageexpress.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories, and subsequent days' offerings, will also be
available on the New York Times wire. The Sunday and Monday
installments will move on Friday, Oct. 22. Subsequent stories will
move daily next week. Photos and graphics accompany each
installment.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a budget of the page and stories that Cox will offer
from Dayton. If you have questions, please contact CoxNet at
404-526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   Falling From the Sky
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Oct. 24: Day 1 (This installment will be available as a
CoxNet Focus page Friday, Oct. 22. Stories and photos will also
move separately.)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAIN _ The U.S. military routinely sends planes and
helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems. An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that
planes keep falling from the sky for the same reasons, that
hundreds of crashes can be linked to maintenance errors, and that
the military keeps hundreds of crashes off its yearly accident
totals. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-SC _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.'' But a Dayton Daily News investigation into the
crash found that in the months preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash,
the engine had been on two other F-16s and removed after pilots
reported smoke and fumes in their cockpits. (Carollo, Dayton Daily
News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-HOW _ The series wouldn't have been possible without the
release of three databases from the Army, Navy and Air Force safety
centers. Also, how to find the full report at daytondailynews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Oct. 25: Day 2
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-METAL _ A type of metal is in the middle of an
investigation involving a series of crashes of the Army's CH47
Chinook helicopter. The story came to light when a whistleblower,
working at a former factory in Springfield, Ohio, found flaws in a
metal used to construct gears that power the helicopter's huge
rotor blades. Investigators now suspect that seven crashes may be
linked to the metal. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Oct. 26: Day 3
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAINTENANCE _ The system used to maintain military
aircraft is itself broken. Hundreds of crashes can be linked to
work performed by unqualified mechanics, parts installed
improperly, engines overhauled incorrectly and inspection records
that were falsified. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-TIMMER _ A Hamilton, Ohio, man died in a helicopter that
should have been grounded. The test result that would have grounded
the craft arrived in the field three weeks after the crash.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Oct. 27: Day 4
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-COUNT _ Since 1980, the military has omitted hundreds of
aviation incidents from its official accident rates, the statistics
used by Congress and the public to assess military safety.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-BUTTON _ Among those not counted: the 1997 crash involving
Capt. Craig D. Button, who took off from an Air Force base in
Arizona and crashed an A-10 jet filled with bombs into a Colorado
mountain. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Oct. 28: Day 5
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-CONTRACTORS _ Private companies that do business with the
government, including large aircraft manufacturers, are protected
against many lawsuits by the government-contractor defense. The
defense means companies have limited liability even when they
produce defective products. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Oct. 29: Day 6
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-KNIGHTS _ The military's handling of the hydraulic
problems on the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters is typical of the way
it handled numerous other mechanical failures in many types of
aircraft. Costs are weighed against risk. Some 70 incidents,
spanning more than 11 years, can be traced to hydraulic problems on
the Sea Knights. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MCNALLY _ Anatomy of a crash. A detailed analysis of a
1994 crash in California involving a pilot named Randall McNally.
No cause was ever determined, but a Daily News examination found
that mechanics had detected problems with the plane's stabilizer
augmentor eight days before the crash. The augmentor was never
found. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)

   ``Falling From the Sky'' is the result of an 18-month
examination by the Dayton Daily News. The full series is available
at www.daytondailynews.com/projects.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the findings are based on information from the
military's own records, obtained through more than 150 requests
filed under the Freedom of Information Act. The federal law gives
citizens access to government records.
</P>
<P>
   Using the law, the newspaper obtained several computer databases
from the safety centers that investigate aviation accidents for the
Army, Air Force and Navy, which is also responsible for
investigating Marine Corps accidents. The databases, which have
never before been released to the public, contained hundreds of
thousands of records on more than 87,500 military aviation
incidents that occurred since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The databases released to the newspaper included information
typically kept secret by the services, including the identity of
parts suspected of playing roles in accidents. The newspaper used
the databases to link a single part to more than one accident.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also obtained dozens of lengthy records of
aviation accident reports from military offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people were interviewed in 13 states. Among those
interviewed were pilots and other crew members, mechanics, civilian
and military accident investigators, military commanders and
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper received technical advice from former and current
military mechanics, pilots, accident investigators and other
aviation experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the experts used by the newspaper was former Army
helicopter pilot Edward Monhollen, who worked for the Army Safety
Center investigating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Monhollen, a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, now investigates
military and civilian aviation accidents for the federal government
and private attorneys through his aviation investigation firm in
San Antonio, Edward Mohhollen &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The series was written by Russell Carollo, a staff writer of the
Dayton Daily News. He previously co-wrote a series on problems with
the military's health-care system that won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize
for national reporting.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. military routinely allows helicopters
and planes in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems _ conditions, in some cases, allowed to exist for months,
years, even decades, an 18-month examination by the Dayton Daily
News found.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reviewed thousands of pages of accident reports
and analyzed hundreds of thousands of computer records released to
the public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The military's system for repairing and maintaining aircraft
is itself broken. Hundreds of in-flight emergencies and accidents _
some deadly _ can be traced to parts installed improperly, engines
overhauled incorrectly and other mistakes by mechanics or the
people supervising them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The military has concealed its true aviation safety record
from the public. Since 1980, hundreds of serious accidents were
omitted from the military's official accident rate, and the
percentage of uncounted accidents is growing, from 1.6 percent of
all accidents in 1980 to 23 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decisions critical to the safety of the men and woman who fly
on military aircraft frequently are left to private civilian
companies with millions of dollars riding on those decisions. In
some cases, those companies participate in secret accident
investigations even as they face multimillion-dollar lawsuits
involving the same accidents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal investigators suspect that several CH-47D Chinook
helicopter accidents may be linked to gears made with a specially
processed metal at two factories, in Chicago and Springfield, Ohio.
In August, 14 years after the first accident, problems with gear
parts made with the same metal led to a worldwide grounding of
Chinooks, the largest such grounding ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ The military operates more than 15,000 fighter jets,
helicopters and other aircraft with virtually no independent
oversight. If the safety of civilians depended on the same system,
airlines could choose their own employees to investigate accidents,
decide when to ground their own aircraft, when to replace unsafe
parts, and make these decisions in secret, with little fear of
being sued.
</P>
<P>
   The military's already flawed aviation safety system recently
has become further strained by massive downsizing and budget cuts,
the loss of thousands of experienced pilots, global conflicts and
an aging fleet of aircraft. Amid these problems, the rate of
serious aviation accidents increased this year for all the services
except the Navy, which was rebounding from an 82 percent increase
in 1998. The Army's rate for serious accidents was the highest
since Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to understand how the military deals with this
stuff,'' said James Browne, whose son was killed flying a
helicopter that Navy investigators later determined was not safe to
fly. ``They don't want to spend the money to fix something until
they're between a rock and a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to sacrifice as acceptable risk the lives of
military personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The military's top safety officials said aviation has never been
safer. They acknowledged the recent increase in the accident rate,
but said their statistics during the past 30 years show a drastic
drop in the rate of serious aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about these sailors and Marines,'' said Rear Admiral
Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr., commander of the safety center in
Norfolk, Va., that oversees Navy and Marine Corps aviation safety.
``If we find something wrong, we fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Gene Martin LaCoste, commander of the Army Safety
Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., said many accidents are caused by
human error, not by longstanding problems ignored by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see guys making more mistakes because of less experience in
the cockpit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Major Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., and the former
director of operations for the Air Force Material Command at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, said serious aviation
accidents have become so rare that they are ``almost statistically
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances that the military is doing everything it can
to prevent accidents, planes and helicopters keep falling from the
sky for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Big problems, small measures
</P>
<P>
   The engine-control assembly (ECA) in the Navy's F-18 Hornet had
failed 114 times when a pilot in Florida reported a problem on July
1, 1996. ``Multiple ECA failures fleetwide posing unacceptable risk
to aircraft crew,'' an investigator warned after that incident.
Exactly one month later, another F-18 reported the same problem.
Three months later, another was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic failures in the Navy and Marine Corps' CH-46 Sea
Knight helicopters caused more than 71 emergencies and accidents
since 1988, three resulting in a loss of helicopters _ one of them
part of President Clinton's fleet. This year, 11 years after the
first incident was documented, two people were injured when a
helicopter filled with reporters and photographers caught fire off
the coast of California. It was the second time in four days that
hydraulic problems had forced a Sea Knight to make an emergency
landing in California.
</P>
<P>
   An electrical relay used in the vapor system for the Navy's
twin-engine E-2C Hawkeye airplane failed at least 54 times _ 26 of
the incidents causing fires or an electrical spark. In 1996, an
investigator warned: ``This situation needs to be rectified. ... We
were fortunate that this incident happened on preflight.'' Two
months later, an E-2C reported smoke in the cockpit after the vapor
system failed. Two similar cases were reported in 1997 and at least
one in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The military often chooses small, measured responses to
recurring problems, but that hasn't always been a good strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the military struggled to prevent engine problems
that plagued the Marines' AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   There were two types of malfunctions: rollbacks, causing the
engine to roll back to idle; and flameouts, the sudden loss of
engine power _ different problems that can be linked to a single
cause.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, an AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., suffered the eighth engine malfunction by the
same squadron in a little more than a year. Mechanics first
suspected water in a wiring harness, but when they took the
helicopter up, the same engine flamed out again.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Cobra has two engines, so losing one is not
necessarily critical. In 1995 and 1996, however, the Navy
investigated reports of dual engine failures.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those cases, on April 18, 1996, an AH-1W from the
Marine Corps Air Station in Iwakuni, Japan, suffered a dual engine
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance personnel in Japan checked a fuel switch. They
swapped engines. They replaced the engines. But they couldn't fix
the problem. So the engines were sent to General Electric ``for
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, on March 25, 1997, an AH-1W from the USS Nassau
reported its No. 2 engine had failed, prompting the commanding
officer to write: ``This is the second rollback in four months on
this engine in this aircraft. ... This hazard is being addressed
... with no fix in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   By March 1997, the military had documented more than 70
rollbacks and flameouts involving the Super Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, an AH-1W Super Cobra crashed in a
field near a high school in Texas, killing both Maj. Michael J.
Browne, the father of two girls and a combat veteran of Desert
Storm and Somalia, and Lt. Robert B. Straw, also a husband and
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take but a word or a thought for someone to cry,''
Browne's father said. ``His wife is alone taking care of the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   A Naval Safety Center investigation found that the helicopter
``was not safe for flight and should have been grounded'' before it
left Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. near Fort Worth, Texas. The
investigation found outstanding ``urgent'' technical directives for
work on the aircraft _ at least two of them aimed at preventing
engine failures.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Dirren, who reviewed Naval Safety Center records of
the accident at the request of the Dayton Daily News, said: ``We
blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumbling afterburners
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes problems go unresolved because the military decides
the solutions are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   By early this year, the Air Force had documented 11 in-flight
failures of afterburners on Pratt &AMP; Whitney F-100-220 engines, used
on F-15 and F-16 fighters. The afterburner, or augmentor, fits into
the exhaust section of the jet and provides extra power by
shrinking the size of the exhaust while injecting and igniting
additional fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of sheet metal called stiffeners, each welded on in 70
places, are attached to the afterburner on the F-100-220 engine to
keep it from buckling under the tremendous heat and pressure
produced by the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force found that vibration and aging caused the welds to
split until eventually the afterburner cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nozzle and augmentor actually came off,'' said Robert May
Jr., who as propulsion product manager is in charge of engines for
the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   An afterburner used for engines on another type of F-16 is
chemically milled, or attached without welds, May said, and the Air
Force could easily have solved its afterburner problem by putting
chemically milled afterburners on its F-100-220 engines, used on
both the F-15s and F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``To retrofit this new augmentor ... is 40 to 50 million
dollars,'' May said, and that's just for the F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was put off. After all, none of the 11 in-flight
failures had caused a major accident.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, an F-16 piloted by a student from Luke Air Force
Base, Ariz., crashed near Gila Bend, Ariz. No one was seriously
injured, but the $20 million aircraft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, on March 26, another F-16 from Luke Air Force
Base crashed on private property near an Arizona freeway. The pilot
ejected and no one was injured. The aircraft was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Both F-16s had afterburners that were attached with welds. In
each case, the afterburner broke free and the engine fell apart,
igniting a fire as flying debris ruptured the fuel lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our risk analysis shows we were in error before,'' said Maj.
Gen. Gideon, the Air Force Safety Center commander.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Derek Kaufman, a Luke Air Force Base spokesman, said the
Air Force now plans to replace the old afterburners, but it could
take several years. Until then, he said, mechanics will do more
comprehensive inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the risks
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the military's needs _ its missions _ are deemed more
important than the risks posed by safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All U.S. Air Force missions and our daily routines involve
risk,'' says a copy of ``Risk Management'' guidelines for Air Force
officers. ``Accept necessary risk required to successfully complete
the mission or task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding risk altogether requires canceling or delaying the
job, mission or operation, but is an option that is rarely
exercised due to mission importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Eric Johnson learned this first hand.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the aviation representative at the Pentagon for the
Army Safety Center, had his face and legs burned on Feb. 23, 1993,
when a UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter crashed in Germany, causing a
230-gallon external fuel tank to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was on fire when he ran from the burning helicopter.
Another officer's clothes were still smoldering when he stumbled
from the wreckage. Four others, including Maj. Gen. Jarrett
Robertson, the deputy commander of V Corps in Germany, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before the Germany crash, investigators working for
a congressional committee warned that putting certain types of
external tanks on Blackhawks could create ``potential dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out was that because of the weight of these
things, the nose (of the helicopter) came near to touching the
ground,'' said Lawrence Dandridge, one of four General Accounting
Office investigators temporarily assigned to the committee staff.
``We also found out they were not crashworthy fuel tanks, so we
told them not to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of replacing the tanks, the Army decided to better
educate pilots of potential problems in controlling the helicopter
when the tanks are mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they thought the training would help fix it,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Germany crash, on July 8, 1997, a Blackhawk
helicopter crashed into a stand of tall trees in North Carolina,
rupturing both 230-gallon fuel tanks and killing all eight people
aboard as the helicopter exploded into a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   The Army issued a press release blaming the accident on pilot
error. But accident investigators noted that the crew would have
survived had it not been for the external fuel tanks rupturing and
causing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate written response to the Dayton Daily News, Army
officials at the Pentagon said the external fuel tanks were
designed to be jettisoned from the helicopter and not intended to
be ``directly involved in every helicopter crash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely that a tank designed with any different
specifications would have made a difference in the crash,'' the
written response says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said tests are under way on a safer tank but that the
Army still allows the Blackhawks to fly with the old tanks.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A team of federal investigators suspect that four
CH-47D Chinook helicopter accidents that killed seven people may be
linked to faulty gears manufactured in Chicago and at a now-defunct
factory in Springfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Records, released after being kept under seal for years by a
federal court, show investigators also have tried to link at least
three other crashes that killed 13 people to the gears. Each of the
helicopters that crashed had gears made with a metal that
investigators suspect may contain a potentially deadly flaw.
</P>
<P>
   In August, armies worldwide grounded hundreds of Chinooks after
a British Royal Air Force maintenance facility in Scotland found
grinding cracks in gear parts made with the same metal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army initially grounded its entire fleet of 466
CH-47Ds, the most Chinooks ever put down at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The metal, Vasco X2M, is used on gears that power the eight
25-foot rotor blades on the Chinook. Vasco was first used on
helicopter gears by Boeing, which patented a process to heat-treat
the metal.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the failures of Vasco-made gears in the
CH-47D helicopters illustrates one of the most significant
anomalies in military aviation: Private aircraft companies are
allowed to help _ relied on heavily in many cases _ determine the
official causes of military aviation accidents, even though the
same companies can faceup to hundreds of millions of dollars in
civil judgments and penalties that may hinge on what the official
causes of the accidents are determined to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, as Boeing was faced with lawsuits questioning the
safety of its products, it was allowed to examine evidence and play
other key roles in helping the Army decide if those same products
were endangering the lives of American service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing contracted with SPECO Corp. of Springfield, now in
bankruptcy, and Litton Precision Gears of Chicago, now Boeing
Precision Gears, to manufacture the gears.
</P>
<P>
   Litton used SKF Industries of Philadelphia and MRC Bearings of
Jamestown, N.Y., to manufacture bearings for the gears. It is those
bearings that triggered the current groundings.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began investigating after Brett Roby, an
inspector at SPECO, warned of cracks in gears made with Vasco. Roby
eventually lost his job in a management reorganization, and filed a
lawsuit in May 1995 against Boeing in federal court in Cincinnati
under the federal False Claims Act. The act encourages government
whistleblowers and other citizens to report government contractor
fraud by offering a reward _ in the Roby case up to 25 percent of
what the government recovers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Boeing, the world's largest aircraft
manufacturer, violated federal and common law because it ``sold, or
caused to be sold,'' defective helicopter gears to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department intervened in Roby's lawsuit in April
1997. Although Roby's lawsuit deals only with SPECO-made gears, the
investigation has expanded to include accidents involving aircraft
with gears made at Litton.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Army and Boeing defended Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vasco is manufactured according to specifications and
made into gears correctly, the Army has verified that it is safe
for use in the helicopters,'' a prepared statement from the Army
says.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials deny that any Litton-made gears were linked to
crashes. They acknowledged that some SPECO gears and gear parts
machined at MRC were faulty, but they blamed the problem on human
error, not on Vasco.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, manufacturers produce faulty gears, Boeing
officials said, but inspections are supposed to identify bad gears.
Both SPECO and MRC failed to identify the problem gear parts
through inspections, the officials said, and that caused the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have been caught,'' said Boeing attorney Mitchell
S. Ettinger during an interview at Boeing's corporate office in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   John Bozogan, vice president of quality assurance and
engineering for MRC Bearings, said the company performed
inspections exactly as it was told by Boeing. But, he added: ``At
the time, Boeing was modifying the inspection requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the grinding cracks that led to the current
grounding, Bozogan said: ``We are concerned that we did not find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fatal crashes through the years
</P>
<P>
   The first crash involving the CH-47D came in 1985, in Honduras.
The helicopter was destroyed but the crew escaped with no injuries.
An Army report found that two gear parts made of Vasco broke into
eight pieces each, and Boeing identified what it believed were
``grinding cracks'' on one of the Litton-made gears. The Army
report found that the gear problems did not cause the accident, but
the service ordered better inspections to identify cracks in gears.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on July 11, 1985, a Boeing test pilot and
three other crew members took one of the first CH-47D models for a
test flight from the company's plant in Pennsylvania. At 5,000 feet
over New Jersey, the pilot heard a loud explosion coming from the
rear of the helicopter, and smoke filled the cockpit. He parachuted
to safety, but two other crew members were killed, one hit by a
rotor blade as he tried to parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Roby's attorneys and federal investigators suspect the 1985 New
Jersey crash was linked to Vasco gears manufactured by Litton in
Chicago. However, Boeing officials said the New Jersey crash was
caused by a transmission problem, not a gear problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no proof it was a gear failure,'' said Ettinger,
Boeing's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A CH-47D crashed near Chico, Texas, northwest of Dallas in
February 1988, killing 10 people and permanently injuring six
others. Paul Patricio lost both of his hands in the fire, and his
face and much of the rest of his body were severely burned. He
filed a lawsuit against Boeing in 1989, and won a settlement for an
undisclosed amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military never determined the exact cause of the 1988 crash.
Army investigators noted that problems found on a gear were
``interpreted differently by several engineers and investigators,''
but the Army said those problems did not cause the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said the Texas crash had nothing to do with
gear failure, and investigators involved in the ongoing probe
disagree over whether the crash could have been caused by the Vasco
gears.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, on Dec. 8, 1988, all five crew members died
when another CH-47D crashed in Honduras. Federal investigators
suspect a Vasco gear was responsible for the crash, and Boeing
officials acknowledge that a gear did fail. However, they said the
gear failure itself did not cause the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something acted on that gear and caused it to fail,'' Ettinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing settled a lawsuit filed by the families of the three dead
airmen, according to their attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Congress held hearings into the Chinook crashes in 1990. A team
of congressional investigators, in a report titled, ``Let the Flyer
Beware,'' found that the Army was ``occasionally slow to react to
serious aircraft problems, tending to wait until disaster strikes
before addressing them.'' Often, even when the Army does address a
problem, the report says, it is a ``Band-Aid solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the hearings, a Chinook flying at night over
Fort Campbell, Ky., lost power and crashed, killing three of the
five people on board. The family of the instructor pilot, Chief
Warrant Officer Dale W. Tate, sued Boeing, claiming the cargo hook
was defective. The court dismissed the case in 1995, but Tate's
attorney, Brian Alexander of New York, is trying to get the civil
case reopened because, in light of the current federal
investigation, he suspects the cause could be linked to Vasco
gears, not to the cargo hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Roby's attorneys also are interested
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tate crash sequence is, in many respects, similar to the
crash sequence of other Chinooks,'' says a request by the Justice
Department to get records from Tate's civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court in Cincinnati has ordered Boeing to allow the
Justice Department to inspect certain gears from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Two more CH-47D crashes occurred in the early 1990s: on Jan. 11,
1991, in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm, and June 24, 1993, in
Maryland. Both helicopters had gears manufactured at SPECO.
</P>
<P>
   There were no deaths in either accident, although some
passengers and crew members escaped the burning helicopter in Saudi
Arabia by climbing through broken windows. Both the Army and SPECO
blamed the crash on manufacturing defects in a SPECO-made gear, and
vowed to step up inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also acknowledged that a gear was to blame in the
Maryland accident, but said it was due to human error: A SPECO
worker, they say, made a mistake trying to remove a sharp edge from
a gear surface.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whistleblower's story
</P>
<P>
   Roby, who now lives in Arkansas, once stopped the production
line at SPECO because of what he said were structural flaws in the
metal used to construct the gears.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roby, in 1993, two high-ranking SPECO officials
asked him to stop testing gears. He said he had found flaws called
continuous innergranular carbide networking, a problem similar to a
crack on a piece of wood or plastic that can cause splitting or
cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my managers know we had this condition,'' Roby said.
``We had three out of three that were bad. I was starting to get
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   He then contacted the Defense Criminal Investigative Service
(DCIS) office in Dayton, a civilian agency empowered to investigate
fraud, waste and abuse in the Department of Defense. Three months
later, he was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department later joined as a plaintiff in the
Roby lawsuit, which is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, workers at a Royal Air Force
maintenance center in Scotland found cracks on a gear part, an RAF
spokesman said. The part, which is made of Vasco, holds bearings in
a gear assembly, or raceway, on which the bearings move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Boeing representative on site,'' the RAF spokesman
said. ``It was brought to his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAF grounded its Chinooks, called Mark 2s by the RAF, on
Aug. 7 or 8, the RAF spokesman said. The U.S. Army grounded its
fleet Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined the risk to be very high,'' said Mark J. Jeude
of the Army's Aviation-Engineering Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, the Army returned half its Chinook fleet to duty but
restricted them to 80 percent engine power.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.''
</P>
<P>
   And records show it had been.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton Daily News examination found that in the months
preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash, the engine had been on two
other F-16s and removed after pilots reported smoke and fumes in
their cockpits.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, 1988, the pilot of an F-16 from Shaw Air Force Base,
S.C., reported smoke and fumes coming from behind the pilot's seat,
causing the pilot to become nauseated and his eyes to water. To fix
the problem, mechanics put a new engine on the plane, and the
problem seemed to have been solved.
</P>
<P>
   At least for that plane.
</P>
<P>
   The engine they took off the plane, number 703938, was put on
another F-16. And the following month, on July 18, 1988, the pilot
of the F-16 which now had engine 703938 reported smoke and fumes in
his cockpit, apparently caused by oil leaking from an engine fan.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on Sept. 13, 1988, engine 703938 was on
still another F-16, piloted by Capt. Ronald J. Garan. Shortly after
he raised the landing gear, while the engine had less than six
hours flight time since installation, Garan heard a loud bang,
followed by an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a violent explosion that shook the aircraft and knocked
my feet off the rudder pedals,'' he told investigators. ``I knew I
had to get out of the aircraft so I looked in front of me and I saw
trailer parks and houses everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Garan ejected, and the F-16 crashed into a residential area in
Sumter, S.C., near Shaw Air Force Base, setting a house on fire and
injuring eight people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it (the plane) ignite and saw the fireball sweep just to
the right of the house that caught fire, and I actually saw the
windows blow out of the house,'' Garan said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured, William Smith, 59, was severely burned over
50 percent of his body. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see where the main fuselage went through the
neighborhood,'' said Michael Brodie, who watched the plane's
descent from his pickup truck. ``There were holes in several of the
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I saw was a man running from our right. He was
burned bad, real bad. Someone was hollering, `There is a baby.
There is a baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John M. Spratt told a local newspaper reporter at the
time that the F-16 was ``trouble free.'' The engine was not
specifically mentioned. Spratt's press secretary, Chuck Fant, said
in a recent interview that Spratt made the statement after speaking
to the Air Force public affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center, acknowledged that all three incidents involved
engine failures. But, he said, unlike the two prior incidents,
there was no report of smoke and fumes in the cockpit prior to the
Garan crash.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hetem Regjepi struggled in his native Kosovo because
Serb-owned businesses refused to hire ethnic Albanians like him.
But after just five months in New York City, he earns $15 an hour
as a hotel housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Regjepi, a high school graduate who speaks little English,
signed up for a free job-assistance program that not only arranged
his interview at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan but also sent a
translator to help him fill out the application.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I tried to get a job by myself, but it
was very hard,'' Regjepi, 29, said through a translator at the
Bronx office of the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit
resettlement group that assists refugees. ``I was confused,'' he
recalled of his first days in the United States. ``Back in my
country, we don't have so many questions. But now I have a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Regjepi was among the 14,000 Kosovo refugees brought over by the
United States beginning in May to ease overflowing refugee camps in
Macedonia. Many began returning home in July after NATO forces
reached a truce with Milosevic's Serbian-led government.
</P>
<P>
   But others like Regjepi have plunged successfully into
mainstream life around New York because of employment and
social-service programs created or expanded for them. The extra
help has made it possible for several hundred refugees to start a
new life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an income. I have to work to pay my apartment. I
need money to live here, so this helps me a lot,'' Kreshnik Demaj,
19, said through a translator who was helping him prepare for job
interviews at the rescue committee's Bronx office.
</P>
<P>
   Le Lieu Browne, manager of the International Rescue Committee's
jobs program, said that she had placed Regjepi and 55 other Kosovo
refugees in entry-level jobs at hotels, department stores, and
manufacturing and industrial companies. An additional 200 refugees
are seeking similar help.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Browne's program hired five Albanian-speaking case workers
from among the refugees to offer counseling on everything from how
to dress for a job interview to how to answer questions. The
committee also offers English classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to understand that the first year will be a
hardship, especially if they don't speak English and have no
American experience,'' Mrs. Browne said. A doctor or engineer
``can't get that kind of job here, but they have to start
somewhere,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the International Rescue Committee and seven
other groups have been strengthened by a grant totaling nearly $1
million that the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance gave them in July.
</P>
<P>
   The resettlement groups have used the state grant to find
full-time jobs for Kosovo refugees and introduce a full range of
transition services, like classes on American culture, mental
health counseling, summer programs for children and even field
trips to the Bronx Zoo and other New York landmarks.

   The Church Avenue Merchants Block Association Inc., a nonprofit
group based in Brooklyn that has sponsored refugees since 1982,
used part of its $260,000 grant to find work for 55 Kosovars and
assist 250 more, said Joanne Oplustil, the association's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   The group offers English classes and has sponsored weekend
outings for teen-agers at museums, libraries and parks. In
addition, through a center in Brooklyn, the group hands out free
food, clothing and furniture to families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have intense needs,'' Ms. Oplustil said. ``They
literally came with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Regjepi said the extra services have not only made him feel at
home but also given him a glimmer of the promising life ahead. In
his short time in New York, he has earned recognition as an
exemplary employee at the St. Regis and was promoted to the day
shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has his own plans, his own dreams, and somebody
likes it here, and somebody doesn't,'' said Regjepi, who recently
moved his wife and young daughter into an apartment in Brooklyn.
``But I like it here and I want to stay.''

ON STATEN ISLAND, A LANDMARK 1959 WRIGHT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The house had been on the market, on and off, for
years. Depending on your perspective, it is a very 1950s house that
needs to be modernized with new baths and a new kitchen _ or it's
an architectural treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Cass has lived in the house for 40 years _ since it
was built _ and in that time has changed it very little. The drapes
are the same, as is much of the furniture. The red and black clock
originally built into the kitchen wall remains, as does the
intercom system, complete with radio. In the living room, the
built-in stereo system is still intact, with the original turntable
and eight-track cassette player.
</P>
<P>
   Red Formica still covers the kitchen counters, and the electric
burners still dominate the kitchen island. There is no Subzero
refrigerator here, no minimalist light-filtering shades to let in
the evocative treetop views from Lighthouse Hill on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mrs. Cass seems startled, and a bit annoyed, every time
a question is raised: Is this drapery the same? Is this chair from
then? Is this the same tile? Yes, yes, yes, she answers, impatient.
Why would she change anything, she asks, that had been specified by
Frank Lloyd Wright?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed a thing,'' she says. ``He was way ahead of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wright didn't personally oversee the construction of
the house, it was built from his design, and most of the original
materials he specified remain, down to the yellow drapes in the
bedroom and the typical Wright wood end tables in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mrs. Cass sold the house for $800,000, after
originally trying to get more than 1 million shortly after her
husband, William, died in 1983, and more recently asking $890,000.
In a few days, she will move into an apartment in another section
of Staten Island, closer to one of her three grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers don't want to discuss the purchase, according to Marc
Schulman, who with Brian Moore signed a contract to sell the house
while they were at Falcon Properties; they have recently left to
start their own agency, the Real Estate Exchange. But, he said, the
buyers are Wright aficionados and had no problem with purchasing a
designated New York City landmark _ a status that restricts their
exterior renovation options.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, this is the only house in New York City designed
by the famous architect, best known here for his Guggenheim Museum.
It was built late in his life from a plan for prefab moderate-cost
housing. The components were made in a Midwest factory and shipped
to Staten Island for construction under the supervision of a Wright
associate, Morton H. Delson, according to the ``Guide to New York
City Landmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a dozen of these houses for the masses were ever
built. Wright had planned to tour the Staten Island house, but
shortly before his scheduled arrival he became ill and died at age
92 on April 9, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the house, according to Mrs. Cass, came
about quite serendipitously, when she and her husband were living
in Queens and thinking about building a house in Staten Island. Her
husband, who owned an employment agency, saw Wright being
interviewed on a television program. He suggested to his wife that
she contact Wright and ask him to build them a house. He had never
heard of Wright, she said, but she had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all about him,'' she says. ``I happened to be a reader.
I read anything and everything.'' She knew from her reading that
Wright typically had an imperious disregard for the costs of
realizing his visions. ``I forewarned him,'' Mrs. Cass said of her
husband, that Wright ``doesn't stop to think about the All-American
dollar.''
</P>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Cass says she can't remember exactly what the
house cost, April Cass, one of her daughters, believes it cost
about $100,000, many thousands more than the original budget, to
build the two-story house, beginning in 1958 and finishing in 1959.
In many ways it is a simple home, with a living room, eat-in
kitchen, three small bedrooms and a master bedroom stretched out on
the main floor. Below, another floor that opens to a swimming pool
has a small kitchen, a bath, a room with a pool table, space for an
office, and a large storage area with a walk-in refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   It is filled with light, blessed with gracious proportions, and
has a large amount of well-designed storage, with cabinets running
the length of the wide hallway that leads to the bedrooms. The
overwhelming feeling is of wood and woodiness. Even the closet
doors in the bedrooms match the walls, which are covered with
Philippine mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   As with all Wright projects, even the smallest details, like the
mailbox, were specified, instead of being left to homeowners who
might ruin the architecture with their own taste.
</P>
<P>
   Certain of Wright's requirements fit nicely into what the Casses
wanted. Growing up, Mrs. Cass had wanted to play the piano, but her
parents wouldn't let her. With this house, she got one, she says,
because ``there is always a piano in a Frank Lloyd Wright home.''
But she never learned to play: ``I didn't have time, between the
house and the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Cass didn't tamper with the architecture, she did
change her decorations every season. For instance, she would never
leave a painting of roses on the wall during the winter, when they
weren't growing outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she had liked best about living in the house, Mrs.
Cass declined to single out any one aspect. ``I never thought about
what I liked best,'' she says. Her daughter April, a graphic artist
in Staten Island, says that the house was a wonderful place to grow
up. To her, it was just home _ and so in college, she was startled
when a friend became angry that she hadn't thought to tell her she
had grown up in a Frank Lloyd Wright house.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cass says she has been happy to meet all the visitors who
began arriving, and signing her autograph book, after the house was
declared a landmark in August 1990. ``I didn't realize how many
people would come, especially students,'' she says. ``They were
shocked that I would let them in. But how else do you learn?''
</P>
<P>
   She believes in keeping things as they are, in preserving their
essential nature. ``We don't keep things the way they should be, in
this country,'' she says. ``You go to France, and you know you're
in France. You go to Greece, and you know you're in Greece.''
Although she is happy to let visitors see the house, she doesn't
like to be photographed herself. ``I'm not here for picture
taking,'' she says. ``It isn't about me.''
</P>
<P>
   To many, the house is known by the name bestowed by the Casses,
Crimson Beech, after an old copper beech that stood in the yard,
but to Wright scholars it is Prefab No. 1. The fact of Wright's
involvement is marked just inside the entry, by a small red ceramic
square with his initials. But his control over the details is what
really gives the identity of the architect away. In the bedroom,
the full-length mirror is built into a wall, so one couldn't be
slapped on later to detract from the angles and planes.
</P>
<P>
   After giving a tour, Mrs. Cass is asked whether she would do
anything different if she had another chance to build a Frank Lloyd
Wright house.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says. ``No. He was darn good. He thought of
everything.''

THE BUILDING AS TRADEMARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metes and bounds once sufficed to determine the
ownership of real estate. But a new kind of property dispute _
intellectual property _ is raising novel questions as to who
controls the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Take the landmark Flatiron Building. Both the building's owner,
Newmark &AMP; Co. Real Estate Inc., and an Internet-oriented venture
capital firm called Flatiron Partners have sought to register an
image of the structure as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. The case illustrates a growing inclination by the
owners of unique structures to assert a trademark right to the
design of their buildings and thereby control and even limit how
images are used.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of U.S. District
Court in Manhattan dismissed a lawsuit by the New York Stock
Exchange against the New York-New York Hotel and Casino of Las
Vegas, which has a one-third scale model of the famous Broad Street
facade on its gambling floor as the ``New York-New York $lot
Exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stock Exchange argued that the trademark value of the
facade, which is registered (No. 1761655), was being diluted and
tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Cedarbaum found that the trademark was not sufficiently
distinctive to suffer dilution. ``Many prominent buildings in the
United States and elsewhere have classical facades with Corinthian
columns and bas-relief figures on a pediment,'' she wrote. And she
said the Big Board ``is not likely to suffer injury to its business
reputation merely because customers or potential customers of the
casino make a mental connection'' to the Stock Exchange when they
see the $lot Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Stock Exchange will appeal the decision, said one of its
lawyers, Doreen L. Costa of Baker &AMP; Botts.
</P>
<P>
   The tug-of-war over the Flatiron almost made it to federal
court, but in a settlement last month, Flatiron Partners agreed to
license the image from Newmark and withdraw its trademark
application.
</P>
<P>
   Flatiron Partners is in 257 Park Ave. South, at 21st Street; not
the Flatiron Building. It chose the skyscraper as an emblem of
Silicon Alley, where many Internet enterprises are hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Newmark, which acquired an ownership interest in the Flatiron
Building in 1997, objected when Flatiron Partners sought to
register a trademark with a high-contrast image of the top of the
prow-like structure. Then Newmark sued, charging that the logo was
``likely to deceive, confuse or mislead'' the public into thinking
there was a connection between the investment firm and Newmark or
its property. ``We do in fact control the trademark rights to the
building,'' said James D. Kuhn of Newmark. ``We're not trying to
stop general photography of New York City or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keri A. Christ of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, a lawyer for
Newmark, said the settlement ``hopefully stands as an
acknowledgment of the fact that the owners of distinctive
architectural works or constructed buildings have intellectual
property rights in the designs of those buildings if they're used
in connection with their business.'' She said the amount of the
licensing fee was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colonna, a founder and managing partner of Flatiron
Partners, said the firm is ``very happy'' with the settlement,
which enables it to continue using a ``powerful, powerful image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we'd established a brand in our space of the world,
separate from architecture and real estate,'' he said. ``Like
anybody who's created a brand, we certainly don't take branding
lightly.''

PRO BASKETBALL NOTEBOOK: HARDAWAY'S NEW TATTOO; O'NEAL HEARS THE
TICKING OF THE CLOCK; RAPTORS POINT FINGERS; RILEY REMINISCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anfernee Hardaway walked into Ancient Art, a tattoo parlor in
Memphis, Tenn., this summer with one simple request. He wanted
something printed on his right arm that signaled his rebirth as an
outstanding player after his last few frustrating years in Orlando.
He wanted something to capture his arrival in Phoenix, where he
will team with Jason Kidd to form, on paper, the most potent
backcourt in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking one night,'' he said recently, ``what can I do
to put something on my arm that reminds me of all this mayhem
that's gone on in my career?''
</P>
<P>
   He came up with ``Heaven Cent, Part II.'' The cent, he made
clear, refers to his nickname Penny rather than the $87 million
contract he signed with the Suns in the off-season. Having the
thick, black Roman letters tattooed, he said, was among the most
physically painful experiences of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It still hurt less than the last two seasons in Orlando, where
Hardaway went from being a potential heir to Michael Jordan to
being just another petulant young star trying to run an NBA
franchise by himself. He led a 1997 revolt against the Magic's
former coach, Brian Hill, was accused of taking his sweet time
getting healthy instead of helping the team during injuries last
season, and had a falling out with coach Chuck Daly that was a
factor in Daly's retiring from the game for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got myself in a situation thatdn't win in, and I
continued to talk and it made it worse,'' Hardaway said. Like Grant
Hill in Detroit for a while, he had trouble picking up Jordan's
torch and carrying the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of pressure on me in Orlando and Grant
in Detroit,'' he said. ``The pressure of us being labeled
superstars and not getting it done was there. I went to the finals,
but we didn't win. It seemed like anything else was not good enough
after that. I never said I was the next Michael Jordan or anything.
I just wanted to win basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Phoenix and Kidd, who has possibly surpassed Gary
Payton as the top point guard in the game, came in. While Hardaway
was making a decision on his future and Orlando was trying to find
a way to sign and trade him, Kidd telephoned him several times
before he signed.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's message: ``We want you here, we need you here and nobody
has any beef about you coming. It's going to be a family
atmosphere. You're going to win. It's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said of Kidd: ``He's awesome. He makes so many good
plays happen, controls the game and never gives up in anything he
does. It's super playing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   These marriages between All-Stars don't always last, as Hardaway
learned in Orlando in 1996, when Shaquille O'Neal left for the
Lakers. Who knows how much time will pass before Hardaway can't
keep from saying all the wrong things again and antagonizing an
entire community? For now, though, he has a new lease on his career
and does not have to carry a franchise all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   It May Be Now or Never
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Alonzo Mourning did not match up last week
in the Great Western Forum Shootout featuring Miami, the Lakers,
Phoenix and Golden State. But the game's two most dominant true
centers did share a common thought: Time is running out for their
teams to make a run toward the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that for the most part, this is our year,'' said
Mourning, whose Heat has been knocked out by the Knicks in the
first round the past two years. ``I really feel that. We've been
together for four years, gone through some adverse situations. But
we've grown and matured from that and we've still got the same
nucleus of guys. And we've improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get settled and adjusted to these new rule changes and
we start taking care of the basketball a little more, we're going
to be a dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is not predicting a championship, but he feels the Lakers
need to finally overcome their worst nemesis: themselves. ``If we
don't win it, it'll be a failure,'' he said. ``It's a real tough
conference. Everybody stacked the deck. For us, it's always been,
if we play hard and do everything right, we're a hard team to beat.
If we screw around and go through the same mess, it's going to be a
long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Lakers had been given enough time to mature as a
team, he said: ``Probably not. I'm probably to blame for that
because I don't have patience, either. Like this house around the
corner I really want to get. People want me to build my house. I
don't want to build my house. I want the house around the corner.
So I'm going to go ahead and get it. For resale value, it'll be a
bad buy because it's a custom house. But I want it. And I want it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also damped down the rumors that he and Kobe Bryant can't
coexist on the same floor. That idea gained steam before training
camp last season when the two engaged in a slap fight during a
workout.
</P>

   ``I'm Kobe's big brother,'' O'Neal said. ``I'm going to get on
him. He's going to get on me. We're going to get on each other.
That's just how brothers are. It's nothing personal. We know what
we both want.''

   Romper Room Session
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Antonio Davis' words last week, Charles Oakley has
another player to help him babysit the Toronto locker room. After
the Raptors lost their first two preseason games to Milwaukee and
the Los Angeles Clippers, Davis, the former Indiana forward,
demanded a players-only meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers were pointed in the direction of Vince Carter and Tracy
McGrady, who only happen to be two of the most exciting young
players in the league. Carter and McGrady were said to have been
throwing down monstrous dunks and engaging fans and other players
in banter while Toronto was losing badly.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Butch Carter and Davis thought both players got caught up
in entertaining the fans. ``This game is a lot more than having two
kids go out and excite the crowd,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My good players must learn there is a proper
field-goal-attempts-to-points ratio,'' Butch Carter said. ``It's
something a kid doesn't know. It's up to me to teach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and the veteran point guard Muggsy Bogues did all the
talking during the meeting. The Raptors then won their next two
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Davis added, ``When you lose to the Clippers, it's time to stand
up and say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Metal Chairs and Memories
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley recently had his Miami contract extended and was given
a part-ownership stake in American Airlines Arena, the soon-to-be
new home of the Heat. So no one knows the need for a nouveau
technodrome more than the president and coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything else,'' he said. ``The game has changed,
the talent has changed and the marketing has created a different
perception. And obviously, the economics require suites because
people want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even Riley got nostalgic late last week when the
final NBA game was played at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood,
Calif. The Lakers, the Heat, the Warriors and the Suns closed down
the building for league business with preseason doubleheaders on
consecutive nights. The dimly lighted arena, which has metal
folding chairs and not much more in the way of accouterments, was
where Riley led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s. It
will be replaced by the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Forum was the place where a 6-foot-5-inch defensive
specialist out of Kentucky got one of his first assignments. ``I
think I opened the building as a San Diego Rocket,'' Riley said.
``Jerry West got 44 on us _ and me. And I was here during the glory
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forum is just the latest arena to be spurned by the league
or demolished in recent years, following the Boston Garden, the
Spectrum in Philadelphia, McNichols Arena in Denver, the Memorial
Coliseum in Portland, Ore., and venerable Chicago Stadium, razed
for a parking lot across from the United Center. As dingy
crackerboxes with more memories than luxury boxes go, there's only
Reunion Arena in Dallas, the Compaq Center (formerly the Summit) in
Houston and Madison Square Garden in New York left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of great events here,'' Riley said, standing
in the corridor where his NBA career began. ``I'm talking about
concerts, too. I can remember going to see Elton John, I can
remember going to see the Eagles. I remember the heavyweight
championship fight between Ken Norton and Muhammad Ali, all the
games that I played in and also coached. It was a great part of
me.''

COMMENTARY: A POLYGLOT CITY THAT DREAMS IN ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ Question: Why did the Clifton City Council adopt
an English-only policy for city notices?
</P>
<P>
   Official answer: Because English is the language of this
country, and people should learn it so they can find the American
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what does the city of Clifton care what dream people
find?
</P>
<P>
   A: We already do lots to help immigrants get settled, get around
and learn English in school, and they appreciate that help. So we
should encourage them to get used to using the language, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because this is America.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they have practical reasons for becoming the
only city in New Jersey to make English the only language for
nonemergency public notices.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that immigrant groups tend to complain when
notices in their language seem to be aimed only at them. This
happened in the summer, when the only foreign languages a warning
about loud car radios was printed in were Spanish and Arabic _ not,
say, Polish or Ukrainian or Korean, or any of the other languages
people speak here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a city that is alive with the music of immigrant tongues,
where even some of the city leaders are foreign-born, the matter of
language seems to reach beyond the practical and down to something
more inexpressibly basic, down to the level of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it from the perspective of a child coming here and
not knowing any English,'' said Stefan Tatarenko, the councilman
who sponsored the English-only rule, and who moved to the United
States from Germany as a child. ``We did not have
English-as-a-second-language instruction as we have now. We didn't
have bilingual education as we have now, and yet I learned it by
the time I was in the third grade.''
</P>
<P>
   The English-only rule was adopted nearly two months ago. So far,
the city has received criticism in editorials and expressions of
concern from civil rights groups, but no legal efforts have been
made to block the new rule. Judging by a nonscientific sample,
foreign-born residents in Clifton seemed more likely than the
native-born to agree with Tatarenko on English only.
</P>
<P>
   Take Maricel Godoy, who was born in Colombia and who now works
for Latin American Travel on Clifton Avenue. Thanks to bilingual
education rules, seven of the eight classes she took in her last
year at Kennedy High School in Paterson, next door to Clifton, were
held in Spanish. Now, 10 years later, she is conscious of her
Spanish-influenced pronunciation and says she wishes she had been
made to speak English more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In school, we never had to speak English,'' Ms. Godoy said.
``But English is America's language, and if they want us to use it,
I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   But then listen to Elaf Abdeljabbar. Born next door in Passaic
of Palestinian immigrant parents and raised in local schools, she's
a Jersey girl right down to her glossy fingernails and her
no-nonsense way of handling nosy reporters. And she thinks the
English-only ordinance is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here are fuming about it because they think
Clifton is very prejudiced,'' Ms. Abdeljabbar said while she waited
on customers at her father's store, Al Aqsa Trading Co. ``You have
to speak the language and eventually you're going to learn it, but
what are the new people going to do? Learn it in a week?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kowal, another councilman, suggested that taking some
time to learn English was fine with him. He just didn't want
immigrants to put it off too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe that if my grandparents had just stayed in
their community and just known Polish, they would never have
bettered themselves,'' Kowal said. ``After all,'' he said, in a
phrase that explained everything, ``this is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abdeljabbar's father, Mohammed Gabber, thought it was a fuss
about nothing. ``They can use any language they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, in the East Side's Polish neighborhoods, the Rev.
Waclaw Sokolowski sat reading his breviary at St. John Kanty Roman
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it seems right that they should want to use English,''
said Sokolowski, who came to the United States from the outskirts
of Gdansk 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also believe it depends on how large the community is,''
Sokolowski went on, hunting for a solution. ``There is nothing
wrong with helping people.''

MIDNIGHT TALKS HELPED TO CLOSE DEAL ON BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert definition of Citigroup in 3rd graf. No other
changes.)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a fund-raiser at the home here of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., shortly after 6 o'clock on Thursday evening,
President Clinton asked one of his closest friends in the Senate,
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., how the talks were going with
Republicans over the most important financial legislation since the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd was not optimistic about the bill, which had reached the
point of do or die. After four days of bitter polemic between Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,
and administration officials, the two sides were stuck over highly
symbolic and racially tinged community lending rules that
threatened to rip the legislation apart.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions had become so poisoned by Thursday night that
Gramm threatened both the White House's top economic adviser, Gene
Sperling, and the head of the nation's largest financial-services
company, Citigroup, that he would pull the plug on the bill,
something neither the administration nor Wall Street wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodd returned to the Capitol and, with a handful of other
Democrats from the Banking Committee, slowly managed to turn Gramm
around in an emotional confrontation in a tiny back office crammed
with three dozen lawmakers, aides and administration officials.
There, they agreed to split a critical difference _ giving Gramm
one provision he wanted that would make community lending advocates
more accountable, and giving the White House what it wanted by
making sure banks provided credit in poor communities before
entering new lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 o'clock on Friday morning, a few scant hours after his
pessimistic report to the president, Dodd and other exhausted
Democratic lawmakers placed a telephone call to a weary Lawrence
Summers, the treasury secretary, to report that they had clinched a
deal with Gramm to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. After
eluding its advocates for decades, the agreement to deregulate Wall
Street, favored by many of the nation's most powerful business
interests, was struck.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in the middle of the night was the final chapter in
a saga that began in 1934, when Sen. Carter Glass himself tried to
undo the law that put his name into the history books. The meeting
capped a month of posturing, brinkmanship and deal-making in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And its outcome is expected to bring about one of the most
important changes in decades in the laws governing the nation's
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   This account of the roller-coaster ride of the Financial
Services Act of 1999 is based on interviews with leading Democratic
and Republican lawmakers, senior officials at the White House, the
Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, and industry
executives and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Their horse-trading involved several deals. One, over a new
regulatory system that may wind up governing the nation's banks for
much of the next century, was reached two weeks ago between Summers
and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, after
months of debate about their visions of the marketplace. The
agreement between Summers and Greenspan to share regulatory powers
is a centerpiece of the legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall
Act.
</P>
<P>
   A legacy of the Great Depression, the act shattered the House of
Morgan and divided Wall Street into investment banks and commercial
banks on the theory that this would lower the risks of economic
catastrophes like the stock market crash and banking crisis of the
time. Later laws would make it difficult for banks to sell
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Wall Street sought to repeal Glass-Steagall, and
for decades Congress was unable to deliver, largely because the
three competing industries, at war over the shape of the
legislation, lobbied the lawmakers into a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1997 when three leading banking and
securities lobbyists met at lunch and formed an alliance. A few
months later, lobbyists from the insurance industry joined the
group. Slowly the industry battle faded, and as the united alliance
approached Congress and the White House, a new momentum developed
to repeal Glass-Steagall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obstacles remained. Foremost was a turf battle between
the Treasury and the Fed. Both agencies supervise banks, but it was
not clear which would have the lead over the financial
conglomerates that would now be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The White House took the position that Treasury needed to play
an important role in bank regulation in order for the Executive
Branch to implement economic policy. But Greenspan said that for
financial conglomerates, the Treasury's formulation would enable
securities firms and insurers to unfairly take advantage of the
special government subsidies intended only for federally insured
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Summers took office early in July, he decided he
would take a stab at the issue, and ordered Gary Gensler, the
undersecretary of the Treasury, to prepare options for a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new legislation, congressional leaders urged Greenspan
and Summers to come up with their own solution to the regulatory
question or have one foisted on them. Two months into Summers'
term, the two men sat for the first of many discussions on economic
theory aimed at a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were two world-class economists who were trying to find
a solution,'' said one top administration official involved in the
negotiations. ``They were both willing to grind this down to the
facts, to the point where they both allowed each other's agency to
share data even if that data contradicted what they were saying
about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has told associates that he believed the talks
ultimately succeeded because the two men spoke the same economic
language, looking at such issues as marginal costs, subsidies and
equities. He concluded that such a deal could never have been cut
by lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours of Oct. 14, Greenspan and Summers
brokered a complex arrangement. Both agencies would share authority
under a regime in which new financial conglomerates would not be
able to take broad advantage of the economic subsidies that are
provided to federally insured banks.
</P>
<P>
   That resolved a fundamental difference between the House and
Senate versions of the legislation and propelled the measure into
high gear. Still, by the beginning of last week, there were a few
remaining barriers to a deal between Gramm and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton returned on Monday night from a trip to New Jersey,
he was informed that there had been no significant progress between
Gramm and the administration over the Community Reinvestment Act.
``It's going to be a long night of baseball and CRA,'' he told his
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Detested by Gramm, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was
intended to eradicate discrimination in lending. Gramm vowed that
his bill would never expand the application of the act, and
insisted that the new measure should exempt thousands of smaller
institutions from its provisions. At the urging of civil rights
groups, the administration insisted that the new law could do
nothing to roll back the 1977 act.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the administration insisted that any bank
interested in expanding into new lines of business must have and
maintain a satisfactory record of community lending. For his part,
Gramm was also insisting that community groups be forced to
disclose any agreements that they reached with banks to increase
their lending to minorities and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night it became clear that House and Senate
negotiators still faced a wide gulf over the Community Reinvestment
Act. Gramm summoned Summers and Sperling. But two hours of talk
accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In later meetings with White House aides, the senator made clear
that he thought Clinton would never veto a financial services bill
just as Hillary Rodham Clinton was preparing to run for the Senate
from New York, whose biggest industry is Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials believed that Gramm's political
calculation was flawed. While Wall Street is an important
constituent of any New York senator, they figured, so are the
minorities and disadvantaged New Yorkers who now benefit from the
Community Reinvestment Act. (Both Democrats in Congress and
administration officials said that Mrs. Clinton played no role in
the legislative battle.)
</P>
<P>
   The talks fared no better on Tuesday. They began with
discussions between Sperling, Summers and Gramm. After Sperling
left the discussions to conduct talks on the budget in another
corner of the Capitol, he was summoned back by Summers, who sent a
dire message. ``Larry wants you back,'' Sperling was told. ``It's
all blowing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gramm put forward what he called his final
proposal. At 10 that night, the Treasury Department rejected it,
issuing another threat of a presidential veto in a statement
largely drafted by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., the ranking Democrat
on the Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that Gramm would try to corral some Senate Democrats,
top White House officials met on Thursday morning with Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, and the nine Democrats on the
Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House concerns were well grounded. That same day,
Gramm held a teleconference with top business executives from
around the nation, urging them to call three of the Senate
Democrats most favorably disposed toward the legislation: Charles
Schumer of New York, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tim Johnson of South
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services industry's top lobbyists trooped to
Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon to implore the majority leaders
in the House and Senate to postpone any final votes for fear that
they would unravel the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to hold all of his Republican colleagues in line, a
frustrated Gramm was also beginning to show signs that he would
pull the legislation, just as he had killed it last year.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a pivotal vote early Thursday evening that sought
to get the deal that had been rejected by the White House inserted
in the legislation anyway, Gramm issued an ultimatum to the chief
lobbyist for Citigroup, Roger Levy. He told the lobbyist that if
Sanford Weill, the company's top executive, did not call Clinton
promptly, the legislation would be killed. Weill had been in touch
with senior administration officials at least four times that day,
but it is not known whether he placed any calls in response to
Gramm's threat.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Gramm took a telephone away from a White
House aide who was talking to Sperling, and repeated his ultimatum
that absent a quick offer from the administration for a workable
deal, he intended to kill the legislation in the next 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling pleaded for more time, telling Gramm that Dodd and
Schumer were working on a new compromise. Gramm apparently
softened, for as he hung up the telephone, he turned to an aide and
said: ``Where's Chris? I've got to find Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding Dodd, Gramm handed him the amendment that just had
failed and asked that he begin reworking it. Schumer had begun to
enlist the support of other Democrats and Republicans for his own
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The group closeted itself in the tiny office of the House
Banking Committee's staff director with top officials from the
Treasury and the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   At several points, Gramm and Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., the
ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, threatened to walk
out. They were cajoled to stay by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who
headed the conference committee, and Dodd and Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tempers had begun to fray.
</P>
<P>
   When Schumer got animated, Gramm pointedly observed, ``I'm an
old man, but I still have my hearing.'' That prompted Dodd to
observe: ``He's from Brooklyn. That's how they talk there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they whittled away their differences, ending with an
agreement over the last remaining issue, a relatively minor
provision that would require community groups to make some public
disclosures about their financial arrangements with the banks they
have pressed to make more loans to the underserved.
</P>
<P>
   The final agreement gave Gramm what he had ultimately sought _ a
statement in the legislation that the community groups would have
to be more accountable by requiring that they had to disclose their
arrangements with banks. Earlier in the bargaining, Gramm had
acquiesced to the administration's request that no banks with bad
community lending records be allowed to enter into the securities
or insurance businesses. The two sides also agreed to split the
difference on exempting small banks from the Community Reinvestment
Act. Small banks with the best lending records would get fewer
reviews for compliance with the act by federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 in the morning, the business of many years was
done.

HAMED WRESTLES HIS WAY TOWARD ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Off the boxing canvas, when he isn't gyrating, or
taunting his opponents, Prince Naseem Hamed is a smart, laid-back
champion. He is also a businessman, which is why he signed a $48
million contract with HBO for as many as six fights.
</P>
<P>
   In his native England, and throughout the Arab world, he is also
a hero. But in the United States, Hamed is still fighting for
acceptance from both the general public and the boxing fan.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a question from a reporter after his rowdy wrestling
match _ that is, boxing match _ with the featherweight Cesar Soto
was so pertinent. Hamed was asked if he was worried that the
12-round fight, not a thing of beauty by anyone's standards, would
have a negative effect on Hamed's quest for acceptance in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' he said. ``The American public is
going to see a fighter with a good attitude and a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question about that, and Hamed's victory on Friday
night over Soto, who has one of the hardest chins, and one of the
hardest heads, in boxing, was as much about perseverance as it was
about showmanship. Hamed's victory by unanimous decision raised his
record to 33-0 and unified the World Boxing Organization and World
Boxing Council belts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the match should be a cause of concern for the Hamed camp
in its quest for acceptance in the United States. It was an ugly
fight, a fact that was admitted by Hamed and his trainer, Emanuel
Steward. ``It wasn't a pretty fight, no,'' said Steward, ``but
sometimes the opponent is the one that dictates that.''
</P>
<P>
   Each camp spent considerable time criticizing the other, but
there was no question that Soto's plodding, stalking style
frustrated Hamed, who has an awkward fighting technique himself.
After an explosive entrance which featured the Four Tops
lip-syncing through ``Get Ready,'' flame-throwing pillars and
fireworks-spewing palm trees, Hamed took control early with several
dazzling combinations.
</P>
<P>
   But Soto (53-8-2) came back in the second round with at least
two solid punches to Hamed's head. It was around that time that a
lot of the grabbing began, initiated mostly by Soto. The fight was
spiced with such grabbing, bringing boos from the crowd of 12,500
at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The most embarrassing, and dangerous, part of the match came in
the fifth round. Hamed had slipped on the canvas while ducking a
Soto punch, almost falling to his knees. Soto then landed, it
appeared accidentally, on Hamed's back. But instead of immediately
getting up, Soto lay there, trying to intimidate Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Hamed pulled a stunt reminiscent of a wrestling
show. He flipped Soto, judo style, onto his back.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed probably should have been disqualified, but the referee,
Dale Grable, instead only deducted a point. Hamed's flip caused
Soto's trainer, Miguel Diaz, to climb into the ring and begin
screaming at Hamed's corner. Steward also jumped into the ring
before order was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's superior boxing skills eventually proved too much for
Soto, and it showed on Soto's face, which was badly bloodied.
Grable's blue shirt looked almost red from all of the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I demand a rematch,'' Soto said through Diaz, who also serves
as his translator. ``This wasn't a boxer. This was Hulk Hogan. He
just came to wrestle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamed, 25, made his 13th defense of his title.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed earned about $5 million for the fight compared with about
$1 million for Soto.

BLACK PARENTS USE RALLY TO TEACH ABOUT HATRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that was as much education as it was
demonstration, dozens of black families from throughout New York
City brought their children on Saturday to observe and learn about
one of the nation's most notorious hate groups. They were among the
800 counterdemonstrators who surrounded the Ku Klux Klan rally on
Centre Street in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the families ventured into the crowds of chanting
protesters. Others stood on the fringes, some with food, eating as
they explained to children the history of racial hatred in the
United States and the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought them to let them know at a young age, to deepen
their understanding about the Klan,'' said Wady Watters, a
41-year-old New York City Transit worker who brought his daughter,
Ateba, 9 and son, Senefa, 10. ``They only know what they have seen
on television and what I have told them.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event drew only a handful of Klan members. But the
strong response by counterdemonstrators and the need many felt to
bring their families demonstrated how the mention of the group
evoked memories of the its much more powerful and violent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now know that they have bombed churches and houses, and
murdered hundreds of African-American people,'' Watters said of his
children, who asked him questions about the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the families who brought their children said
attending a Klan rally and seeing racial hatred firsthand was a
unique experience in New York City, with its ethnic diversity. But
many said that if their children leave the city, they want them to
understand that many people in the United States still have racist
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Watters, who lives in Brooklyn, said he wanted his children to
see that the type of hatred the Klan displayed still existed,
despite the lessons about harmony the children learn from their
teachers and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, if you don't know where you are, you
don't know where you are going,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The white supremacist group became notorious between the 1920s
and the 1960s for its intimidation of and terrorism against blacks,
Catholics, Jews and members of civil rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Klan has fractured and faded into the
background of American hate groups, being eclipsed by other white
supremacist groups such as the World Church of the Creator and the
Aryan Nation. Some factions of the Klan have attempted to mute
their rhetoric, no longer attacking minorities, but emphasizing
white pride in an attempt to draw in more members, experts have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Sanchez, 35, who is black, brought his 8-year-old son,
Carlos Jr., close to the area where the Klan was to demonstrate.
``I'm trying to explain to him what happened, but think it is going
to be hard for him to understand,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hoped that the images of hatred would remain in
his son's head and that in future years they could discuss the
history of the Klan and the source of its members' hatred.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The black families were also joined by whites and others who
brought their children.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna Wenthe, 36, of Bremen, Germany, who is on vacation in
Manhattan, brought her daughter, Marlene, 9, to the rally. ``In
Germany, we have the same problems. We don't have the Klan, but we
have Nazi skinheads who would just as quickly kill a black
immigrant,'' Ms. Wenthe said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bines, 45, an Arab-American elementary school counselor
from Brooklyn, said that he brought his three daughters to educate
them and to stand together with other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to know that this was something bad that
happened in American history,'' Bines said.
</P>
<P>
   Bines' daughter Lydia, 11, said: ``My school is full of all
different types of people you can imagine. I don't care what they
look like, they are all the same to me.''

 &HT;    A gamble in New Orleans
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In its first incarnation, it was a spectacular
failure. But Harrah's is betting its new $350 million casino in
downtown New Orleans will be a spectacular success.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people hope so. The casino, which opens Thursday night,
needs to make enough money to pay the city and the state $118
million annually. It needs to make enough to pay off debts. And it
needs to make enough to avoid another closure, which would throw
2,500 people out of work _ again _ and leave a monstrous building
vacant in the middle of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years ago, Harrah's opened what was billed as the
nation's first land-based casino in a downtown setting. It was a
temporary facility, housed in a drab municipal auditorium a stone's
throw from a public housing project. It went bankrupt in seven
months. The permanent casino is a glitzy affair in a killer
location _ on Canal Street at the edge of the French Quarter,
sandwiched between half a dozen large hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrah's has obstacles, starting with the enormous tax
burden, which will eat up about a third of its projected revenues.
On top of that, state regulators, in the interest of protecting
existing businesses, have barred Harrah's from having a hotel or an
upscale restaurant on the premises. Those are amenities gamblers
look for in a casino. Food is available in a bare-bones food court
and a 250-seat buffet. Finally, there's some worrisome history: In
addition to the failure of the Harrah's temporary facility, two
riverboat casinos also have failed in downtown New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's executives don't seem concerned, nor do the Wall Street
analysts who follow the publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sevigny, president and chief operating officer for Harrah's
New Orleans, looked out the window of his 28th-floor office across
the street from the casino one day recently and counted the hotels
that surround the casino on all sides. ``There are 3,400 hotel
rooms separated from the casino only by a street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he pointed to the aquarium, the Imax theater, the Riverwalk
shopping mall, and the edge of the French Quarter, each about a
block away from Harrah's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've got a great location,'' he said. ``This is an
urban environment, and it is surrounded with the kind of amenities
tourists use. Until Detroit opened its temporary casino a few
months ago, this was the only casino in an urban environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has a temporary casino downtown and eventually will have
three Las Vegas-style casinos.
</P>
<P>
   And, Sevigny said, ``This property is fabulous. It is without
question one of the prettiest casinos in the gaming industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino is a fake New Orleans set right in the heart of the
real thing. There are five distinct areas mimicking different
aspects of the region. There's the Jazz Court with live jazz music
being played under a fake oak tree, and the Mansion Court, which is
supposed to feel like a Garden District tea party. In the
Smuggler's Court, a pirate ship is sinking in a swamp and Jean
Lafitte's gold tooth is blinking. And in the Mardi Gras Court,
gamblers can catch beads and doubloons from a minifloat that will
parade through the casino twice nightly. Why have Mardi Gras once a
year when you can have it all the time?
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 2,900 slot machines taking as little as a
nickel and as much as $500, and 120 game tables. For high rollers,
there are private rooms in the ``Court of Good Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Sevigny isn't saying how much gamblers need to lose for the
casino to break even, but Wall Street analysts have said it's
around $700,000 a day. At least 10,000 people have to walk through
the doors daily. Annually, the break-even figure works out to about
$300 million, more than twice what the casino made in its temporary
quarters. Three New Orleans riverboats, docked in Lake
Pontchartrain, don't make that much combined.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those riverboats has a location like Harrah's. They
are in the suburbs and rely almost exclusively on local business.
Sevigny estimates more than half of Harrah's customers will be
tourists. A substantial portion will be regulars from one of
Harrah's 17 other casinos, Sevigny said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel and Patty Johnson, conventioneers in town from St. Louis,
stood outside Harrah's last week, looking downright depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sick it's not open yet,'' Patty Johnson said. She is
a regular at the Harrah's in her hometown. Asked if she would come
back specifically to gamble at the New Orleans Harrah's, she said
no.
</P>
<P>
   C.B. Forgotston, a vocal gambling opponent, thinks the casino is
doomed to failure, unless the state and city decide to ease the tax
burden. And even if it succeeds, he doesn't think it will benefit
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a success only if it brings in additional
tourists,'' he said. But he thinks most of the gamblers will be
like the Johnsons _ tourists who are in town anyway and decide to
drop by the casino. ``If the casino is drawing on people who are
here anyway, then all it does is take money away from the existing
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Froeba, general manager at the Westin Canal Place
across the street from Harrah's, thinks the casino will bring in
more tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can do nothing but help,'' he said. ``The facility is
beyond my expectations. It's spectacular. It will soon be on the
list of things you have to do when you're in New Orleans. And I
think some people will come here specifically for it, like they go
to Las Vegas.''

 &HT;    Class is in for SWAT teams
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOYOCK, N.C. _ The concussion of two pipe bombs exploding in
succession followed by the pow, pow, pow-pow-pow of gunfire
shattered the serene autumn. SWAT officers swarmed into the high
school. Inside, chaos reigned as a couple of America's new breed of
domestic terrorists fired indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   Police are used to going blind into violent situations, but they
have not been adequately prepared, in the estimation of many
experts, to tackle the new kind of school violence where they might
find themselves caught between terrified students and alienated
youth armed to the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason officials at the Blackwater Lodge and Training
Center in Moyock built the mock 15-room ``R U Ready High School''
for training exercises such as the one last month for some 400
members of the National Tactical Officers Association, an
organization of SWAT team officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with chaos _ a tremendous amount of
confusion,'' said Al Baker, retired from the New York Police
Department where he was commander of the Emergency Service Unit for
25 years. ``They are all young and all are unknowns in this large
place. There is a tremendous amount of noise. You don't know who
the shooter is. We're trying to teach them the techniques of
clearing a hostile environment. There is a lot of bleeding. This is
not something that can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   RESPONDING RAPIDLY TO TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   At last spring's massacre at Columbine High School on the
outskirts of Denver, police were accused of taking too long to get
into the school and flush out the killers, who had already turned
their guns on themselves after shooting 13 other people. One
problem cited by some experts was that eight different SWAT teams
were on the scene, causing confusion in coordinating activities.
The schoolhouse also was booby-trapped with homemade bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis at training exercises at Blackwater is on rapid
response, a kick-in-the-door philosophy of immediate entry with
guns drawn.
</P>
<P>
   In an exercise for the tactical officers here, participants ran
through drills on how to get inside school houses immediately
behind shields carried by two lead officers running abreast. They
cleared the way for paramedics to reach downed victims and flushed
out panicky students. Then they went after the pretend shooters and
``killed'' them with ``simunition,'' or small paint balls. In the
past two years, there have been six school shootings that attracted
national attention, beginning when a 16-year-old boy in Pearl,
Miss., killed two classmates and wounded seven others in October
1997 and ending with the wounding of six students at Heritage High
School in Rockdale County, Ga., in April.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths from school shootings has see-sawed in the
past seven years, according to the National School Safety Center in
Westlake Village, Calif. There were 32 during the 1992-93 school
year but only 11 in 1996-97. The number jumped back up to 26 in
1997-98, then dropped slightly to 19 in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   While there appears to be no dramatic increase in school
violence, law enforcement officers see a new, scary phenomenon in
incidents such as the Columbine massacre, where everyday students
suddenly become heavily armed terrorists holding classmates
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to better combat domestic terrorism such as
schoolhouse standoffs, Eric Prince, a Detroit businessman, wrote a
check to build the 5,200-acre high-tech Blackwater facility that
opened last year for law enforcement and military training.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for police dealing with hostage situations is that
the bad guys keep changing. For years, the hostage taker fit a
certain convention _ the trapped bank robber, or the angry husband
or boyfriend threatening a companion. Then, negotiation was the
standard response.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence landscape shifted in the 1980s with the spread
of crack cocaine, and police lost their footing.
</P>
<P>
   A VIOLENT TWO-DIMENSIONAL WORLD
</P>
<P>
   Gangs flourished and children fell as they were caught in
crossfires over drug turf. Drive-by shootings became commonplace in
many poor neighborhoods where the cheap-drug trade flourished.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the topsy-turvy world of street drugs, there was a
logical structure with which police could deal. A hierarchy ruled
the gangs, and drive-by shooters had their targets, even if they
occasionally hit innocent bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbine in Littleton, Colo., all the victims, in a sense,
were bystanders. How did we move from inner city gang warfare to
schoolhouse shootings?
</P>
<P>
   Among the many school systems trying to find answers is Wake
County, N.C., which last week began a pilot program to identify and
help children who are at risk of becoming violent. The schools plan
to aggressively try to locate troubled students and provide them
with therapy, mentoring and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano, co-authors of the book
``Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill,'' contend that the hold violence
has on some children can be traced to early childhood. They blame
in part the neglect of parents who allow their children to sink
into a two-dimensional world of television and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is like wet cement,'' said DeGaetano, an educator
and consultant who offers tips in her book ``Screen Smarts,'' a
family guide to media literacy, and on her Web page
(www.growsmartbrains.com). ``In early childhood it is
impressionable and malleable. What we put in it stays.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, retired from the U.S. Army and currently on the
faculty at the Unversity of Arkansas' Department of Psycyology and
Counseling, argues that many children have been subliminally
trained to be skilled killers _ and numbed to the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The former Airborne Ranger infantry officer and paratrooper
traces violence back beyond the advent of television in the 1950s
to the 1940s psyche of the World War II soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In World War II, we found that only 15 to 20 percent of the
riflemen would shoot at the enemy in a one-on-one situation,'' said
Grossman, the author of the Pulitzer-nominated book ``On Killing.''
``They would run and hide; they would do anything, but they would
not shoot; even if they were in imminent danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``in Vietnam we got the firing rate up. Ninety-five percent
would shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he says, was partly due to training.
</P>
<P>
   ``In World War II, they taught them to shoot at bull's-eyes,''
Grossman said. ``When a real person popped up in front of them,
they had to look them in the eyes. In Vietnam, we taught them to
shoot at people (by using) silhouette pop-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same thing we've done with video games. We've
involved the kids in this virtual reality and they shoot at
people,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHING CHILDREN TO KILL
</P>
<P>
   How much video games contribute to teen violence remains open to
debate.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing 27 studies on video games, Purdue University
assistant Professor John Sherry said he found the immediate
correlation between game play and aggression to be small.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sherry acknowledged that current data is insufficient
to draw firm conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   What the games can do, says Grossman, is teach and refine some
very scary skills. As an example, he cites Michael Carneal, the
14-year-old who shot up a prayer group at a school in Paducah, Ky.,
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never fired a gun,'' Grossman said. ``He steals one
from a neighbor's house and fires eight shots on the prayer circle.
He got eight hits on eight different targets. Five were head shots
and the others were (in the) upper torso. Three were DOA (dead on
arrival) and one was paralyzed. I trained Green Berets and when I
told them about this, they were stunned. These were scambling,
screaming kids. I can't find as good a shot from the annals of
criminal, law enforcement or soldier histories.''

   FALLING FROM THE SKY

   HARRAHS _ NEW ORLEANS _ Four years after a land-based casino in
downtown New Orleans went bankrupt, admitting that far too few
gamblers were losing far too little money, the re-structured
company is going against all odds and re-opening. Sure, it's
prettier and smaller and in a slightly more convenient location
than the first attempt, but just to stay afloat, Harrah's will have
to make far more in daily revenues than any other casino in the
region. When the doors open on Canal Street Thursday (Oct. 28), the
old questions will be asked again: Do New Orleanians or the
tourists who visit here really need another attraction? Is the
casino enticing enough to lure people away from Bourbon Street and
its bars and nightlife? And how will it compete against the
glittering offerings of the Mississippi Coast casinos, which are

   UNITEDNATIONS _ With U.N. forces trying to keep the peace in
Kosovo and create it in East Timor, this much is obvious: On
occasion, at least, the U.S. government finds the U.N. to be a
fairly useful organization. Yet the United States, which was one of
the founding members of the international body 54 years ago this
Sunday, is just 10 weeks away from losing its vote in the U.N.
General Assembly. Under the organization's rules, the U.S. owes too
much money _ $1.7 billion, by the U.N.'s reckoning _ to retain its
voting power. But that debt will soon be paid if Ted Turner has his
way. When Turner announced in 1997 his gift of $1 billion over 10
years to U.N.-related causes, he wanted some of his money to go to
U.N. projects that help women, children and the environment. But he
also wanted to create a political climate conducive to having the
U.S. pay its U.N. arrears. And he has created an organization to
try to accomplish that goal. (Melvin, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25.

   BRITAIN-PARENTING _ LONDON _ Call it the Battle of the Parenting
Gurus. On Oct. 30, Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo, two California-based
authors, will visit London, advising thousands of parents here to
feed their babies on a rigid schedule, leave babies to sleep
through the night by eight weeks, and spank children as young as 18
months. The pair have written a controversial Bible-based parenting
curricula that includes the popular book ``Growing Kids God's
Way,'' which has been used by more than a million parents. But Dr.
Penelope Leach, the so-called Dr. Spock of Britain, calls the two
Americans child abusers. She abhors spanking and has called on the
British government to stop the Ezzos from coming. (Emling, Cox News

   CHINA-MACAU _ MACAU _ The checkered history of this indolent old
Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are weeping as China
prepares to take over. Four hundred years ago Macau was far richer.
Portuguese traders dined on plates of gold because for a century
Portugal had a world monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and
silver with Japan and China. Twelve years ago, China and Portugal
had no trouble agreeing that the Portuguese should end their
occupation just before the millennium. Both sides have stuck to
this pact with little friction. And so on the evening of December
19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau and China are due to gather
here just before midnight to toast the end of nearly 450 years of
Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral
strikes 12 times, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and
oldest Western enclave in Asia. (Kunstel/Albright, Atlanta

MISERY AND MISFORTUNE HAUNT SCARLET KNIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Rutgers' spiraling season has come down to
the elemental goal of winning a game. Just one. But in a 38-15 loss
to Pittsburgh today at Rutgers Stadium, the Scarlet Knights looked
far away from achieving even that.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers' record dropped to 0-7 (0-4 Big East), and the threat of
repeating its 0-11 season of 1997 is becoming very real. The
Scarlet Knights face Temple and Navy the next two weeks before the
greater challenge of Syracuse and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights have excuses for their misery. Their
starting quarterback, Mike McMahon, is lost for the season with a
shoulder injury. Eight starters on defense have been lost for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of misfortune _ and the need to ease the
concern of potential recruits _ that led the Rutgers athletic
director, Robert Mulcahy, to publicly assure Terry Shea last week
that he would remain as head coach next year.
</P>
<P>
   But even the beleaguered Shea would have a problem explaining
the Scarlet Knights' anemic performance Saturday against a Pitt
team (4-3, 2-2) that had limped in with two straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's halftime lead of 24-0 could have been greater had
the Panthers not lost three fumbles, one in the end zone after an
apparent touchdown on their opening drive. (Pitt fumbled again into
the end zone in the second half.)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, who started at quarterback last week for the first
time since 1997, aimed his passes at times and simply did not have
the arm strength to complete others. He connected on 5 of 16 passes
for 45 yards and accounted for three interceptions in the first 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman Chad Schwenk played two series in the first half,
completing 1 of 4 passes for 14 yards. Schwenk tossed a 54-yard
touchdown pass to L.J. Smith and scored on a 1-yard keeper in the
third quarter to give the score some respectability.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Rutgers, playing before a home crowd of 17,325,
threatened to catch up. With the Knights trailing by 31-15 early in
the fourth quarter, Rutgers linebacker Dax Strohmeyer intercepted a
pass, but the turnover was nullified because defensive end Wayne
Hampton was penalized for roughing the Pitt quarterback, David
Priestley.
</P>
<P>
   In a sloppy first half, the Scarlet Knights kept themselves in a
hole by gaining 7 yards on 13 first-down plays. Pitt, on the other
hand, gained an average of 6 yards on first down.
</P>
<P>
   Priestley, getting his first start since the season opener,
found a friend in the befuddled Rutgers secondary. In the first
half, he completed 16 of 23 passes for 211 yards and two
touchdowns, the first coming on a 7-yard look-in to Latef Grim to
push the Panthers ahead, 7-0, early in the second quarter. Grim,
the Big East's leading receiver, matched his season average with 6
receptions for 74 yards before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   A 47-yard punt return by Pitt's Hank Poteat set up Nick Lotz's
32-yard field goal to stretch the Panthers' lead to 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Gibson, Pitt's 6-foot-4-inch, 300-pound defensive
tackle, leaped to bat down one of Jones' passes and came down with
the interception before rumbling 7 yards into the end zone to make
it 17-0. Pitt's last score of the half came on a 7-yard pass from
Priestley to running back Nick Goings.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough for Pitt. The rest was exercise.

ON A DAY OF COLLISIONS AND PROTESTS, ITALY WINS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The America's Cup challenger trials were
more demolition derby than yacht racing Saturday as the 75-foot
boats crunched together and cracked apart under a flurry of protest
flags. When the water was again calm at the end of Saturday's
matches, officials had listened to the bruised and battered
contestants and postponed the last races of the first round-robin
in the Louis Vuitton Cup series until Wednesday. Round 1 was to
have concluded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The day's combustible elements somewhat overshadowed the victory
of Italy's Prada Challenge, which improved its record to 7-0, by
defeating previously undefeated Young America by less than 10
seconds. In almost an exact rerun of its race on Friday against
another previously unbeaten American challenger, America One, the
Italian yacht Luna Rossa came from behind and was again helped by a
spinnaker mishap to beat the United Stated by a few yards in a
thrilling 12-mile yacht race here to emerge as the early favorite
to reach the final of the America's Cup in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing in 8-knot winds, very welcome after gales Friday, the
Milan-based Prada syndicate defeated Young America, the flag bearer
of the New York Yacht Club, by a margin of a boat length, or 75
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Young America, commanded by Ed Baird, led for most of the race,
and was still ahead in the last of the four legs until the
spinnaker collapsed. The battle of unbeatens more than lived up to
pre-race hype, producing a desperately close finish in which the
yachts raced for the line side by side only inches apart. When the
Vuitton regatta of 400 races over four months is completed, the
challenger to the holder, Team New Zealand, will probably come from
Italy or the American campaigns of America One and Young America.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race on the course, 15 miles north of Auckland, was a
tantalizing preview. Under bright skies, Young America's Baird won
the start from Francesco de Angelis by a length. The skippers then
fought a furious four-leg struggle right down to the line in
on-shore southwest winds sometimes reaching 10 knots.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans fought off attacks by the Italians for three legs
but faltered on the downwind leg near the finish when a snap
shackle failed on their spinnaker. Young America slowed as the sail
flapped out of control and the Italians seized the chance to
overtake. For several minutes the bow of the pursuing American boat
almost touched the Italian boat's stern.
</P>
<P>
   Both boats flew protest flags but umpires ruled that Luna Rossa
was maintaining a proper course to the finish and that Young
America had not obstructed the Italian boat as it gybed away to the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of this race that had to do with being in the
right place on a wind shift,'' Baird said. ``And in the end, the
result was based on something breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third day in a row for snap shackle failures in
spinnakers or genoas, and Baird quipped, ``Apparently, they have
been passing these shackles around.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action, Japan's Nippon Challenge was penalized half a
point for damaging the Spanish vessel, Bravo Espana, in a
bow-to-stern collision in pre-start maneuvering that caused
substantial damage to both. And America One was struck by Dennis
Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes in another skirmish at the start line.
America One went on to defeat its compatriot by one minute.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the others in the repair shop during the next three days
will be the Swiss yacht Be Happy, which has yet to win. Be Happy's
bulkhead tore loose from the hull minutes into its race against the
French team.

 &HT;    McCain hopes for headway as GOP field narrows
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. - George W. Bush's double-digit lead in the polls
and his commanding advantage in campaign cash prompted another
self-deprecating joke from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always darkest before it's totally black,'' McCain said,
assessing his chances against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some cause for mirth as McCain edges closer than
ever to Bush in opinion polls in New Hampshire, site of the first
primary. The shrinking of the Republican field - Elizabeth Dole
dropped out last week and Pat Buchanan is expected to join the
Reform party Monday - is affording McCain more attention just as
voters here are starting to give the presidential race a closer
look.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is offering them a character-based campaign that draws on
his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and calls on
Americans to band together against a favorite McCain target, the
``special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his latest trip to New Hampshire last week immediately
after Dole's withdrawal and the failure, again, of his campaign
finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's willingness to go against his party on campaign finance
reform issues rankles some of his colleagues, but it reinforces the
image that McCain believes is the key to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's honest. It would be wonderful to have someone we
can trust,'' said Claire Partridge, a retired secretary who showed
up at the century-old town hall in Wakefield to show her support
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nancy Spencer-Smith, an Episcopal priest and lawyer in
Wakefield, had yet to make up her mind. But she talked about his
time as a POW.
</P>
<P>
   ``People admire the fact that he could withstand that challenge
and not be jaded or embittered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio ads that began airing last week stressed the same theme,
saying that McCain has ``the character to do what's right'' and
``the courage to fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new polls last week showed McCain beginning to close the gap
with Bush. In a Research 2000 survey, he trailed the Texan by 12
points, 39 percent to 27 percent. Bush had a 16-point advantage, 42
percent to 26 percent, in an American Research Group poll.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign sent an urgent appeal for funds via e-mail last
week, using the poll numbers and Dole's exit as its context.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy demands that he do well in New Hampshire on
Feb. 1, then win in South Carolina on Feb. 19 and in his home state
of Arizona three days later.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would then have two weeks to capitalize on his showings
before more than a dozen primaries March 7, including those in
California, New York and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has neither the money nor the organization to match Bush
across the nation. But he is hopeful that early strength might
swing voters his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to my dismay, the majority of Americans still don't know
who John McCain is,'' he said in Concord. ``But if I do well here,
they will.''
</P>
<P>
   It is something more than a wing and a prayer, but well short of
a sure thing. McCain said his odds have improved, but he gave
himself only a one in three chance.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Pat Buchanan won the Republican primary here,
but could not compete with Bob Dole's superior organization
elsewhere in the country. In the 1984 Democratic primary here, a
contest McCain cites hopefully, Gary Hart upset former Vice
President Walter Mondale. But Mondale was the Democratic nominee
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the remaining Republican candidates, he has not
attacked Bush, whose rhetoric of inclusion is similar to McCain's.
While McCain's tactics have spurred talk that he wants to be vice
president, the senator said this is not so.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he is using a positive message to try to forge a
coalition of moderate Republicans, veterans, independents and some
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to broaden this campaign out from just rigid,
party doctrinaire issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His comment came just a day after he voted in the Senate to ban
partial-birth abortions. But McCain used the abortion issue to
illustrate what he means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are pro-life as I am and those who are pro-choice
(should) sit down and have a dialogue together on making adoption
easier, improving foster care, doing the things we can to eliminate
abortion, a goal which all of us share,'' he said.

 &HT;    Turner foundations lobby to get U.S. to pay U.N. dues
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With United Nations forces struggling to keep the
peace in Kosovo and create it in East Timor, this much is clear: On
occasion, at least, the U.S. government finds the United Nations to
be a fairly useful organization.
</P>
<P>
   The organization began both operations partly at the behest of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the United States, which was one of the founding members of
the international body 54 years ago today, is just 10 weeks away
from losing its vote in the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: nonpayment of dues. Under the organization's rules,
the U.S. owes too much money _ $1.7 billion, by the U.N.'s
reckoning _ to retain its voting power.
</P>
<P>
   But that debt will soon be paid if Ted Turner has his way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Atlanta media magnate announced in 1997 his gift of $1
billion over 10 years to U' _cil'' that gives veto power to China,
``one of the most flagrant human rights abusers,'' and Russia,
``the most unstable great-power regime.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier this month that
unpaid dues and bureaucratic delays have made it virtually
impossible for the United Nations to respond quickly to crises like
those in Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an organization that must respond regularly to crisis,
this is a sure path to frustration, failure and irrelevance,'' he
told the General Assembly's budget and finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the United Nations agree that more reform of the
organization is needed, but they say the world body still performs
critically important tasks .
</P>
<P>
   Turner and the Better World Fund are by no means alone in their
fight. The United Nations Association runs model U.N. programs in
schools to teach students the value of the United Nations. With 175
local chapters around the country, the association tries to
persuade local citizens to lobby their congressmen on behalf of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that between 60 percent and 70 percent of American
people favor paying the back dues, said William Luers, chairman and
president of the organization. Luers is a former U.S. ambassador to
Czechoslovakia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, heads the Emergency Coalition for U.S. Financial
Support of the United Nations, an organization that includes
several former U.S. secretaries of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the leading country within the U.N.
system,'' Eisenhower said. ``And it seems to me that if you have
made a commitment to pay your dues to an organization, and you want
to remain involved and engaged in that organization, you ought to
pay what you owe. That's a rather conservative notion _ that great
nations pay their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower said she sees a growing realization in Congress that
the nonpayment of dues is undermining the United States' standing
with countries that do pay, and undermining the nation's national
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino, too, thinks the chances of convincing Congress to pay
part of the debt this year are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's a shrinking place,'' she said.

AN ORNERY AND HURTING O'NEILL STILL FULFILLS HIS CHILDHOOD DREAMS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul O'Neill was cranky and ornery, again, when he
trudged off Turner Field after Friday's workout. He rumbled past
reporters and wanted to know why they needed to interview him and
the other Yankees, a necessity O'Neill should understand since he
will have played in three of the last four World Series after
Saturday night's opener with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But most interviews with O'Neill are a struggle at first.
Eventually, O'Neill relaxes and speaks eloquently about every
subject that does not involve him, and the verbal tantrums
dissipate. Friday was more of the same jousting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you a question,'' O'Neill said to one familiar
reporter. ``When do we get time to relax?''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter reminded O'Neill that the Yankees' clubhouse had
been closed for over an hour before the workout and then asked
O'Neill if he would rather be home in Columbus, Ohio, watching the
Series on television. The question seemed to startle O'Neill, but
he regrouped and was fast with his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be out in right field,'' said O'Neill, a small
smile across his face, ``with you guys up in the press box.''
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Neill finally agreed to talk, even yelling for one
reporter whom he had rebuffed to hurry up and interview him.
O'Neill discussed the confidence the Yankees have, the excitement
of winning a World Series, the sizable obstacle the Braves will be
for the Yankees and the importance of staying focused during the
distractions created by baseball in late October.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill's most significant observation was a comment he had
made on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium. When someone had asked him
about what being a Yankee had meant to his career, O'Neill barely
waited for the question to end. He said being a Yankee had meant
everything to an Ohio boy whose goal of playing for the Cincinnati
Reds was electrifying for only one of the six years he spent there,
when the 1990 Reds went all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been my career, in my mind, being in New York and
being part of these teams that have won here,'' said O'Neill. ``I
remember 1990 and I remember the seven years I've been here. That's
what I look back on as my career, because I've been on teams that
have had a chance to win. When you play sports, that's what you
dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are doing more of that dreaming, although it is more
reality than dreaming now that they are in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neill has had an ordinary post-season with a .276
average and one run batted in through the first eight games, he is
one of the players Atlanta must stop. That is amazing considering
that 12 days ago the Yankees learned that O'Neill had a fractured
10th rib on the right side, and doctors advised the 36-year-old to
skip the American League Championship Series and hope and pray that
he healed in time for the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was insistent on playing through the pain, and he
lobbied Manager Joe Torre the way a 17-year-old lobbies his father
for the car keys on a Friday night. O'Neill won.
</P>
<P>
   Now O'Neill's injury, which he said did not limit him in any way
during the ALCS, is hardly a major concern. Torre was so certain
about O'Neill's status against the Braves that he replaced
outfielder Shane Spencer with infielder Jim Leyritz on the roster.
Spencer was a security blanket in case O'Neill reinjured himself,
but O'Neill said: ``The last few games in Boston, I felt fine. It's
not a story anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees speculated that O'Neill would have continued to
play in the post-season even if the pain in his rib was so intense
that it caused him to have trouble breathing. O'Neill had a torn
hamstring throughout the 1996 dash to a World Series title and
still made a memorable catch in Game 5 against Atlanta, so being
slowed by injuries is not a new experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous resolve,'' said David Cone. ``He's miserable
when the story is him and he's in the spotlight. He couldn't wait
to declare himself healthy and make this a nonstory. You could tell
he was miserable, just the notion of being left out.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill batted only .190 (30 for 158) against left-handers this
season, so he was among the happiest to hear that Tom Glavine had
been scratched as the Game 1 starter Saturday night _ a decision
that meant he would probably face the Yankees no more than twice in
the series, and possibly just once. Still, the Series could prove
to be annoying for him with three lefties in the bullpen for
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill tried flicking away those dismal numbers by saying
everything starts fresh Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that everyone in here should feel lucky to be
playing on this team at this time,'' said O'Neill. ``You get breaks
in games, you get breaks in life, you get breaks in baseball. It's
a big break for everyone in here to be part of this team through
this run.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing in black and white hooded robes that
revealed their expressionless faces, 16 members of the Ku Klux Klan
staged a rally in Manhattan Saturday before hundreds of jeering
protesters who shouted, ``Klan go home!'' and various obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   If any Klansman had harbored illusions of working the hostile
crowd gathered before him Saturday, they evaporated quickly. The
rally turned violent even before the hugely outnumbered Klansmen
had a chance to say one amplified word. As Grand Dragon James
Sheeley and a handful of his colleagues entered a penned-in staging
area before the state Supreme Court building in lower Manhattan, he
was attacked by five men who had entered the area, apparently after
convincing the police that they were Klan members, too.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men leapt on Sheeley, punching him in the face before
officers intervened and arrested the man and four other people, who
shouted, ``Death to the Klan!'' as they were led off.
</P>
<P>
   With only 16 members willing to appear without their masks
Saturday, the Ku Klux Klan's low-tech rally appeared to be an
anemic, even farcical sideshow to the much larger crowd of shouting
counterdemonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The Klansmen were unmasked after losing a legal battle with the
city that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a federal appeals court in Manhattan reversed a lower
court's ruling and decided that the Klan's rally could go on only
if its members did not have the anonymity they had sought behind
their pointed white hoods, powerful symbols of the organization's
racist, violent history.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge appeals court refused to overturn a lower
court's ruling against the Partisan Defense Committee, an ad-hoc
anti-Klan group, which had claimed the city violated its rights by
rejecting a request for a sound permit for a rally adjacent to the
Klan's. Lawyers for the Klan group, the Church of the American
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, argued that if its members were forced
to unmask themselves, they faced retaliation because of their
unpopular views, thus violating their First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 a.m. Saturday, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed
a petition on the Klan's behalf with the U.S. Supreme Court, and it
was referred to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has responsibility
for emergency petitions from the New York region. At 2 p.m.,
Justice Ginsburg rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were pleased with the Supreme Court
decision upholding the antimask statute. ``We are gratified by the
decision of Justice Ginsburg,'' said the city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess. ``It supports the case that we presented
to the court and supports the three to nothing decision by the
second circuit court of appeals. We also feel that the policy
behind the anti-mask statute helps to avoid violence, makes people
accountable for their actions and, so far, the event has been
virtually violence-free and hopefully will conclude that way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a makeshift stage in front of the state Supreme Court
building where placard-carrying anti-Klan protesters had gathered,
Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, yelled into a microphone:
``These are stupid people. They need to blame their targets for
their own failure.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jerrold R. Nadler, D-N.Y., also spoke, though his
voice was all but drowned out by mocking shouts from the
protesters. The Klan, which once boasted of membership in the
millions, is now believed to have dwindled to about 4,000 members
as it struggles to compete against newer, bolder and more
Internet-savvy groups that, in the shrinking realm of white
supremacy, are often seen as more fashionably racist than the
cross-burning Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Klan has a plan: To let it be known around the
country that they can do whatever they want,'' said Charlene
Mitchell, a labor organizer from Manhattan who came to one of the
two pre-Klan protest gatherings Saturday. ``That's why they want
all this attention, to grow their membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Quester, 36, a kindergarten teacher from Brooklyn, said,
``I hate the Klan, that's why I'm here.'' Remarking on the week of
court battles the Klan fought to win the right to rally Saturday,
he added, ``I think we should exercise our free speech so
vigorously that no one hears them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some others among the protest crowd, Ms. Mitchell, 69, is a
veteran of other Klan rallies, in Cleveland, Georgia and Tupelo,
Miss., where hooded, armed Klansmen rode through town on the back
of flatbed trucks. ``It was a scary thing,'' she recalled. ``You
can't see their faces, you can't see their eyes. It's
terrorizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the specter of a few dozen members of a racist fringe
group taking a stage in lower Manhattan before hundreds of police
officers and thousands of jeering anti-Klan protesters, Saturday's
event was also filigreed with several smaller, quieter ironies.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is known for brazenly hurling epithets at blacks and
Jews, Jeffery L. Berry, the Klan's national imperial wizard, for
instance, quickly hired Norman Siegal, the head of the New York
Civil Liberties Union, who is Jewish, to force City Hall to issue a
permit. Then, last week, the city's largest black newspaper, The
Amsterdam News, and the Rev. Al Sharpton both filed legal papers
supporting the Klan's right to rally in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (The newspaper said it had acted out of a sense of First
Amendment inclusiveness, and Sharpton clarified that he wasn't
``for the Klan,'' simply ``against the mayor.'')

 WASHINGTON: his campaign. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it is the preponderance of New York banking and brokerage
firms at the top of Bradley's donor list that sets him apart from
the other leading candidates for the presidency. Only two Wall
Street firms are in Gore's and McCain's top 10 lists of
contributors; only one makes Gov. George W. Bush's list of 10
biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm to make the top 10 list for all four candidates is
Goldman, Sachs, whose partners and their families have contributed
$22,455 to McCain, $60,250 to Gore, $77,250 to Bush _ and $210,000
to Bradley. Bradley's success is even more notable because
Goldman's former chairman, Robert Rubin, was chairman of the
National Economic Council and treasury secretary in the Clinton
administration. Rubin is so far sitting out the 2000 presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's familiarity with top bankers, brokers and bond traders
grew from his 18 years of service on the Senate Finance Committee.
He was one of the primary authors of the landmark 1986 tax bill and
the architect of a plan to address the Third World debt crisis in
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bradley's opponents cannot point to anything specific
in his Senate career that would account for Wall Street's loyalty
and generosity. He proposed an increase in the capital gains tax,
advocated abolition of a variety of tax shelters and urged banks to
take substantial losses on their loans to struggling economies _
all positions that at times put him at odds with financial
executives.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for Bradley's popularity on Wall Street?
</P>
<P>
   Partly it is geography: Bradley attended Princeton University in
New Jersey, represented New Jersey in the Senate and still lives in
northern New Jersey. Partly it is familiarity with the people and
the lingo of Wall Street _ J.P. Morgan hired him consultant within
weeks of his leaving the Senate in 1997. Partly it is his position
as the only Democratic alternative to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And he also helped to give New York something no other area
politician has ever delivered: two NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't any of the policies that make him popular,'' said
Mark Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association.
``Part of it is he was a Knick, and a very successful one at that.
A lot of the Street are sports fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used the two years between retiring from the Senate and
establishing his presidential committee late last year to lay the
political and financial groundwork for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work at J.P. Morgan, Bradley signed on as a
consultant with the Gartner Group, a telecommunications research
firm in Stamford, Conn. The company paid Bradley $131,000 in 1998,
according to the personal financial disclosure statement he
released this year.
</P>
<P>
   He took part-time appointments at the University of Maryland,
Notre Dame University and Stanford, earning $170,000 last year for
a handful of lectures at each school.
</P>
<P>
   He gave more than 60 speeches _ at an average of $25,000 each _
to a variety of corporations, law firms and interest groups. Among
them were Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a pharmaceutical company; Health
Care Information and Management Systems Society; the National Home
Equity Mortgage Association; the Association of Investment
Management Sales Executives; Key Bank; Barclays Global Investors;
the American Association of Health Plans, and First Union Capital
Markets.
</P>
<P>
   So last winter when he announced his intention to seek the
Democratic nomination for president, he had not only a rich list of
potential donors from three successful Senate campaigns, but a new
cache of contacts from his two years out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his proven ability to raise money and win elections,
Bradley seems to have benefited from disaffection among some
Democratic Party donors with Clinton and his chosen heir, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the initial interest in Bradley is the result of
Clinton-Gore fatigue,'' said Bonnie Reiss, a top New York
fund-raiser for Bradley and a member of his advisory board, ``a
feeling that they need to wash their hands of the whole
administration.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At butler boot camp, Lisa Meyers, who wants to work for a very
rich family in a Fifth Avenue apartment with a view of Central
Park, was singled out from her classmates and scolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a little too slick for this profession, missy,'' said
Mary Louise Starkey, founder of the Starkey International Institute
for Household Management, a school in Denver that markets itself as
the Harvard of high-end household help. ``The lady of the house
will get rid of you in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A discerning household manager, which is the Starkey Institute's
gender-neutral term for butler, would never, ever look more
fetching than the lady of the house, especially if that lady is one
of those young ``trophy'' wives, who tend toward insecurity and
prickliness, Mrs. Starkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers, a fit and attractive woman of 35, nodded
compliantly. She conceded that she may have to retool her
appearance to land the $60,000-to-$120,000-a-year salaries that
household managers command in Manhattan. Having left her career as
a chiropractor, Ms. Meyers is paying about $7,200 for an eight-week
course in the elegant care and feeding of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   These are lucrative and stressful times in the annals of
household help in the United States. Never before have there been
so many wealthy Americans with so many big houses that need
tending. Yet many of these new rich need as much schooling in the
art of living large as the students in butler school, according to
Mrs. Starkey and many others in the service trade.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American households worth $10 million or more has
quadrupled in the last decade, jumping to 275,000 from 65,000, said
Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University and
an expert on wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of people who can afford a butler has
no precedent in the country's history, except perhaps in the boom
years of the 1920s, Wolff said. He estimated that up to a fifth of
those worth at least $10 million _ about 55,000 households _ are in
the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   There has likewise been an unparalleled swelling in the size of
the American house. When the Census Bureau began measuring in 1984,
only 7 percent of new houses were larger than 3,000 square feet
(often considered the size threshold for household help). By the
second quarter of this year, 17 percent of new houses were at least
that big, and many were much, much bigger, according to the
National Association of Home Builders. Its surveys show that the
largest and most expensive of these houses are concentrated in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers scream for good help.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starkey's 10-year-old school, based in a Georgian mansion
near the Colorado Capitol dome, now graduates about 60 certified
household managers a year. She plans to expand next year with a
second training mansion in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had more students and more applicants, because I
could place them all,'' said Carol Scudere, who owns Professional
Domestics in Columbus, Ohio, and is the director of training at the
four-year-old school, which competes with Mrs. Starkey's.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Washington and Los Angeles, placement agencies that
specialize in servants for the rich say that the demand for
experienced household managers exceeds the supply.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many household managers are working in the United
States is not known. Until Mrs. Starkey's school opened in Denver,
most had either been trained in the great homes of the very rich or
had emigrated from England, where there are training schools and a
long tradition of butlers learning their craft as underbutlers.
After a long postwar slump for butlers in Europe (when the number
of butlers in England shrank to the hundreds from more than
18,000), demand there appears to be rising. The International Guild
of Professional Butlers plans to open a school in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to deal with vendors, they don't want to
cook, they don't want to hear about bickering and jealousy among
the staff,'' said Keith Greenhouse, president of the Pavilion
Agency in Manhattan. ``They want the butler to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a persistent and sometimes destabilizing
undertow in this flood of big money, big houses and big demand for
Grade-A help.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans new to wealth _ and three out of four households
worth more than $10 million were minted in the past decade _ say
they are uncertain about how to manage their servants, how to pay
them, and even how to talk to them. Their parents, in many cases,
were not rich. They did not grow up with servants in the house.
They sometimes are too chummy with the servants or too demanding,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs among the multimillionaires and downstairs among their
better-trained servants, there can be grumbling, miscommunication
and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned not to include servants in family functions,''
said Mary Campbell, who grew up in a two-bedroom house and now
lives in two large homes, in Boston and the Berkshires. Her husband
is Lewis Campbell, chief executive of Textron Inc., which makes
Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been burned through the years,'' added Mrs. Campbell,
who three months ago hired a household manager trained at the
Starkey Institute. ``People took advantage of our niceness. They
took advantage of friendship. They lied about their hours. They
told other people about our business.''
</P>
<P>
   An experienced Manhattan butler says that working for the newly
rich is almost always annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nouveau riches tell you the price of things,'' the butler said
with a sniff. ``I have worked for people who brag in front of their
kids about how much their statuary art costs; then their kids brag
to their friends. Americans also don't know how to draw the line
about being too familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   The butler, who was born in England, complained that many
wealthy Americans do not even know basic table manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know how to use silverware. People leave their
knives and forks on table at all different angles instead of
putting them together to show they are finished.''

 &HT;    Turner foundations lobby to get U.S. to pay U.N. dues
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With United Nations forces struggling to keep the
peace in Kosovo and create it in East Timor, this much is clear: On
occasion, at least, the U.S. government finds the United Nations to
be a fairly useful organization.
</P>
<P>
   The organization began both operations partly at the behest of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the United States, which was one of the founding members of
the international body 54 years ago today, is just 10 weeks away
from losing its vote in the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: nonpayment of dues. Under the organization's rules,
the U.S. owes too much money _ $1.7 billion, by the U.N.'s
reckoning _ to retain its voting power.
</P>
<P>
   But that debt will soon be paid if Ted Turner has his way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Atlanta media magnate announced in 1997 his gift of $1
billion over 10 years to U.N.-related causes, he wanted some of his
money to go to U.N. projects that help women and work to control
the world's population. He wanted some of it to go to improving the
global environment, and he wanted some of it to go to programs that
help children.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all. Turner also wanted to create a constituency
for the world body in the United States, which would create a
political climate conducive to having the U.S. government pay its
U.N. arrears.
</P>
<P>
   So Turner set up the U.N. Foundation to distribute money to U.N.
programs that help women, children and the environment. And he set
up the Better World Fund to handle the more political side of
things _ such as campaigning for public support for the U.N. and
lobbying Congress to pay at least some of the back dues this
country owes.
</P>
<P>
   The Better World Fund is a distinct organization, but it bears a
striking resemblance to the U.N. Foundation. It is located in the
same office space on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C. It has
the same president _ former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth. And it has the
same board of directors, chaired by Turner.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out its mandate, the Better World Campaign _ the
primary project of the Better World Fund _ is running an
advertising campaign designed to increase support for the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a place for peace?'' begins one full-page ad, in
large, eye-catching letters. ``Sometimes the world seems full of
violence and hatred, terrorism and war,'' the ad continues in more
subdued type. ``Fortunately, there is a place where people can
pursue peace: The United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   After a plea for the United States to pay its outstanding dues,
the ad concludes, in bold print: ``Great nations keep their word.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad has run primarily in Washington, D.C., but has also
appeared in publications around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisements by the group stress the U.N.'s role in
bringing to justice the suspects in the bombing of Pam Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in building an international
coalition against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, in negotiating
settlements of regional conflicts and in caring for refugees around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that the United Nations needs money, namely the
money the U.S. owes it, to do those jobs. And people who criticize
the United Nations for inefficient or inadequate responses to
crises should bear that in mind, said Phyllis Cuttino, executive
director of the Better World Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people don't understand about the U.N. is,
really, without the appropriate tools, the U.N. can't do the job
it's been assigned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. debt to the world body began accumulating in the
mid-1980s. In an effort to force the United Nations to adopt budget
reforms, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) sponsored an amendment to
the State Department Authorization bill to withhold 20 percent of
the country's annual assessed contributions to the organization.
According to the Better World Campaign, that made the United States
the first country to ever impose unilateral conditions on the
payment of its U.N. dues.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, payment of the dues has been tied to an an issue
that U.N. supporters say is completely unrelated. Rep. Chris Smith
(R-N.J.), a member of the International Relations Committee, has
successfully linked payment of U.N. dues to a provision that would
bar international family planning funding to any organization that
used its own, non-U.S. government funds for abortion-related
services.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the United Nations supports no abortion
activities. The amendment would prevent not the United Nations, but
the U.S. Agency for International Development from supporting
abortion-related programs in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Because that amendment was attached, President Clinton last year
vetoed a bill to pay the U.N. arrears.
</P>
<P>
   Now the debt has become large enough that, under Article 19 of
the U.N. Charter, the United States will lose its vote in the
General Assembly at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   An effort is being made in Congress to attach the same amendment
again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonpayment of the dues, however, will not affect the United
State's right to vote _ and cast vetoes _ in the more powerful U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks the United Nations itself is without blame.
Some critics contend that the U.S. money would be misspent unless
the U.N. reforms its bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in the Montreal Gazette, economics Professor
Irving Brecher of McGill University said the United Nations ``is
near the edge of financial ruin'' _ $2.6 billion in debt as of May.
More than 60 percent of the debt is due to the U.S. failure to pay
its dues.
</P>
<P>
   The world body is struggling, Brecher wrote, partly because it
is ``constrained by a never-reformed Security Council'' that gives
veto power to China, ``one of the most flagrant human rights
abusers,'' and Russia, ``the most unstable great-power regime.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier this month that
unpaid dues and bureaucratic delays have made it virtually
impossible for the United Nations to respond quickly to crises like
those in Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an organization that must respond regularly to crisis,
this is a sure path to frustration, failure and irrelevance,'' he
told the General Assembly's budget and finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the United Nations agree that more reform of the
organization is needed, but they say the world body still performs
critically important tasks .
</P>
<P>
   Turner and the Better World Fund are by no means alone in their
fight. The United Nations Association runs model U.N. programs in
schools to teach students the value of the United Nations. With 175
local chapters around the country, the association tries to
persuade local citizens to lobby their congressmen on behalf of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that between 60 percent and 70 percent of American
people favor paying the back dues, said William Luers, chairman and
president of the organization. Luers is a former U.S. ambassador to
Czechoslovakia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, heads the Emergency Coalition for U.S. Financial
Support of the United Nations, an organization that includes
several former U.S. secretaries of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is the leading country within the U.N.
system,'' Eisenhower said. ``And it seems to me that if you have
made a commitment to pay your dues to an organization, and you want
to remain involved and engaged in that organization, you ought to
pay what you owe. That's a rather conservative notion _ that great
nations pay their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower said she sees a growing realization in Congress that
the nonpayment of dues is undermining the United States' standing
with countries that do pay, and undermining the nation's national
security interests.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino, too, thinks the chances of convincing Congress to pay
part of the debt this year are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's a shrinking place,'' she said.

UNDATED: are finished.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To iron out wrinkles in wealthy households, Mrs. Starkey
preaches professional management and personal boundaries. Her
students are taught to trim their nose hairs, wax their eyebrows,
use a yardstick to space plates at the dinner table and always call
their employers by their surnames and use the proper courtesy
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Starkey also drills her clients. During home inspections,
she advises prospective employers to tell their household managers
many details about their personal lives, from how they like their
coffee in the morning, to favorite television shows, to which child
is related to which ex-spouse. Mrs. Starkey repeatedly alerts
clients to the insidious dangers of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have chosen the profession of service,'' Mrs. Starkey told
Ms. Meyers and seven other aspiring household managers at the
Starkey Institute. ``You are about to be propelled into a world
many of us never see, a world of plenty, of power and of
indulgence. Remember, you are going to be paid as a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning course in ``boundaries'' at the Starkey Institute
raised these sticky questions: What if the lady of the house asks
the household manager for help in adhering to a strict low-fat
diet? And what if the household manager, while working in her
employer's bedroom, finds an empty container of double-chocolate
ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it in the trash and keep it to yourself,'' said Jenny
Hookey, a former household manager for Michigan Gov. John Engler
and an instructor at the school. ``You are not supposed to be your
employer's conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hookey rose from her chair in a basement classroom of the
mansion-cum-school and wrote these initials on the blackboard:
YBYJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet your job if you cross a boundary,'' Mrs. Hookey said,
explaining what is perhaps the most dismal fact of life in the
service trade. Servants have almost no job security. If an employer
does not like your look, your attitude or your work, you are out,
no matter how well trained or highly paid you may be.
</P>
<P>
   In a class on ``personal style,'' taught by Mrs. Starkey,
students were asked to describe the character of the wealthy people
for whom they hope to work. The class volunteered these words:
selfish, intelligent, aggressive, rushed, motivated, stuck-up,
philanthropic and judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   Why would you want to work for people like that? Mrs. Starkey
asked her class.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, gleaned from separate interviews with all eight
students in the class, seems to be as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Those who aspire to the butler trade are middle-aged people in
post-marriage, post-child-bearing phases of their lives. Ms. Meyers
was the exception, and she has been advised to compensate for her
relative youth. A beautician who consults for the Starkey Institute
told her: Trim the blond, highlighted hair. Lose the showy
earrings. Lay off the dark red lip-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students said they enjoyed taking care of expensive
things. Many have worked for restaurants or in catering, luxury
sales or property management. They are intrigued by the idea of
working for a very rich family with many houses and jetting around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   One student, Chief Petty Officer Samuel Sutton, 39, has worked
for several generals and admirals in Washington as a chef and a
senior household manager, and he was hoping to go to work soon in
the White House. He said he went to the Starkey Institute to polish
his skills and prepare for 2003, when he will leave the Navy and
look for a household manager job that will double his military pay
of about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical student was Ingrid Lawrence, 56, who is divorced
with no children. In ``personal image awareness'' class, Ms.
Lawrence, a tall German-born woman with ramrod posture and an
expensive but understated wardrobe, was judged to have a near
perfect look for service: tasteful, elegant and simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of fussy,'' said Ms. Lawrence, who recently quit her
job at Neiman Marcus in San Diego, where she sold china, crystal
and silver. ``I love housework. I love to be surrounded by
beautiful things. It will give me pleasure to take care of these
beautiful things in a private house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lawrence explained that in her own house in San Diego, she
used only fresh linen napkins, never paper. She kept her linen damp
in plastic bags in her refrigerator, she said, so that she could
iron it as needed, obtaining the crispest and most wrinkle-free
napkins possible.
</P>
<P>
   In ironing class at the Starkey Institute, when a teacher
mentioned the linen-in-the-refrigerator trick, Ms. Lawrence smiled
knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a grueling 12-hour day at the Starkey mansion, all
the students gathered in the basement over dinner to watch ``The
Remains of the Day,'' the 1993 film in which Anthony Hopkins plays
an emotionally remote English butler.
</P>
<P>
   The butler, Stevens, resolutely refuses throughout the film to
judge the character of his employer, Lord Darlington, even as he
makes a national fool of himself by appeasing the Nazis in the days
before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the film, the butler is asked how he could
endure working for such a despicable man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his butler,'' Stevens replies. ``I was there to serve
him, not to agree or disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the students laughed during parts of the film,
especially when servants ironed The Times of London, it struck most
of them as profoundly sad.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in class, however, Mrs. Starkey said that Stevens
had had it exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start judging your employers,'' she said, ``your days
are numbered.''

L.A. NO HOOP-MOVIE TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Southern California, where mourning the last bite of a Krispy
Kreme donut qualifies as nostalgia, we are roaring toward a maudlin
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Let's slam on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Our U-turn through hoop history begins at the Forum, which
despite the champagne stains is out of the pro basketball business.
Careening into even deeper obscurity is the Sports Arena, a doomed
venue that Ron Harper still may be able to sniff from Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   We also are a few days removed from the tepid poetry that
lurched behind the passing of Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   With such tardy tribute in mind, let's postpone the chatter of
rules changes and Charles Barkley's vast rear end, while honoring
two guys who prevented ``professional basketball in L.A.'' from
being defined by high school kids and sneaker pimps.
</P>
<P>
   Two guys who paved the diamond lane for Kareem, Magic, ``Big
Game'' James, Coop and Pooh (Hey, no list-crashing. Shame on you,
Pooh. Now get out of here).
</P>
<P>
   Two guys you should remember during your commute from the blood
bank to the ticket window at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor and Jerry West ... thanks to them, L.A. was spared
the dubious glory of becoming a ``basketball movie'' town.
</P>
<P>
   West, responsible for most of the hires you now see in those
cool Laker V-neck jerseys, has balanced on the edge of your memory
since retiring as one of the 10 greatest players in the history of
players.
</P>
<P>
   He was so great, that at least one young, impressionable
knucklehead (guilty!) practiced running face-first into walls to
acquire the nose West developed through years of catching elbows
with it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Laker GM, he snatched Kobe from the jaws of Charlotte,
N.C. He delivered Shaq. While working near the dead end of the
first round, he conjured Vlade, A.C. and Elden. He rescued Van Exel
in round two.
</P>
<P>
   West refers to such maneuvers as ``lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he ever unlucky? He'll swear he frequently is, but even Bill
Walsh required arm-twisting before the Niners drafted Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you weak enough to embrace everything you read and
hear, Baylor possibly the greatest forward in NBA history has
become the heavy bag for Clipper punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clipper museum has been built by the silly approach of
the team owner. Baylor's greatest sin as GM has been deferring
personnel moves to coaches who know less about the game than he
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to force a player on a guy who doesn't
want him,'' Baylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the last three drafts, he has assembled a young,
talented and exciting team that figures to be humbled by free
agency and the owner's definition of appropriate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I root for Elgin,'' says West, who remains one of Baylor's
biggest fans and loyal pals. ``He's such a great person and he
deserves to have great success.''
</P>
<P>
   West also realizes his ex-teammate deserves credit for the
impact he's had on their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an incredible player with a great flair for the game,''
says West, who uses the word `incredible' two more times in the
next three sentences. ``When I joined the Lakers, he made me feel
comfortable here. He was great to have on your side. He was a lot
of fun, but serious about competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Baylor's skills include inventing good-natured, spirited
and ultimately worthless debates by operating with nothing more
than the raw material from a harmless greeting of ``hello.''
</P>
<P>
   But West, who frequently swaps phone calls with his opposite
number at Planet Clipper, has been known to lob his own verbal
curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry once told me Tyronn Lue couldn't play at all,'' Baylor
says. ``Then someone asked me what Jerry was going to do (in the
1998 draft), and I told the guy he was going to draft Tyronn Lue.''
</P>
<P>
   West didn't; but he did acquire Lue in a trade the next day.
</P>
<P>
   With Maurice Taylor drop-stepping his way toward free agency and
the Laker roster threatening to become Valhalla for immortally
wounded Chicago Bulls, Baylor and West must be dialing the phone
quite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber optics involved pass more hoop knowledge back and
forth than a flock of college-coaching sharpies lurking at your
nearest Nike-sanctioned jamboree.
</P>
<P>
   The wiretap was made for moments like these. But if all you can
do is dial a radio station, inform the host you're serving ``mad
props'' or one love to Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans of our sport tend to forget very quickly,'' West says.
``The past isn't remembered with the kind of passion you find for
baseball and football.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time we prove the man wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Worm hole still open?
</P>
<P>
   Laker coach Phil ``Zen Master P'' Jackson now admits that
re-hiring Dennis Rodman would provide swell rebounding karma for
his next playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   But without Michael Jordan around to hold the leash, adding
Rodman makes about as much sense as buying a pit bull to fetch your
slippers; oh, your slippers will arrive, but you may not be able to
pry them from the dog's jaws.
</P>
<P>
   We also should mention the Clippers' phone number was on speed
dial at the offices of Team Rodman. Clips owner Donald T. Sterling
reportedly was intrigued by the idea of signing the Worm to move
tickets and dilute the anti-Sterling headlines inspired by the Mo
Taylor issue.
</P>
<P>
   But superior hoop intellects reminded him that Rodman's people
only were interested in Clipper cap room (a bit of loose change
less than $10 million), and would seek most if not all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling might have been willing to make an exception for Rodman
but only of the $2 million variety.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   According to the league's big thinkers, the presence of Jason
Kidd made run-and-jump rookie Shawn Marion a perfect fit in
Phoenix. But without the generous-and-speedy Kidd on the floor,
Marion put 20 points on the Lakers Friday. ... Wow, ex-Clipper
Rodney Rogers looks like half the player he was last season, and
that's a good thing. Were the Clippers derelict in allowing him to
skip over to Phoenix? No! He had six years (two of those in Denver)
to demonstrate any consistency; and their three-spot's in great
shape with Lamar Odom and Ty Nesby. ... Once he gets healthy, look
for the Bulls to continue shopping Toni Kukoc. ... Laker rookie
Devean George has traveled light years beyond his audition as
gifted-but-tentative Division III prospect during the Summer Pro
League at the Pyramid. ``The difference now is that he realizes he
belongs out there,'' said West, who adds George to his ``lucky''
draft list. George had been on the scouting radar since the
pre-draft nobodies went to war in Portsmouth, Va. But West had the
nerve to choose him at 23 over bigger names such as Tim Jones of
Miami (Fla.) and Georgia's Jumaine Jones. ... Yao Ming, the
7-foot-6, 19-year-old tower of potential from China, reportedly
will compete at Pauley Pavilion next month on a Chinese national
team scheduled to play UCLA in an exhibition game. ...Four out of
four NBA scouts rate 6-5 shooting guard DeShawn Stevenson
(Washington Union High, Fresno U.S.A.) as the prep hotshot
best-equipped to make the ill-advised leap to the NBA. Stevenson
verbally committed to Kansas a few days ago.

CLINTON RETREATS FROM PLAN TO INVEST RETIREMENT FUNDS 
 (HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add approx. 225 words, mainly Republican reaction)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton dropped one of the most
contentious elements of his plan for bolstering Social Security's
finances on Saturday, and called on Congress to break the partisan
deadlock over how to prepare the retirement system for the aging of
the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he would send Congress
legislation next week based on a proposal he first floated earlier
this year to shore up Social Security with projected federal budget
surpluses. But the new version will not include Clinton's
longstanding call for the government to invest some Social Security
taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve more than confusion, double talk
and delay on this issue,'' Clinton said. ``So it's time to have a
clear, straightforward bill on the table, and next week I plan to
present one _ legislation that insures that all Social Security
payroll tax will go to savings and debt reduction for Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is now taking in more than $100 billion a year
above what it is paying to retirees, but as the baby boomers
retire, payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of his desire for bipartisan cooperation, White
House officials said Clinton was withdrawing for now his plan to
seek higher returns for the system by having the Government invest
as much as 15 percent of Social Security's reserves in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had rejected the idea of government investing in
equities, saying it would amount to federal ownership of private
industry. Most Republicans have rallied instead around alternatives
under which individuals would be able to invest part of their
Social Security payroll taxes on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans are sure to welcome Clinton's concession,
they long ago dismissed the rest of the president's basic approach,
which is built around reducing the national debt and then capturing
some of the interest savings on the retirement system's behalf.
Republicans have often said Clinton's underlying plan is nothing
more than an accounting shell game that fails to address the
fundamental mismatch between promised benefits and the revenues to
pay them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president is serious about saving Social Security,
he'll work with us to give personal accounts to American workers
rather than relying on tired old accounting changes that simply
fill the trust fund with more IOUs,'' said Trent Duffy, a spokesman
for Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said its plan would extend Social Security's
solvency from 2034, when under current projections it would be able
to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits, to 2050, beyond the
life span of most of the 76 million Americans born in the 18 years
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is present what we feel is the most
solid, bipartisan, hopefully uncontroversial proposal to lock away
the Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, and use those
interest savings to extend the solvency of Social Security,'' said
Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Saturday was in part a last-ditch effort
to make some progress this year on dealing with Social Security,
which has more than lived up to its reputation as the most
politically and ideologically charged of issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clearly also an effort to put the White House back on
the offensive after several weeks in which Republicans in Congress
have used Social Security to attack Democratic spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences, rallies on Capitol Hill and television
commercials in the districts of 10 House Democrats, the Republicans
have made a case that Democrats want to spend so much money that
they are raiding Social Security's reserves to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the president's radio address, Republicans in
Congress promised not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for
other spending programs, and called for cuts in spending. Rep. J.C.
Watts, the chairman of the Republican Conference, said Republicans
now planned to cut spending and keep the budget balanced while
paying down $150 billion in debt in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security surplus must be off limits,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, who gave the Republicans' radio address Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the government should stay the course and live
within its means,'' Domenici added. ``By doing so, we can preserve
the Social Security surplus, pay down our national debt, keep the
budget balanced, while investing in priorities such as education
and health care.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both parties routinely agreed for decades to spend excess Social
Security payroll tax revenues on general government operations. But
this year the two parties have both pledged to balance the budget
without using any of the Social Security money, and they have been
trading bitter accusations about the inability of the other to show
how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has been less about Social Security _ the retirement
system's long-term health is only indirectly connected to whether
some of its excess revenues are spent on other programs in a given
year _ than about exploiting an issue that both sides believe can
play to their benefit in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of both parties have come up with approaches to
dealing with Social Security's underlying problems, none of the
plans have enough support to have been given serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said Clinton's plan was intended to be a start on the
broader goal of insuring Social Security's viability for at least
75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is based on the idea that by using the Social
Security surplus to pay down the national debt, the government's
interest bill will decline substantially.
</P>
<P>
   By the White House's estimate, the government's interest expense
will be $107 billion lower in 2011 than it would be if the Social
Security surplus were not used, starting this year, to reduce the
debt. Clinton's proposal would take the money saved because of the
lower amount of debt, starting in 2011, and earmark it to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   From 2011 through 2015, the total savings in interest dedicated
to Social Security would be $544 billion, Sperling said, and
savings would continue accruing beyond 2015 at around $189 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The savings would at first go to further reductions in the
national debt. After the debt was paid off _ around 2015 under the
White House's current scenario _ the savings would continue to be
transferred to Social Security in the form of a government IOU that
would later be redeemed to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the plan would still require that the
government eventually pay Social Security benefits using general
revenues. In that way, they said, Clinton's plan would merely defer
tough choices about raising taxes, cutting benefits or again
increasing borrowing.

 &HT;    Mayfield in running for top 10 Cup finish
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Forgive Jeremy Mayfield for sounding a bit
overconfident on his chances in today's Pop Secret 400.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield has been overwhelmed with frustration, disappointment
and bad luck on the track this season, especially during the past
two months. Earning a front-row starting position has a tendency to
return a struggling driver's brashness. Mayfield starts in the No.
2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to win the race, and we feel like we can,''
Mayfield said. ``This team right now is better than it has ever
been, and I feel real good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who drives the No. 12 Ford, is in such a confident
mood that he has the same outlook for the three remaining races at
Phoenix, Miami and Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we ran really well at all four
tracks, and I wouldn't be surprised if we won all four races,''
Mayfield said. ``That's not a prediction. That's just the way
everybody on this team feels about the last four races of the
season and about those four race tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, 30, was projected as one of the top contenders for the
Winston Cup championship at the beginning of the season. The lofty
expectations transpired after Mayfield's eye-opening performance
during 1998. He won the first Pocono race and had 12 top 5s, 16 top
10's and finished seventh in the points race.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield has not won this season, but he has four top 5s and 10
top 10s. He is 11th on the points list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're determined to fight our way back to the top,'' Mayfield
said. ``We've been trying to find what we need in our cars, from a
balance standpoint. We got off a little bit at the beginning of the
year and feel like now we know what we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I think we all hit it and got lucky and ran good
several times and didn't know why. Now we've figured out what it
takes to run good week-in and week-out. You've gotta have answers
to build a consistent team.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way for Mayfield to salvage the season would be to win
a race and finish in the top 10 in points. He trails Mike Skinner,
in the 10th spot, by 225 points and is four points ahead of Terry
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep in mind that everything we're doing right now
affects more than just the end of this season,'' Mayfield said.
``How we end this season will play in big part in how we start next
year, and how we start next year will really affect how we finish
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's recent streak of bad luck included a flat tire at
Dover Downs, losing two laps because of a caution flag at
Martinsville, and ignition problems at Talladega.

 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eighteen Ku Klux Klan members, vastly outnumbered by
scores of reporters, photographers and television crews, hundreds
of riot-helmeted police and thousands of counterdemonstrators,
stood in silent protest for an hour and 15 minutes Saturday in the
limp finale to a constitutional melodrama stretching from City Hall
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police hustled the Klan members _ 16 men and 2
women, most wearing pointed white hoods, but no masks _ into the
basement of the state Supreme Court building on Foley Square 45
minutes before the scheduled end of their rally, a series of
running clashes between the counterdemonstrators and the police
broke out nearby, around the Municipal Building.
</P>
<P>
   The scuffles went on, with about a dozen arrests, swirling,
jeering crowds and cantering mounted police even as, a few dozen
yards away, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was holding a news conference in
City Hall's Blue room to praise the police for peacefully
containing the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, seven people _ all counterdemonstrators _ were arrested
during the Klan demonstration, the police said. At least three
police officers were injured, including a Community Affairs officer
who was hit in the head by a thrown D-cell battery, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The day began badly for the Klan members, who had been unmasked
Friday by a three-judge appellate court's reversal of an earlier
ruling that the city could not deny them a permit on the basis of
an obscure 1845 state law prohibiting masked gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of shouting protesters _ 6,000 by the police count,
along with another 2,000 tourists and curious onlookers _ had
already gathered in two fenced-in sections, at the north and south
edges of the square, rimmed with government buildings and
courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   The area set aside for their protest, a small triangle of grass
and trees just north of the State Supreme Court at 60 Centre
Street, was already surrounded by helmeted police and sealed with
barricades of steel and of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   But, witnesses said, five men, two dressed like skinheads and
three older men in street clothes, were already there, having
talked their way past the police by saying they were Klan
supporters joining the rally.
</P>
<P>
   As the little band of Klan members made their entrance, the five
men rushed them and began pummeling the Klan grand dragon, James W.
Sheely. Police officers pulled them off and arrested at least
three. One of them, a white-haired man, shouted, ``Death to the
Klan'' as he was led off in handcuffs. Sheely was cut on the cheek,
and was later seen pressing a napkin to his face at during the
protest.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One of the men who posed as a Klan supporter was John Lewis, 47,
a shop teacher at George Westinghouse High School in downtown
Brooklyn. ``We ran into the group, and I ripped their banner away
from them,'' Lewis said Saturday at the 84th Precinct in Brooklyn,
where he and the other two men were taken after their arrest. ``I
was put to the ground before I had a chance to do anything more. I
would have done all I could to try to stop that group from
organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' friend, Derek Pearl, 62, a former teacher at Westinghouse
High, grabbed a Klan member's face when he rushed the group. ``I
wish I could have grabbed his neck, but there were about eight cops
dragging me down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he justified fighting racism with violence, Pearl
said: ``How could someone who believes in racial superiority have a
just rally? If that's not reason enough to hurt someone, I don't
know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan members were unmasked after they lost a legal battle
with the city that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the federal appeals court reversed a lower court
decision and barred Klan members from rallying with their faces
hidden by masks. In a victory for the Giuliani administration, the
justices unanimously rejected the Klan's arguments that the city
was selectively enforcing a state law that bars the wearing of
masks during most rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Klan group, the Church of the American Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan, had argued that if its members were forced to
unmask themselves, they faced retaliation because of their
unpopular views _ and that the law thus violated their First
Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   About 11 a.m. Saturday, the New York Civil Liberties Union filed
a petition on the Klan's behalf with the U.S. Supreme Court, and it
was referred to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has responsibility
for emergency petitions from the New York region. At 2 p.m.,
Justice Ginsburg rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were pleased with the Supreme Court
decision upholding the antimask statute. ``We are gratified by the
decision of Justice Ginsburg,'' said the city's Corporation
Counsel, Michael D. Hess. ``It supports the case that we presented
to the court and supports the 3-to-nothing decision by the 2nd
Circuit Court of Appeals. We also feel that the policy behind the
antimask statute helps to avoid violence, makes people accountable
for their actions and, so far, the event has been virtually
violence-free and, hopefully, will conclude that way.''
</P>
<P>
   On a makeshift stage in front of the state Supreme Court
building where placard-carrying anti-Klan protesters had gathered,
Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, yelled into a microphone:
``These are stupid people. They need to blame their targets for
their own failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan, which once boasted of membership in the millions, is
believed to have dwindled to about 4,000 members as it struggles to
compete against newer, bolder and more Internet-savvy groups
proclaiming white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Klan was looking for a fight Saturday, or hoping to
update its image from hooded men on horseback burning crosses in
country fields. What better way to pick up a few members, free
publicity, and compete with groups like the World Church of the
Creator, the Aryan Nation and Christian Identity than to hold a
little rally in Manhattan, the heart of American liberalism?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Klan has a plan: to let it be known around the
country that they can do whatever they want,'' said Charlene
Mitchell, a labor organizer from Manhattan who came to one of the
two pre-Klan protest gatherings Saturday. ``That's why they want
all this attention, to grow their membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some others among the protest crowd, Ms. Mitchell, 69, has
seen other Klan rallies, in Cleveland, Georgia and Tupelo, Miss.,
where hooded, armed Klansmen rode through town on flatbed trucks.
``It was a scary thing,'' she recalled. ``You can't see their
faces. You can't see their eyes. It's terrorizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stinson, 45, a social studies teacher from Leonia, N.J.,
who was also at the protest, said: ``They have a right to speak,
but people who believe in tolerance should also speak out. I feel
it's important not just to talk about it, but we must use as much
energy as those who encourage hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikeisha Mustafa, 24, a student at the College of New Rochelle,
said she had skipped class to attend. ``It's time for people to
realize how dangerous the Klan is in America as a whole, not just
in the South,'' said Ms. Mustafa, who is black. ``Their white power
means destruction to the rest of our nationality.'' She said she
was pleasantly surprised at the racial diversity of those at the
protest. ``I can go back and tell people it's more than just black
and white. That this involves everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the specter of a few dozen members of a racist fringe
group taking a stage in lower Manhattan before hundreds of police
officers and the throng of jeering protesters, the event was
filigreed with smaller, quieter ironies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the defenders of the Klan's right to rally, for example,
were the city's largest black newspaper, The Amsterdam News, and
the Rev. Al Sharpton, who both filed legal papers this past week
supporting the Klan's efforts. (Though the paper said it had acted
from a sense of First Amendment inclusiveness, Sharpton clarified
that he was not ``for the Klan,'' simply ``against the mayor.'')

OFFENSIVELY SPEAKING, TURNER AND GAILEY LIKE NIGHT AND DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As offensive minds among NFL head coaches go,
Norv Turner and Chan Gailey are about as alike as right brain/left
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Their names may be symmetrical, right down to the number of
letters, but their philosophies on how to move the football and put
up points are highly dissimilar, especially in their use of the
running game.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, former Cowboys offensive coordinator now in his sixth
season as head coach of the Washington Redskins, runs the
traditionally two-back, occasionally two-tight end, smash-mouth,
run-between-the-tackles offense.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same system being used by offensive coordinators in New
England (Ernie Zampese) and St. Louis (Mike Martz). Don't look now,
but the Redskins, Rams and Patriots currently rank Nos. 1, 2 and 4
among NFL offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, the Cowboys' second-year head coach who is under fire by
fans and media for a 14th-ranked offense that has produced only
three touchdowns in its past 10 quarters, has more of a thinking
man's offense. There are frequent changes of personnel packages in
the offense, which utilizes running backs as receivers, sometimes
even winding up with an empty backfield behind the quarterback. It
also features a running game that is geared more to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Turner dares you to stop him. Gailey challenges you to outthink
him.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Gailey both are first-time NFL head coaches who
stepped into their jobs under similar circumstances. Both were
former offensive coordinators of other teams _ Turner, with the
Cowboys, Gailey, with the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Turner took over a 4-12 Redskins team that was three
years removed from a Super Bowl championship. In 1998, Gailey took
over a 6-10 Cowboys team that also was three years removed from a
Super Bowl win.
</P>
<P>
   In their first 22 NFL games as head coach, Turner was 5-17.
Gailey is 13-9.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers that matters most right now are four and two.
Turner is riding a four-game winning streak; Gailey, a two-game
losing streak coming into today's showdown for first place in the
NFC East at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who has come under harsh criticism as a result for his
play-calling the past two weeks, said, ``We're not sustaining and
finishing ... \Rbut\S I really don't think that we're that far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose play-calling has made him suddenly a genius in
Washington, said, ``We're running the same plays as we ran in the
past. What we're doing is that we're running them with a lot more
consistency, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones offered this perspective:
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know there are a lot of different offenses, a lot of
different schemes, a lot of different ways to play the same player,
and if you can put it all together, you can win a Super Bowl. We've
seen that. Different types of coaches, different styles of offenses
can win Super Bowls.''  &LR; subheds:Outside, inside Gailey's system is
more running to the outside; Turner's offense, more running
off-tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chan's offense, we put pressure on the defense by making
them think and adjust to what we're doing,'' said injured Cowboys
fullback Daryl Johnston, who has played under both systems. ``In
Norv's system, it was mainly: `OK, you know what we do. Let's see
if you can stop it.'''
</P>
<P>
   These are styles different from each other. There is more power
blocking in Turner's offense; there is more pulling in Gailey's
offense. They also have their similarities: Both offenses are
designed to protect the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both offenses believe in keeping a back in to protect the
quarterback, which is the antithesis of what they do in San
Francisco,'' said Jones, who predictably gave the Gailey offense
the edge over the Turner-Zampese system when asked to compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Chan utilizes Emmitt as a runner in an improved
way ... giving him a chance to make a \Rprogression read\S, pick
out the soft spot and make a bigger play than he might otherwise
get running off-tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan also incorporates some unorthodox play-calling into his
offense and that scares opposing defensive coordinators. I know
this. Dan Reeves does the same thing in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the Gailey offense is Reeves, his former Little
League coach in Americus, Ga., where both grew up, along with heavy
influence from Ron Erhardt, formerly of the same Steelers staff as
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Gailey playbook is a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan has ingenuity,'' said Jones, referring to the gadget
plays and multiple sets, ``but he does it without sacrificing the
fundamental approach to running the football.''  &LR; subheds:Knowing
your personnel Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo has had to
prepare for both coaches _ Gailey while with the Steelers and
Turner this week with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norv knows how to scheme and create blocking angles, but I
think his real strength is how he uses his players to make those
plays,'' said Campo. ``He has a real good `feel' for what to call,
when to call it and what players to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said, ``People think we're suddenly now running some kind
of different offense. We're not. You're going to have your ups and
downs, but the whole key is to continue doing what you believe
in.''
</P>
<P>
   What Turner believed in nearly got him fired, and as recently as
this past off-season when the Redskins were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it has something to do with players?'' Campo
asked with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Campo believes the difference in the Redskins' offense then and
now has been the addition of quarterback Brad Johnson (10
touchdowns, two interceptions and a 106.5 passer rating).
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had receivers like this before. They've had running
backs like this before. They've had offensive lines like this
before, although this one is better overall,'' said Campo. ``But
the key to the whole thing is the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's offense means more timing routes for the receivers.
Gailey's offense has more ``read-and-react'' routes for them.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's offense might include two, three or four wide receivers
and a tight end or a running back in the slot, and usually has
somebody in motion. Turner's offense is more basic, with something
as simple as either a fullback or an H-back to give the same
formation a different capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably use more personnel groups than any team we play.
In the first game, they used something like nine different
personnel groups against us,'' said Campo. ``\RTurner\S is very
good at using one play to set up another.''
</P>
<P>
   The wheels will be turning for both Gailey and Turner today at
Texas Stadium where, almost to a man, the Cowboys know this is a
must-win because they can't afford to lose a third consecutive NFC
East game and fall behind Washington by two games.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason nobody likes to call it ``must-win,'' said Jones,
``is because it puts you in a bind if you don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones prefers to call it ``a pivotal game'' or ``a very, very,
very important game,'' _ not must-win, but three verys.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey needs to get the Cowboys offense untracked. Turner wants
to avenge his team's only blemish, a game in which his offense
scored 35 points and lost, 41-35.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is on Gailey. The spotlight is on Turner. How quickly
opinions can change in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnston said: ``The Redskins kept Norv. I'm sure right about
now, they're very glad they did.''

RICE ROLLS PAST TCU WITH 35-POINT BURST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As members of Rice's fifth-ranked 1949 team watched
proudly, their 1999 counterparts seemed to offer convincing proof
yesterday that time has stood still for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. Another four-game winning streak over TCU. Happens every
50 years. What bowl shall we go to?
</P>
<P>
   But while that long-ago triumph was a memorable down-to-the-wire
battle, this one was memorable for the domination of the Owls (5-3,
4-0 Western Athletic Conference), who spotted the Frogs (3-4, 2-2)
a 14-point lead and then rolled to a 42-21 victory in front of
28,535 witnesses at Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the momentum changed and they started rolling, we just
couldn't stop them,'' said defensive end Aaron Schobel, who caused
a fumble that led to TCU's only points after the first quarter. ``I
don't know what changed ... it all happened so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Owls, who rolled up 424 yards, controlled the ball for
nearly 35 minutes, and even threw two touchdown passes, the victory
was their fifth in a row and left them with the inside rail
position in the WAC title chase.
</P>
<P>
   For the Frogs, said coach Dennis Franchione, ``This is not the
end-all game. We have to put this behind us and move on. But this
may be the best Rice team I've seen. It was a typical performance _
if you can't stop them, they control the tempo and get you out of
sync]. After that, it's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice coach Ken Hatfield said, ``As much as anything, when you
look back on it, that drive to start the third quarter was as big
as there was. We took the ball and went down and scored, and that
had a big impact on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a 14-14 battle, the Owls took the second-half kickoff
and executed a textbook wishbone march, 65 yards in 16 plays
requiring a leisurely seven minutes, 16 seconds. Quarterback Chad
Richardson, who finished the day with 163 yards on 28 carries,
converted a third-and-11 with a 17-yard sprint on the option, and
fullback Jamie Tyler plunged 1 yard for the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs ran three plays and punted, and the Owls were back
quickly, zipping 61 yards in 15 seconds. Leroy Tyler ran 22 on the
drive's first play, and Richardson finished it with a 39-yard pass
to Mike Gingrich, who was 20 yards past the TCU secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 28-14, the Frogs punched out to their 36, and then
Casey Printers tried to hit LaTarence Dunbar with a swing pass.
Rice linebacker Dan Dawson stepped in front of Dunbar, picked it
off, and traveled 30 yards to the end zone untouched with 3:32
remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against their offense, you hurt yourself when you give up a
score and then go three-and-out,'' Franchione said. ``But even when
they scored again, I felt we still had a decent chance. With our
offense, being 14 down wasn't that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the interception pretty much sealed it.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU got seven points back when Richardson fumbled after being
hit by Schobel, and Bird Jones ran it 19 yards into the end zone.
But the Owls countered with a 55-yard scoring run by Tyler in the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs opened the game smartly, rolling 80 yards on their
first possession, with national rushing leader LaDainian Tomlinson
(19 carries, 133 yards) slicing through huge gaps in the line and
Printers hitting two key passes and then scoring from the 4.
</P>
<P>
   A second score followed quickly, with Printers driving the Frogs
59 yards and hitting Mike Scarborough with a 5-yard fade for the
points with 3:54 remaining in the first period. But the Owls
recovered in the second quarter, with Richardson scoring once and
hitting Bradley with the tying score from 23 yards out. For the
Owls, it was the start of a 35-point run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were in pretty good shape after the first two
drives,'' Tomlinson said. ``We had things going our way. But after
that, we were mostly standing on the sidelines, watching them go up
and down the field. It was a frustrating day.''

CLINTON RETREATS FROM PLAN TO INVEST RETIREMENT FUNDS 
 (HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct time element in 2nd graf)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton dropped one of the most
contentious elements of his plan for bolstering Social Security's
finances on Saturday, and called on Congress to break the partisan
deadlock over how to prepare the retirement system for the aging of
the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he would send Congress
legislation this week based on a proposal he first floated earlier
this year to shore up Social Security with projected federal budget
surpluses. But the new version will not include Clinton's
longstanding call for the government to invest some Social Security
taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve more than confusion, double talk
and delay on this issue,'' Clinton said. ``So it's time to have a
clear, straightforward bill on the table, and next week I plan to
present one _ legislation that insures that all Social Security
payroll tax will go to savings and debt reduction for Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is now taking in more than $100 billion a year
above what it is paying to retirees, but as the baby boomers
retire, payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of his desire for bipartisan cooperation, White
House officials said Clinton was withdrawing for now his plan to
seek higher returns for the system by having the Government invest
as much as 15 percent of Social Security's reserves in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had rejected the idea of government investing in
equities, saying it would amount to federal ownership of private
industry. Most Republicans have rallied instead around alternatives
under which individuals would be able to invest part of their
Social Security payroll taxes on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans are sure to welcome Clinton's concession,
they long ago dismissed the rest of the president's basic approach,
which is built around reducing the national debt and then capturing
some of the interest savings on the retirement system's behalf.
Republicans have often said Clinton's underlying plan is nothing
more than an accounting shell game that fails to address the
fundamental mismatch between promised benefits and the revenues to
pay them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president is serious about saving Social Security,
he'll work with us to give personal accounts to American workers
rather than relying on tired old accounting changes that simply
fill the trust fund with more IOUs,'' said Trent Duffy, a spokesman
for Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said its plan would extend Social Security's
solvency from 2034, when under current projections it would be able
to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits, to 2050, beyond the
life span of most of the 76 million Americans born in the 18 years
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is present what we feel is the most
solid, bipartisan, hopefully uncontroversial proposal to lock away
the Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, and use those
interest savings to extend the solvency of Social Security,'' said
Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Saturday was in part a last-ditch effort
to make some progress this year on dealing with Social Security,
which has more than lived up to its reputation as the most
politically and ideologically charged of issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clearly also an effort to put the White House back on
the offensive after several weeks in which Republicans in Congress
have used Social Security to attack Democratic spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences, rallies on Capitol Hill and television
commercials in the districts of 10 House Democrats, the Republicans
have made a case that Democrats want to spend so much money that
they are raiding Social Security's reserves to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the president's radio address, Republicans in
Congress promised not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for
other spending programs, and called for cuts in spending. Rep. J.C.
Watts, the chairman of the Republican Conference, said Republicans
now planned to cut spending and keep the budget balanced while
paying down $150 billion in debt in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Security surplus must be off limits,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, who gave the Republicans' radio address Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the government should stay the course and live
within its means,'' Domenici added. ``By doing so, we can preserve
the Social Security surplus, pay down our national debt, keep the
budget balanced, while investing in priorities such as education
and health care.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both parties routinely agreed for decades to spend excess Social
Security payroll tax revenues on general government operations. But
this year the two parties have both pledged to balance the budget
without using any of the Social Security money, and they have been
trading bitter accusations about the inability of the other to show
how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has been less about Social Security _ the retirement
system's long-term health is only indirectly connected to whether
some of its excess revenues are spent on other programs in a given
year _ than about exploiting an issue that both sides believe can
play to their benefit in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of both parties have come up with approaches to
dealing with Social Security's underlying problems, none of the
plans have enough support to have been given serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said Clinton's plan was intended to be a start on the
broader goal of insuring Social Security's viability for at least
75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is based on the idea that by using the Social
Security surplus to pay down the national debt, the government's
interest bill will decline substantially.
</P>
<P>
   By the White House's estimate, the government's interest expense
will be $107 billion lower in 2011 than it would be if the Social
Security surplus were not used, starting this year, to reduce the
debt. Clinton's proposal would take the money saved because of the
lower amount of debt, starting in 2011, and earmark it to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   From 2011 through 2015, the total savings in interest dedicated
to Social Security would be $544 billion, Sperling said, and
savings would continue accruing beyond 2015 at around $189 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The savings would at first go to further reductions in the
national debt. After the debt was paid off _ around 2015 under the
White House's current scenario _ the savings would continue to be
transferred to Social Security in the form of a government IOU that
would later be redeemed to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the plan would still require that the
government eventually pay Social Security benefits using general
revenues. In that way, they said, Clinton's plan would merely defer
tough choices about raising taxes, cutting benefits or again
increasing borrowing.

BRUINS' START NOT SIMPLY NET RESULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-plus years into their recovery, the Bruins have regressed
like stumbling addicts, bumbling around the ice the way they did in
1996-97 when midseason came and all we had to look forward to
around here was the June draft and some wunderkind-in-waiting named
Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   What ails the Bruins? Head coach Pat Burns came out last week
and pointed to the obvious: the absence of Byron Dafoe, the cutting
loose of Dmitri Khristich, the walkaway of Tim Taylor, and the
buyouts of Dave Ellett and Ken Baumgartner.
</P>
<P>
   Burns's point: Minus those five, the product had to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   I'll buy that, but only to a point. Come the end of the
playoffs, Ellett and Baumgartner were virtually, if not totally,
out of the picture. Khristich, no matter what he says, his agent
says, or the Maple Leafs say now that they own him, folded up the
show on or about April 18, the last game of the regular season.
Based on his postseason performance and sour attitude at the end,
his subtraction is an addition.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's loss is real. He played with intelligence, passion, and
grit. He was a team guy. Sure, the Bruins can find capable bodies
to plug in that hole, be it a Sean Pronger or a Mikko Eloranta or
the Baby Bruin du jour, but Taylor was a known, reliable,
productive part of the puzzle. He was taking a pain-killing shot,
sometimes two, before every game of the Buffalo playoff series.
What more do you want than a guy's pound of flesh?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Taylor exceeded Boston's pay expectations and signed
with the Rangers for about $1.5 million a year. Great for Taylor.
He literally gave up his body for that money. Few athletes can say
that today. Boston's mistake with Taylor was not realizing his
worth _ especially with Burns as coach _ upon his arrival here in
the fall of '97. It was the same mistake the Bruins had made with
the likes of Dave Poulin and Dave Reid. Had management been
proactive and identified Taylor as a worthy employee to lock up for
the future, it would have paid him a little more than market rate
soon after his arrival and tied him up with a four- or five-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dafoe thing has become an out-and-out mess. Both sides share
the fault in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe opted not to go to arbitration following two seasons with
great numbers. He was guaranteed at least the $3 million the Bruins
offered and might have rung the bell for substantially more.
</P>
<P>
   Had he and his agent, Ron Salcer, made a realistic assessment of
the negotiating landscape on Causeway Street, they quickly would
have realized Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell weren't going to
spring the Vault door open for them. Heck, it took Sinden nearly 20
years and some 1,300 games to get there with Ray Bourque. Dafoe has
two years and 133 regular-season games in that black-and-gold
sweater. In this town, that means he's barely shaved up his crease
for pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, Bourque entered the '90s making around $500,000,
and that was pretty good pay for the time; only three NHLers were
at $1 million or more. Bourque won his third Norris Trophy in '90,
too, and he already was guaranteed a spot in the Hall of Fame. Just
these few years later, Dafoe won't work for six times what Bourque
made in '90.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquated thinking? OK, to a degree, because there's a new-age
club, Anaheim, paying Paul Kariya $10 million a year. But this is
Boston, with old ownership and even older management, and to expect
anything different after all these years is to believe that the
moon is made of cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   When Dafoe came with hat in hand recently and said he'd work for
Boston's base, around $3 million a year, that was the time for the
front office to realize it's important to know how to win. It was
time to do the deal, with a slight massage here and a little cash
there. To pull away now from the guts of a deal that has been on
the table for months looks and feels punitive.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it's either sign Dafoe or trade him, but don't
stand brave on short money and the shaping of incentives. Bust his
chops? For what? Soon it will be Christmas and the faithful fan
base, ever willing to pay, might begin to ask questions for the
first time since Bobby Orr left. Such as: ``Hey, Sophie, think
maybe you'd rather have a week in the Bahamas instead of going to
the Bruins-Blackhawks game tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins would not have started this season 0-5-4 with Dafoe
in net and Taylor anchoring the checking line. My guess: more like
3-3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled into thinking, however, that 0-5-4 is all Dafoe
and Taylor. Hardly. Anyone noticed how poorly the Bruins move the
puck out of their end? For two decades, that has been Bourque's
job, and thus far he hasn't shown his trademark zip and timing with
the puck. Let it be duly noted, too, that at one point last week he
was averaging 29:56 minutes per game, second only to the Blues'
Chris Pronger (age 25) and nearly 90 seconds more than Rob Blake
(age 29). Bourque is 38, and you just knew the day had to come when
he'd look 30.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the Bruins will get beyond the Dafoe signing and the
Taylor hangover. Hard to believe now, but they are better than a
.222 team. And when they are better, the key reason won't be either
Dafoe's dough or Taylor's stand-in. The reason will be the play of
Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, Anson Carter, and Thornton. That
was the truth seven weeks ago when training camp opened, and it
will be the truth three or four months from now. As those core
forwards go, so will go the Bruins. Right now, they're not going at
all, a huge concern that has been masked by hangovers, holdouts,
and business that has become all too usual on Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   Valuable addition
</P>
<P>
   Ellett, deemed too slow to help on the Boston back line, found
himself a job with the Blues last week, signing a one-year deal
worth $1.6 million. He'll help fill the void, especially on the
power play, while Al MacInnis recovers from a foot fracture. When
MacInnis went down, the most obvious names out there were Ulf
Samuelsson (signed last week by the Flyers) and Mark Tinordi (still
on the sideline). But St. Louis general manager Larry Pleau made it
clear from the outset that he wasn't going to shell out big money.
Pleau: ``We can't afford those kinds of contracts. We aren't going
to spend $2.5 million or $3 million on a guy _ we just aren't gonna
do it. Not only does it mean tying up that kind of money on a two-
or three-year deal, but when you do something like that, it means
some of your younger players get pushed further back in their
development. No one likes to lose a player like Al, but we all go
through it. As a matter of fact, we went through it last year when
Chris Pronger went down with a bad ankle. He was out for about a
month (15 games), and other guys just had to fill in.'' . . .
Adding to the Blues' injury woes: Ex-Bruin Geoff Courtnall again is
sidelined with a concussion. Doctors have prescribed a couple of
weeks of bed rest for Courtnall, who now may be facing retirement
at age 37. Courtnall: ``I don't know why this is happening to me;
maybe somebody is trying to send me a message.'' No matter what his
decision, he'll get the balance of the $7 million he has coming for
seasons 1999-2001 . . . The Flyers, off to the worst start in
franchise history (sound familiar?), committed $4.55 million to the
35-year-old Samuelsson through next season. Keep in mind:
Samuelsson and Flyers captain Eric Lindros have been hated enemies
since the '91 Canada Cup when Lindros, then only 18 years old,
separated one of Samuelsson's shoulders with a crunching check into
the boards. Could make for some interesting bus rides . . .
Ex-Bruins coach Don Cherry recently blamed the US college hockey
influence for all the hits around the net after the whistle. Now
there's a stretch. Seems to me the Flyers were perfecting that art
back in the '70s, when the NHL viewed US colleges as the feeding
ground for practice goalies. Tragically, the Canadian influence in
the NHL dies by the shift, but it's even more tragic when Cherry,
in defense of his flag, espouses his gobbledygook as gospel . . .
If the Bruins do get around to dealing Dafoe, one potential landing
spot is Vancouver, where Wrentham's Garth Snow is sidelined with a
broken finger. Question is: What do the Canucks realistically have
to offer? Three names that could come into the mix would be Markus
Naslund, Alex Mogilny, and Todd Bertuzzi, but none of the three,
individually, would approach Dafoe's value.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate returns
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got a second-round draft pick for losing Khristich to
the Leafs last week, and sure, something is better than nothing.
Right now, though, the Bruins need a body _ maybe a few bodies _
and some unnamed 17-year-old in Thunder Bay doesn't do much to fix
today's ills. The early rumor out of Toronto had the Bruins picking
up Yanic Perreault in the exchange. But a half-dozen games into the
new season, Perreault was the league's No. 1 faceoff man (66.4
percent success rate) and was picking up a point per game for the
Leafs. So much for that swap. However, look for the Leafs to make
another deal or two. Perreault could be moved, but not until
superstar center Mats Sundin is back from a leg fracture (at least
three more weeks) . . . Note to the NFL: That replay thing you've
got going, with the referee conducting his own peep show on the
sidelines, is far too reminiscent of the NHL's replay fiasco of the
last couple of years. Drop it now before it becomes the Super Bowl
nightmare that the NHL encountered in last season's Stanley Cup
final . . . When the Lightning visit the Vault Thursday night, look
for Ben Clymer on their back line. Clymer couldn't come to contract
terms here in Boston (Chapter No. 23567411) after being drafted
27th overall in '97. A free agent, he signed a three-year deal
worth some $2.5 million with Tampa at the start of October.
Initially assigned to the minors, he got the call ahead of Belmont
Hill's Paul Mara, the No. 7 pick in '97, only a few days into the
new season when the Bolts needed to bolster the blue line . . .
Brian Sutter's deal in Calgary won't be renewed if the Flames miss
the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season. Given his club's
start (2-5-2 headed into Saturday night) Sutter might have more
immediate concerns than what happens in March and April. Grant Fuhr
hasn't provided anything close to the hoped-for boost in the Flames
cage, and the attack overall is lifeless . . . Rumors about an
imminent Felix Potvin deal last week had Islanders GM Mike Milbury
issuing a statement saying, ``I am not entertaining offers for
Felix Potvin. He's been our best player so far. It's been our
intention to keep him.'' Potvin is hot again, after slumping badly
upon being dealt to the Isles last season. If the Isles do get
around to dumping him, look for them to wheel him for a young
forward with low salary and high upside. They could net, say, $1
million or more in payroll, enhance the offense, and bring
phenom-in- waiting Roberto Luongo up from Lowell . . . Flyers boss
Ed Snyder also had to shoot down reports last week that head coach
Roger Neilson was about to get the heave-ho and that GM Bob Clarke
was next on the loading dock. Not true, bellowed Snyder. This much
is true: With the league's No. 2 payroll, the Flyers are going to
have to get it in gear soon, or virtually everything in Philly,
including sidewalk pretzels, could change. An ESPN report last week
had the Flyers feeling out at least one club (hello, Detroit?)
about its interest in acquiring L'Enfant Terrible . . . Word around
Raleigh is that the transplanted Hurricanes will open their new
building with a season-ticket base of only 6,000 _ about half what
the league demands of would-be expansion cities before awarding
franchises . . . Ex-University of New Hampshire star Jason Krog
will make at least $1.175 million with the Islanders. The two-year
pact he signed at the end of his college career called for a pair
of $512,500 signing bonuses and a minor-league minimum of $75,000
for each of two seasons. If he makes it to Uniondale, his pay will
be prorated at $512,500. Not a bad deal for a kid who, at age 18,
was considered too small for pro scouts to take at all seriously.

<TEXT>
<P>
   See, it happens everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As losses mount, players begin to point fingers at the coaches
and one another. It has happened in New England under Pete Carroll.
It is happening in Hempstead, N.Y., with Jets players questioning
Bill Parcells's play-calling. It happened earlier this season in
Denver to Mike Shanahan, when a few of his players went out to
dinner and stuck a fork in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Carroll has spent so much time telling his players
not to point fingers at one another and at the coaching staff. It
is why he objected to this reporter writing about ``rumblings'' in
the locker room after the Kansas City loss, when he was questioned
for using the valuable Troy Brown on kickoffs (Brown was hurt on
the opening return) and for not activating Vincent Brisby. The
three remaining receivers got fatigued running deep route after
deep route in the absence of Brown and Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   Though coaches hate it when fingers are pointed, it does show a
human side to otherwise robotic players. It shows they care about
what's going on. Venting anger can be good.
</P>
<P>
   It has been good for Denver. After the dinner with a Sports
Illustrated reporter at which some players said the team was done
for the season, the Broncos' level of play seems to have improved.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Oakland, the theory will be tested with the Jets, who
have had unrest this past week. Even a longtime Parcells ally, New
York Post columnist Steve Serby, splattered the coach across the
pages of the newspaper, saying he not only looked like former Jets
coach Rich Kotite but coached like him as well. Serby wrote, ``The
genius doesn't live here anymore. Parcells is 1-5 and he has no one
to blame but himself. He made his backup quarterback bed and now he
has to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   An unnamed defensive player, speaking to the Newark Star-Ledger
about some of the team's defensive problems, said, ``There are some
things you just don't do. But remember, we're dealing with a
genius.'' Another player on the defensive side said, ``If you let
him tell it, he's doing all he can.'' That player didn't seem to
like the fact that Parcells tends to blame the players and not
himself for the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was criticized by an offensive player for the fade pass
to Keyshawn Johnson that he called against the Colts last week
because ``that's a tough pass in the end zone'' for an
inexperienced quarterback such as Ray Lucas. The ball was picked
off by Jeff Burris and run back 55 yards to set up the winning
field goal. Parcells did take the blame for that, saying, ``I take
full responsibility for it. You try to do what you think is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was criticized by another unnamed player just for
throwing the ball that late in the game when the Jets had run it so
well. ``We had run the ball for something like 200 yards and then
he throws it,'' said the player. Wayne Chrebet said, ``Obviously if
something works from the 50 to the 3-yard line, maybe you should
continue to go with that.'' Some players even brought up Parcells's
decision to get rid of quarterback Glenn Foley earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The locker room became even more fractured when players learned
details of the Kevin Williams situation. Most players didn't know
that Williams, a young safety, was critically ill in the hospital;
they didn't know because Parcells didn't tell anyone. Then Parcells
put Williams on an injured reserve list that allowed him to be paid
half his 1999 salary, which players thought was cheap for a guy who
was on a ventilator after a lung infection.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show that even when the great coaches lose, they lose
control of their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan found out after his 0-4 start. He lost his Hall of Fame
quarterback, John Elway, to retirement, and his All-Pro runner,
Terrell Davis, to a season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we had adversity,'' said Shanahan during a
conference call last week. ``How do you react to it? Do we give in?
Or do we use injuries as excuses? How do you step up? I'm pleased
with how the team's responded.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Shanahan has handled the injuries and backbiting a
bit more successfully than Parcells. That's not to say Parcells
won't handle it well himself after everyone has had their say and
stuck all of their knives in his back.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the infamous SI article, Shanahan went after his
team:
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, if someone believes we're going to be 0-8 the
first half of the season, if you really believe that, I'll buy your
bus ticket, plane ticket _ just tell me and I'll let you go. I
don't care how much money we're giving you.' I said, `Just go. You
can go. Go. Go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's so hard to keep doing the right thing, the genius thing,
after you've won two Super Bowls like Shanahan and Parcells have.
Eventually you have to make hard, cold decisions that can be based
more on salary cap considerations than football. Shanahan made a
couple of big mistakes in the eyes of many players and fans: He cut
Steve Atwater and replaced popular quarterback Bubby Brister with
Brian Griese.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans don't like those types of slights, and for a while it
affected the team. The Patriots went through the same thing with
Willie Clay, and unfortunately for Carroll, the problem has
lingered because Chris Carter simply hasn't been as good as Clay.
You can argue that Ty Law's tentativeness early in the season was
due in part to the fact that he didn't have Clay around to bail him
out if he took a chance and missed. Ditto for Lawyer Milloy, the
biggest critic of the move.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches don't like cracks in their teams' armor. It's easier for
guys like Parcells and Shanahan, because they've proven they can
win championships and they'll always have jobs. But Carroll won't
get that benefit if things worsen. We've seen the Cleveland Indians
fire Mike Hargrove despite five straight division titles and two
World Series appearances. It could happen here, too. Bob Kraft
isn't shy about replacing coaches; he wasn't afraid to stand up to
Parcells, and he lost him. Look at his other pro franchise, the New
England Revolution, and you'll find a new coach on the sideline
every season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are at a crossroads this week: Win and avoid the
finger-pointing, or lose and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers in charge
</P>
<P>
   It's San Diego. Way out on the other end of the world. In New
England, we don't pay much attention to the Chargers, but this year
there's reason to.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, with a rookie coach, Mike Riley, and a general
manager, Bobby Beathard, who many thought had flipped his lid for
hiring him, the Chargers start Sunday's games leading the AFC West
with a 4-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard, whose son had played at Southern Cal when Riley was
the offensive coordinator there, got a brainstorm. He figured Riley
would be the offensive mind that he needed for what traditionally
has been an offense-oriented franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But the team has developed quite differently than expected.
While the advent of Ryan Leaf seems to be well off in the future
given his maturity problems as a player and a person, the Chargers
have become a team noted for defense _ defense that revolves around
linebacker Junior Seau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Junior's team,'' said Riley. ``He sets the standard
for work and practice, everything we do. I just wish every young
football player in America could spend a day with him and watch
what he does to get ready for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all see the games and how he plays in the games. He's a
fabulous player. But you know, it's all the stuff he does before
the games actually arrive that really amazes me. It's been a great
example for all of us that are new here to see exactly what he
means to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Seau has been able to inspire people such as John Parrella and
Norman Hand, who are now playing out of their minds on defense. The
Chargers also have taken veterans such as Chris Penn and Darryll
Lewis off the scrap heap to keep the secondary in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Norman the game ball last week,'' said Riley. ``He and
John do all of the dirty work inside. They do their job quietly
without much fanfare or attention, but it enables some of our other
guys like Junior to make plays. We recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley really didn't know what to expect when he took over. He
didn't know the inner workings of the team, except that Seau was
the leader. He was asked immediately to handle Leaf, and he
definitely has put his foot down. At one point the Chargers weren't
going to keep Leaf on their roster. But Riley, who has experience
with quarterbacks, decided to make Leaf his project while Jim
Harbaugh and Erik Kramer led the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'm surprised with what's happened,'' said Riley.
``I had no real expectations of how it would be. We are, more than
ever in my life, going game to game, getting ready to play and
knowing it's going to be hard. We've never started out a game ahead
_ we're always coming from behind _ so I didn't expect that, and
really I don't know what to expect down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   A selling point?
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking: If building a new football stadium in Foxborough
continues to be a headache, do you think Kraft will just sell and
get into the bidding for the Red Sox? . . . With the success of Jon
Kitna in Seattle, Brad Johnson in Washington, and Kurt Warner in
St. Louis, teams are going to be competing to put quarterbacks on
NFL Europe rosters. The Chargers are considering it with Leaf. The
Patriots will likely do it with Michael Bishop. ``It was the best
thing I ever did,'' said Johnson. ``I didn't play very much in
college, and in my first three or four years, I didn't play much in
the league and I needed some experience. I always had great
practices, but there's nothing like game experience. It doesn't
guarantee that you're going to have success in the NFL if you go
over there, but at least you'll have that experience to draw on.''
Of course, Leaf, who has foresight the length of his nose, said,
``It's not an option. The No. 2 pick in the draft, you're playing
in the NFL, not the World League.'' . . . Did anyone else notice
that in last Sunday's Patriots-Dolphins game, there was an O.J.
(McDuffie) and a Kato (Serwanga) on the field at the same time? . .
. Wednesday was a sad day for Chrebet. While he chatted with
reporters, his cell phone rang, and when he answered it, his face
froze as he sat back in his chair. He learned that his football
coach at Garfield (N.J.) High School had committed suicide . . . In
Dallas, they call Deion Sanders the NFL's best cover corner. In New
England, it's Law. But according to Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren,
the best cover corner in the league is his own Shawn Springs. ``He
might be the best corner I've ever coached,'' said Holmgren. ``If
you go out and say, `You cover that guy all game,' he's the guy who
can do it.'' . . . Parcells told the New York media last week that
Scott Zolak would not be returning. There had been speculation
about Zo returning to the Jets after Ray Lucas sprained an ankle,
but the Jets are expecting Lucas to be ready by next week . . . New
England players, listen up. Instead of the same old sorry quotes,
this is what other players quite confident in themselves say about
the opposition: Redskins receiver Albert Connell on Sanders: ``I
don't think Deion can cover me. I mean, he's been in the league 10
years now. He's a good corner, an All-Pro, but I feel I'm at the
stage of my game where I can get by anybody.'' That's a refreshing
comment, unlike so many guys who say the same stuff week after week
and bore their fans to tears. Atlanta corner Ray Buchanan on
Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart: ``He looks where he's throwing the
ball. I don't know what's going on with their offense, but it's
pretty easy to read.'' Outside of Milloy's unabashed way of dealing
with things on the field and in the media, the Patriots can be a
stuffy bunch . . . Here's a different perspective on the
much-maligned Patriots offensive line, as told to the Worcester
Telegram and Gazette by Terry Allen: ``This is the best offensive
line I've played with. We're just not getting the opportunity.
These guys! How many years have they had 1,000-yard rushers?'' Hard
to believe there are five teams that run the football worse than
the Patriots, but oddly, No. 31 San Diego is 4-1 and No. 30 Seattle
is 3-2. Rounding it out, No. 29 Arizona is 2-4, No. 28 Atlanta is
1-5, and No. 27 Green Bay is 3-2. The Patriots, at 26, are 4-2, and
the Dolphins, at 25, are 4-1 . . . Agent Jack Mills, who represents
Ted Johnson, said there is a realistic chance his client can return
to active duty before the end of the regular season. ``Teddy feels
he can make it back, but he thinks it would be more the end of
November rather than the beginning of it,'' said Mills . . . Mills
also represents former Heisman winner Rashaan Salaam, who was cut
by the Browns to make room when Karim Abdul-Jabbar was acquired at
the trading deadline. Mills is in New England this weekend, and you
can expect him to approach the Patriots about Salaam, given their
running woes.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down on film critic
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith got himself in a bit of hot water in Cincinnati when
he accused teammates of not studying enough film and doing their
homework. Coach Bruce Coslet said, ``Akili needs to take care of
Akili, and everybody else is taking care of themselves. So I don't
want to hear that kind of talk. I don't think there's any problem
with our effort.'' . . . Marcus Washington, a sixth-round pick of
the Patriots, was signed to the Seahawks' practice squad. He holds
the distinction of being the only draft pick in the Bobby Grier era
who didn't make either the team or the Patriots' practice squad . .
. Bruce Smith has sacked 59 different quarterbacks in his NFL
career, and he gets a shot at No. 60, Kitna . . . Joey Galloway has
lost $900,000 in his holdout, plus he has been fined $5,000 a day
by the Seahawks for being AWOL. Nice decision . . . Coach Jon
Gruden will tell you the reason the Raiders lead the league in
rushing is Jon Richie, the big fullback who does quite a job as
Tyrone Wheatley's lead blocker. Part of the reason the Patriots'
running game hasn't worked is that Chris Floyd can't stay healthy
enough to be on the field . . . There have been 21 games decided in
the final two minutes this season, and 35 decided by 3 points or
fewer. That's more than half the 3-points-or-fewer record (67 of
240 in 1997) . . . Also up this season is passing yardage. The
average is 419.5 yards per game, compared with 400 after six weeks
last season . . . By beating the Redskins, Troy Aikman would have
his 87th victory of the decade. He is currently tied with Joe
Montana (1980s) for the most wins in a decade . . . Warner has a
131.4 passer rating through five games, completing 71.43 percent of
his passes. If he keeps it up, he could better Kenny Anderson's
record 70.55 completion rate of 1982 . . . The Patriots are fifth
in the league in sack differential. They've sacked the quarterback
20 times, two behind league leader Jacksonville, and they have been
sacked 13 times . . . Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn has been told to
stop looking to break the big play on every carry. Dunn has 17
carries for negative yardage so far because he's spending too much
time changing directions and trying to make something happen when
there's nothing there. ``Warrick can do whatever he wants out
there, but he's got to realize it's tough to run outside in this
league,'' said coach Tony Dungy. ``In his first two years, most of
his big runs came on inside runs, and I think on some of those
inside runs he's looking to bounce it outside too soon.'' . . . The
Cardinals have a bye this week and then will debut a revamped
offensive line against the Patriots. Rookie L.J. Shelton, who was
the 21st overall pick in the draft, is moving to left tackle,
replacing Matt Joyce; James Dexter, who had been the right tackle,
is moving to left guard, replacing Chris Dishman; center Aaron
Graham and right guard Lester Holmes will keep their jobs, but they
too could be on the outs . . . The Cardinals have decided to go the
Rams route and sign a quarterback from the Arena League: Sherdrick
Bonner, who played for the Arizona Rattlers and was playing
softball in four leagues in Phoenix when he got an audition last
Tuesday. Bonner, who completed 28 of 30 passes at the audition,
will back up Dave Brown, who will start against the Patriots next
week in place of Jake Plummer (fractured finger).

CENTRAL: RUNNING OF ALL BUT THE BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the NBA's Black-and-Blue Division.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the fraudulent Chicago Bulls _ are they something or
what? _ and you have the best-balanced division in the league. With
the exception of the disreputaBulls, you have seven teams with
quite legitimate playoff aspirations. Given what's going on in the
Atlantic Division, who could say otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   The Central Division features a worst-to-first turnaround by the
Hornets, who last year were predicted to finish even lower than the
Bulls. The reason? Their two best players were out, their coach was
in a snit, and their marquee free agent was Derrick Coleman. But
the Hornets changed coaches, made a big deal (which looks better
every day), and now are the presumptive favorites in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's champ, Indiana, has a spectacular new building and a
real tug-of-war going on between the win-it-now crowd (Larry Bird)
and the let's-reload-before-we-become-the-Bulls crowd (management).
One Davis has been traded (Antonio) and the other is upset over his
contract (Dale). The backcourt starters are both 34 and the center
has feet that would make Bill Walton blush.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, meanwhile, is perceived to be a team on the move, and
for good reason. If they ever get a point guard, or if Alvin
Williams somehow morphs into one, the Raptors will be even better.
</P>
<P>
   You can throw a blanket over Milwaukee, Atlanta, Detroit, and
Cleveland. One doesn't appear to be demonstrably better than the
others, although the Pistons still have Grant Hill (for the time
being, anyway). The Bucks seem to have suffered the least of the
four, so they get the early nod to lead the pack. The Cavs have a
rookie coach, but also have Danny Ferry on the last year of his
10-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The only team without a chance is, of course, those cagey Bulls.
Gee, they're doing a masterful rebuilding job there, aren't they?
They missed out on all the free agents last summer _ oops, we
forgot Will Perdue and B.J. Armstrong _ so now management is trying
to brainwash the dupes out there into thinking that they'll get
Hill or Tim Duncan next summer. Yeah, sure. Maybe Tyrone Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they'll be awful again, further discrediting
what they did earlier in the decade. At least the Celtics tried to
be decent (with the notable exception of 1995-96). The Bulls'
``Refuse To Win'' mentality couldn't be more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a preview of the division, with the teams listed in
projected order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   1. CHARLOTTE HORNETS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 26-24, fifth place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Baron Davis, Todd Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Chucky Brown, Chuck Person.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key returnee: Anthony Mason.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Even It Up.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: You gotta like this team on paper. Coach Paul
Silas already had a good team, and then he lucked into rocket man
Davis in the draft. The Hornets can go big or small and beat you
either way. Say what you want about phlegmatic Elden Campbell _ and
there are times when he's out in the ether _ he remains one of the
top three healthy centers in the conference. Coleman appears to
have gotten religion, and Mason, quirks aside, is relentless. Eddie
Jones is one of the top 2 guards in either conference; he'll get a
chance this season to pick up those playoff stats, which have been
a downer. David Wesley may be keeping the seat warm for Davis, but
he's not a bad guy to have running the show. Plus, he can keep
defenses honest with his shooting. The Hornets can also be a pain
on defense with Jones and Davis on the perimeter and Campbell and
Coleman to block shots. Everyone likes this team now. It's easy to
see why.
</P>
<P>
   2. INDIANA PACERS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 33-17, first place. Lost to New York in the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Jonathan Bender, Zan Tabak.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Antonio Davis, Fred Hoiberg.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key lame duck: Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``I Don't Want to Wait.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: How much do these guys have left in the tank? Bird
is on record as saying not only that this is his last year, but
also that he can't go into the season without a decent backup for
Rik Smits. So he has Zan Tabak? The Pacers can go two ways, either
one understandable. They can recognize this might be their last,
best chance, or they can do what they did three years ago when they
knew Larry Brown wasn't coming back. They took that year off. The
loss of Davis is significant in the short run; three years from
now, if Bender develops as many think he might, we might be hailing
it as an outright Indy theft. But that's not going to help the
Pacers now, unless the kid is even savvier than Kevin Garnett.
Antonio Davis was a huge force (even if he did get smoked by Marcus
Camby in the playoffs), and now Dale Davis is in high dudgeon over
his contract. If they play, and play hard, the window is still
open. But barely.

   3. TORONTO RAPTORS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 23-27, sixth place. Did not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Antonio Davis, Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry,
Alex Radojevic.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: John Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``It's Getting Hotter in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: These guys have the pieces in place to make a
serious upgrade and don't seem all that much less powerful _ on
paper _ than either of the two teams above them. They've got
grizzled tough guys (Davis, Kevin Willis, Charles Oakley) to go
along with dazzling young'uns (Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter) and
assorted others who can shoot (Curry), block shots (Michael
Stewart), and defend (Doug Christie). The big question mark is at
point guard; is Williams up to it or will the no-knees-left Bogues
be pressed into serious service? Toronto wanted to plug that hole
this past summer and made a run at Eric Snow. The Raptors still
have some very moveable players if they feel they have to make a
deal down the road. But with a very acceptable starting five and
some enviable depth _ we haven't even mentioned Dee Brown, who is
on the shelf for now _ the Raptors should become the first Canadian
playoff team in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   4. MILWAUKEE BUCKS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 28-22, fourth place. Lost to Indiana in first
round.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Dale Ellis, J.R. Reid, Danny Manning.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Dell Curry, Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Easy to Be Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Only five players remain from the Bucks team that
started the season last February: Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson, Ervin
Johnson, Tractor Traylor, and Vinny Del Negro. But even bigger is
the availability of Sam Cassell, who was all but gonzo last year.
If he's healthy and stays healthy, he can be a big plus. George
Karl's teams also play defense _ a previously foreign concept to
the Big Dog _ and the presence of all those veterans can't hurt in
the locker room. (Ellis, of course, played for Karl in Seattle.) A
real wild card here for Milwaukee is Tim Thomas, who came over from
Philadelphia. If he develops as Karl thinks he might, he could be a
terrific addition off the bench. Traylor and Reid will provide bulk
up front, and Johnson can block shots, if not much else. The big
question is how much of a hit the Bucks took in losing the Currys.
Ellis might replace Dell. But Michael's toughness won't be easy to
replicate.
</P>
<P>
   5. ATLANTA HAWKS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 31-19, second place. Lost to New York in the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Isaiah Rider, Jim Jackson, Lorenzen Wright,
Bimbo Coles, Jason Terry, Cal Bowdler.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Steve Smith, Mookie Blaylock, Tyrone Corbin,
Grant Long, Ed Gray.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``I Know There's an Answer Here.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: This team could have gotten to the conference
finals last spring had it remained healthy and been able to make
shots. It did neither and succumbed to the Knicks in utterly
humiliating fashion. Still, the breakup is staggering and a lot is
riding on the new guys. Rider is who he is; this also is the last
year of his contract. Wright is a nice addition up front, but is
Bimbo Coles an even swap for Blaylock? (Terry eventually may settle
there when he figures out how the NBA works.) There are also a lot
of questions about Lenny Wilkens's ability to handle all the
potential distractions _ we've already seen Rider acting up (it's a
good thing he wasn't in Kitty Hawk or we'd still be taking trains).
But the Hawks like the mix (forget what you saw in Providence if
you were one of the 100 who watched). And while we're at it, isn't
it time Dikembe Mutombo puts an end to his ``overrated'' tag?
</P>
<P>
   6. DETROIT PISTONS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 29-21, third place. Lost to Atlanta in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Terry Mills, Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Joe Dumars.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key maybes: Bison Dele, Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``The Last Time.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: A lot hinges on whether Dele and Harper decide to
play. If they do, the Pistons could be back in third place. If they
don't, they'll be lucky to make the playoffs. They have the best
ACC team right now _ a notch above Wake Forest _ but they can't be
serious about Eric Montross/Don Reid with Christian Laettner at
power forward. They have the supernova in Hill, who may use this
season to determine if he really wants to stay or join Tim Duncan
in San Antonio. (Wouldn't that be a nice fit, given the Spurs' need
for a small forward?) Harper would help in the locker room _ we
think _ and provide a capable backup to erratic Lindsey Hunter.
They have some good outside shooters in Jud Buechler and Terry
Mills, a super slasher in Jerry Stackhouse (who has to start
playing one of these days), and the relentless Jerome Williams.
That should be enough to get them to the dance.
</P>
<P>
   7. CLEVELAND CAVALIERS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 22-28, seventh place. Did not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Lamond Murray, Mark Bryant, Andre Miller,
Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Derek Anderson, Johnny Newman.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``Nobody Home.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: These guys could be a lot better this season and
still find themselves right where they were last year. They have a
new coach in Randy Wittman and they also have a lot riding on the
Waltonesque feet of Zydrunas Ilgauskas. If he can play this season,
and play the way the Cavs know he can play, then Cleveland will be
a potentially dangerous team. (Bryant was picked up as insurance,
although he's no Andrew DeClercq.) They will have the inside game
and the outside game with bombers galore in Wesley Person, Murray,
and Langdon. That's a good mix. The Cavs were generally pretty
sound defensively under Mike Fratello, and it's hard to envision
that changing with a Bobby Knight disciple at the helm. This could
easily be the best seventh-place team in the league. If the Z man
avoids the IL and the rookies develop as hoped, the Cavs could move
up a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
   8. CHICAGO BULLS &QC; 
(FR) Last season: 13-37, last place. Did not make playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key additions: Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Will Perdue, B.J.
Armstrong, Hersey Hawkins, Fred Hoiberg.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Key losses: Ron Harper, Brent Barry, Mark Bryant, Andrew
Lang, Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Team song: ``The Impostors.''
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comment: Well, at least the Jerrys can relax knowing they
have not done what the Celtics did. That, of course, was their big
fear. No, they've turned themselves into the Clippers, which is
even more mystifying. Somehow, the basketball fans in Chicago are
being asked to fork over good money to see a team that again has
decided to take a pass on the season. Oh, we'll see a lot of Brand
and Artest because they have to play; there's no one else. Everyone
else of any consequence is in the last year of his contract,
including the Bulls' last holdover from the Glory Days II, Toni
Kukoc. (Armstrong and Perdue were around for Glory Days I.) Think
those guys will be really pushing the envelope for victory No. 20
in mid-April? The big question is whether the Bulls can outmaneuver
Orlando _ also tanking it _ for the worst overall record. That's
part of the plan, of course. Just ask the Clippers how it all comes
together.

   When most youngsters finish the 3-mile Head of the Charles
Regatta, their parents cheer for them, help them lug the boats to
the car, and drive them home. But Eleni Goesch-Karamanlidis had a
slightly different welcoming committee Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dimitrius Karamanlidis cheered her on, and yes, he helped
her put the boat on top of their car. But they were not headed home
to Narragansett, R.I. The father and daughter will trade places
Sunday when Dimitrius, 51, rows in the grand master singles race,
and Eleni will be cheering on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Eleni, 14, is the youngest competitor this weekend, but she is
no newcomer to the sport. Or to the Charles. She rowed her first
Head of the Charles two years ago, but this was the first time the
family got to double-team the event.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday father saw daughter start at Magazine Beach, then got
in his car and tried to beat the traffic to meet her at the finish.
Traffic wasn't a problem for him, but the wind was for Eleni.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I just quit racing, it was so windy,'' said Eleni as
she fastened the scull to the roof of the car, then grabbed a bagel
to chew on as she put on her long pants and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Eleni finished ``dead last'' in the field of 26,
and she wasn't hopeful that Saturday would be any better.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, as Eleni placed 24th out of 25 starters, with a time
of 28:05.06.
</P>
<P>
   The windy conditions offset her skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one spot, on the second mile, that actually I
could row,'' she said. ``Otherwise I kind of went with it. I really
was trying, but I don't know, it seemed like I couldn't row and
flipped over a couple times. The wind just kept working against me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was waiting to go at the start, I probably was going
faster than when I would have been racing, going the other
direction. I couldn't even get my jacket off without almost falling
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleni (who usually goes without the hyphenated last name,
despite the program listing that ``the announcers messed up all
four times''), said she had some foreshadowing about the bad
weather on the drive up Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole ride up, the boats kept moving around, they almost
fell off,'' she said. ``But I didn't think it'd be so bad till I
got out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrius, an engineering professor at the University of Rhode
Island, rowed a little in his native Greece, but didn't start
competing seriously until he was in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   When Eleni was 5 years old, she was small enough to squeeze in
and ride with him. When Eleni was 7, they went to a camp in Vermont
for private lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else is just sit in the boat and try to figure it
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They thought of joining a club but haven't because the closest
one is 35 miles away in Providence. Both Dimitrius and his wife,
Hilde Goesch, live at the college.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8-inch Eleni, who is on the cross-country team at
Narragansett High, said she might put her running career on hold to
focus on rowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go to the Olympics, and think I'm better at rowing
than running if I pay attention to it,'' she said.

COMEBACK A MATTER OF FACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Miami coach Butch Davis prepared to analyze Saturday's
game, he sat down and sighed. He was not overcome by emotion,
knowing his No. 23 Hurricanes had just won their first game since
early September. He did not break down and cry, as he did after a
double-overtime victory at Alumni Stadium two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with a Southwestern accent cultivated during a boyhood
in Oklahoma, Davis spoke purposefully. He emphasized important
points with a slight drawl, letting the words ``miraculous'' and
``defense'' and ``composure'' and ``stop Boston College'' hang in
the air a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   From the coach's confident appearance, it was hard to remember
the Hurricanes trailed the Eagles by four touchdowns early in the
third quarter. Listening to Davis, it was hard to imagine that
Miami's dramatic 31-28 victory took anything more than careful
planning and better defense.
</P>
<P>
   He made it seem smart to go for it on fourth and 17 with the
score tied, 14 seconds left, and his quarterback injured. He
graciously praised Boston College as ``outstanding,'' sounding like
any victorious coach who thought he brought the better team and
gained validation by the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his team were not cocky in their postgame remarks and
celebrations, but they did not betray any doubt in themselves or
their ability to win the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked at halftime that if we were going to get back in the
game, there were going to be three things that were going to have
to happen,'' said Davis, whose team trailed, 21-0, at intermission.
``Defensively, we were going to have to make a stand. We were going
to have to stop Boston College. I thought our defensive kids
responded. The second thing I told the players was we weren't going
to win it all in one play. We weren't going to get back in it in
one play. It was going to be a long process. It was going to be
possession after possession. The third thing we talked about was we
had to create a turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami went right down the checklist. The defense made
adjustments, keeping BC scoreless after it took a 28-0 advantage
with 6:18 left in the third. The Miami offense stretched its rally
throughout the second half, capping its comeback with a 30-yard
Andy Crosland field goal with three seconds remaining. A crucial
turnover came midway through the fourth quarter. Cedric Washington
fumbled and Miami's William Joseph recovered. One play later the
Hurricanes had cut the Eagles' lead to one touchdown, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   As Miami drew closer in the second half, the visitors' sideline
came alive. Junior wide receiver Michael Stewart of Cranston, R.I.,
waved a towel in the air and flapped his arms, cheering on his
teammates. Junior linebacker Nate Webster kept muttering under his
breath, ``Comeback, comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored 21 points in a half, so we felt we could score 21
points in a half,'' said tight end Daniel Franks, who caught a
10-yard pass from Kenny Kelly to tie the game at 28. ``I think when
they came out and jumped on us, 28-0, that may have taken a little
out of us, but we never stopped fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back and we scored, that built our confidence
back up going into the next series. I think (BC) lost a little bit
of emotion on that and we just kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   After Miami scored its second touchdown, the team's attitude had
changed. At that point, the Hurricanes knew they had caught the
Eagles off guard with their two-minute offense. The second
touchdown came so easily after a 32-yard pass from Kelly to James
Jackson that the offense told the defense all it needed to do was
hold the opposition to four touchdowns. If the defense could keep
Miami at 28 points, the offense believed it could win the game.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous first half, the defense was more than happy
to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in the locker room and said, `We've got a whole other
half,' '' said linebacker Dan Morgan. ``With the offense that we
have, we knew that if we got them the ball, sooner or later they'd
start clicking. They did. We got them the ball. We did everything
we wanted to do.''

CIRINO NOT HAPPY WITH DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Cirino entered the interview room Saturday looking
downright hostile, bitter that Boston College blew a 28-0
second-half lead and lost to Miami, 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   The senior defensive back and cocaptain boldly, and angrily,
declared that the Eagles have endured such a letdown for the last
time.
</P>
<P>
   Never again, he said, will BC watch an opponent score four
unanswered touchdowns, then allow a limping quarterback to convert
a fourth-and-17 play to set up a winning field goal. Never again
will the Eagles fail to put away a heralded adversary. Never again
will they walk away that embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Saturday's loss was the worst he's ever experienced,
Cirino fired back, ``What do you think? We were up, 28-0. Without
question it was a chance for us to make a statement in this
program, make a statement throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on national TV. We have a lead like that and give up.
It's unexcusable. It's unexcusable when you're trying to develop a
program. It's something we should never let happen and something
that's never going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirino tied for second in tackles among the Eagles with six. He
was part of a defense that held the Hurricanes to just four first
downs and 101 yards total offense in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   He was also there when Miami spent the last 17:11 outexecuting
the Eagles at practically every phase of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the contest got away, Cirino said, ``It's hard to
pinpoint. We just came out in the second half and didn't play well
at all. We didn't do a good job of executing our plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stunk in the second half. Period. We had a 21-0 lead; we
came out and . . . the offense came out and scored a touchdown and
put us up by 28. It's unexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Eagles 5-2, still one win away from bowl
consideration, and the rest of the schedule (at Syracuse, West
Virginia, at Notre Dame, at Virginia Tech) is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Cirino, ``I can't wait for next week. It will be a gut
check for this team how we respond.'' And he disputed coach Tom
O'Brien's claim that the Eagles wore down in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst moment came with 14 seconds left, when Miami
faced that fourth-and-17 from the BC 35.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kenny Kelly, battling a sprained left ankle
sustained moments before, completed a 22-yard pass to wide-open
receiver Reggie Wayne, who got his feet down after leaning to make
the catch. Andy Crosland kicked a 30-yard field goal on the next
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going for the (first-down marker),'' said
Cirino of the reception. ``I knew, and I tried to relay that to the
rest of the defensive backs. I knew they were going to try to put
themselves in position for a field goal. We just didn't execute.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory would have been BC's first over a ranked team since
a triumph over then-No. 24 West Virginia two years ago, in
O'Brien's first home game. Instead the Eagles were left to discuss
what could have been _ and what won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cirino, ``For us to give up as big a lead as we had,
regardless of who it is . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who it is. We're just as good as Miami if we
showed up today.''

87 GOLD RC SET THE STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ Friday night and Mike Teti was calling from his car
phone, en route to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 9,000 things to do this weekend,'' the US men's rowing
team coach was saying.
</P>
<P>
   That night, it was a National Rowing Foundation fund-raising
meeting in Mystic _ then back here straightaway. ``I have to row
with my buddies tomorrow morning,'' said Teti _ and against his own
crew Sunday afternoon in the Head of the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Teti may direct the planet's best eight, but he has a higher
calling Sunday. He's rowing bow for the 87 Gold Rowing Club, also
known as the US boat that surprisingly won a gold medal at the 1987
World Regatta.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't so long ago that Teti and his buddies are old enough
to row in the masters race. But it was long enough that 87 Gold has
no fantasies of blowing away the field in the championship event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not delusional,'' said Teti, who at 43 is the ranking
elder of the eight. ``We're not going to beat our national boat.
We're not going to beat the Germans or the Brits. We're not going
to beat Princeton or Harvard. If we get in the top 20 (of 49),
that'll be a good result. For us, the important thing is just
getting back together.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 crew had its 10th reunion here two years ago. Since all
but one also rowed in the 1988 Olympic eights at Seoul, they had
another 10th reunion last autumn. So why not again this year? All
but Teti, Mike Still, and John Pescatore live in the Boston area
and all of them are still in racing shape. Relatively, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how when you get older, what you perceive as being
in shape changes from when you were really in shape,'' Teti mused.
``The guys told me they row twice a week. I said, `So rowing twice
a week gets you in shape?' It used to be that rowing twice a day
got you in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, twice a week was enough for 87 Gold to beat a bunch of
college varsities last year, enough to find the swing again and
reclaim a taste of the magic from a dozen summers past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a special boat,'' Teti said. ``No stars, but it had
this chemistry, like the US boats the last few years. Anytime we
did anything on the clock it was pretty quick. But if you'd asked
me when I got off the plane in Copenhagen if we'd win, I would have
said probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   The US hadn't won the gold medal in 13 years, most of the boat
was college kids, and their heat was brutal _ the West and East
Germans, the Soviets, and the Australians. Save your energy for the
repechage (second-chance race), coach Kris Korzeniowski told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But midway through the race, we went through the field,'' Teti
recalled. ``We not only won the heat, we set a world record. I
thought, maybe we can win this thing. The final was actually easy _
we won by open water.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Still, the entire boat came back for the Olympics,
which the US hadn't (and still hasn't) won since 1964. Teti and his
mates led midway, but the West Germans rowed through them. Then the
Soviets caught them by a quarter of a second at the finish and
silver turned to bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we were a bit disappointed,'' said Teti. ``But about
40 seconds later I thought, well, it's an Olympic medal. I'm pretty
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans haven't won one since. They didn't win another
world title until 1994. Now, with Teti coaching, they've won three
in a row and are the chalk favorite to break their 36-year golden
drought in Sydney next year. They're also odds-on to win the
championship eights for a record fifth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Teti took a few spins with his 99 Gold guys in practice at
Princeton last week because 7-man Garrett Miller was hurt and
replacement Sebastian Bea was still in class at Cal-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to row with the good guys for a few days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, though, Teti was back working out with the
87s, with Still and Pescatore, John Smith and Ted Patton, Pete
Nordell and Doug Burden, Mike Porterfield (subbing for fellow
Northeastern immortal Jeff McLaughlin) and cox Seth Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   For luck, they were using the same Vespoli shell that the 1997
boat rowed to win its world crown. Maybe it could restore them a
decade's youth by osmosis. The 87s still work out regularly and
most are near their Olympian weights (Teti still checks in around
185). They can still make a boat move _ just not as fast for as
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go out and do steady-state, it feels the same,'' Teti
said. ``But once we go to pressure, it's not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't ever be the same as it was in Copenhagen, but that's
not why the 87 Gold RC is taking to the river Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we crossed the line in 1987, that eight never rowed
again,'' Teti said. ``We just want to be back out there together.''

PITINO'S PLEDGE DOESN'T LOOK PROMISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks here in River City are frettin' a mite. Professor Rick
Pitino said our band instruments are on the way, but it's been a
couple of years since we gave him our money, and we kinda thought
we'd be blasting out our 76 trombones by now.
</P>
<P>
   He's a promising machine. This year he promises we're gonna be
in the playoffs. Sounds great. Would be nice. It's sad to
comtemplate, but we're coming up to Year 5 of the FleetCenter and
there has yet to be an NBA playoff game in that building. The name
``Boston Celtics'' simply doesn't mean anything to the current
generation. It's just another also-ran team whose players' names
are known outside of Boston only by certifiable basketball junkies.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Rick says that's about to change. In the third year of
his regime, we will see some real progress. This will be the
playoff year.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they say these days, let us do the math. Last year eight
Eastern Conference teams made the playoffs. In order for Professor
Rick's team to make the playoffs in the spring of 2000, one of
those eight must drop out.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be Indiana. It won't be Miami. It won't be Atlanta. It
won't be Philadelphia. It won't be New York. It is not likely to be
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it might be Detroit. The Pistons don't exactly
stir the soul. And we surely know that the unrecognizable Orlando
Magic will be playing their final game April 19.
</P>
<P>
   So we have one definite and one possible vacancy for Professor
Rick's team to occupy. But that's not the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte missed the playoffs by one game last year, and most
people believe the Hornets will be one of the most improved teams
in the league. Anthony Mason is back, he is very much his old
ornery self, and in Paul Silas he will be playing for a no-nonsense
coach who should be able to cope with Mase's con games. Give them a
definite slot.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto was in the hunt for a long while, and there is no reason
why the Raptors won't be better. Washington has a new coach (Gar
Heard) and a new center (Ike Austin, in great shape), and if Mr.
Heard can deal with the recurring Rod Strickland attitude problem
(he was AWOL again during the past week), the Wizards might be all
right. The Nets were everyone's chichi pick last year before
injuries ruined their season and cost John Calipari his job. If
they can manage not to get blitzed in November and December, they
could be very formidable in the second half. Finally, there is
Cleveland, which should respond much better to a new coach _ any
new coach _ than it did to the unyielding Mike Fratello. If
Zydrunas Ilgauskas can recover from his foot injury, the Cavaliers
will be heard from.
</P>
<P>
   The first preseason publication I picked up had the Celtics in
last place. It certainly isn't inconceivable, if they don't play
well.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how many people even realize that Professor Rick
promised the playoffs, anyway, because people have learned to write
down his pronouncements in pencil, not ink. What he says ordinarily
has meaning only in the very short run. It's not that he doesn't
mean what he says; it's just that he reserves the right to change
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to war with a team whose alleged leader has no true
respect in the league, whose point guard has been skating by on his
exquisite raw talent since he was 14 years old, and whose center
was, in fact, a backup a year ago at this time. Professor Rick is
once again trying to sell us Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   The Nos. 3 and 6 first-round draft picks of two years ago are
long gone. Last year's No. 1 pick never arrived, thanks to the
Vitaly Potapenko deal. Pitino did make a truly great pick in 1998
with Paul Pierce, who already has become the best player on the
team. We will give him that one.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, capriciousness has been his middle name. He has
proclaimed someone as his ``best point guard'' one day and buried
him the next. He actually said that Bruce Bowen was ``John Havlicek
without a jump shot.'' There is always the appearance of constant
activity, but so much of it turns out to be wheel-spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Going from 15 wins to 36 was the easy part. He took over a
nucleus that was better than its record, and with his X-and-O
capability and his personality, he pushed the Celtics to a much
better record. Great. But the next step is always exponentially
harder.
</P>
<P>
   This Celtics experience is something very new to Professor Rick.
For the first time in his coaching career, Year 2 was not
substantially better than Year 1. He is using the lockout as an
excuse, as if the Celtics were the only team adversely affected.
Fans don't want any more excuses. Professor Rick has had two years
to put his stamp on the team, and after two years the only apparent
constant in the Pitino regime is change for change's sake.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to promise the playoffs, because right now they
really aren't the point. People here are sophisticated enough to
understand that the Celtics could improve and still miss the
playoffs. What they want is to see a team play quality basketball.
They want to see Antoine Walker and Kenny Anderson play at a high,
spirited, and intelligent level, and if they do not see that they
will hold the coach accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be blunt. These two are the key to everything for the
Boston Celtics. Walker can do things few players his size have ever
done, and Anderson does have some basic point guard skills. The
problem is that neither has ever made the complete mental and
physical commitment to be the best individual player he can be, let
alone making the commitment to being the best team player he can
be.
</P>
<P>
   For his $7 million a year, Professor Rick was supposed be able
to bring out the best in people such as Walker and Anderson. That's
the trouble. He's got his money. The rest of us here in River City
are still waiting for our instruments.

KOVEN MEETS THE ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leading the elite fleet of single scullers at the Head of the
Charles Sunday is hometown rower Jamie Koven, the 24-year-old who
will be defending his title.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Koven will be chased by a group of
international rowers here by invitation to form a Championship
Singles division, a first for this event.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's top scullers will be hot on Koven's stern,
and the 6-foot-4-inch, 210-pounder welcomes the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' says Koven, a native of Green Village,
N.J., now working in Boston as a financial analyst. ``It would be
amazing if the US could have a high-caliber, elite-level race.''
</P>
<P>
   With such rowers as Luka Spik from Slovenia, Juri Jaanson from
Estonia, Andris Reinholds from Latvia, and Merlin Vervoorn from the
Netherlands, this year's Head of the Charles is taking a big step
in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lineup in Women's Championship Singles will compete
this weekend by invitation.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Koven's eighth Head of the Charles, a race he first
rowed as a freshman at Brown in 1991. He sees rowing headed in the
direction of professional events, especially outside the US where a
circuit of sprint regattas keeps most rowers at the sport
year-round, especially in this pre-Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is not as important as World Cup,'' said Koven, who
nevertheless enjoys the size and scope of the Boston event, which
has seen steady growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix at the Head of the Charles is great. Everyone has a
life outside of rowing, and I would not like to see that change.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Koven, the kind of elite competition on the sprint
race circuits is bound to make an impact on the Head of the
Charles. And it will make his race much tougher than in other
years.
</P>
<P>
   Koven won the US National team trials in singles, as he did last
year. After finishing fifth as part of the eight in the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta, he switched to the single scull and promptly
won the gold medal at the 1997 FISA World Championships. That year,
he also won a bronze at a World Cup event in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Koven became the first US rower in 31 years to win the singles
Worlds and was named US Rowing Male Athlete of the Year. In
September of the same year, he won the Athlete of the Month award
from the US Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Koven's winning ways began at Brown, where, with just two losses
in his four years, he led the university to its first national
collegiate title of any kind in the school's 229-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Koven finished eighth in the singles at the FISA
World Championships, eighth at a World Cup event in Lucerne,
Switzerland, and first in the Diamond Single Sculls at the Henley
Royal Regatta.
</P>
<P>
   Rowing, while slowly gaining visibility in this country, still
finds itself behind running.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more community rowing,'' said Koven, ``but more people
relate to running. But rowing has a harder time selling itself to
the mainstream media than running. You need to have water and a
boat. Those things make rowing seem harder to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   And for elite-level rowers to throw themselves into the sport
full-time, they need sponsors. Koven, who will spend time at the
Princeton Olympic Training Center, has a number of sponsors _
Princeton Financial Systems, Crowley Maritime Corporation, and
Knickerbocker Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the sport is accessible to one level for
some, but I'd like to see it for all,'' he said. ``Only the rich
can participate. There were some rowers who couldn't get here from
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Koven and most of the rowers recognize that this year's
Championship Singles division is only the first step in the
direction of elite competition at the Head of the Charles. As the
event grows, said event chairman Fred Schoch, the big names will
inevitably be drawn to the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in event sponsorship also reflect the changing times.
Longtime major sponsor BankBoston has ``run the course,'' said
Schoch, and as of last winter the Head of the Charles was looking
for a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared out of my wits in January,'' said Schoch. ``But
it came together. The event has gained recognition as a real
attraction in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and Polo Sport have signed on as major sponsors, as have
Xerox and Dunkin Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Top rowers such as Koven like both the growing elite class in
the event and the wide-open club aspect, which gives the Head of
the Charles _ and rowing generally _ its greatest recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Head of the Charles is slow to grasp the professional
aspect of it,'' said Koven. ``It's such a big event that it changes
slowly. But it is much more competitive now.''

LAKERS' HORRY HARRIED BY INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ One glance at the stats sheet, or a single
play this exhibition season, and it's clear something's wrong with
Robert Horry's game.
</P>
<P>
   A tough transition to the triangle offense? No, worse. Horry
said his troublesome knees feel worse than ever, and nothing seems
to help.
</P>
<P>
   Horry is just 4 of 15 from the field in 50 minutes of playing
time and has generally looked out of sorts the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the offense, I know where to go.... It's just that my
body is not allowing me to do the things I want to do,'' Horry said
before Friday's game against Phoenix. He then went out and played
barely a minute before heading to the locker room because of pain
in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Horry is day-to-day. By his own account, his status
sounds more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Horry has long suffered from tendinitis in his right knee and
has developed the same condition in his left. But the 29-year-old
veteran said the problem has grown worse, and he's not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew,'' he said. ``They (team trainers) just say my
legs are weak. I do everything to keep them strong, but it's not
helping. Both of them now. It used to be just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Without any lift in his legs, Horry's shots are falling short.
And the pain is the worst it has ever been, he said. The knees only
sometimes respond to daily treatment. ``Some days they do, and some
days they don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly bad news for the Lakers, who not only are
thin at power forward already, but need struggling veterans Horry
and Rick Fox to provide some punch and leadership in their second
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers probably will begin the season with 36-year-old A.C.
Green in the starting lineup, backed up by Horry and perhaps
35-year-old John Salley. Travis Knight is recovering from a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson tried to give Horry a jumpstart Thursday by
putting him in the starting lineup. Horry said he's better off
starting because his muscles are loose from pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Ty's time: Tyronn Lue, the Lakers' speediest player but also
their shortest at 6-feet even, scored his first five points of the
exhibition season Friday night. But the second-year guard hasn't
played more than seven or eight minutes in any game yet.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who prefers taller guards, said Lue still can find a
place in his game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he showed last night what he can do for the team _
just, boom, get out and start generating energy on the floor,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lue, who became a crowd favorite late last season, hopes to
overcome his size deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait like I did last year and when my chance
comes, I'll be ready,'' he said. ``I know what I can do, and I know
I can play in this league, so I'm going to stay confident in
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster movement: All of the Lakers' healthy players will see
action as they play three games in three days, starting today in
Bakersfield. Jackson then plans to reduce the roster before the
exhibition finale, Thursday in Anaheim against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers thin at power forward, Jackson also said there
is ``a possibility'' he will look to sign a free agent once other
teams make cuts and indicated he had a player in mind.

THIS TIME, MIRACLE IS MIAMI'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do miracles never cease?
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Doug Flutie engineered the Miracle in Miami
when he completed a 48-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Gerard
Phelan that put Chestnut Hill on the map, sent Boston College's
football team soaring into the Cotton Bowl, and made a Heisman
Trophy winner of the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the No. 23 Miami Hurricanes snapped a three-game
losing streak and eased the bitter memory of that stinging setback
by fashioning a miraculous comeback of their own. Trailing, 28-0,
Miami pinned the Eagles with their worst loss of the season by
rallying for 31 unanswered points in the final 17:11 to score a
31-28 triumph on Andy Crosland's 30-yard field goal with three
seconds left before an ashen-faced Alumni Stadium crowd of 44,058.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Charge of Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Bewitching at BC.
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will.
</P>
<P>
   Senior free safety Pedro Cirino knew what to call the debacle:
``Unexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles appeared destined for their sixth victory of the
season, a possible bowl berth, and perhaps even their first
appearance in the Top 25 after an impressive first-half showing
against a ranked opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, the Eagles were not prepared to go the distance
against the Hurricanes. John Matich missed a 33-yard field goal
attempt wide, Cedric Washington fumbled inside the BC 10, and BC's
backpedaling defense allowed Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly to
convert a fourth-and-17 play with a 22-yard pass to Reggie Wayne
that set up Crosland's winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who hobbled the final six plays on a severely sprained
left ankle, completed 20 of 36 passes for 218 yards and three
touchdowns to lead the Hurricanes to scores on five of their last
six possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is about coming to Boston that makes for
these kind of games,'' said Miami coach Butch Davis, who was
reduced to tears in his last visit to Chestnut Hill two years ago
when the Hurricanes snapped a four-game losing streak by pulling
out a 47-45 victory in double overtime. ``Last time, a double
overtime, and today some kind of miraculous effort by our kids in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, it was apparent the Hurricanes were going to need
some kind of miracle when the Eagles scored on three of their first
four possessions, including the first two, to surge to a 21-0 lead
at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I thought we gave a great effort today,'' said BC coach
Tom O'Brien, whose team (5-2 overall, 2-2 Big East) must pick up
the pieces before traveling to Syracuse next week. ``When you play
a Top 20 team like that, you can't fumble the ball away like we did
there in the second half. We can't miss a field goal. You have to
give them credit. They took advantage of those opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, who completed 18 of 35 passes
for 139 yards, gave BC a 7-0 lead when he found tight end Bryan
Arndt from 17 yards out. Then, after BC's defense shut down the
Hurricanes on their second possession, William Green capped a
14-play, 88-yard drive _ sustained by a Miami roughing-the-kicker
penalty on Matich's 44-yard field goal _ with a 2-yard burst that
made it 14-0 with 3:47 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Rowe made it 21-0 when he scored on an 8-yard run up the
middle that capped a five-play, 48-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got behind so much because of poor play, but they played
exceptionally well,'' Davis said. ``They played outstanding. Their
kids made plays. They blocked. They caught the ball. They were
giving us fits on defense. It took a while to try and regain our
composure and find the things we felt would give us a chance to get
back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Davis preached three things to his team: Make a
stand on defense. Don't try to win it all on one play. Create a
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hurricanes emerged from their locker room, they were
stunned to discover that the Eagles had not. Clearly, it was not
the same BC team that had smacked the Hurricanes in the mouth in
the first half. That was evident when Miami answered Washington's
3-yard TD with a 12-play, 79-yard drive capped by Kelly's 12-yard
TD pass to fullback Will McPartland.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eagles went three and out on their next possession, a
sense of dread seemed to grip the crowd. After Matich missed the
33-yard attempt with 11:29 to go, momentum quickly shifted to
Miami's side when a simple Kelly screen pass turned into a 32-yard
touchdown by James Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who led all rushers with a career-high 183 yards on
29 carries, then fumbled on the next play. One play later,
Jackson's 6-yard TD pulled Miami within 28-21. BC's offense
sputtered, and Miami scored on its third consecutive possession
when Kelly found tight end Daniel Franks with a tying 10-yard TD
with 3:51 to go.
</P>
<P>
   When Hasselbeck threw three consecutive incompletions, Miami
took over at its 47 with 3:16 to go. It was plenty of time for a
miracle.

DENVER BOOT WOULD BRAKE SPECULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The topic never goes away completely. When the
Patriots are winning, it is dormant, like a hibernating bear. But
once the losses start, it awakens.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the topic is still groggy, half-asleep. There's a yawn
here and a stretch there, but for the most part it's not rousing.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is Pete Carroll's future, of course.
</P>
<P>
   When the team was 4-0, there was little mention of the job
Carroll was doing, no need to discuss his employment status, a
topic that was revisited over and over last season by talk shows
and columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Things were exacerbated after the first-round playoff loss to
Jacksonville, when Bobby Grier said he would conduct an evaluation
of the entire operation, including Carroll. The coach survived the
evaluation, which included input from some veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Carroll began asserting himself. Though
there were people to answer to _ Grier, Andy Wasynczuk, and Bob and
Jonathan Kraft _ he took a strong stand on player personnel and the
workout program. He made changes in training camp, making it
tougher, with more days in full pads, more running, more studying.
The result was terrific: a 4-0 start, with fewer of the injuries
that killed the team a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what. A funny thing happened on the way to 16-0. The
Patriots have lost two straight games, by a total of 3 points _ one
on a missed field goal in the hostile environment of Arrowhead
Stadium in Kansas City, the other when the Dolphins were able to
drive 59 yards in the final 2:10 to score the go-ahead touchdown
while leaving only 23 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Was the topic about to awaken from its long offseason nap?
</P>
<P>
   We heard the front office was displeased after the Miami loss.
The talk show callers were again complaining about the coaching,
ripping the offense for being able to score only one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of the ``typical'' Carroll October/November swoon
resurfaced, though it was somewhat lost in the Red Sox fever that
overtook the area.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``crossroads'' was used a lot this past week. And with
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't beat the Broncos Sunday, they will be on a
road well-traveled in the Carroll era: the one that leads them
close to .500 when the leaves begin to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It's the vaunted midseason dip, which is usually followed by the
late-season surge, which is usually followed by the early exit from
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a win could take them to a road less
traveled, toward a consistent season like the one they had in 1996,
up a mountain and all the way to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is no different from the other 30 NFL coaches; they will
tell you that all of the games are important; they claim it's the
media or the fans who place certain importance on one game over
another. But Sunday's game in Foxborough _ whether Carroll accepts
it or not _ is one that could keep the whispers about his future
sleeping soundly.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are not the ``world champion'' Denver Broncos as we
once knew them, they're still a team to be concerned about. They
have straightened out their earlier problems, and they seem to be
clicking with Brian Griese plugged in for John Elway and Olindas
Gary plugged in for Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, you see, still have other players who led them to
Super Bowl victories the past two seasons. They still have a tough
defense. Those who thought the Broncos' season was over following a
Sports Illustrated dinner invitation in which a player or two said
they were done after an 0-4 start have decided they are alive after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sunday's game will be difficult. Not as difficult as
originally thought when the schedule came out, but not as easy as
when the Broncos were 0-4 and in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been unable to finish things off the last two
weeks. The practice week was devoted to this. Finishing off an
opponent can be a daunting task for a team that runs the ball at a
2.9-yards-per-carry clip and must rely on Drew Bledsoe not only for
its big plays but for third-down conversions and short-yardage
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches also will tell you they take the schedule one game at a
time. In this case it is wise to do so, but glancing slightly
ahead, the Patriots have a Halloween date in Arizona, where the
Cardinal offense is in shambles because Jake Plummer is out with a
fractured finger and the running game is one of the worst in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll knows the mental fragility of the NFL player. He knows
how quickly the tide can turn, one day riding the wave, the next
day fighting to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll must figure out what ails the offense against a tough
Denver defense; he must find a running game that is at least
respectable and can create balance. He must have Bledsoe hitting
his deep receivers. He must have Ben Coates as a centerpiece of the
offense. He must create a defense that will confuse even the poised
Griese, and he must create an environment in which Ty Law can make
plays as he did a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   He must create a scenario in which the sometimes sullen
Foxborough crowd will jump out of its skin and holler so loudly
that the Denver offense can't hear a thing.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m. we will know a little more about whether the topic
will rise again or whether it will rest in peace.

ROSE ELECTION A SURE BET TO CAUSE STIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Rose returns to baseball Sunday night _ assuming
he can make it in time from his card show in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball proudly presents its All-Century Team
before Game 2 of the World Series and it should be great fun
watching commissioner Bud Selig hold his nose when he introduces
Pete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if Pete was elected, he's welcome, and he is,'' Selig
said while standing on the field before Game 1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be officially unveiled at a media session in
downtown Atlanta at 2 p.m. Sunday, but according to Pastime
Productions, Rose is scheduled to be in the Grand Ballroom of
Bally's Park Place Hilton Casino Resort from noon to 3. His
signature will fetch $40-$75 depending on what he signs. If Rose
keeps the commitment, he should be able to make it to Turner Field
just in time for Sunday's on-field ceremony (7:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rose's card show appearance on this special day,
Selig said, ``I was told that. I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah. So much to say, so little space.
</P>
<P>
   The latest national poll shows that most Americans think Rose
should be in the Hall of Fame. Naturally. The cliches are easily
applied. It's trendy to paint the baseball establishment as cruel
to poor Pete. How can baseball keep him out of Cooperstown? He had
more hits than any other player. He paid his debt to society, but
baseball won't forgive him. The Hall walls are lined with crooks,
drunks, and racists.
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is not in the Hall of Fame because he knowingly and
repeatedly committed baseball's cardinal sin. He bet on major
league baseball games while he was managing a major league baseball
team. Anyone who thinks Rose was framed probably believes O.J. was
framed, too. You know, 200 people conspired to make it look like he
did it. The preponderance of evidence allows for no other
conclusion, and Rose willingly agreed 10 years ago to the ultimate
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, he has done nothing but trash baseball and
insult our intelligence by refusing to admit he did it. Meanwhile,
he shows up at every roadside memorabilia show, hawking his wares.
He is the Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rose's prospects for reinstatement, Selig said,
``It's the same. I'm comfortable with (former commissioner Bart
Giamatti's) decision. There's no new evidence. We're exactly where
we were.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rose gets his golden moment, and no doubt his presence will
distract mightily from Ted Williams, Hank Aaron, Stan Musial,
Warren Spahn, Sandy Koufax, and other living greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that will happen,'' countered Selig. ``I think
these players are so great, the ceremony will be as good as it was
in Boston (for the All-Star Game) and that was the best ever.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that Rose should not even be on the
All-Century Team, and not because of his gambling. We all know he
was a hit machine and a gritty competitor and a winner who worked
his butt off and played five positions. But he was also a leadoff
hitter who did not have a high on-base percentage. He was without
power. And he gets more outfield votes than Roberto Clemente (not
on the team). More than Musial?
</P>
<P>
   Please. Sorry to embarrass Pete, but put his numbers next to
Musial's. It's embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose vote isn't the worst, however. Fortunately the
All-Century Team allowed for five add-ons, and wrongs were
corrected with the additions of Honus Wagner, Musial, Spahn,
Christy Mathewson, and Lefty Grove. Perhaps modern fans cannot be
expected to know that Spahn, Mathewson, and Grove were a little
better than Nolan Ryan (who finished first in the voting), Roger
Clemens (fourth), and Greg Maddux (seventh).
</P>
<P>
   Rose finished ninth, making him the final outfielder to make the
team on the basis of fan voting. And his spot on the team is
certain to start a new series of stories about why he should be in
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get Rose in the Hall is to have the rules
changed for admission. Make it only about what you do on the field
_ like football and basketball. Baseball is imprisoned by a clause
in which voters are asked to consider the character, integrity, and
contribution to the game. Clearly it is hideous to have baseball
writers passing judgment on the character of ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the rules are left the way they are, Rose is out.
Gambling is a crime against baseball. It almost killed the game in
1919 and that's why the rules are so strong. Every day of their
careers, players walk by a clubhouse-wall notice outlining the
rules against wagering on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's like this, folks: when the ground ball goes between Bill
Buckner's legs, we must have faith that he is trying. There can be
no hint that the game is in the bag. Baseball can never become WWF.
</P>
<P>
   And please, no nitwit remarks about how Rose bet only on his own
team. It doesn't matter. If he bet on the Reds Monday and
Wednesday, then he was effectively betting against his team on
Tuesday. That's the day he's not trying to win quite as much. How
would you like your son to have been an overused relief pitcher on
the 1988 Reds, pitching at the expense of his own career in order
to help settle Pete's huge gambling debt?
</P>
<P>
   Rose is still settling the score. That's why he's scheduled to
be in a casino Sunday _ while Mssrs. Williams, Aaron, Spahn,
Musial, and Koufax are being honored by the game they served so
well.

FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH SAYS SEEING STARVING KIDS ON TV PROMPTED HIS
SENDING TROOPS TO SOMALIA  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION _ Former President Bush conceded Saturday that
he ordered U.S. troops into Somalia in 1992 after seeing
heart-rending pictures of starving waifs on television, but he said
American leaders must be ``very wary'' when tempted to employ
military might to ease human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that as he and his wife, Barbara, watched television
at the White House and saw ``those starving kids in quest of a
little pitiful cup of rice,'' he phoned Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please come over to the White House,'' Bush recalled telling
the military leaders. ``I _ we _ can't watch this anymore. You've
got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They settled on a contingent of 28,000 U.S. forces that helped
open supply lines into war-torn Somalia and especially into
Mogadishu, its capital. ``And we ended the starvation,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Such humanitarian operations have ``less to do with vital
national security interests'' and are ``being understandably
debated today,'' Bush told a conference on U.S. military
interventions at Texas A&AMP;M University. The session was sponsored by
the Washington-based Center for the Study of the Presidency and two
A&AMP;M units, the George Bush School of Government and Public Studies
and the Center for Presidential Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The former president described his first two uses of U.S. force
abroad _ in 1989 to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and in
1990-91 to drive the forces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from
Kuwait _ as straightforward defenses of U.S. security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In Somalia, Bush said, ``our mission was different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was use of force,'' he said, ``And it's one that I think a
president has to be very wary of, because of the precedent. We
cannot be the world's policeman. We cannot put force in place every
time a president or Congress sees a terrible tragedy of genocide,
of starvation, whatever it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This use of force in Somalia was the exception that proved the
rule that force should be used when our vital national interests
are at stake,'' Bush said. ``To be fair, I put saving American
lives in the vital category but not the humanitarian gesture. Maybe
it's kind of illogical, but that's at least the way I interpret
these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many places where national disasters strike and
tribal warfare comes out. They all want help, they all need help,
but we cannot always use force.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of the presidential campaign being conducted by
his son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the former president steered
clear of most of the political implications of interventions and
did not criticize any military involvements under his successor,
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush limited his comments on U.S. involvement in Somalia to the
period during his presidency. Less than a year after Bush was
defeated by Clinton, the U.S. force in Somalia had been reduced and
made part of a U.N. operation aimed more at nation-building than
humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, 1993, a firefight with a local militia faction
resulted in the deaths of 18 U.S. servicemen and the body of a dead
U.S. soldier was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.

ARENA LEAGUE GAINING RESPECT AROUND NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It is two weeks ago in St. Louis, and 65,872 fans are
screaming inside the Trans World Dome for quarterback Kurt Warner,
who is picking apart the San Francisco 49ers as if they're the San
Jose SaberCats.
</P>
<P>
   Warner throws for 177 yards and three touchdowns _ in the first
quarter alone. He finishes with 20 completions in just 23 attempts,
323 yards and five touchdowns in a laugher, making the Rams, once
the joke of the NFL, the only unbeaten team left.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, in Indianapolis, Miami Dolphins wide receiver
Oronde Gadsden makes four catches for 132 yards, including a
48-yard reception that set up his game-winning touchdown grab, one
he makes by outleaping a Colts defender in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   From Des Moines to Portland, from Orlando to Albany, from
Phoenix to Nashville, Arena Football League coaches, executives,
players and fans are cheering these rising NFL stars that they
still call their own. They are giving thanks to Warner and Gadsden
for bringing long-due credibility to a 13-year-old, eight-man game
that once was considered a circus ring, a joke, to the purest of
football purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Kurt is on an undefeated Rams team and doing great, it
just gives (the Arena league) a great boost,'' said former Rattlers
quarterback Sherdrick Bonner, whose ego received another boost this
week after the Cardinals signed him as their third quarterback.
``There was some talk last year after I got signed (by the Atlanta
Falcons as a practice player). But nobody made a huge splash,
except for maybe Oronde Gadsden. Now, you hear scouts saying,
`We've been looking in the wrong places.'
</P>
<P>
   ``These (Arena) guys have game experience on a pro level. You
can't take that away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gadsden went from hotel to lavish apartment living,
from being rookie of the year in the Arena league with the Portland
Forest Dragons to one of the NFL's top rookies by averaging 14.9
yards a catch and tying O.J. McDuffie for the Dolphins' lead with
seven touchdown receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, Warner was fielding questions such as ``how
many players are there on each side in an Arena game?'' Now some
are asking if he could be the NFL player of the year. He could if
he continues this pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is a lot of people ask me what it feels like
to be in the NFL playing, but it is all about playing football,''
Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   But, until now, the chasm in talent between the NFL and the
Arena league, skeptics said, was wide and deep. The Arena league
was supposed to be the black hole of pro football, a place where
NFL rejects wind up, never again reaching NFL peaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known,'' said Rattlers Coach Danny White, a former
Dallas Cowboys quarterback who quickly was convinced the Arena
league was worthy by the speed and quickness and toughness it took
to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who used a summer of seasoning in NFL Europe, playing
quarterback for the Amsterdam Admirals after three years with the
Iowa Barnstormers, only got the chance because of Trent Green's
untimely misfortune. Warner was elevated to starter in preseason
after Green suffered a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Vermeil said he thought his team could win with
Warner, but not because of Warner, who has thrown for 15 touchdowns
and 1,328 yards in leading the Rams to a 5-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Warner has been intercepted three times, has
completed 71.4 percent of his passes and has a 131.4 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil and others credit Warner's success to his Arena
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all attribute the qualities Warner has displayed _ the
ability to throw on the move, throw to a tight place and throw with
accuracy and a lot of flair _ to his having played in the AFL,''
former NFL head coach and CNN/SI.com columnist Ron Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   After ripping apart the 49ers, Chris Berman gave this
wise-cracking advice on ESPN's Prime Time: ``Everybody coming out
of college, play in Arena Football, then you'll be good.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent ``Sports Illustrated'' issue has Warner on the cover
with the question: Who is this guy? &QL; 
More visibility &QL; 
How visible has the 50-yard indoor war become around the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Trent Dilfer was spotted
recently inside the locker room wearing an Arena Bowl XIII cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Dilfer said. ``Kurt's been great. I think there's
a lot of people (in the Arena league) playing well and they've just
got to be discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Warner to remind people that years ago quarterback Paul
Justin went from the Rattlers, where, in 1993, he led them to the
Arena league semifinals with a broken wrist, to the Indianapolis
Colts, where, at times, he filled in as a starter, without Warner's
off-the-charts success.
</P>
<P>
   Now Justin is Warner's backup in St. Louis, and four Iowa
newspapers are sending reporters to cover Warner's games, making
the pride of Cedar Falls front-page news for three weeks at the
``Des Moines'' ``Register,'' the Iowa media following him around as
if he's a Heisman Trophy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the (Arena) league says, `We can't pay Kurt enough
money for what he's doing,' '' said Barnstormers media relations
director Dick McDonald, who receives about two calls a day from
national media requesting background on Warner's Barnstormers days.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals kick returner and receiver Mac Cody, who played a year
in the Arena league with the Orlando Predators, isn't awed by
Warner's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even the NFL, could ignore what they did in tight
confines, Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people in the NFL who take notice of you,''
said Cody, who was waived by the Rams in preseason, before the
Cardinals claimed him. ``If you go out and have a tremendous game,
that will open anyone's eyes, from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattlers receiver/linebacker Hunkie Cooper, who had a failed
attempt with the New Orleans Saints after an Arena league MVP
season in '93, said Warner and Gadsden just took their same game to
a bigger field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing the same thing in the NFL that they did in the
Arena league,'' Cooper said. ``Kurt is having a field day, and
Oronde is making plays.'' &QL; 
Partnership &QL; 
Warner's rise comes on the heels of the NFL forming a partnership
with the Arena League with a chance of eventually investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   It will never be a farm system for the NFL, but what Warner is
doing has to send a message to NFL personnel directors, said Jim
Foster, the Barnstormers' owner who invented Arena football on the
back of a manila envelope while watching an indoor soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of writers ask, `Do you think the NFL will be
swarming all over the Arena League next year?' '' Foster said. ``I
don't think it will get to that extent, but it sends a message,
that for no other reason it's a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have a steal with Warner, who is grateful to earn a '99
salary of $250,000, the league minimum for a second-year player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, they're selling tickets like crazy,'' Foster said.
``They're almost sold out for a year now. We've got two buses and a
charter plane to see the Nov. 14 game. There's a lot of residual
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams in the NFL have to say, `We need to scout these
guys more seriously.' They've got to be more focused on the Arena
League.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals General Manager Bob Ferguson has looked at the Arena
game closely since the early '90s when he was part of the Buffalo
Bills. When a defensive back went down, then-coach Marv Levy had
Ferguson get on the phone with Durwood Roquemore, then a star for
the Orlando Predators, and ask for his help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of picks (in the Arena league),'' Ferguson said.
``In fact, he had a couple with us. He played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as players such as Warner and Gadsden get their chances,
many others wait for theirs. Such as Rattlers offensive specialist
Calvin Schexnayder, who set three single-season Arena league
receiving records two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two or three guys in the (Arena) league that are
better than Oronde,'' Rattlers Vice President Gene Nudo said.
``Like anything in life, it's fate and timing, being in the right
place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, at 30, is still the Rattlers' heart and soul, and, while
watching Warner and Gadsden do well, it returns hope to a guy that
the NFL once deemed too small (5-foot-8) and too slow for the big
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to look at (the Arena league) now,'' Cooper
said. ``They'll see the talent. You have to look at what the person
does when he has the football, how he overcomes adverse situations.
That carries over. Everywhere I've been, I've been a winner, no
matter if I make it to the NFL or not. I probably missed the
opportunity because the age factor sets in and the way that's
treated. But I know I can play in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner sees the respect coming, comparing it to the '60s when
the American Football League merged with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same thing . . .,'' Bonner said. ``It got no
respect. It was treated like a Single-A league.''

Cornhuskers don't scare Texas 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Go beyond the wild-eyed atmosphere created by
the 84,082 crammed into Royal-Memorial Stadium. Also take it beyond
one heckuva of an entertaining afternoon of college football, and
what kind of impact the final score surprise had on the national
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Shove aside all the above, along with the Xs and 0s mumbo-jumbo,
and the huge plays and the critical mistakes. Leave it alone for
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, attempt to place yourself in Children of the Corn
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is killing these Nebraska people, who have a severe dislike
for all things Texas, including the University of. This ``Texas
thing'' eats at them like stalk rot. Two hundred acres barren of
corn would be easier to take than losing yet again to the Texas
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   But lose, of course, the Cornhuskers did Saturday on a
beautiful, wind-blown Hill Country afternoon. Since the advent of
the Big 12 Conference, the Longhorns are 3-for-3 against Nebraska,
and this time it ended the No. 3 'Huskers' perfect season and dream
of a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska nose tackle Steve Warren summed up the gut ache that's
involved. ``Just hearing that fight song again walking off the
field, it was a bad experience,'' he said. ``They just have our
number.''
</P>
<P>
   This number was 24-20, as Texas roared back after a seemingly
out-of-it first half. The Cornhuskers led 13-3 at intermission and
the 'Horns' offense had been so inept, gallant quarterback Major
Applewhite heard boos late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone ever wants to measure the size of Applewhite's
heart, you'd better bring a tailor's tape. The Major is up and the
Major is down, but he's never down and out. Applewhite rallied the
'Horns in the second half, dealing Nebraska the kind of loss that
coach Frank Solich called ``tough for our football team and our
football program.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this one eats right at the foundation of a storied
``program.'' And yes, Solich needed a win to appease the corn crowd
back home. At the final gun Saturday, some 7,000 loyal 'Husker fans
seated in the north end zone had the look of Titanic passengers
clinging to the rail as the last crammed lifeboat floated away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not easy,'' noted safety Clint Finely, one of many
Texans (Cuero) on the Nebraska roster. ``Three times since I've
been at Nebraska is hard to take. We don't lose to anybody three
straight times.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much, anyway. Florida State has four straight bowl game wins
over the 'Huskers. Oklahoma won three straight in the mid-'80s. But
the ``Texas thing'' stings more, simply because of history and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the Big
12. The 'Huskers had a personal playpen in the Big Eight,
particularly after the demise of Oklahoma as a power. And with the
Big 12 came stricter academics standards for jocks, which Nebraska
bitterly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   It was Texas and Texas A&AMP;M that had the political clout to lead
the way in the formation of the Big 12, and also in pushing through
those academic guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Huskers' revenge was supposed to come on the football
field. Except in three years, Nebraska is 1-4 against the Longhorns
and A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought we'd lose to Texas three times in a row,''
said quarterback Eric Crouch, who was unable to generate big plays
off the bread-and-butter option Saturday. ``But give Texas credit,
despite all our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska caused self-wreckage by losing three fumbles, two
inside the 'Horns' 10-yard line. ``We had control of the game,''
said 245-pound running back Dan Alexander. ``The only way we could
lose was to beat ourselves with mistakes, which we did. It's not
that we're jinxed against them. We just have bad luck when we play
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Mack Brown, the Texas coach, happened to think
otherwise. ``Those fumbles were caused by hard tackling. We feel we
created those turnovers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it happened. And what also happened was
that Nebraska led, 20-17, with just under eight minutes to play and
the heralded ``Black Shirt'' defense couldn't hold it.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Longhorns were moving south to north in that
game-winning 60-yard drive, against the wind. All of the 37
previous points had been scored with the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the whining. Texas won the game because Texas won the
game. The Major came out throwing and connecting all through the
second half, including the clutch drive in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's too short and too slow,'' Finely, the safety,
said of Applewhite, ``and all that may be true. But I'll tell you
what he also is: a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Children of the Corn, the losing doesn't happen often,
except to Texas. And that's the hardest part of all.

CRUDE DITKA LUCKY HE DIDN'T GET FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His close friends wonder if last Sunday was the beginning of
Saints Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka's latest meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   His punishment for making an obscene gesture, swearing at a fan
and grabbing his crotch in the home loss to Tennessee could have
been much worse than the $20,000 fine the Saints levied at Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   He could have lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ditka visited team owner  &UR; Tom Benson a day after the
incident and said he was ready to accept being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to honor that (contract) as long as they want me
here, but I told Tom the minute he wants to make a change, I
understand,'' Ditka said. ``Listen, you're nobody until you're
fired. But if you've been fired twice, you're really somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, I'll live through it. Tom knows my feelings.
I went in and apologized to him. I said, 'Listen, I'm the most
understanding guy in the world. Any change you make, I'll
understand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Benson never considered firing Ditka or asking for his
resignation. But Ditka's relationship with the Saints fans, who
used to adore him, could forever be changed by last Sunday's lack
of class.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka was upset that the Saints, who led, 10-0, couldn't score
in the final 12 seconds of the first half after having a first and
goal at the Tennessee 1.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked off the field at halftime, several fans screamed at
him. He swore at them and flipped them off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the game, with fans chanting, ``Ditka
sucks,'' he grabbed his crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong,'' Ditka said of his behavior. ``I was wrong. It
was done out of frustration. But that doesn't give me any right to
act that way.'' &QL; 
Kicking themselves
</P>
<P>
   Giants kicker  &UR; Brad Daluiso thinks there is a reason why he
suffered a season-ending knee injury on the final play of last
Monday night's victory over the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God was looking down and said, `Whoever that idiot is
who kicked to Deion, I'm going to blow his knee out,''' Daluiso
said. ``That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Daluiso shouldn't be so hard on himself. It wasn't his decision
to avoid a squib kick with one second on the clock and the Giants'
leading, 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``My original thought was to squib kick,'' said Giants Coach
 &UR; Jim
 &UR; Fassel, the former Cardinals offensive coordinator. ``But I knew
(special teams coach)  &UR; Larry MacDuff did a lot of research on that
situation and knew what they liked to do. He suggested we bloop a
kick, which would give us a chance to get down and cover it. He
said we had worked on covering that in practice, and I knew we had.
So we went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daluiso kicked it longer and higher than he should have and
right to the one player who could beat the Giants, the Cowboys'
 &UR; Deion
 &UR; Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys then ran their version of the Stanford band play,
lateraling the ball down the field for what appeared to be a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants, Fassel and MacDuff were saved when the officials
ruled that Sanders' pitch to  &UR; Kevin Mathis was a forward lateral,
which is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Had the play stood, Fassel would have been crucified in the New
York press; MacDuff, formerly University of Arizona's defensive
coordinator, likely would have been fired, and the Giants would
have committed the second biggest late-game blooper in league
history.
</P>
<P>
   They also committed the other one, not taking a knee in a 1978
game. Instead, they handed off and fumbled and the Eagles'  &UR; Herman
Edwards returned it for a game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel wasn't there that day. But he was on the Stanford
sideline in 1982. He was an offensive assistant when rival Cal beat
the Cardinal by racing through the Stanford band. &QL; 
Midnight riders
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs Coach  &UR; Gunther Cunningham returned to Baltimore last week
for the first time since the snowy, March night in 1984 when the
Colts sneaked out of Maryland for Indianapolis in moving vans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got called into  &UR; Jimmy Irsay's office,'' Cunningham said of
the son of the former Colts owner. ``He said, `You guys have got to
pack.' I looked out the window and there were the police dogs. I
felt like a thief getting away in the night. It was such an eerie
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was a Colts assistant at the time under Coach  &UR; Frank
Kush, the longtime Arizona State boss.
</P>
<P>
   He never came back to Baltimore until last Thursday night the
Chiefs played the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a tough deal for me,'' Cunningham said of
leaving Baltimore 15 years ago. ``Frank (Kush) always told me the
city's important in football. I love the working-class towns where
they support their football. I always said if the truck drivers
like what I'm doing, I'm OK. They're the real fans.'' &QL; 
History lesson &QL; 
It's not easy to put Dolphins quarterback  &UR; Dan Marino's 60,000
passing yards in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The 60,000 yards would translate into about 34.1 miles, 163
trips up and down the Washington monument, 600 football fields, 3.1
miles longer than the European Chunnel and seven-tenths of a mile
more than 21 trips across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. &QL; 
Another curse
</P>
<P>
   All New Englanders know about the ``Curse of the Bambino,'' the
81 years the Red Sox have gone without a World Series championship
as punishment for letting  &UR; Babe Ruth go to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots, who host Denver today, have a curse of their
own. They have gone 19 years without a victory over the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   New England has lost 11 consecutive times to Denver, the longest
streak in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   In their past four victories over the Patriots, the Broncos have
outscored them, 132-45, and outrushed them, 602 yards to 230. &QL; 
Quick kicks
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are 8-2 in their past 10 games, the two losses
coming against today's opponent, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Benched Vikings quarterback  &UR; Randall Cunningham, on the team's
offensive struggles: ``We've been saying it's urgent for a while.
It's a F-U-N-K funk.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers lose today in Minnesota, they will have suffered
three consecutive defeats for the first time in a non-strike year
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   By throwing only one touchdown pass last week, the Rams'  &UR; Kurt
Warner failed to break Packers quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre's record of
16 touchdown passes in the first five games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Diana Ditka, wife of the Saints coach, on her husband's 60th
birthday: ``I've never been to bed with a 60-year-old man. I'm
going to get him a Viagra cake.'' &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TOP FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. JacksonvilleBooooring but effective. 2. St. LouisClimb on board
the Super Bowl express. 3. MiamiAll those who think Damon Huard is
better than Dan Marino stand up. 4. TennesseeFinally has learned
how to run the ball. 5. San DiegoDefense. Defense. Defense. &UR; THE
BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
31. ClevelandContinues to lead in the Peter Warrick sweepstakes.
30. CincinnatiAkili Smith has saved Bruce Coslet's job for now. 29.
New OrleansHow many think Mike Ditka will be coaching the Saints
next year? 28. AtlantaNothing has gone right for the defending NFC
champions. 27. New York JetsTuna boat floundering and Rick Mirer is
back at the helm. ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; St. Louis Rams: Finally, the Rams have made believers out of
us, but not because of former Iowa Barnstormers quarterback Kurt
Warner. He's not the biggest reason for the Rams' shocking
offensive numbers. It's the offensive line. Led by former
first-round pick Orlando Pace, the line makes sure Warner never is
touched. Isaac Bruce is one of the best receivers in the league.
The defense is opportunistic. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New England Patriots: The bend-and-break defense doesn't work.
But that's exactly what the Patriots did in the last few minutes at
home against the Dolphins last week. They also can't run the ball.
They had an eight-point lead with two minutes left and couldn't get
a first down. This is one of the NFL's most talented teams but
always seems to underachieve. They take a two-game losing streak
into today's game against Denver, a team the Patriots never seem to
beat. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified Jets defensive player, on Coach Bill Parcells'
play-calling in last week's 16-13 loss to the Colts: ``There are
some things you just don't do. But, remember, we're dealing with a
genius.'' &QL; 
ODD-SHAPED BALL &QL; 
Former Arizona State linebacker Derek Smith could afford his own
apartment after being drafted by the Redskins in 1997. But instead
he chose to live in the Cooper family's basement in Herndon, Va.
</P>
<P>
   When the Redskins were on the road, the Coopers would pet-sit
Smith's pit bull. When the Redskins were at home, Smith would
compete in bow-and-arrow shooting contests and Parchessi games with
the Cooper's son, Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Smith no longer lives there. He got married last February. And
Chad Cooper now is a a blue-chip football recruit who is headed to
Virginia Tech. But Smith still keeps in touch with the family,
including coming over to the house to participate in the
rubber-band shooting ``wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were so vicious, I did not dare to go into the
basement,'' Chad Cooper's mother, Connie said. &QL; 
SHORT SHOTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Packers quarterback Brett Favre was so bad in last week's 31-10
loss at Denver, he had a dismal passing rating of 9.6, the lowest
of his career. He completed only 7 of 23 passes and was intercepted
three times.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three games, Vikings second-year receiver Randy Moss
has 22 catches for 367 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback R.W. McQuarters of the 49ers, on the release of
starting cornerback Mark McMillian, who was beaten for two
touchdown passes in last week's loss to Carolina: ``I was shocked.
I checked to make sure my stuff was still here. It sends a message
around the league, they (teams) expect you to perform. If they
don't feel you're playing (well), they'll get rid of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob McNair, owner of the new Houston expansion team, wants to
call the team the ``Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have scored only four times in their past 28
possessions. During that stretch, they have missed four field
goals, thrown three interceptions and lost two fumbles. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE HOLDS ON FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. _ Amid the confusion, the head-shaking and the
passionate pleading with the defense for just one more stop, there
was Jaumal Bradley. He was the only guy in a Cal State Northridge
football uniform who was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this,'' said Bradley, the only CSUN player expressing
that opinion. After all, this was a depressing,
``how-could-this-happen-again?'' kind of ending.
</P>
<P>
   But Carson Souter's 48-yard field-goal attempt was two feet wide
to the right, Montana State had not completed an amazing comeback
and suddenly all Bradley's teammates were feeling as good as he
was.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN had a 24-21 victory over Montana State on Saturday, ending
a three-year losing streak to the Bobcats in front of a homecoming
crowd of 10,007.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN improved to 4-3, 3-2 in the Big Sky Conference. The
Matadors won their first road game of the season, but only after
holding off the Bobcats (3-4, 1-3), who trailed 24-0 late in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any doubts about us winning,'' said Bradley,
even after MSU recovered an onside kick with 31 seconds left,
eventually setting up Souter's attempt with six seconds remaining.
``It made the game exciting. Always as a little kid, you think
about the game-winning field goal. I kind of knew he was going to
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley !ital!hoped!off! Souter would miss, because a loss would
have demoralized CSUN's defense, which swarmed the Bobcats for
three quarters only to see the Matadors' offense go into a funk and
not score a point in the final 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystique that Montana State has against us,'' said CSUN
interim head coach Jeff Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   If last week's domination of Sacramento State was the defense's
comeback game of the season, Saturday would be the knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors forced out, in order, Montana State's top kickoff
returner (Arie Grey), their top tailback (Lathian Tyler) and top
receiver (Chip Hobbs). All in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Grey left with a leg injury in the first quarter after a strong
hit by reserve running back Alan Taylor on his only kickoff return;
Tyler had a hip pointer and had 21 yards on seven carries; and
Hobbs had more concussions (one) than receptions (zero).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came and were physical,'' Kearin said. ``We're
tackling better, and we're coming up and hitting people with a
little more `oomph.' There was a lot of (MSU) offensive production
sitting on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, CSUN did everything. The Matadors had a season-high
seven sacks and broke up four passes. Montana State only ran 10
plays and gained 50 yards in the first quarter as CSUN took a 10-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Senior cornerback Chazz Moore, who didn't allow a reception on
his side of the field, helped force the Bobcats' rotating
quarterbacks _ Kasey Harte and Dusty Broderick _ into a combined
18-for-48 performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as executing my assignment,'' Moore said, ``I feel like
this is one of my better games _ thus far. I still have a lot of
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors gave up 388 yards _ almost 100 below their season
average, which ranked last in the Big Sky entering the game. And
Shawnbay Jones, a senior defensive lineman who made a team-leading
12 tackles, sensed the confidence level is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we come out, we try to make a statement,'' Jones
said. ``We know in our hearts we are better than the stats show.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana State had the same fourth-quarter magic as last year,
when the Bobcats rallied for 16 points and beat CSUN 32-26, though
it wasn't the Matadors' defense that collapsed. At least two
factors (18 penalties and offensive complacency) contributed to
MSU's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't throw the ball as deep as we usually do,''
said Bradley, who had a season-low 53 yards rushing. ``It's
something new for us, to have a lead. We just need to learn how to
put a team away.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady, who was 30 of 47 for 340 yards
and two interceptions, said this was a rare case where the Matadors
got too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to hold the lead instead of expanding it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin agreed and took the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really playing as hard the second half as we were
the first half,'' he said. ``We throttled down a little bit. That
may be why we got slowed up on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, none of the Matadors cared they had almost let a
sure-win slip away. They won on the road against a quality
opponent, something none of the contenders for the Big Sky title
can claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get a road win,'' said wide receiver Drew Amerson,
who had nine catches for 156 yards and a touchdown.

ARENA LEAGUE MORE THAN JUST A FEEDER FOR NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because quarterback Kurt Warner and wide receiver Oronde
Gadsden are making names for themselves in the NFL, don't think the
Arena Football League will become a feeder system.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the two games are as different as checkers and
chess, but, in essence, it's the same: They still have to tackle
and run and pass and catch and score.
</P>
<P>
   And the quality of players in the Arena game, although 70
percent of them had experience at an NFL camp, keeps improving.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Barnstormers owner Jim Foster, who invented the eight-man,
50-yard Arena game, said he has heard talk that the NFL soon will
assign someone to oversee relations with the Arena league and with
the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   That could open more doors for guys considered on the bubble of
being NFL players, guys such as Rattlers offensive specialist
Calvin Schexnayder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're good enough to play for (Rattlers Coach) Danny
White, then most of them are good enough for us to take a look at
it,'' Cardinals General Manager Bob Ferguson said. ``Any game of
football is a training ground. We tell the players, `Go get
experience.' ''
</P>
<P>
   NFL Europe still is the NFL's main training ground. That's where
Warner went for seasoning after three years in the Arena league
with the Barnstormers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's even grown into a pretty competitive scenario,''
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherdrick Bonner, the former Rattlers quarterback who was signed
by the Cardinals last week, said that he had noticed the
competition grow in the smaller professional leagues just in his
seven years in the Arena league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of other guys just trying to get into the
Arena league and the CFL,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the NFL started a partnership with the Arena league
and purchased an option to buy an interest sometime down the road.
Some NFL owners have expressed interest in buying Arena teams. The
New Orleans Saints ownership already has purchased a team that is
expected to begin play next Arena season.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlers President Bryan Colangelo said the kind of interest the
Arena league is getting from the NFL ``speaks volumes'' for what it
has accomplished since the league's inception in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a farm league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just doing the Arena deal to build a farm
league,'' Foster said. ``They're really more interested in the
marketing aspect, reaching more fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Arena Football League may not be a bad league after all.
You can't look at it as a fluke.'' &QL;

BACTERIA _ What started five years ago as just a little drip in the
computer center of a major corporation has grown to a flood of
nationwide concern that fire-sprinkler systems are at risk of being
ruined by bacteria found in drinking water. The pinhole-size leak
discovered in May 1994 was one of many that began turning up in
overhead sprinkler pipes at the hub for worldwide computer
operations of AlliedSignal Inc. in Tempe, Ariz. The problems caused
by industrious bacteria hadn't been given much attention in
fire-safety systems until AlliedSignal pursued the issue _ and an
estimated $25 million in replacement costs _ in federal court
lawsuits blaming Phoenix and Tempe, its water providers. By JON
KAMMAN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEW-ECONOMY _ In an age when their parents were playing with
blocks, first-graders at a west Phoenix elementary school are
snapping shots of spheres and cubes with a digital camera and
printing them from the classroom computer. These are the faces of
the New Economy. It's a jittery, fast-paced world where the way we
do things is changing dramatically _ and constantly. To help
Arizona prosper in this daunting new landscape, the Morrison
Institute for Public Policy will release a New Economy guide for
Arizona. By DAWN GILBERTSON. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL;

MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Phoenix) In the morning she drove to Buckeye to
visit with one of the dying. Now it was afternoon and she was on
her way to visit another one of the dying. This was the life of
Eloise Delgado. It's what she did. She was never late. She never
missed an appointment, not until this particular Tuesday afternoon,
Oct. 19, when Eloise herself was one of the dying but did not know
it. By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Undated) _ They're the words no one in television wants
to hear: ``Rework the pilot.'' But they're the ones the producers
of Time of Your Life, the Jennifer Love Hewitt spinoff of Party of
Five, heard. The series premiere begs the question: If this is the
new, improved version, how bad must the original have been? By BILL
GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL;

KIDD MAY SIT TILL SEASON OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By AL TOBY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ja &UR; son Kidd and the Philadelphia 76ers'  &UR; Allen Iverson
might be put on hold until the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd sat out Saturday's practice because of a deep bruise on his
left thigh. Kidd suffered the injury in a collision with Los
Angeles Lakers forward  &UR; A.C. Green in Friday's preseason victory.
He is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns (3-2) will host their third preseason game at the
America West Arena tonight at 6 against the 76ers (2-2). If Kidd
has to sit out tonight's game, he will only have to wait until
November 4th's regular-season home opener to get another crack at
Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' injury list, however, isn't as bad as the 76ers'.
Philadelphia limps into tonight's preseason contest with a battered
frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Forward  &UR; Theo Ratliffe is sidelined for the next three weeks
with a fractured bone in his left ankle. Ratliffe suffered the
injury in a collision with New York Knicks guard  &UR; Charlie Ward in
the team's second preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow frontcourt men,  &UR; Matt Geiger, Tyrone Hill and  &UR; Stanley
Roberts, a recent acquisition, are also hampered by various
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened Sixers frontcourt should give the Suns a chance to
exercise their inside game on offense. Forward  &UR; Rodney Rogers was
impressive off the bench in the Suns' 112-100 preseason victory
against the Lakers. Rogers, a free-agent acquisition, scored 32
points and grabbed seven rebounds. &QL; 
Oh, behave &QL; 
Didn't the Bad Boys era end in the early 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously not, judging by the behavior of the Phoenix Suns
during the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   A day after  &UR; Penny Hardaway did his best imitation of  &UR; Mike
Tyson against Miami guard  &UR; Rex
 &UR; Walters, Suns forward  &UR; Tom Gugliotta was ejected after he was
called for his second technical foul of the game. Gugliotta tossed
a towel at referee  &UR; Tim Donaghy while Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge argued
with Donaghy at midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge and Gugliotta said they didn't expect a suspension as a
result of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Googs is certainly not going to be suspended,'' Ainge said.
``I don't know what he did to constitute a suspension. I'm not even
sure he deserved to be kicked out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In a much less recalcitrant mood, Gugliotta said he should have
shown more restraint during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have just kept my mouth shut,'' Gugliotta said. ``The
whole thing was stupid. You'e just got to live and learn.'' &QL; 
Kudos &QL; 
Ainge praised his team's overall defensive intensity in Friday's
victory against the Lakers. Although the Lakers shot over 50
percent and  &UR; Shaquille O'Neal had 37 points, the Lakers' second
leading scorer,  &UR; Ron Harper, had only 14 points.

EXPOS PROSPECT HAS REAL GAME, NAME TO MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually, when center fielder  &UR; Milton Bradley steps to the plate,
he doesn't hear people yelling his name. He hears them yelling word
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dies out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after he gets a hit. This Milton Bradley indeed has
game.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old switch-hitting Montreal Expos prospect who is
playing for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League was
named player of the week for Oct. 12-18, after hitting .526 with
two triples, a home run, six RBIs. He also scored seven runs and
stole three bases.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bradley was hitting .475 with two homers and 11 RBIs
and had a nine-game hitting streak through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is moving up the ranks, along with his high school
rival, Diamondbacks' prospect  &UR; Nick
 &UR; Bierbrodt, a left-hander, who isn't able to play in the Fall
League, because of an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   The two competed against each other in Long Beach, Calif.,
before signing out of high school in '96. Bierbrodt was the
Diamondbacks' first pick. The Expos took Bradley in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no race to see who gets (to the major leagues)
first,'' Bradley said. ``He's a pitcher and I'm a hitter, so he's
more likely to advance faster than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who hit .329 in Class A ball last season, will join the
Expos in spring training, but isn't sure where he'll be placed to
begin the season. &QL; 
Together again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So much for saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitching prospect  &UR; John Patterson keeps saying
hello to fellow pitcher  &UR; Brad
 &UR; Penny, who has been popping up in his life since Penny was traded
to the Florida Marlins as part of the  &UR; Matt Mantei deal July 9.
</P>
<P>
   They came into the Diamondbacks' organization out of high school
together in 1996. They were teammates last year at Class A High
Desert and the beginning of this season at Double-A El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the trade, they teamed up at the Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're together in the Fall League, teaming up with the
Scottsdale Scorpions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like he never left,'' Patterson said. &QL; 
Around the league &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Desert Dogs'  &UR; Rob Bell (Cincinnati Reds) was named
pitcher of the week for throwing five innings of no-hit ball,
facing the minimum of 15 batters in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Maryvale's  &UR; Dustin Carr (Tampa Bay Devil Rays) had a nine-game
hitting streak. He is second in the league in hitting at .471,
trailing Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa Solar Sox had a 12-3 record, the best start in the Fall
League since the Grand Canyon Rafters started 14-2 in '97. The
Rafters, by the way, had the worst record through Wednesday at
4-11.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two starts, Scottsdale's  &UR; Grant Roberts (New York
Mets) did not yield an earned run in seven innings. Meanwhile,
Maryvale reliever  &UR; Jamie Brewington (Cleveland Indians) has not
allowed a run in 8 innings. &QL; 
D-Back prospects &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How the Diamondbacks six prospect fared through Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Jack Cust was hitting .304 with two homers and 10
RBIs, 11 runs scored and had a .492 on-base percentage (third best
in the league).
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Jeff Andrews was 0-2 with a 16.62 ERA in three games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eric Knott was 2-1 with a 4.32 ERA in 8 innings with four
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ben Norris was 0-0 with a 6.55 ERA in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was 0-2 with a 5.00 ERA in nine innings. He walked six
and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Jeremy Ward was 0-0 with two saves and a 2.35 ERA in 7
innings. &QL;

PENN STATE BEATS PURDUE, 31-25  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN U. BACON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. _ Purdue was 12 yards away from ruining
Penn State's undefeated season and, perhaps, its chance of winning
the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Brees, who riddled the Nittany Lions for 379 yards and 2
touchdowns, had marched Purdue down the field with less than a
minute left after Penn State had missed a 47-yard field goal that
would have given it a 9-point lead with just over a minute
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 68,355 was on its feet, begging Brees to work his
magic, as he had all season.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Penn State defense that met the challenge. Four
times it repelled the Boilermakers _ one tipped pass, three
incompletions _ as the Nittany Lions held on for a 31-25 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For Joe Paterno, Saturday's victory was the 315th of his career,
moving him past Amos Alonzo Stagg into third place among
major-college coaches and within eight of Bear Bryant's record
total. It was the 10th consecutive victory for Penn State, the
second-longest winning streak among major colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The result also continued the Nittany Lions' mastery over
Purdue. Since Penn State (No. 2 in the Associated Press poll and
No. 5 in the New York Times computer ranking) joined the Big Ten in
1993, it has won all four of its games against the Boilermakers
(No. 16 AP and No. 20 in The Times).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the toughest game we've had on both sides of the
football,'' Paterno said after the game. ``They know what they're
doing and Brees is clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Brees, Purdue's Heisman Trophy candidate, is on target to become
the first quarterback in school history to complete over 60 percent
of his passes. He demonstrated the poise of his predecessors _ who
include Len Dawson, Bob Griese, Mike Phipps and Jim Everett _ in
completing 31 of 48 passes.
</P>
<P>
   But Brees was finally stopped by Penn State's defense, which is
led by linebacker LaVar Arrington, the favorite to win the Butkus
award. Arrington singlehandedly converted a sack of Brees into Penn
State's first touchdown and smothered Purdue's second field-goal
attempt. The block, Arrington's second of the season, sent the
teams into halftime tied at 14-14.
</P>
<P>
   While Penn State tailback Eric McCoo could manage just 10 yards
on nine carries in the first half, and the Nittany Lions'
two-quarterback offense struggled to get only six first downs,
Purdue rolled to 17 first downs on Brees' 223 yards passing to
eight different receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the most explosive offense we've faced this
season,'' Arrington said. ``It's not just Drew Brees. He's
outstanding, but it's also their offensive line, and they've got
some really good receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Boilermakers' third possession, Brees completed passes of
13, 28 and 30 yards to set up Sedrick Brown's 2-yard touchdown run.
It was the only time a team has scored in the first quarter against
Penn State's defense all season. But Arrington stole Purdue's
momentum on its next series, when he caught Brees cocking his arm
to throw the ball, forcing a fumble at Purdue's 2-yard line.
Arrington picked up the ball and walked into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come at you from different directions and come at you
with speed,'' Purdue Coach Joe Tiller said. ``It makes for a lot of
sleepless nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue came back with another impressive drive, culminating in a
9-yard pass from Brees to Donald Winston in the back of the end
zone with 10 minutes 42 seconds left in the half, giving the
Boilermakers a 14-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn State defense jump-started the Nittany Lions again when
Mac Morrison recovered Antoine Neal's fumbled punt return at the
Purdue 43-yard line. Two plays later, Penn State quarterback Kevin
Thompson completed his team's first long gain of the day when he
threw a 39-yard pass down the sideline to Eddie Drummond to tie the
game at 14-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions broke the tie on the second half's first play from
scrimmage. From Penn State's 22-yard line, Thompson stepped back
and threw the ball toward the sideline at midfield, where Chafie
Fields cut underneath the Purdue coverage, grabbed the ball and
galloped about 50 yards unchallenged. The uncharacteristically bold
play put Penn State ahead by 21-14.

TIME COULD BE RUNNING OUT FOR DESIGNATED HITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two recently concluded league championship series, each
great in its own way, also punctuated the vast difference between
the American and National leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The times of the games in the AL were so much longer than those
in the NL that it undoubtedly will raise the issue of the
designated hitter once again. Commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig plans to use
the lengthy game times in the AL to further fuel his desire to
eliminate the DH once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Although a pair of the NL games lasted longer than four hours,
each one of those went into extra innings, including the instant
classic of Game 5, which lasted 15 innings and nearly six hours.
Two of the ALCS games dragged past the midnight hour, an incredible
feat considering neither went into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   One way baseball thinks it can speed up games is the complete
elimination of the DH, an idea that has gained momentum in recent
months and years. To get the players union to agree to such a move,
one possible plan baseball has is to add a 26th player to each
roster.
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of news that will probably not sit well with
players such as Seattle's  &UR; Edgar
 &UR; Martinez, Tampa Bay's  &UR; Jose Canseco or Cleveland's  &UR; Harold Baines,
all of whom have made a career out of being a full-time designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The union does not want to lose 14 designated-hitter spots, most
of which are highly paid. But how could the union possibly put up a
fight if baseball offered to add 30 spots while taking away just
14?
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate Selig on this matter. This is the same
person who initially heard he would never get interleague play or
the wild card through the proper channels. Both are now staples of
the major league landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wants to start saving time on games again. Eliminating
the designated hitter is one sure way to set that plan in motion. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
The 2000 schedules have been released and, once again, interleague
play will remain the way it's been, with each division playing its
sister division only. Which club has the best interleague record
since it was introduced in 1997? &QL; 
Expansion envy? &QL; 
While the Diamondbacks wound up running away with the National
League West championship, the other expansion club, the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, finished in last place in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took different paths, and for the path we have chosen, I
don't think this organization has to take a back seat to anyone and
won't,'' Devil Rays General Manager  &UR; Chuck LaMar said. ``I think
our development plan is in place, and when it is all said and done,
we will reach the levels that the Arizona Diamondbacks have reached
and, hopefully, surpass those levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like Arizona simply spent more money than Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did take different paths, and ours is the one that will
take time before the complete book is written,'' LaMar said. &QL; 
The Vaughn sweepstakes &QL; 
It's beginning to appear likely that the Cincinnati Reds will vie
not to participate in the upcoming negotiations for free-agent
outfielder  &UR; Greg Vaughn, who hit 45 home runs and had 118 RBIs for
the Reds last season.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn wants a four-year deal for at least $10 million per
season. At age 34, Vaughn may have trouble finding a suitor for his
talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think a 50- to 65-million-dollar deal for a
34-year-old player fits us economically or baseballwise,''
Cincinnati General Manager  &UR; Jim Bowden said. ``We probably won't be
a player in the Vaughn negotiations.'' &QL; 
Philly Phollies &QL; 
The Philadelphia Phillies may have bungled their chance of getting
a new stadium at their desired site in the Center City area of
Philadelphia. The next option, which is appearing more likely, is
to remain in south Philadelphia, right across the street from
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the Phillies delay, the more construction costs will
soar.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling reason for the front office needing a new
stadium built as quickly as possible, however, is that they could
sentence themselves to being unable to compete if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Though the added revenue would sure help the Phillies, a larger
issue is looming. Within a few years, the Phillies could be left
playing at the only NL stadium with artificial turf, which is a
difficult sell to any prospective free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman  &UR; Scott Rolen, arguably the Phillies best
all-around player, has already complained about the fake grass
taking a toll on his still-young body. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Surprisingly, it's the Florida Marlins, who have compiled a 31-18
record since interleague play became a part of the major league
landscape. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Wonder what this says about Mark McGwire?: Legendary St. Louis
shortstop  &UR; Ozzie Smith had this to say about  &UR; Brian Jordan, whom
the Cardinals lost to free agency last winter: ``He was the best
clutch hitter in the organization.'' As for the Cardinals, Smith
added, ``There are a lot more questions than answers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Forget the animals, it's the other hunters who should beware:
Fired Cleveland Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove offered this gem when asked
if he planned to do any hunting this winter: ``Now would not be a
good time to put a gun in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Ken Reitz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does it really matter?: There's a lot of talk about the winner
of this World Series earning the label as the team of the 1990s.
That's all fine, but one argument against such talk should be
centered on this question: Who was the team of the 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Another $6 million and they could have matched Kevin Brown's
contract: The Los Angeles tax assessor recently valued Dodger
Stadium at $99.92 million. The breakdown showed the actual stadium
valued at $41 million and the land surrounding the park at $52
million. Another $6 million value was placed on equipment inside
the stadium. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Philadelphia center fielder  &UR; Doug Glanville joined  &UR; Lou Gehrig,
 &UR; Eddie Collins,  &UR; Fresco &UR; Thompson and  &UR; Red Rolfe as the only Ivy
Leaguers to reach 200 hits this century. Glanville graduated from
Penn. Gehrig accomplished the feat eight times.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves have played 91 postseason games during the
1990s, easily the most of any club in the majors. Of those 91
games, Atlanta has played 18 extra-inning games, including three
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks and Florida Marlins have agreed to postpone the
deadline for Arizona to send a player to be named as part of the
 &UR; Matt Mantei deal from last July. It's not expected to be a
big-time prospect.
</P>
<P>
   One of many reasons Colorado was so enthralled with hiring
 &UR; Buddy Bell as manager was his willingness to move to Denver on a
year-round basis. Neither of the previous managers,  &UR; Don Baylor and
 &UR; Jim Leyland, made Denver his winter home. Leyland actually lived
in a conference room at Coors Field after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers requested and received permission from the
San Diego Padres to interview hitting coach  &UR; Merv Rettenmund, who
has enjoyed many successes with the Padres, Angels and Athletics.
The Padres will allow Rettenmund to leave, if that's his desire. If
he does, Detroit would probably hire former Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim
Riggleman.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals easily have the most experience in their
executive branch, at least when it comes to people who have held
general manager duties. Aside from GM
 &UR; Walt Jocketty, St. Louis has  &UR; Jerry Walker,  &UR; Bob Gebhard and  &UR; Bing
Devine. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
The Diamondbacks' annual end of spring-training games at Bank One
Ballpark will see a new face come to the Valley. The Boston Red
Sox, who open the season on the road against Seattle, will play a
pair of spring-training games at the BOB early next April.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, who appear set to trim their $45 million
payroll, are offering everyone but  &UR; Tony Gwynn and  &UR; Trevor Hoffman
to anyone who is interested. That means ace
 &UR; Andy Ashby, who will be paid $6 million in 2000, is available.
Expect several clubs to line up and try to pry Ashby away.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect St. Louis to exercise  &UR; Donovan Osborne's $5 million
option for next year. Osborne, who again was injured, will instead
receive a $500,000 buyout. The Cardinals, though, plan to try and
sign Osborne at a reduced rate, an idea that sits fairly well with
Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati badly wants pitcher  &UR; Pete Harnisch to undergo
arthroscopic surgery on his pitching shoulder. The right-hander,
though, is balking at the prospect of going under the knife.
Harnisch won 15 games and missed only two starts in the

down next season and wind up missing two months. &QL;

NEW CREASE RULE HAS GOALIES ON EDGE, FRUSTRATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably won't find too many goalies rejoicing over the
NHL's decision to revert back to the old in-the-crease rule, where
now, a toe or inadvertent skate blade in the paint won't take a
goal away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there's been more traffic in front of the net than
a policemen's convention at Dunkin' Donuts. Goalies are getting
folded, spindled and mutilated _ all within reason, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks mainly to  &UR; Brett Hull's controversial goal that ended the
Stanley Cup Finals last season, the league now allows skaters in
the crease so long as they don't interfere with the play. It's
called the ``no harm, no foul'' rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they don't call any penalties on them, the guys
will abuse it,'' laments New Jersey Devils goalie  &UR; Martin Brodeur.
``The big problem for me is because I play a lot outside my net,
and I get hooked and I get pushed off of more than I did in the
past. It gets frustrating when the referees don't call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Count former goalie  &UR; John Davidson as a big proponent of the
change. It's time goalies face the music, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see they have to be men again. Real men,'' the
ABC television analyst said. ``The game is about guys going to the
net and trying to score. Goalies have been sacred lambs or sacred
cows, however you want to call it, for too long. They've been given
a free ride. They can take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goalies are back to is swinging their sticks at ankles
and the backs of legs to get guys to move out of their line of
fire. Great. I miss those  &UR; Billy Smith explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the former goalie for the Islanders and Kings, was
infamous for blowing his fuse and retaliating when players took
extra liberties in his space. Expect to see a lot of goalies going
``Billy bonkers'' this season. &QL; 
Russian roulette &QL; 
The knock on many Russian-born players over the years has been that
they take too many nights off, that their hearts aren't always in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Although that's certainly not true with every Russian, a great
deal of them have carried the reputation and seldom done anything
to debunk it. Vancouver's  &UR; Alexander Mogilny suggested it's a
losing battle. Stereotypes don't die easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always going to be a Russian, and there's never going to
be anything positive about Russians,'' he said. ``That's fine. I
know there's not much you can do to change how people think. (But)
there's not many people who've accomplished what I've accomplished
in this game, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I care. People say I don't care. The question is
impossible to answer. I care very much about my game and my
performance. That's all that matters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravo. But now listen to Mogilny's former teammate,  &UR; Pavel Bure,
now with the Florida Panthers. He's sat out the past few games
nursing a sore groin and says it doesn't make much sense for him to
play hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play, I feel you have to give 100 percent,'' Bure said.
``If you can't give 100 percent, what's the use in playing? You're
hurting yourself. You're hurting your teammates. And you're fooling
nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bure was just being honest, but comments like those don't help
dissolve the myth surrounding Russian hockey players. In today's
NHL, you simply have to learn how to play through pain. And that
goes for everyone. &QL; 
Great respect &QL; 
If you get a chance, check out  &UR; Wayne Gretzky's new book,
``99'':``'' ``My Life in Pictures'' ($29.95, Dan Diamond &AMP;
Associates, Mint Publishers). The photos alone, many of them never
before seen, are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gretzky also takes the time to jot down a few memories about
each picture. There's a great shot of him with the Coyotes'  &UR; Rick
Tocchet, a former teammate in Los Angeles and in two Canada Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Tocchet is one of the most respected players in the game
today,'' Gretzky writes. ``Each year, you can count on him both to
score 30 to 35 goals and be as tough as anyone in the league. I've
always admired his work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky repeated those sentiments Friday night after visiting
Tocchet and the Coyotes in the visitor's locker room following
Phoenix's 6-3 win against the Kings at the Staples Center. The
Great One is a genuine fan of Tocchet's and is proud to call him a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, whose 2,777 penalty minutes rank seventh in league
history, will play in his 1,000th NHL game on Tuesday. &QL; 
Sticking together &QL; 
Nice job by the Colorado Avalanche to somehow not only stay afloat,
but to remain ultracompetitive in the tough Western Conference
despite losing so many players.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche lost three pretty big ones to the Rangers via free
agency _  &UR; Theo Fleury,
 &UR; Sylvain Lefebvre and  &UR; Valeri Kamensky. The club also has been
without its best player, center
 &UR; Peter Forsberg, who is out until December following shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that, and the fact that seven of the team's first
nine games were on the road, the Avalanche was 4-3-2 and 3-1-1 in
its past five games entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got good hockey from everyone,'' said Coach  &UR; Bob
Hartley. ``The veterans have done a great job, and the rookies are
showing very well again. Those young players have been a big help
to us. We had a good training camp, and we've worked very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the guys are in great shape, and that's allowed us to
get through the tough part of the schedule.'' &QL; 
Quit overreacting &QL; 
Last week's incident involving Pittsburgh's  &UR; Darius Kasparaitis and
Chicago's  &UR; J.P. Dumont didn't look as bad as all the attention it's
received. Kasparaitis saw Dumont charging at him with his head down
and simply raised his elbow to protect himself and get the
Blackhawks' rookie out of his way.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem malicious or over the line on his part, but
because Kasparaitis is who he is _ one of the hardest hitters in
the game _ the Blackhawks, specifically General Manager  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Murray, and the NHL took exception. Kasparaitis was suspended for
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look out for things on the ice if Mr. Kasparaitis wants
to play that when he comes to town,'' Murray said. ``I hope he will
be a man, drop the gloves and settle it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever makes them happy, Kasparaitis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to play that way, I'm happy to do that,'' he
said. ``Their whole team is going to be in the penalty box. That's
their style of play. I'm not scared. Philadelphia tried to kill me
two years ago and it didn't happen. Nothing's going to happen this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but mark your calendar for Dec. 26. That's the next
time the Penguins play at Chicago. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. DetroitCarve it in stone. You know it and I know it. The Red
Wings will be playing in the Conference Finals.  &QL; 
2. Dallas A recent run of injuries has got Coach Ken Hitchcock
shaking in his Buster Browns.  &QL; 
3. San Jose Just moving up the charts like a new pop music
sensation.  &QL; 
4. New Jersey So he hasn't scored for two years in the playoffs,
but Bobby Holik already had six goals in six games.  &QL; 
5. Toronto They say newcomer Dmitri Khristich isn't a team player.
Who cares? &UR; BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Chicago They had scored one goal more than the Coyotes (20)
through the same number of games (seven) and still were winless at
0-4-3.  &QL; 
27. Boston Coach Pat Burns is seething. So are Bruins fans, who are
clammoring for the B's to re-sign Byron Dafoe _ at any price.  &QL; 
26. Buffalo Dominik Hasek has already retired.  &QL; 
25. Calgary GM Al Coates says it's too early to panic.  &QL; 
24. Islanders Hey, you guys still interested in Robert Reichel? ON
THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Florida Panthers: Off to a flying start at 5-1-1 (before Frida vs.
Calgary) and enjoying a plush, easy early-season schedule. Six of
their first seven games were at home and they responded by going
4-0-1 in their own digs. Not too shabby, although the Southeast
Division is the weakest in the NHL. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Buffalo Sabres: Things are getting pretty interesting on this team.
Did Coach Lindy Ruff push the panic button by apparently deciding
to play muscial chairs with his goalies? Looks that way, though you
can't blame him for giving young prospect Martin Biron a chance. Or
can you? &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
 &UR; Carolina Hurricanes Coach Paul Maurice on the team's slumping power
play unit: ``I have a great agreement with the 'Canes' management.
I don't ask them about season tickets and they don't ask me about
the power play.'' &QL; 
LOOSE PUCKS &QL; 
It's easy to poke fun at the Rangers and their $60 million payroll.
Hey, I did it just last week. But Dean Lombardi, the general
manager of the San Jose Sharks, made an excellent point the other
day about his counterpart, Rangers' GM Neil Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``His boss came right out and said, `If you don't make the
playoffs, you're out of a job,' '' Lombardi said. ``It's a tough
environment to work in. What is the alternative there? If you're
Neil Smith, what do you do? You can't build in New York. They want
to build now.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting to see the Flyers sign veteran defenseman Ulf
Samuelsson to a two-year, $4.55 million contract. Samuelsson has
had some major wars over the years with Philadelphia captain Eric
Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still owe him a few things,'' Samuelsson said. ``He's a
broken shoulder ahead of me, a broken nose ahead of me. It's been
nothing personal. When I played against him, I always tried to nail
him. But I'm still a few hits behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of old defensemen, Chris Chelios appears to have
settled himself in with the Detroit Red Wings. He's planting roots
in the area, his kids are entrenched in a local youth hockey
program, and he now says quite flatly that the Red Wings ``are my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he still doesn't forget from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going through hotels asking where the Hawks' pregame
meal is and all kinds of little slip ups like that,'' Chelios said.
``I call up restaurants for people and say, `This is Chris Chelios
of the Blackhawks . . .' I'm still (messing) up.''
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill had Edmonton trading unsigned power forward Bill
Guerin to Colorado for either Chris Drury or Milan Hejduk.
Avalanche GM Pierre Lacroix, though, squelched the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade Hejduk or Drury for any reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers GM Glen Sather, meanwhile, beat up on Guerin in the
papers once again: ``He's looking for $3 million a year. Why
doesn't he just ask for $7 million or $8 million? What's the
difference? You're still being stupd. It's just a degree of how
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's an interesting comparison to Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman
notching his 1,100th career NHL victory last weekend. That's more
wins that 21 NHL franchises have ever won.
</P>
<P>
   At his current pace, Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr is on pace to
finish with 459 shots on goal, which would be the second-highest in
league history behind the 550 taken by Boston's Phil Esposito in
1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you can't score if you don't shoot. It should be no
surprise that when Jagr rifled 403 shots on goal in 1995-96, he
finished with 62 goals _ his career high to this day. &QL;

SCRIMMAGE SHOWS HOUSE HE HAS LOTS OF HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Arizona State's basketball team needs senior
guard Eddie House as much as House needs the freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Together, in their first scrimmage Saturday at Wells Fargo
Arena, House felt good in the knowledge that he won't have to do it
all for the Sun Devils to succeed this season.
</P>
<P>
   House, of course, poured in most of the points and hit two free
throws with four seconds left to give the Maroon a 59-58 victory
over the Gold in an officiated scrimmage that had four 10-minute
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Tanner Shell's reconstructed ankle held up well
in his first all-out game since having surgery shortly after
leading Mesa Mountain View to the 5A state basketball title last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Shell's intensity on defense and hustle around the basket helped
bring the Gold back from an early 15-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Tommy Smith, who gained 20 pounds of muscle
since last season, showed off his athleticism with two alley-oop
dunks that had many in the crowd whooping.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman point guard Kyle Dodd showed poise and intelligence and
a soft jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle is playing really good for a freshman,'' House said.
``He's showing a lot of composure. He showed floor leadership out
there. He's patient. He is getting it done. And he's not the only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen forwards Shawn Redhage and Donnell Knight showed
glimpses of promise. Knight finally got untracked in the final
quarter when he scored six straight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real good situation,'' House said. ``They want to win.
They want to fight hard for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donnell Knight came up to me and said, `We're going to do what
it takes to get you to the (NCAA) Tournament.' When he's a senior,
he's going to want the freshmen to do the same thing for him. I
appreciate that a lot. It's great that they're not looking to the
future. They're looking for right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Rob Evans sees similarities between this group of
freshmen and a 1995-96 freshman group he brought to prominence at
Mississippi during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these guys are a little bit ahead,'' Evans said. ``I'm
really pleased with the young kids.''

MAN LIVES WITH CONSEQUENCES OF SELLING MCGWIRE'S 70TH HOME RUN
BALL 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY OSCAR AVILA  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Never, not once, did Philip Ozersky wish that he had
sat somewhere besides the left-field box in Busch Stadium that fall
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Not when the e-mailers called him a loser and other names too
nasty to print. Not when his privacy vanished in less than a day.
Not when he wondered whether he was wasting the chance of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back to the game, Ozersky knows that a slight change in
angle, or a wind blowing a few miles per hour stronger, would have
sent Mark McGwire's 70th home run soaring in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always go back through your life and wonder if you would
change anything,'' Ozersky said. ``If you change one thing, your
whole life would change.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd had some bad things happen to him, ``but I wouldn't
change them. They happen for a reason. I caught that ball for a
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   At work Ozersky tries to make sense of life's whims.
</P>
<P>
   In a complex near Forest Park, Ozersky, 27, and an army of
researchers at the Human Genome Project are mapping the 6 billion
pieces that make up human genes. Those multicolored lines on his
computer screen show a DNA sequence _ just one microscopic
difference can change a person entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky's life changed Sept. 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball came shooting toward his section, Ozersky's heart
leaped. But his head stayed clear. Other eyes darted, but they were
slow. A beat slow.
</P>
<P>
   The ball banged off a back wall. But Ozersky, working the
angles, didn't care where the ball was. He guessed where the ball
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Then he threw his 180-pound frame under the metal bleachers
toward a prize that was his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from the pile with a piece of baseball history that
promised to make him rich, a millionaire. Famous. The American
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   The police knew this, too, so they whisked Ozersky and his
girlfriend (whom he had met in the same box a year earlier) into
the bowels of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky ran into a tunnel, under the seats, the crowd's cheers
still audible. He held the ball up as if it were the Olympic torch.
</P>
<P>
   He ran and ran.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea where he was going.
</P>
<P>
   It's a crisp autumn day about a year later. The leaves are
falling, and baseball is close to crowning a champion. Ozersky has
just returned from lunch at the St. Louis Bread Co. in the Central
West End.
</P>
<P>
   The work load was light today, although the task remains
daunting. Researchers need to map 1 billion bases in DNA. After six
years they recently celebrated the completion of their 100
millionth sequence.
</P>
<P>
   As Ozersky lingered in the lobby, researchers in white lab coats
streamed in and out. He chatted with an acquaintance about the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at the information desk can't help interrupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you the guy who caught McGwire's ball?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me,'' Ozersky replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he worked in this building,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky gets this a lot. He's a minicelebrity in St. Louis. Fans
greet him at Cardinals games; strangers quiz him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what'd you do with it?'' the clerk asks curiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold it.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk nods and smiles in approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that's right,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that, at first, Ozersky didn't know what was right.
After sprinting through the tunnel for post-game interviews, the
lifelong Cardinals fan was prepared to hand the prize back to
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The groundskeeper who caught No. 62, the ball that broke Roger
Maris' single-season record, handed McGwire the ball back before a
national television audience. He became a hero.
</P>
<P>
   The fan who caught No. 63 became a public enemy after he decided
to sell his souvenir. Other home-run catchers joined him on the
hate list.
</P>
<P>
   After considering it for a few weeks, Ozersky decided to sell
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to compare me with the guy who caught No. 62,''
Ozersky said. ``I think both of our decisions were good decisions
for us. Of course, not everyone agreed with my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Few caught the fans' wrath like Ozersky. Memorabilia experts
predicted that the ball could fetch as much as $10 million. He
quickly became the poster boy for greed in St. Louis.

MAN LIVES WITH CONSEQUENCES OF SELLING MCGQIRE'S 70TH HOME RUN
BALL 
</HEADLINE>
 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ ``On the radio dial, at any point of the day, people
were talking about Phil as though he was the devil incarnate,''
said Daniel Paisner, whose book The Ball features Ozersky. ``He was
just doing something that any one of us would have done in the same
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The shots bothered Ozersky, but he couldn't bypass the chance to
provide for his family and for his own retirement. And he saw the
ball not as a jackpot but as a chance to do some good.
</P>
<P>
   One America Online e-mail message spoke for many in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously represent the worst elements of professional
sports today: individualism, self-gain, self-centeredness, etc.,
etc.,'' the e-mail message read in part.
</P>
<P>
   ``GET A LIFE. If you really believe that you'll have more
friends now that you've got some more money to party with, then you
obviously are too lame to gain friends on your personal attributes
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was signed, ``A baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   What that fan, and others, didn't realize is that Ozersky had a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky wrote a letter to McGwire in December. ``As not only a
Cardinals fan but also an avid baseball fan, it was a very
difficult decision for me not to return the ball,'' he wrote.
``However, I could not overlook the effect the sale of this
baseball may have on the lives of me and my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation on what the ball might sell for is
astonishing, and I turn to you as a role model of how to handle
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ozersky's ideal scenario, someone would buy the ball from
him, use it for a series of profitable promotions and eventually
return it to McGwire. Ozersky would be rich and have money to
contribute to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Under one plan, the maker of a line of plush toys similar to
Beanie Babies proposed a line of McGwire bears. Each bear would
have a serial number. The company would hold a contest in which the
winner would present the baseball to McGwire at this year's
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky wasn't sure the idea would work.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential buyers proposed unusual ideas. One wanted to take
the ball apart, add 1 inch of its thread to new balls and re-sell
them.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance, Ozersky said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ozersky decided to auction the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk at Ozersky's office cuts to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' she whispers. ``How much did you get?''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky pauses and enunciates his jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-point-seven million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk's eyes widen as if she's seen a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably bought yourself a new car,'' she says. ``I would
have bought me a new car. A Lexus, or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' Ozersky says as he walks away.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a millionaire supposed to look like?
</P>
<P>
   Does he drive a Lexus? Does he wear Armani?
</P>
<P>
   Does he look like Donald Trump, who on a New York promotional
visit told Ozersky: ``You're a pretty good businessman, from what I
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phil Ozersky's case, a millionaire comes to work in a 1994
Ford Probe, in need of a shave, wearing a Cal baseball cap and
flannel shirt.
</P>
<P>
   He still rents a house in the suburb of Olivette with his
girlfriend and a childhood friend. He still goes to ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky's one major purchase was a house in Florida for his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to be conscious of staying who you are,''
Ozersky said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have met Ozersky only after he became famous. But
here's a glimpse into his personality just hours before his big
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In batting practice he snagged a ball hit by Cardinal Ron Gant.
It's a baseball fan's dream. After countless games, he had a ball
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He turned and gave it to a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now I can't believe I did that,'' Ozersky said. ``I just
felt bad because it was sitting right by her feet.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. A bigger prize awaited.
</P>
<P>
   After paying about $1.2 million in taxes, Ozersky has given
about $250,000 to charity, including money for Cardinals Care, the
American Cancer Society and the Leukemia Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to start a summer camp for abused children, McGwire's
main charity. When he was younger, Ozersky had worked as a camp
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he really emerges out of all this as a true hero, the
way he has lived his life, the choices he has made with his
money,'' Paisner said. ``He has been really inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky, however, is a reluctant hero. He changed his home
number long ago, but he still gets requests from charities. He has
given countless interviews: ESPN, morning zoos, the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   A wacky Dutch television program called ``Gekkenhuis,'' or
``Crazy House,'' even flew Ozersky to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to work, although the whirlwind forced him to cut
back. He never thought of quitting his $29,000-a-year job.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky loves his co-workers. And he believes in their mission,
which could be one of the great scientific breakthroughs of modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that I'm more proud to work on this than
being any part of baseball history,'' he said. ``This is what I'd
rather tell my grandchildren about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky has few souvenirs of his wild year.
</P>
<P>
   His desk is free of any mementos or clippings next to his thick
binders of genetic charts and uneaten apple.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky's first, and only, encounter with McGwire came at a
January charity auction. He bid $11,000 for a drawing of the
slugger. They made small talk, and McGwire autographed the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Philip,'' he wrote, ``Great catch!''
</P>
<P>
   The ball itself ended up in the hands of comic-book publisher
Todd McFarlane, who has taken it on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky saw the ball when it stopped in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fan that he is, Ozersky sometimes wishes he could just
grip the ball, just hold the gem that changed his life. This was
the ball that made so many people happy, not just baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's happy just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   As Paisner said: ``It doesn't matter who bought it. It'll always
be Phil's ball. It'll always be his moment. You can't buy that from
him.''

MURAL ART REVIVAL BRINGS TOWNS TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERVILLE, Kan. _ Here and in a score of other Kansas towns,
people are buying paint in 5-gallon buckets, popping the lids and
creating art on the sides of old mercantile buildings, railroad
depots, warehouses, banks and just about anything else standing.
</P>
<P>
   They're painting murals.
</P>
<P>
   Even ancient silos have been turned into art. And one artist is
convinced that those grain elevators that dot the Kansas landscape
like faraway white cathedrals are just waiting to become the
biggest canvases of all.
</P>
<P>
   From here in Waterville to places like Syracuse on the far
western edge of the state and in between _ Marysville, Harper,
Great Bend, Council Grove, Winfield, Pittsburg, Lucas, Protection
and a dozen other Kansas towns _ the wayfarer can find murals whose
caliber ranges from the dexterity of professional artist Stan Herd
to a group of high school students who've bedecked an empty wall
with the unique perceptions of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there are more murals being done today than anytime
since the WPA (Works Progress Administration) during the
Depression,'' said Maggie Hall-Bicker, a Winfield artist who, with
$4,000 worth of paint, turned an old warehouse into a collage of
railroads, farms and the Flint Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Hall-Bicker dated the revival of the art form to the early
1990s, when people realized again that murals could celebrate a
town's history and culture, boost the growing preservation movement
and attract spectators and tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sullins, who runs an insurance agency on U.S. 50 in
Syracuse, a one-stoplight Hamilton County community of 1,600
abutting Colorado, couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would just roar through here on the highway,'' she
said. ``Eyes straight ahead. Now they stop and take pictures of the
mural. And they not only stop, but they spend money here. They get
something to eat. They shop. They spend some time here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse mural, depicting scenes of the town's history, is
145-feet long and 10-feet high. It was commissioned locally and
done by Mike Fallier, a Syracuse native who now lives in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for murals recently led the Kansas Sampler
Foundation to publish in its newsletter a list of 10 muralists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become extremely popular,'' said Marci Penner, who
heads the foundation in Inman. ``Some, like Stan Herd, just pop out
at you. His mural in Wilmore is just wonderful. But then there are
a few that aren't so well-done. But say this: They're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Winkenwader, a farmer and artist who lives just north of
Waterville, has done murals in Maryville, Blue Rapids and here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had the bug,'' said Winkenwader, 62. ``I liked oils
and watercolors better than just drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because art wasn't offered in high school, Winkenwader took an
art correspondence course. He farmed. He worked for the soil
conservation service. He always painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd work for the ASCS (conservation service) days, come home
in the evening and farm, and then I'd paint way into the early
morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winkenwader figured he had done about 12 murals in the three
towns, all commissioned by banks, churches and historical groups,
or private individuals. He'll pull in just a few hundred dollars on
each.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Winkenwader said he loved what he was doing. And he
said he was used to conditions most art types would rebel at _
painting, for instance, in high summer on corrugated barn siding
that has been used to cover a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The heat just blazes out at you, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Winkenwader is accustomed to the locals who
stand over his shoulder asking questions and offering advice. He
likes knowing the community is behind him, literally.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the recent Brooklyn Museum imbroglio with its
dung-splattered Madonna, a severed hog, and other shock art,
Winkenwader allowed that flinging malodorous substances around
Waterville or Blue Rapids would surely bring men in white coats and
large nets.
</P>
<P>
   Fallier agreed, adding that the New York art world ``gets all
the headlines while we're out here starving to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just the way it is,'' he added. ``What's nice is
that your art really means something to the people. I've had calls
from friends out in Syracuse saying that one mural has changed the
whole town. I painted it, but it's their mural.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Caldwell of Hutchinson, who has done murals in Arlington
and Great Bend, said the proprietary frame of mind Kansans take on
as they watch the transfiguration of a wall or building may speak
volumes about the real role of art in peoples' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell and other muralists believe in participatory art. One
recent mural had parts of it painted by ``artists'' ranging from by
youngsters barely old enough to hold a brush, to senior citizens in
their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lay it out almost the same as one of those paint-by-number
kits, only bigger,'' he said. ``That mural becomes something that
kid can go back to when he's a young man or then a father and say,
`I helped paint that.' That means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said some towns initially had doubts about the murals.
Great Bend, he said, was an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hard time getting the first wall,'' he said. ``Now
we've got 10 done. And there are 14 walls waiting. Once they see
what happens with a mural, people go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, said Caldwell, there's a practical streak to Kansans
embracing murals. A ballpark figure for a good-sized mural in a
small town should run from $7,000 to $9,000, he said. Compare
demolition, removing the rubble, landscaping, and ending up with an
empty lot and you're likely talking comparable money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you find with murals is once they're up and as long
as they're maintained, the whole neighborhood around them brightens
up,'' he said. ``It's just something that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As for getting the money to do the mural, Fallier said bingo
games financed the ones in Harper. Rosslyn Schultz of the Grass
Roots Art Center in Lucas said a mural there was done with in-kind
donations such as buckets of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Conchita Reyes, an official with the Kansas Arts Commission in
Topeka, said there was some state matching fund money available for
murals, roughly $2,000 plus a little more for ``technical
assistance,'' i.e. the artist. Currently such grants are being used
for murals in Pittsburg and Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Fallier said his commissions usually came by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One town sees what another has done, and you get a call,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said he had been negotiating with a grain company to
turn one of their massive elevators into a cattle stampede scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to paint them every so often anyway,'' Caldwell
said. ``Can you imagine? A herd of cattle charging at you as you
pull into some little town? Wouldn't that be something to see in
Kansas?''

 KC's SCHOOL DISTRICT WOES MIRROR TREND FACING OTHER DISTRICTS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR and KEVIN HOFFMANN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri's move last week to strip the Kansas
City School District of state accreditation mirrors a nationwide
trend of states intervening in their struggling urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   From New Jersey to Illinois to California, governors, lawmakers
and education leaders are growing increasingly restless with the
dismal performance in many big-city classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems now more than ever that states are intervening in the
chronically troubled districts,'' said Todd Ziebarth, policy
analyst for the Education Commission of the States, a nationwide
nonprofit group that analyzes state education policies. ``It seems
for the past five or six years, at least one or two states have
done some type of intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziebarth said state politicians were being pulled into troubled
school districts because of local officials' inability to turn
around poor test scores and low graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states now have legislation that allows them to take
over an academically troubled district, according to data from the
Education Commission. At least 10 states have exercised such
authority, although the level of control varies from state to
state.
</P>
<P>
   The states' actions have helped correct financial and management
flaws of troubled districts, Ziebarth said. Unfortunately, state
officials have had minimal success at improving the academic
problems that often spurred them to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the first thing either a state or (a state-appointed
official) takes on are the financial problems, the management
problems, the infrastructure problems,'' he said. ``Changes in the
classroom seem to be more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kirst, a Stanford University education professor and
former president of the California state school board, has studied
state interventions. He agreed with Ziebarth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for Missouri will be can they do anything to
change the quality of the classroom. Can they connect this to
improving education at the classroom level?'' Kirst said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman says he thinks he
can.
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said the state board's decision to remove the Kansas
City district's accreditation should not be viewed as punitive.
Instead, he said, it should send a clear signal to students,
parents, school officials and community leaders that the city faces
an academic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And time is running out. Without substantial progress in the
next two years, the district could be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   State intervention alone, however, does not guarantee success.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Schundler, mayor of Jersey City, N.J., said that his city's
school district had seen only minimal improvement in test scores
and no improvement in the graduation rate since the state took over
in 1989, citing ``academic bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey City case marked the first time a state intervened in
a local school district.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Peretzman, a spokesman with the New Jersey Department of
Education, disagreed with Schundler and pointed out substantial
gains in the Jersey City district and other New Jersey school
districts under state control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence shows there has been substantial improvement,''
Peretzman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Jersey City district had met 37 percent of the
state's ``monitoring indicators'' before the intervention. The
district today meets 94 percent. He said not only had test scores
improved, but also the graduation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Peretzman acknowledged that the state first addressed
mismanagement problems. He said that New Jersey districts were
``highly dysfunctional'' and that those changes had to happen
before any improvement in the classroom could occur.
</P>
<P>
   Schundler, however, said it was time to stop shifting
accountability from one political body to another and instead make
the districts accountable to parents. If parents are unhappy with
the way their children are being taught, he said, school board
members should have to stand for another election.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center in
Newark, N.J., an advocacy group representing urban schoolchildren,
said state officials must help develop plans to put troubled
districts on a path to improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra said, however, that state officials would be in for a
long haul if they simply moved in and replaced the school board,
the superintendent or even the principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to turn and look at these schools and say, `What
do we do now?' And they are going to face the same old problems the
district had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra said that thorough assessments of teacher training,
curriculum and leadership within the individual schools must occur
before any improvement would take place in the urban classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Kansas City) is like our urban districts, they don't have
the capacity to do these sort of assessments,'' Sciarra said.
``These are districts constantly in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's loss of accreditation gives the state board
authority to replace the elected local school board with an
appointed panel. But Bartman and state Board of Education President
Betty Preston said they had no desire to take over the operation of
the Kansas City system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is volunteering for this job with the idea of wanting
to run the school district, that's for sure,'' Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bartman said his department would send officials to
Kansas City this week to help the district begin meeting the
state-ordered improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody (including the state) has got some responsibility to
improve performance,'' he said.

 KC's SCHOOL DISTRICT WOES MIRROR TREND FACING OTHER DISTRICTS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR and KEVIN HOFFMANN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The district and the community must focus
their efforts, he said, adding that his department stood ready to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be partners in a resolution, not just evaluators
and spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bartman says, he thinks revoking Kansas City's
accreditation _ forcing the state to confront one of its biggest
educational challenges _ will help speed Missouri toward having its
public schools rank among the nation's top five by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   One urban education expert called the state board's decision an
act of political courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a state really not willing to tolerate low performance
from minority and low-income kids, and that's an important message
for the state to send,'' said Alfred Hess, director of the center
for urban school policy at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of many states that are willing to take on their
big cities. The politics of big city vs. state is pretty fierce.
This is a pretty gutsy move.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hess, who has studied state intervention in the Chicago
public schools, said the action had a downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also sends a message that the state doesn't think the city
schools are very good,'' Hess said. ``And that's bad news for real
estate agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Berkley, chairman of the Civic Council's education policy
committee, agreed that the state action would not help economic
development efforts in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be fallout from it, no doubt,'' Berkley
said. ``How far it will go I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkley also said that the problems confronting schools in
Kansas City confronted the other districts in almost every major
American city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happen now to have been given a status that highlights
that even more,'' Berkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is we are actually on the upswing right now with
momentum and potential. Hopefully, being given this status will not
stop that momentum, but create a greater sense of urgency and
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartman acknowledged that he might have spent considerable
political capital in pushing for the loss of state accreditation.
But he said he felt that it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10 percent of our kids not learning, and they
haven't been for a long period of time,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults have to take some risks, too. We think it's measured.
You do what you can to anticipate, and you measure the risk. In the
end, you try to do what's right and pay the consequences.''

TEXAS STUNS Nebraska AGAIN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
AUSTIN, Texas _ The clock expired and Texas tailback Hodges
Mitchell dropped to his knees to kiss the turf at Royal-Memorial
Stadium. Moments later, he embraced teammate Ryan Nunez before
pulling away and playfully pounding Nunez's shoulder pads. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nebraska who?,'' Mitchell yelled. ``Nebraska who?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Technically, that would be the third-ranked Cornhuskers, who
fell for a third consecutive time as a decisive favorite in a Big
12 matchup against the Texas Longhorns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time, No. 18 Texas prevailed, 24-20, Saturday as a
nine-point underdog in front of a stadium-record crowd of 84,082.
Once again, the Longhorns erased a fourth-quarter deficit in
stunning the Cornhuskers and Las Vegas oddsmakers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this time, said Texas players, they did not surprise
themselves. Not like in 1996, when Texas pulled a 37-27 upset in
the Big 12 title game to win as a 21-point underdog. And not like
last season, when the Longhorns prevailed, 20-16, as 17-point
underdogs in Lincoln, Neb. That one ended the Cornhuskers' 47-game
home winning streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This one, by contrast, simply helped Texas (6-2, 3-1) hang on to
its share of first place in the South Divison standings while
dropping Nebraska (6-1, 3-1) a game behind No. 7 Kansas State (7-0,
4-0) in the North Division race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason this is an upset is because they're No. 3 and
we're No. 18,'' said Nunez, whose 39-yard catch jump-started Texas'
game-winning, fourth-quarter touchdown drive. ``I expected to win
all along. Even when we were down, 13-3, we expected to win. At
some point, you kind of get the feeling that we've got their
number.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown put it more succinctly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a freak deal. It wasn't something anybody
planned on, because defensively, we were so bad,'' Brown said.
``This year, we thought we were a much better football team with a
chance to win.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas capitalized on that opportunity, thanks in large part to a
defense that forced three turnovers, including two inside the
Longhorns' 10-yard line. Although Nebraska racked up 429 yards, 120
came on three completions, on drives that ended in two turnovers
and one field goal. Longhorns defenders focused on stopping
quarterback Eric Crouch's option runs and limited him to 35 yards
on 17 carries (2.1 per attempt). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rolling the dice \Rwith blitzes\S, trying to get to
him and upset his rhythm,'' said Texas defensive coordinator Carl
Reese. ``We wanted to make someone else beat us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Nebraska, no one else surfaced. But the Texas offense, after
a dismal first half, rebounded with a vengeance after
intermission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same offense that produced no net yards _ and no first downs
_ on five consecutive first-half possessions cranked out touchdown
drives of 35 and 58 yards in the third quarter to erase a 13-3
deficit. Most of the damage came from quarterback Major Applewhite,
who connected on 6 of 6 passes in the third quarter for 110 yards,
including a 13-yard touchdown strike to Kwame Cavil that put Texas
on top, 17-13. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Nebraska responded with a 44-yard scoring drive in the
fourth quarter, giving the Cornhuskers a 20-17 lead with 7:41
remaining. Texas countered with a 60-yard march in four plays,
covering the final 17 on a swing pass to tight end Mike Jones, who
bounced off Nebraska defenders Keyuo Craver and Ralph Brown on the
way to the end zone.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt people grabbing at my legs, so I kept pulling away,''
Jones said. ``As soon as I got in the end zone, I felt like I was
in a different place. It was like I was having an out-of-body
experience, watching myself score. I'll never forget it. It was the
greatest high I've ever experienced on a football field.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teammates were pretty happy, too, especially after linebacker
Anthony Hicks' blitz forced a fourth-down incompletion on
Nebraska's final offensive play. Afterward, Crouch and the
Cornhuskers maligned themselves for missed opportunities. Crouch
called it ``very disappointing'' to be part of the first Nebraska
team to drop three consecutive games to a conference opponent since
losses to Oklahoma in 1985-87. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, a fifth-year senior, smiled and insisted he is not
surprised to have played on teams with a combined mark of 3-0
against a school with three national championships in the 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``An upset? No. We were just the better team this Saturday,''
Hicks said. ``The way we played, we could have beaten most
anybody.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the team Texas beat Saturday, to the surprise of many
outside the Longhorns' locker room, was Nebraska. Once again. &QL;

   &UR; THE TENNIS PARTNER &LR;  By Abraham Verghese. Harper Perennial, $14.
A physician's story of his friendship with a young Australian
intern struggling to maintain control of his inner demons is also
one about medicine, grief and, above all, human nature. ``Verghese
is a fine writer, lyrical and controlled, and he captures the
attachment between the two men _ its motives, its allure _ with
both precision and charm,'' Caroline Knapp wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1998.

   &UR; THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN: Stories &LR;  By Alice Munro. Vintage
Contemporaries, $13. Most of these eight long stories are rooted
around 1960 and deal with the way people lived then and how they
live now, offering a rich portrait of a generation of women who
discovered a different set of rules in adulthood. This collection,
which was selected by the editors of The New York Times Book Review
as one of the best books of 1998, is ``characteristically superb,''
Michael Gorra wrote. At times ``Munro's work has the dazzling but
utterly illusory simplicity of the Wordsworth who ... could
collapse one moment, one memory, into another with an unrivaled
combination of clarity and subtlety.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BILL EVANS: How My Heart Sings &LR;  By Peter Pettinger. Yale
University, $15.95. The first full-length biography of the
enormously influential jazz pianist is as interested in his
exquisite playing as it is in his long private struggle with heroin
and cocaine addiction, which led to his death in 1980. The ``book
is packed with ... shrewd critical commentary,'' Terry Teachout
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; READING JAZZ: A Gathering of Autobiography, Reportage, and
Criticism From 1919 to Now &LR; , edited by Robert Gottlieb (Vintage,
$20), features about 150 previously published pieces pulled
together by a noted book and magazine editor. ``This comprehensive
and intelligently organized collection reflects not just editorial
skill but a well-informed enthusiasm for the music,'' Peter
Keepnews wrote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNDRED DAYS &LR;  By Patrick O'Brian. Norton, $13.95. In the
19th installment in the author's popular franchise of naval
historical novels, the bluff Commodore Jack Aubrey and the
brilliant ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin take on Balkan and North
African mercenaries during the hundred days between Napoleon's
escape from Elba and Waterloo. ``There is no doubt the fans will
like'' this tale, Paul Kennedy wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ROAD HOME &LR;  By Jim Harrison. Washington Square/Pocket Books,
$14. Five members of a part-Sioux family take turns narrating the
history of three generations of their Nebraska clan and their
complex connections to one another and to the natural world. ``To
read this book is to feel the luminosity of nature in one's own
being,'' Thomas McNamee wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WALKING WITH THE WIND: A Memoir of the Movement &LR;  By John Lewis
with Michael D'Orso. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $15. In chronicling
how the 1960s changed the United States (and his own role in that
transformation), an eminent civil rights leader revisits the
triumphant first half of the decade and the assassinations and
disillusionment that followed. Last year the reviewer William H.
Chafe called this a ``powerful memoir'' written ``with simplicity
and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TROUBLE IN MIND: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow &LR; , by
Leon F. Litwack (Vintage, $17), is a harrowing study of the South
between Reconstruction and World War I, a nightmare world of
segregation, brutal violence, disfranchisement, dashed dreams of
freedom and indignities large and small. ``Litwack's is a
heartbreaking book about a heartbreaking time,'' Edward L. Ayers
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RUBY &LR;  By Ann Hood. Picador USA, $13. This novel about the
strange bond between a grieving widow and a pregnant teen-age
runaway explores the unpredictable demands of sorrow. Last year the
reviewer Megan Harlan admired ``Hood's caustic wit, brightly
detailed prose and thoughtful delineations of two women struggling
with private, powerful regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIKE NEVER BEFORE &LR;  By Ehud Havazelet. Anchor, $12.95. These 10
interlocking stories about two generations of an Orthodox Jewish
family are unpredictable in their aims but share themes of
assimilation, the unforgivingness of time and the wasting of love.
The author ``can wriggle inside the personality of just about
anybody,'' Craig Seligman wrote last year. ``The writing soars.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CEREUS BLOOMS AT NIGHT &LR;  By Shani Mootoo. Bard/Avon, $12.50. Set
on an imaginary Caribbean island, this tale is about two displaced
souls whose marriage sets off an explosive chain of events, ranging
from adultery to murder. ``Mootoo's impressive first novel mixes
elements of magic realism and Gothic horror in a style that is by
turns lyrical and lurid,'' Diane Cole wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTER SILENCE: Rape and My Journey Back &LR;  By Nancy Venable
Raine. Three Rivers, $14. In this bold account of the author's rape
in 1985 and its aftermath, she digs deep to analyze the feelings of
profound violation, rage, self-blame and shame brought on by the
crime. ```After Silence' is a book that dignifies the human
spirit,'' Richard Shweder wrote in 1998. ``It should be read by
everyone.''

RECORD BUT NO WIN FOR VAN RAAPHORST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even before USC embarked on its game-failing drive
in the final two minutes, quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst had sliced
Stanford's secondary apart with his arm, his savvy and his
escapability.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, all the things he's not supposed to be able to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it, Stanford was so not in awe of Van Raaphorst's
record-setting performance that it challenged him to make a play in
the final minute to win. He didn't, and despite throwing for a
USC-record 415 yards the Trojans lost 35-31 to the Cardinal at the
Coliseum on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they would play back in a prevent (defense),'' USC
freshman receiver Kareem Kelly said. ``They insulted our offense by
coming up and doing what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, if that's the case, is a slap in Van Raaphorst's face.
The redshirt junior broke Brad Johnson's six-year school mark of
most passing yards in a game (392), but it was the 16 yards he
didn't get that hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst scrambled to create time, connected on a pair of
64-yard touchdown passes and showed poise and composure that makes
Carson Palmer's absence easier to take. Van Raaphorst's career day
included career-highs of 25 completions, 51 attempts and three
touchdowns. But it was little consolation after he was intercepted
on the last play of the game at the Stanford 7-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what I threw for, we needed to win,'' said Van
Raaphorst, who was on the verge of tears in the locker room. ``I
feel bad. Nothing matters. The stats don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this isn't how the most prolific passing display in
Trojans history should turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst nearly threw for more yards in this game than
Palmer did before his collarbone injury (490), but offsetting the
64-yard TD passes to Marcell Almond and R. Jay Soward was the
third-quarter interception that gave Stanford its first lead.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst never took his eyes off Soward, his intended
receiver, and Chris Johnson stepped in and returned the pick 30
yards to put Stanford up 28-24. It was the first of three
second-half interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mike gave us a chance to win,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``He threw the deep ball well, audibilized well. We
didn't protect him down the stretch. Mike's a great competitor. He
needed help from some people at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the knocks on Van Raaphorst _ a lack of arm strength,
speed and big-play ability _ were pushed aside in for the first 58
minutes. But the most important one _ an ability to lead a team to
a comeback on the final drive _ remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so poised and calm the whole time,'' USC running back
Chad Morton said. ``That's why I like being next to him in the
huddle. This isn't all on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst had the chance to add conspicuous-by-its-absence
late-game heroics to his portfolio when the Trojans' defense gave
him the ball on the Stanford 45 with 2:08 to play. He even made a
critical fourth-down play when he waited until he was hit to dump
the ball off to Morton, who darted for the first down to keep USC's
hopes alive with under a minute to play.
</P>
<P>
   But after a third-and-4 pass fell incomplete with nine seconds
left, Van Raaphorst was left with one more chance. And now he's
left with the memory of Tim Smith intercepting the ball and running
out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's there to say?'' Van Raaphorst asked. ``I can't think of
anything right now.''
</P>

WITH GLAVINE SICK, MADDOX GETS THE CALL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The telephone rang late at Bobby Cox's house Friday
night and, as with many late-night phone calls, it was not good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine, the Atlanta Braves' designated starting pitcher for
Game 1 of the World Series, was at home sick with an intestinal
virus and would not be able to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I've got to get a hold of Maddux,''' Cox, the Braves'
manager, said, referring to Greg Maddux, who pitched Game 1
Saturday night, a 4-1 loss to the Yankees, instead of Game 2 on
Sunday night. But Cox said Glavine told him, ``No, I've called him
and he's ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was ready. He pitched brilliantly through seven innings
Saturday night, but left the game in the eighth inning with the
score 1-1 and the bases loaded. John Rocker relieved Maddux, but
those three base runners came around to score and were the
difference in the game. Maddux, who was charged with the loss,
allowed four runs, two of them earned, on five hits and three
walks, and struck out five. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Cox said about Glavine's illness, ``but
things like this do happen. Tommy has pitched at times with a bad
arm through his career, shoulder, elbow, two broken ribs, two bad
knees, a bad ankle, an infected toe and never missed a start that I
can remember. He's really sick, dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Braves, beset by a seasonlong string of devastating
injuries and illness, encountered their latest medical hurdle.
Glavine had caught the bug that had leveled his family. His stepson
and wife were ill during the National League Championship Series
against the Mets and, after Friday's workout and news media
session, Glavine felt sick enough by 11:15 p.m. to tell Cox there
was no way he could pitch Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he hoped that Glavine, a left-hander, would be fit
enough to start Game 3 on Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. If
healthy, he would then also be available to start Game 7, if that
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He had been scheduled to start Games 1 and 5. Cox wanted Glavine
to start the Series opener because he had not pitched since
throwing seven shutout innings against the Mets in Game 3 of the
League Championship Series on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox juggled his rotation around Glavine's illness. Glavine
will have 10 days of rest if he goes in Game 3, but if there is a
Game 7 he will have his regular four days of rest. Kevin Millwood,
who was scheduled to start Game 3, will instead start Game 2, and
John Smoltz remains the Game 4 starter.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the sudden change in the rotation produced a
dramatic drop for the Braves. Glavine, a two-time Cy Young award
winner who is 1-0 with a 1.38 earned run average in the post-season
this year, gave way to Maddux, a four-time Cy Young award winner,
who entered the game 1-1 with a 2.14 e.r.a. in the 1999 post-season
and who had last pitched in Game 5 of the League Championship
Series, on Oct. 17. Maddux threw only lightly in the outfield
during Friday's workout, so he was fully rested.
</P>
<P>
   One impact of the change in pitchers was on the Yankees' lineup.
Ricky Ledee, a left-handed hitter who was 0 for 3 Saturday night,
started in left field instead of Chad Curtis, a right-handed hitter
who would have played had Glavine pitched. Manager Joe Torre did
not find out about the switch in pitchers until he arrived at the
park about 2:30 p.m., when he looked at the lineup sheet and a
clubhouse attendant told him Glavine was sick.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, too, was unruffled by the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, it's the same, except it might be easier because
we're at home,'' he said. ``Physically, the only difference is I
get to hit. I don't know if that's good or bad for us. I was
looking forward to pitching at Yankee Stadium. I hadn't gotten to
pitch there during the regular season. It's always been a dream of
mine to pitching in that stadium. What better time than the World
Series?''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any additional concern for Cox now, it is that the
virus does not sweep through the Braves' clubhouse, as illnesses
regularly do. But Glavine stayed at home Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think,'' Millwood said, ``that's he's going to be
coming around kissing anybody.''

the supply. (Kevin Moloney/New York Times Photo)

rich say that the demand for experienced household managers exceeds
the supply. (Kevin Moloney/New York Times Photo)

 &HT;    Game One yanked from Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves spent three days convincing the media and
themselves that this team was different from the one that lost to
the Yankees in the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went out in Game 1 of the 1999 World Series on
Saturday night and did their best imitation of the team that lost
to the Yankees in '96.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, the Braves' Greg Maddux outdueled the
Yankees' October wonder, Orlando Hernandez, thanks to Chipper
Jones' awakening from a 60 at-bat power slumber with a solo home
run in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But like the last four games of the '96 Series, the Braves had
the bottom yanked out from under them in a 4-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, trailing 1-0 in the best-of-seven, will send Kevin
Millwood against David Cone in Game 2 on Sunday night at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' homer in the fourth inning turned out to be one of two
hits for the Braves. The 1-0 lead it provided lasted until the
eighth inning, when the ever patient Yankees lineup scored four
runs against Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had allowed a base-runner in five of the first seven
innings _three reached second base _ but held the Yankees scoreless
by mixing in three strikeouts, a double play and a couple of weak
grounders to stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That quality work got swallowed in a wobbly eighth inning, when
the Yankees loaded the bases on Scott Brosius' third single of the
game, a pinch-hit walk by Darryl Strawberry and an error by first
baseman Brian Hunter, who had a ball slip out of his hands on a
Chuck Knoblauch sacrifice bunt attempt. Maddux thought he had Derek
Jeter struck out on an 0-2 pitch away, but didn't get the call,
then watched Jeter tie the game with a no-out single to left to
make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker was called in to stop the damage, but only
contributed, falling behind to Paul O'Neill 3-1 before giving up a
two-run bouncing single to right. Rocker struck out the side, but
not before giving up another run on a bases loaded walk to Jim
Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   That inning all but wrapped up the Braves' fifth consecutive
World Series loss and the Yankees' ninth consecutive World Series
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees haven't lost in the World Series since Game 2 of
1996, when Maddux pitched eight shutout innings in a 4-0 Braves
victory. The Yankees won the next four to stun the Braves in 1996
and four more to sweep the Padres last season.
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Glavine sitting at home with a terribly timed case of
the stomach flu, Maddux played emergency starter. It was his third
Game 1 start of the postseason and first Game 1 start in a World
Series since 1995 when he beat the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He drew the Yankees best postseason starter.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the Cuban defector with the high leg kick and sliding
arm angle, has been virtually untouchable in his two years of
playing in October. Entering Saturday night's game he was 4-0 with
an 0.97 ERA in five starts, 2-0 with a 1.17 ERA this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome than those numbers for the Braves was his
bloodline. Hernandez is the half-brother Livan Hernandez, who
terrorized the Braves for 15 strikeouts in a 2-1 Marlins victory
against Maddux and the Braves in Game 5 of the 1997 NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez came close _ with 10 strikeouts in seven
innings. By the time NLCS MVP Eddie Perez struck out for a second
time in two at-bats on a Hernandez curve, El Duque had matched his
postseason high in strikeouts with nine, and it was only the second
out of the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   For the first couple innings, progress against him meant a
little contact, which Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko supplied with
back-to-back outs to right field. That and an Andruw Jones walk in
a 10-pitch at-bat in the second inning ended a roll of eight
strikeouts from Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   But he was staring down a 1-0 deficit after a poor 1-0 pitch to
Chipper Jones, who turned on a belt-high fastball for his first
home run this postseason and first ever homer in a World Series
game. Jones had hit a paltry .217 in the postseason from the left
side with more strikeouts (six) than hits (five).

LOOK OUT, PASADENA, STANFORD IS ON TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another week, another Stanford victory, another
step closer to the school's first Rose Bowl appearance in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a member of the Tournament of Roses Committee, you
might as well pull your crimson blazer over your head.
</P>
<P>
   Because if this Stanford team represents the conference in
Pasadena on Jan.1, things could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's no doubting Stanford is the best the Pac-10
has to offer, which is a little like being the finest-tailored suit
in a thrift store.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal won another game Saturday, coming back from a 21-0
deficit to stun USC 35-31 at the Coliseum. It was the latest stop
on their undefeated run through the conference, which includes a
10-point victory over UCLA and a 50-22 mugging at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has a game and a half on the rest of the conference,
with games remaining at Washington, at Arizona State and home
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   If Stanford wins the Pac-10 championship, it will bring the
worst defense Pasadena has seen since... oh, wait. Nearly forgot.
UCLA plays there every other week.
</P>
<P>
   But be it Stanford or another of the Pac-10's not-so-fearsome
.500 teams, the conference champ will get Penn State. Or, if the
Nittany Lions are snapped up to play in the Sugar Bowl for the
national title, the next at-large BCS team.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the second-place team from the Big 10, but not
necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin _ they all seem like
mismatches. But it could be worse. It could be an at-large team.
Like, say, Florida. Or Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Granddaddy of 'Em All could be reduced to a New Year's Day
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   If USC second-stringer Mike Van Raaphorst can throw for 415
yards against this Cardinal defense (a Trojans all-time single-game
record), then what could a real quarterback do?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Stanford gave up 415 passing yards Saturday. Along
with 587 total yards, 24 first downs, 212 rushing yards and a pair
of 64-yard TDs.
</P>
<P>
   And won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stats don't look pretty,'' Stanford cornerback Ruben
Carter said, ``but stats don't matter much in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be true in the perspectiveless Pac-10, which has
become a bastardized version of the Western Athletic Conference.
The games have turned into stat-stuffed shows of offensive
gluttony.
</P>
<P>
   Or defensive incompetence, depending on your point of view.
Either way, it's an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single team is ranked in the top-25 of the two major
polls. Mathematically, it's possible for every conference team to
be bowl ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   On the national landscape, the Pac-10 is a speed bump.
</P>
<P>
   Check that. Speed bumps are designed to slow things down. Pac-10
defenses have shown no such ability.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stanford, the conference's top team according to the
standings, is unranked. What's worse, it has an 0-2 nonconference
record.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cardinal's two defeats weren't particularly pretty. One
was a 44-39 loss to San Jose State _ a WAC team, for crying out
loud _ and the other was a 69-17 lashing at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of the same porous Stanford defense Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst hit Marcell Allmond with a 64-yard touchdown at
2:50 of the first quarter. It was the Trojans' longest play from
scrimmage this season. Two quarters later, Van Raaphorst tied that
mark with a 64-yarder to R.Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   Soward dropped another bomb, a guaranteed 70-yard TD catch at
the start of the fourth quarter, after he had beaten cornerback
Chris Johnson down the field by a full 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything bad about Stanford,'' Soward
said, ``... but we could've had that all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow though, Stanford came on top again. Came another game
closer to their first Pac-10 title since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal remains on a collision course for the Rose Bowl _
``collision'' being the operative word.

STANFORD LIVES IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyrone Willingham calls it living in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Stanford head coach had no problem with defensive
lineman Willie Howard sprawling in celebration on the Coliseum turf
following Stanford's improbable 35-31 victory over USC on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he enjoyed seeing offensive tackle Jeff Cronshagen
sitting on the Cardinal bench happily soaking in the atmosphere of
the victory with no thoughts of the next three weeks on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why he had to grin when he saw quarterback Todd Husak
searching the crowded field until he could give teammate Tim Smith,
who salted away the win with a last-play interception at the
Cardinal goal line, a big hug.
</P>
<P>
   That's also why Willingham didn't want to hear anything more
about the latest victory on what is becoming to look more and more
like a Rose Bowl tour once the sun came up today.
</P>
<P>
   ````This is a huge win for us,'' said Willingham, having no
trouble keeping a calm exposure despite the chaotic afternoon.
````And (today) it's on to the next one. Washington becomes the
focus of our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice try, but maybe it's time to focus on what it takes to be in
Pasadena on New Year's Day. Stanford, at 5-0 in Pac-10 play, leads
Arizona State, Washington and Arizona by one game in the loss
column. So, let's look at next week versus Washington, but also
take a peek at a road game against Arizona State and the conference
finale against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to dust off the old tales of New Year's Day 1971
and 1972 when the Cardinal last played in a Rose Bowl. Maybe it's
time to teach the unedecated why the 1971 defense was called the
Thunderchickens.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time for us media members to admit - gulp - that we
were wrong to project before the season that Stanford was the
eighth best team this conference has to offer. Maybe it's time to
remember that a Stanford team that loses to San Jose State can
still play in Pasadena - like the 1971 Cardinal squad did.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about living in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ````It's hard not to think about it (the Rose Bowl),''
linebacker Riall Johnson grudgingly admitted. ````We have to have
that as a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   See, now was that so hard?
</P>
<P>
   ````But we can't do that by not playing them one a time,''
Johnson countered quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Husak, a St. John Bosco High graduate, emerged from the
victorious locker room and spoke of the highs and lows that can
envelop a college football season. He gave an example, discussing
the 1997 season when the Cardinal were 4-1 and nationally ranked
before losing five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ````This is nice,'' Husak said, ````but we could lose the rest
of the games and not even go to a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   There were things on Saturday to indicate that might not be so
farfetched of a notion. Stanford, after all, did fall behind USC,
21-0, before the teams changed sides to begin the second quarter.
The Cardinal defense did allow Mike Van Raaphorst, who wouldn't
have been playing if Carson Palmer didn't lower his shoulder
against Oregon, to throw for 415 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, perhaps, this is an offense which couldn't
gain an inch on fourth down at the Stanford 45-yard line with 2:08
remaining and the Cardinal clinging to a 35-31 lead. Husak ducked
his head into the line of scrimmage in search of the needed inch
and came up two inches short.
</P>
<P>
   ````I felt it was bad spot,'' Husak said.
</P>
<P>
   All they needed was an inch. The spot shouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ````My thought process was if we get one inch, we win the
football game,'' Willingham said. ````I felt confident we could get
what was needed. Was there a risk involved? No question about it,
but I weighed the risk and thought it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision failed and the game suddenly hinged on the
110th-rated defense in the land.
</P>
<P>
   ````I went to (Willingham) and said `You're going to go for it
aren't you?','' defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. ````I felt
confident if we didn't get it then (the defense) would go out and
get them stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   It took every bit of the defense's energy to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ````I'm sure there still are some non-believers out there,''
Husak said. ````But, I'll tell you, there isn't one non-believer in
that locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-believers? Husak knows all about them.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't earn a full-time starting job at St. John Bosco until
hs senior season and colleges weren't exactly beating down his
door. In fact, his options consisted of Stanford and, well,
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Stanford was right. On Saturday, he was 20 of
32 for 290 yards with touchdowns of 23 and 16 yards and the
game-winning score on a 1-yard plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ````I'm not trying to prove anything to (the schools that didn't
offer a scholarship),'' Husak said. ````I've proven that I can
play. What's important to me is proving we can win.''

TROJANS CRUMBLE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Today's USC joke: What does a Trojan do when he gets dealt a 21
in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Fold.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me if that sounds harsh. But how often do teams blow
21-point first half leads, in consecutive games no less? USC stands
3-4 on its fast-eclipsing season and DOA in the comatose Pac-10,
and no one will blame Trojan fans if they decide to skip the second
half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 35-31 loss to Stanford at the Coliseum was no better
or worse than the loss at Notre Dame a week ago. A mediocre team
that is poorly coached found a way to lose, and that's pretty much
what one has come to expect of the Trojans now for more than a
decade now.
</P>
<P>
   They can neither live up to their old reputation nor any
down-sized expectations, like competing annually for the Pac-10
title. Those hopes for '99 are as dead as UCLA's, the only saving
grace.
</P>
<P>
   The sad sight here Saturday was emotionally spent young USC
players trying to painfully explain why they again lost a football
game the same way. The questions weren't nearly as probing as the
answers were telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a question of heart,'' said USC safety David Gibson.
``It isn't that we didn't play hard enough, or that we don't want
it bad enough. We were all aware that `we can't blow this lead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Van Raaphorst, the junior subbing for Carson Palmer who
threw for a school-record 415 yards but also three interceptions,
wore the look of someone zipping body bags, consumed by dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to expound on,'' he said. ``If you guys
figure it out, let me know. I can't give you any perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's mental,'' said cornerback Antuan Simmons, who
intercepted two passes but was also the primary corner on two
Cardinal touchdown passes. ``It's not physical. I'm not tired.
We're just not making the plays when it's for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   When a team loses is just a matter of timing. The common ground
is that USC, at best, is fundamentally inconsistent and poorly
prepared. Stanford contributed to USC's brisk 21-0 start with a
soft early zone, poor punting and a halting offense adjusting to a
new different starting tailback, Brian Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford began making its adjustments in the second quarter, and
except for one more long USC touchdown pass and one specious
Stanford coaching decision in the final minutes, it dominated the
rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   On a day the offense netted 587 yards (238 of it in the first
quarter), for example, there were still questions to ask about Paul
Hackett's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Like, why does Hackett ask Van Raaphorst, who does not have the
long arm or quick release of Palmer, to throw the same kind of
passes, virtually all of them on the perimeter, down the sidelines
or long, slow-developing out patterns?
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst doesn't move well, either, yet there he was
running plays in the last minute off play-action with Stanford
selling out to crush the pocket. Why not throw in some shotgun
formations, which would give Van Raaphorst time and better
visibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use the shotgun,'' said Hackett. Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of why USC still can't seem to stop
any kind of running game. Stanford's netted 160 Saturday, and it
did its best work on its gamewinning touchdown drive, with nine
rushes among 14 plays on a 55-yard drive that, on a day of big
plays and quick strikes, took 6:38 off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett had all of the answers, of course. This was the other
sad sight. His post-game discourse was clinical, like that of an
attending surgeon who just watched someone else lose a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting tired of these,'' he said. ``When you fumble, when
you throw interceptions, when you shank punts, when you miss field
goals ...''
</P>
<P>
   This was entirely consistent with Hackett's comments this week,
when he publicly called out the seniors for a lack of leadership.
Those comments showed little compassion or sensitivity for the very
small group of seniors who start, like Gibson, the everloyal Chad
Morton and Wendrell Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter Saturday asked Hackett why he doesn't seem to
accept much of the responsibility for the losses, Hackett bristled
and belittled the question and questioner.
</P>
<P>
   We're spoiled, of course. For years, standup coaches like Terry
Donahue and John Robinson rarely pointed fingers at the players,
even when it might have been warranted. Robinson's second tour at
USC was messy, but he still went out on his shield. To do so would
have been a breach of family.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett may not understand family. What he does understand is
that by blaming the seniors, who are as good as gone anyway, he
shifts blame to the guy who recruited the seniors, Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The shotgun may not be in Hackett's arsenal, but he runs a great
mis-direction. From now on, let's call him Blackjack Paul Hackett.
</P>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reggie Jackson won the right to be called Mr. October
for his post-season exploits. Orlando Hernandez might be Mr.
October, the Sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez permitted one hit in seven innings, striking out 10,
and the Yankees rallied for four runs in the top of the eighth
inning, defeating Atlanta and Greg Maddux, 4-1, in Game 1 of the
World Series Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' David Cone will face Kevin Millwood of the Braves
in Game 2 on Sunday night. Atlanta's Tom Glavine, who had been
scheduled to pitch Game 1, was scratched after he came down with a
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking their 25th World Series title, the Yankees are winning
in the post-season with even greater efficiency than they did last
year, when they took 11 of 13 games en route to the championship:
they have won eight of nine games this year.
</P>
<P>
   The only hit off Hernandez in his seven innings was a home run
slugged by Chipper Jones in the fourth, and Maddux shut out the
Yankees into the eighth, holding that 1-0 lead. Maddux had been the
winning pitcher in the last shutout of the Yankees in the World
Series, in Game 2 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Brosius rolled a single through the left side of the
infield, his third hit, leading off the eighth. Yankees Manager Joe
Torre decided to forgo the bunt and sent Darryl Strawberry to
pinch-hit for Hernandez, and Maddux walked him. Chad Curtis ran for
Strawberry, and there were runners on first and second and nobody
out. The potential tying and leading runs were on base, and now
Torre called on Chuck Knoblauch to bunt the runners along.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch pushed a bunt between the onrushing Maddux and the
charging first baseman Brian Hunter. As Knoblauch sprinted toward
first, Hunter tried to recover, gloved the ball and dropped it, and
Hunter was charged with an error. Bases loaded, nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter fell behind, no balls and two strikes, took a close
pitch for a ball and then slammed a single through the left side of
the infield, all runners advancing a base and Brosius' run tying
the game. Maddux walked off, and the left-hander John Rocker
relieved to pitch to Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who had done so poorly against left-handers this year,
got ahead in the count, 3-1 _ one of Rocker's errant pitches had
bounced against the backstop and returned directly to catcher Eddie
Perez, great fortune for the Braves _ and then muscled a ball
through the right side of the infield. Curtis and Knoblauch raced
home, and by the time the Braves finished firing the ball around
the field, the Yankees led, 3-1, and had runners at second and
third.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with the bases loaded, Rocker walked the pinch-hitter Jim
Leyritz to force in the fourth run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front sacked Atlanta Saturday afternoon, the temperatures
dropping, the winds gusting. When Maddux strolled to the mound for
the top of the first inning, it was 49 degrees and there were
predictions that the temperature would drop near 40 by game's end;
the wind blew across the field, straight in from left-center field,
straightening the flag above Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Batboys scrambled to corral hot dog wrappers and napkins, and
the picture-glass windows on the private boxes shimmered in the
breeze. Yankees third baseman Brosius breathed warm air into his
glove. Infielders staggered and lunged to catch pop-ups. George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, donned the same outfit
as he did in Boston last weekend (baseball people are notoriously
superstitious): heavy parka with a hood, Yankees baseball cap. So
long as Maddux and Hernandez could comfortably grip the ball, they
were working in conditions highly favorable to them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez came into the game with an impeccable record in the
post-season: four victories in five starts, with the Yankees
winning his only no-decision, and a 0.97 earned run average in
October. The Braves had hit him hard in regular-season games the
last two years, but this was different. Hernandez seems to focus
deeply during big games, catcher Jorge Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his baseball pants high, with the long, dark blue socks,
and a long-sleeved shirt, Hernandez chewed gum ferociously on the
mound until he set his body to throw, and then his jaws would stop
and he stared at the hitters and began his delivery, which seemed
to confound the Braves from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez threw a two-strike slider to the first hitter he
faced, Gerald Williams, and Williams swung wildly, as if he swung
in the dark. Bret Boone anticipated an outside slider and was
overpowered when Hernandez zipped a 91-mile-an-hour fastball under
his hands. Jones looked for something on the outside corner with a
full count and Hernandez fooled him, too, throwing a fastball over
the inside corner. Three batters, three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out seven in the first three innings, and if
this seemed familiar to the Braves, you would not have blamed them:
the last time a Hernandez brother faced them in the post-season, in
1997, Livan Hernandez struck out 15 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque made one serious mistake in the first three innings,
with one of his fastballs to Ryan Klesko _ who had been 5 for 5 in
his career against Hernandez _ and the Atlanta slugger hammered the
ball to right field. A home run, on a summer day. But when his
drive met the stiff wind, his drive lost, dying and falling into
the glove of O'Neill in right.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to the dugout, Klesko glanced over his shoulder
toward right field, disbelieving, and he appeared to mutter aloud
to teammates as he returned his bat to the rack:  &UR; You've got to be
kidding me. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, were having the same sort of success
against Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, here to be introduced as part of baseball's
All-Century Team on Sunday, lounged on the Yankees' bench before
the game and remembered how, two days after Don Larsen's perfect
game in the 1956 World Series, Johnny Kucks arrived at Ebbets Field
to find a baseball resting in the heel of one of his baseball
spikes, left there by the coach Frank Crosetti. That is how Kucks
learned how he was to start the deciding game of the World Series
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had a similar experience. Glavine, scheduled to pitch
Game 1, was beset by a virus and called Maddux late Friday night
and told him he would probably not be able to pitch. Torre, the
Yankees' manager, learned of the switch Saturday afternoon, when a
teen-age clubhouse attendant relayed the Braves' lineup from
Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox, mentioning _ oh, by the way _ that
Glavine was sick.
</P>
<P>
   The change really made no difference, Knoblauch said before the
game, because after watching both pitchers for years on cable
television, the Yankees were going to be just as familiar with
Maddux as they were with Glavine. Hopefully, Knoblauch said, ``we
can get his pitch count up by the fifth or sixth inning, and he
won't be around that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux threw seven pitches in the second inning, 11 in the
third, eight in the fourth; he was around far longer than the
Yankees would have preferred, throwing strikes, sinking his
fastball, throwing it inside to left-handers and running it back
over the inside corner of the plate. He did this to right-handers
as well, his fastball appearing to be outside, out of reach, until
it darted over the outside fringe of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two runners reach scoring position in the first
three innings, but Maddux struck out Bernie Williams with Jeter on
second in the first inning, and after Brosius reached second in the
third inning, Knoblauch popped out and Jeter grounded to second.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out Boone to open the fourth, and after falling
behind one ball and no strikes to Jones, Hernandez tried again to
pound an inside fastball past the probable National League most
valuable player. But Jones would not cooperate, turning and
launching the ball down the right-field line; Jones stood at home
plate and watched until he was sure the ball would curl on the
inside of the foul pole. It was his first home run since Sept. 23,
the first run of the World Series, the first hit for the Braves _
and the only hit Hernandez would allow.
