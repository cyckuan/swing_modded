Japan's second remote satellite docking attempt fails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A second remote docking experiment between two
Japanese satellites in outer space failed Friday morning, a month
after the first attempt succeeded, Japan's space agency said.
	   But technicians at Japan's National Space Development Agency
will try to dock the satellites again later Friday, said agency
spokeswoman Akiko Suzuki.
	   Friday's failed attempt came after the satellites docked after
briefly separating at a maximum distance of two meters (6.6 feet)
on July 7.
	   That experiment marked the first ever such outer space maneuver
carried out via remote control from Earth. The two satellites were
hooked up before being launched into space last November.
	   It is hoped that such remote-controlled docking can be used to
ferry supply shipments via unmanned craft to the space stations of
the future.
	   The two satellites _ ``Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi''
(altair) _ were named after two stars which cross each other on
July 7 each year.
	   On Friday, the satellites were successfully separated at an
altitude of 550 kilometers (341 miles) above Earth beginning around
3:00 a.m. (1800 GMT Thursday), Suzuki said.
	   About 90 minutes later, they were about 520 meters (1,706 feet)
apart, keeping that distance during a 15-minute rendezvous flight.
	   The Hikoboshi, using its laser beam, then began to approach the
Orihime. But the radar response was soon lost, Suzuki said.
	   After that, the Hikoboshi went into an automatic safety flight
mode via computer programs built in to avoid collisions, she said.
	   ``There was a shaking in part of the Hikoboshi and a slight
vibration in the other at the approach stage,'' Suzuki said.
	   Later, the two satellites moved into stable flight about 2
kilometers (1.24 miles) apart, she said.
	   Suzuki said technicians planned to try and link up the two
satellites after 7:00 p.m. (1000 GMT) Friday, with signals
transmitted from Earth.
	   Japan is spending 310 billion yen (dlrs 2.15 billion) to build
four modules for the International Space Station, a joint project
with the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency
scheduled for completion in 2003.
	   The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science also plans to
send a probe to the Moon next year and to explore a nearby asteroid
early in the next millennium.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombians hopeful that a new president
might attain peace were inundated Thursday by images of freshly
filled body bags, wounded soldiers on stretchers and grieving
relatives.
	   A far-flung rebel offensive ahead of Andres Pastrana's swearing
in Friday as president has shown just how strong the leftist
insurgents have become and how difficult it will be to make peace.
	   In fighting that tapered off Wednesday, guerrillas from the two
largest rebel factions set off bombs in cities and towns, attacked
oil pipelines and a hydroelectric dam and hammered army and police
bases in about half the country with rockets, mortars and grenades.
	   The government said 71 soldiers and police were killed and 85
wounded by rebels of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, and the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN. Another 100 security-force members were missing, and
198 rebels had been killed, it said.
	   Giving sharply different figures, a FARC spokesman said in a
radio interview Thursday evening that rebels killed at least 143
soldiers and police, and took 133 as prisoners. Only 15 guerrillas
died, said the rebel spokesman, Alfonso Cano.
	   In the most devastating fighting, rebels overran an important
southern anti-narcotics base in Miraflores, killing or dragging
away dozens of soldiers and police as possible bargaining chips.

China to release detained dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident detained last month in a
crack down following the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton was
to be freed Friday, dissidents in exile said.
	   Lin Hui was to be released Friday morning from a detention
center in the eastern city of Hangzhou, according to a statement
citing family members.
	   Lin was among 12 dissidents detained last month in a crackdown
on a would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party, founded
to challenge the ruling Communist Party.
	   Human rights groups say Wang Youcai, a main party organizer,
remains in custody and is to be indicted soon. Wang, Lin and
another activist, Wang Donghai, announced the formation of the
China Democracy Party on June 25, the start of Clinton's nine-day
China tour.
	   Authorities refused to let the group register, as required by
law. At least a dozen persons linked to the party were detained,
and all but Wang Youcai have now been released.
	   On Thursday, a Hong Kong-based human rights group said that
nearly 100 democracy campaigners would risk arrest by marching
through two cities next week to demand the release of detained
activists.
	   The activists in Hangzhou and the central city of Changsha
applied for parade permits from police, according to the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China.
	   More than 90 people pledged to join in the marches even if
permission is refused, said Lu Siqing, the center's founder and
spokesman.
	   Chinese police routinely turn down applications for protest
marches, and the penalty for parading illegally can be heavy.

Singapore soccer league slashes pay for coaches, players and staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ With an economic downturn threatening the
survival of Singapore's soccer league, officials have slashed
salaries for players, coaches and administrative staff as sponsors
pull out, the head of the league confirmed Friday.
	   The 20 percent pay cut takes effect immediately, and includes
all employees of the S-League, including chief executive officer
Chris Chan.
	   ``The league is in dire straits now,'' Chan told a newspaper
published Friday. ``Whether we like it or not, this is something
that we have to do for the long-term good of the S-League.''
	   Stung by the economic downturn, corporate and private sponsors
for the league's 11 clubs have begun to reduce their financial
support.
	   ``The clubs rely on goodwill from the sponsors for survival,''
Chan told The Associated Press. ``Because of the economic
situation, sponsors are feeling the pinch, so we've reached a stage
now where some of the clubs are having difficulties meeting up with
their expenses.''
	   Major corporate sponsors typically give 300,000 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 172,000) to a club, while the combined contribution
from smaller sources often exceed that amount. The league itself
subsidizes each club with 400,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 230,000).
	   Chan noted that every S-League team has seen some sponsors pull
out already, and many are now facing delayed payments or reduced
support from their major sponsors.
	   Compounding the problem, attendance at local matches has dropped
significantly this year due to greater interest in the World Cup.
	   Since wages for players and coaching staff constitute about 80
to 85 percent of a clubs' expenses, it was the logical target for a
cost-cutting exercise, he added.
	   One club, Balestier Central, expects a shortfall of about
400,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 230,000). The team's chairman, S.
Thavaneson, told The Straits Times that companies in Singapore
``have retrenched workers and implemented salary cuts ... football
clubs should be no exception.''
	   The salary cuts are expected to save clubs about 160,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 92,000) a year. Average budgets per club
are about 1.2 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 690,000).

Philippine president says he is unlikely to stop first execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Friday
he is unlikely to stop the Philippines' first execution of a
criminal since the restoration of the death penalty in 1994.
	   Estrada acknowledged that many of the more than 600 people who
have been sentenced to death are poor. But he said the first man
scheduled to be executed, Leo Echegaray, a poor carpenter who raped
his stepdaughter, did not commit his crime out of poverty.
	   ``It would have been different if he had killed someone during a
robbery because his family was going hungry,'' said Estrada, who
was elected in May. ``But this was not because of poverty. This was
an act of an animal.''
	   A lower court convicted Echegaray of raping his 10-year-old
stepdaughter in 1994. In 1996, the Supreme Court upheld the lower
court's decision.
	   In 1997, the highest court affirmed its earlier decision, saying
Echegaray ``must be permanently prevented'' from repeating his
crime. It later said he could be executed by lethal injection
between Feb. 27 and Aug. 27, 1998.
	   In February this year, however, it stopped a lower court from
fixing a specific date until the Supreme Court has ruled on a
petition by Echegaray's lawyers questioning the constitutionality
of execution by lethal injection.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty, but a law
that took effect in January 1994 restored it for 13 ``heinous
crimes'' including rape, murder and drug trafficking.
	   Opponents say many people sentenced to death are unable to
afford good lawyers, and that the crime rate has not declined
despite the restoration of capital punishment.
	   Proponents, however, say the penalty has not yet sent its
message to would-be criminals because no one has been executed
since 1994.
	   The Supreme Court automatically reviews death sentences. The
president can stop executions by granting executive clemency or a
commutation of the sentence.

Obuchi outlines tax cuts, pledges reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In his first major policy speech before Parliament,
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi pledged on Friday to drive ahead with
tax cuts and new spending to revive Japan's sputtering economy.
	   Obuchi, who was elected premier last week, also said he would
push a plan to clean up the banks' bad debt mess, cut the
bureaucracy and put together a special economic strategy council.
	   ``I have a strong sense that without courage today, there is no
tomorrow _ mark my words,'' he told the first parliament session
under his rule. The session was opened Friday morning by Emperor
Akihito.
	   Japan's new government is under mounting pressure to deal with
the country's deepening recession. Unemployment hit a record-high
of 4.3 percent in June and the banking system is groaning under
piles of bad debt.
	   In a further sign of economic weakness, the head of Japan's
Economic Planning Agency on Friday said he will issue a report next
week showing that the country's finances are worsening.
	   ``The economy is clearly floundering,'' Taichi Sakaiya told
reporters.
	   Obuchi's forcefully worded speech broke little new ground from
statements he and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa have made since
the new government was put together last week after Obuchi's
confirmation in Parliament.
	   But the new prime minister, who took office with approval
ratings hovering around 30 percent, vowed to implement the tough
reforms and policies needed to turn the economy around.
	   ``Our Cabinet's fate depends on us putting out country back on a
recovery path in the next couple of years,'' Obuchi said in a
speech interrupted several times by applause.
	   A major plank in Obuchi's program is a package of six bills
setting up a ``bridge bank'' system to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running while bad loans and remaining assets are
sold.
	   The legislation is needed to clean up the estimated 80 trillion
yen (dlrs 551 billion) in problem loans weighing down Japanese
financial institutions. Most of the debts are left over from the
collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   ``In order to revive Japan's economy, we must first of all ...
settle the bad debts held by financial institutions,'' he said,
calling for speedy implementation of the plan.
	   The plan faces problems, however, in Parliament, where Obuchi's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party only holds a majority in the lower
house.
	   Some critics object to the use of 11 trillion yen (dlrs 75.9
billion) in public funds to bail out the banks. Others say the plan
needs to be strengthened to allow weak banks to fail, or that it
should include penalties for directors of mismanaged banks.
	   Another major piece of Obuchi's program is tax cuts aimed at
getting thrifty consumers to spend more money and give strapped
corporations more funds to keep afloat.
	   Obuchi said he planned about 4 trillion yen (dlrs 27.6 billion)
in personal tax cuts, moving to reduce the maximum combined
national and local income tax bite from 65 percent to 50 percent.
	   The prime minister also said he wanted to cut the corporate tax
rate from 46.3 percent to 40 percent, comparable to rates in other
countries. That was expected to amount to nearly 3 trillion yen
(dlrs 20.7 billion).
	   The other half of the stimulus is a planned 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 69 billion) in new spending. Obuchi said he would temporarily
suspend a new fiscal austerity to allow the deficit spending.
	   Obuchi said he wanted to put in place a program to cut the
number of bureaucrats by 20 percent over the next decade and slash
government spending by 30 percent.
	   He also announced he had formed a special economic council
reporting to the prime minister, and offered that as a sign that
he, not the powerful bureaucracy, would be running the economy.
	   ``On the final policies, I myself will decide them and implement
them,'' he declared.

Suu Kyi tells military to leave her home, government refuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi has demanded the military government remove its unit of
security personnel stationed at her home, but the government has
refused, military and opposition sources said Friday.
	   The dispute over the security detail represents the deepest
deterioration in relations between the 1991 Noble Peace Prize
winner and the military government since it released her from six
years of house arrest in July 1995.
	   It was also an ominous sign of increasing tensions immediately
before the tenth anniversary of the Aug. 8, 1988 nationwide
democracy uprising which the military crushed with brutal force,
killing and jailing thousands.
	   A statement from Suu Kyi's political party, the National League
for Democracy, said Suu Kyi sent a letter to the government on July
31 saying she no longer needed the services of the security unit
and asked for its removal.
	   ``Since the military unit did not leave her compound, Aung San
Suu Kyi told the commanding officer of the unit, Zaw Htoo Aung, at
11:10 a.m. on Thursday to withdraw the security personnel,'' the
NLD statement said.
	   ``She told the captain that their presence would be treated as
trespassing if they did not move out by 11:30 a.m.,'' the party
statement said.
	   Upon her release in 1995, Suu Kyi asked to government to keep
some of her former guards at her Rangoon compound as security,
something her party members were not trained to do.
	   NLD members said the move demonstrated a willingness to work
with the government, while at the same time placing her safety in
the hands of the military. If she was harmed, the military would
bear the blame.
	   The security detail, however, has functions other than
protecting the Nobel laureate.
	   Diplomats in Yangon told the Associated Press in Bangkok that
the detail is under the command of military intelligence and that
its duties include reporting on Suu Kyi and her colleagues's
activities.
	   The detail sometimes bars supporters and journalists from
meeting her, follows her when she attempts to leave her home, and
has at times stopped her, the diplomats said.
	   That includes three incidents during July when Suu Kyi attempted
to travel outside Yangon to meet party members and was prevented.
During the last incident, party leaders said the authorities
manhandled Suu Kyi and dragged her back home against her will.
	   The incident drew condemnations of the military government from
the international community.
	   Col. Hla Min, the military government's spokesman, said Suu
Kyi's request to withdraw the unit ``has to be seriously considered
from various angles.''
	   He said that Suu Kyi's calls for a tourism boycott of Myanmar,
economic sanctions against the regime and an end to foreign
investment until democratic reforms have taken place had affected a
lot of people.
	   ``We cannot rule out that those affected people may try to hit
back at any given time,'' Hla Min said.
	   Suu Kyi and her party members have been physically attacked
twice by mobs, in November 1996 and about a month ago in front of
her home.
	   Many analysts in Rangoon blamed the government for staging the
attacks, but said Suu Kyi's security unit was not involved and had
tried to stop the violence.
	   The analysts attributed the attacks to harder-line elements in
the military who disagree with what they perceive as the
intelligence services's soft handling of Suu Kyi.

Last Thai dictator says massacre general will be new army chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's last dictator has predicted
that a general who allegedly ordered troops to fire on democracy
protesters in 1992 will be the new army commander in chief, local
papers reported Friday.
	   The candidacy of the controversial general for the top army post
has already sparked protest statements from pro-democracy
organizations, and if he were appointed, street demonstrations
would surely follow, democracy activists have said.
	   The prediction was made by Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, who led the
last coup d'etat in 1991 and then became the target of democracy
protests a year later when he attempted to have himself named prime
minister although he hadn't been elected.
	   The army suppressed the protests with violence in which more
than 40 civilians were killed, more than a hundred wounded and more
than 40 are still missing. However, Suchinda was forced to resign.
	   The commander in charge of the units that opened fire was Gen.
Chainarong Noonpakdi.
	   Suchinda made the prediction on Thursday when army brass and
prominent businessmen and journalists visited him at home on his
66th birthday.
	   Among the visitors was Chainarong.
	   ``Ah, you're the potential commander in chief of the Royal Thai
Army, aren't you,'' Suchinda was quoted as saying to Chainarong by
Khao Sod (Fresh News), a Thai-language daily.
	   ``I wish you success. I congratulate you in advance,'' Suchinda
said.
	   Top army brass will name the next army chief. Their decision,
however, must be approved by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is
also serving as the first civilian defense minister in 22 years.
	   It is unlikely that Chuan, who opposed military rule, would
approve Chainarong's appointment, and some members of his Cabinet
have been quoted as saying they will resign in protest if he does.
	   The military, however, may attempt to appoint Chainarong anyway,
according to some analysts, to strike back at Chuan for his
attempts to reform the armed forces and put them under more direct
civilian control.
	   Thailand has had more than a dozen military coup d'etats since
the end of World War II, but current army chiefs insist those days
are over.

Report: Drug-related crimes on the rise in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Drug-related crimes, particularly those
related to amphetamine abuse, are on the rise in Bangkok, local
papers reported Friday.
	   Samer Intharasak, the chief justice of the Criminal Court of
Southern Bangkok, said the pace of drug-related crimes his court
was dealing with was rapidly outpacing last year's total, according
to The Nation newspaper.
	   ``There have already been more than 2,000 amphetamine cases in
the first six months of his year compared to 2,904 all of last
year,'' Samer was quoted saying by The Nation.
	   Criminal cases involving heroin, however, were decreasing, he
said.
	   The Thai government regards amphetamine abuse as the most
serious drug problem facing the country today and has increased the
penalties for dealing the drug to be as severe as those for
trafficking in heroin.
	   This week, a Thai court sentenced an amphetamine dealer to
death.

Japan's new premier calls for improved relations with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's new prime minister said Friday he wanted to
sign a peace treaty and normalize relations with Russia by 2000 and
planned a trip to Moscow in the fall.
	   In his first policy speech before Parliament since becoming
prime minister last week, Keizo Obuchi said he would continue the
progress in ties with Moscow begun under the previous
administration.
	   ``I will do my utmost to completely normalize Japan-Russian
relations by strengthening ties in various fields and by concluding
a peace treaty by 2000,'' said Obuchi, a former foreign minister.
	   The premier also said he would like to visit Russia sometime in
the fall.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Kamura is reportedly planning a trip
to Moscow in September. Within the past year, then-Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held two
summits.
	   The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II, mainly because of a disagreement over control
of the Kuril Islands, claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the
end of the war. Relations between the two countries, however, have
improved in recent years.

Philippine budget deficit declines in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' budget deficit for
the first seven months of the year declined to 13.57 billion pesos
(dlrs 323 million) from 24 billion pesos (dlrs 571 million) a month
earlier, the government said Friday.
	   The government hopes to limit the budget deficit to 40 billion
pesos (dlrs 952 million) by the end of the year. It says, however,
the deficit could balloon to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion)
unless spending is cut and revenue collection is improved.
	   Strong revenue collections in July were largely responsible for
the narrowing of the trade deficit.
	   Government revenue totaled 53 billion pesos (dlrs 1.3 billion)
in July, while expenditures reached only 43 billion pesos (dlrs 1.0
billion). It was the first time since February that the government
has posted a surplus on a monthly basis.
	   For the first seven months, revenues totaled 272.0 billion pesos
(dlrs 6.5 billion) while expenditures reached 285.6 billion pesos
(dlrs 6.8 billion).
	   A slowing of economic activity because of the Asian financial
crisis has reduced corporate profits and therefore tax payments,
while a drop in imports has lowered customs collections.

Vietnam devalues its currency once again

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam devalued its currency Friday for
the third time since October, continuing a go-slow tactic in an
effort to avoid the precipitous plunges that have ravaged other
Asian countries.
	   The move brought a little relief to battered exporters and
generally was welcomed by bankers, who have said for month that the
dong is overvalued.
	   ``It's a step in the right direction, but we feel there is some
more to go,'' said David Pollitt, manager of treasury for Hong Kong
Bank in Ho Chi Minh City.
	   But the tinkering also caused some immediate confusion and
little movement in a stagnant market where most people are hoarding
U.S. dollars in anticipation of further cuts.
	   And it sparked jitters in a region already nervous about the
recent falls in the Japanese yen, which in turn have put pressure
on China to devalue the yuan.
	   The devaluation, effectively 7 percent, was a two-step move that
began late Thursday when the State Bank of Vietnam narrowed the
trading band within which the dong can trade from 10 percent to 7
percent.
	   On Friday morning, the bank set the target rate at 12,998 dong
to the dollar from 11,815 on Thursday, making the new floor 13,907.
The dong has been trading at the low end of the trading band since
before the Asian economic crisis started 13 months ago.
	   Vietnam has been under simultaneous pressure to open its markets
to attract more foreign investment and devalue its currency to give
a boost to export-dependent industries, especially after nine
months of bad weather hit crops hard.
	   But it has kept a tight rein on the dong, fearing the increased
costs of much-needed imports and payments on its dollar-denominated
foreign debt.
	   At the time that the state bank widened the trading band from 5
percent to 10 percent last October, the floor rate was 11,734. The
new floor means the effective devaluation since then has been 18.5
percent _ 24 percent if a move in March 1997 is added in.
	   At the same time, some regional currencies have lost 40 percent
or more of their value.
	   Complaints have been rising from exporters, many of which have
been shedding jobs as their sales shrink. Other industries,
particularly the nearly dormant domestic auto industry, have been
calling for protectionist measures.
	   Rice exporters in particular were cautiously optimistic after
Friday's action _ even though it will make imported fertilizers
more expensive _ because demand on the world market has been
increasing.

China to release detained dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with group planning signature drive against labor
camps in grafs 3-5; edits to conform, trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident detained last month in a
crackdown following the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
be freed Friday, dissidents in exile said.
	   Lin Hui was to be released Friday morning from a detention
center in the eastern city of Hangzhou, according to a statement
citing family members.
	   Meanwhile, a group of nine dissidents based in Shanghai said
they were requesting police permission to hold a campaign beginning
next Wednesday to collect signatures for a petition demanding the
abolition of labor camps, according to a Hong Kong-based human
rights group.
	   Police are allowed by law to send detainees to labor camps for
up to three years without trial. The group argues that such
practices, and the brutality experienced by inmates at such camps,
violate China's constitution, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Given the government's ban on public displays of dissent,
authorities were unlikely to allow the petition drive.
	   Lin, the dissident due to be released, was among 12 people
detained last month in a crackdown on a would-be opposition group,
the China Democracy Party, founded to challenge the ruling
Communist Party.
	   Human rights groups say Wang Youcai, a main party organizer,
remains in custody and is to be indicted soon. Wang, Lin and
another activist, Wang Donghai, announced the formation of the
China Democracy Party on June 25, the start of Clinton's nine-day
China tour.
	   Authorities refused to let the group register, as required by
law. At least a dozen persons linked to the party were detained,
and all but Wang Youcai have now been released.
	   On Thursday, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said that nearly 100 democracy
campaigners would risk arrest by marching through two cities next
week to demand the release of detained activists.
	   The activists in Hangzhou and the central city of Changsha
applied for parade permits from police, who routinely turn down
applications for protest marches.
	   Although the penalty for parading illegally can be heavy, more
than 90 people pledged to join in the marches even if permission is
refused, said Lu Siqing, the center's founder and spokesman.

Tanker spills oil after striking shoal near Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore-registered tanker bound for Hong
Kong struck a shoal and spilled 400 tons of oil into waters near
Singapore on Friday, state-run television reported.
	   The Ocean Gurnard, carrying 12,500 tons of marine gas oil that
is used to power ships, hit the edge of Singapore's South Ledge
Shoal and sustained damage to three cargo tanks, the report said.
	   The television report quoted the Maritime and Port Authority as
saying, the spill was ``expected to evaporate very quickly. ...
There is no danger of pollution to the mainland of Singapore and
the beaches.''
	   An official of Ocean Tanker, managers of the vessel, told The
Associated Press the damage was slight and arrangements were being
made to transfer the remaining oil into another tanker. Operations
manager Patrick Chua said the accident occurred about 30 miles (48
kilometers) east of Singapore, but would not confirm the cause of
the spill or other details.
	   ``Currently everything is under control,'' Chua said. ``We're
just waiting for the divers' report once they finish their
underwater inspection.''
	   The maritime authorities said the vessel was in stable
condition, salvage and oil-spill response companies went to the
scene and booms were laid around the ship to contain the spill,
according to the television report.
	   Maritime authorities did not answer their phones and did not
immediately return calls from the AP.

Mexican officials agree to give information on bank bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Aides to President Ernesto Zedillo promised
Thursday to give a rebellious Congress information about a bank
bailout fund whose debts officials want to absorb into the national
debt.
	   But in a meeting with congressmen that lasted more than six
hours, the aides balked at a key demand: to release the names of
major debtors whose defaulted loans account for most of the dlrs 65
billion fund.
	   The appearance by Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida and
Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria was part of a campaign to win
approval of a financial package the government says is essential to
Mexico's economy.
	   Opposition party congressmen, who hold a majority, have insisted
on a study of the bailout fund known as Fobaproa before agreeing to
accept it as part of the national debt under the government
proposal.
	   Some want to exclude at least some of the bad loans they say
were either fraudulent or the result of insider trading by wealthy
businessmen.
	   Treasury Prosecutor Ismael Gomez Gordillo said after the meeting
that the government would not release the names of key debtors.
	   The government maintains it cannot fully divulge Fobaproa
records because of a bank secrecy law. Critics say the law is not
relevant.
	   ``It doesn't apply because Fobaproa is not a bank,'' said Mexico
City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
	   Earlier this week, the PRD released a list of businesses whose
multimillion dollar loans were allegedly absorbed by the government
under Fobaproa.
	   The fund bought up bad loans from banks after the 1994-95 peso
devaluation, which sent interest rates soaring and led to default
on many loans.
	   ``There is a great possibility that there are criminals there or
individuals who may have engaged in different types of illegal
actions,'' said Francisco Jose Paoli of the conservative National
Action Party.
	   Mexico's Roman Catholic Church joined the debate on Thursday.
	   Speaking at a church conference in Toluca, Bishops Jose Andres
Corral and Onecimo Cepeda called on the government to disclose full
information about the bank bailout, saying those who benefited from
it must pay their debts to society.

Early election could ensure win for Malaysian prime minister

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ruling party may order
early general elections due to its fear that worsening economic
misery could blemish its popularity.
	   The ruling coalition's general secretary recently proposed the
possibility of a vote before Parliament's term expires in April
2000.
	   Mohamed Rahmat, who also is information minister, told the 14
parties of the Barisan National coalition to prepare themselves for
an early vote. The Barisan National has governed Malaysia since
independence from Britain in 1957.
	   ``During these economically difficult times, we have to retain
the present government,'' Mohamed said.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has declined to comment on the
date for elections. While some opposition leaders say elections
could be called as early as October, others predict they will be
next April.
	   Elections have rarely changed governments in Malaysia. Most
leadership changes have been a result of internal power wranglings
within the dominant party within the coalition, the United Malays
National Organization.
	   But as this Southeast Asian nation slips toward its worst-ever
recession and braces for widespread job losses and rising food
prices, Mahathir probably sees his grip loosening, said the
nation's main opposition leader, Lim Kit Siang.
	   Mahathir, 73, is criticized for imposing sweeping controls on
the media and blaming outsiders for the country's economic woes.
But he also is widely credited for transforming an introspective
society and an agricultural economy into a modern nation with
towering skyscrapers and a global voice.
	   Although there is little doubt Mahathir's party will return to
power, a poor showing could severely damage the leader's
credibility and embolden others to challenge him.
	   Last month, the government unveiled a sweeping plan to push a
recession-bound economy toward growth, and leaders might want to
capitalize on any early successes, Chandra said.
	   The plan calls for holding down unemployment and bankruptcies by
pumping government funds into construction projects, civil works
and debt-ridden banks afraid to lend to companies teetering on the
brink of collapse.
	   According to government estimates, there will be more than
500,000 unemployed by the end of this year in a nation that, for
the last decade, imported workers to fill domestic positions.
	   ``The other indication that something is brewing is the (prime
minister's) schedule'' Chandra said. Mahathir has kept a grueling
schedule of late, criss-crossing the country, meeting provincial
leaders and making public speeches.
	   Opposition politicians say early elections would not catch them
by surprise.
	   ``We factored to have it soon,'' said Subky Latif, a spokesman
for the Islamic Party of Malaysia. ``The longer the government
waits, the more its influence will decrease.''

Currency pressures, Japan's policies dominate downward market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Nervous Asian markets fell again Friday due to
pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and fears China might be forced to
devalue its currency.
	   Traders had also awaited details from Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's policy speech in Tokyo. Speaking in the middle of
Asia's trading day, Obuchi pledged to go through with tax cuts and
new spending to revive Japan's economy.
	   Also, officials said they would issue a report next week saying
Japan's financial situation was worsening.
	   But much of the regional focus was on Hong Kong, where interbank
interest rates rose and the stock market slipped again. After
hitting a 3 1/2-year low at the close of Thursday trading, the Hang
Seng index continued to fall, dropping 198 points, or 2.7 percent,
to 7,056.34 by midday.
	   Markets are concerned about a chain reaction of currency
weakness and devaluation: continued slumping of the Japanese yen
inducing China, despite repeated denials, to devalue its yuan, thus
exerting pressure on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Hong Kong has huge currency reserves with which to protect its
dollar, the last freely convertible currency in Asia that has not
depreciated because of Asia's economic turmoil.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority moved this week to prop up the
currency against speculative attacks.
	   After two rough days, interbank rates bounced around Friday _
opening higher on fears of more speculative attacks, then easing
because of thin trading, and rising again after Vietnam devalued
its currency.
	   Dealers said that even though the Vietnamese currency is not
freely convertible, it takes little to unsettle such nervous
currency markets.
	   Asian markets were hit hard earlier in the week after the Dow
Jones industrial average fell nearly 300 points on Tuesday,
inciting fears that the U.S. economy might begin slowing.
	   Many Asian countries see demand for their exports by a strong
U.S. economy as the lifeline they need to pull them out of a
13-month economic crisis.
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock index rose in early trading, and the
yen weakened slightly against the dollar.
	   Most currencies in Southeast Asia opened lower on fears over the
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar. Pressure was strongest
in the Singapore dollar, the most liquid currency in the region.
	   Philippine shares, already at a five-year low, plummeted another
3.1 percent in early trading, and the currency fell as well over
fears that China might be forced to devalue.
	   Both share prices and the baht currency were down in Thailand,
and Indonesia's rupiah weakened in early trading. In Malaysia, the
stock market opened mixed, while the ringgit currency was down on
fears over the Hong Kong dollar.

Peso falls on fears of Chinese devaluation; stocks decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Fears of a devaluation of the Chinese
yuan triggering another round of regional currency declines drove
the Philippine peso sharply lower against the U.S. dollar in
morning trading Friday.
	   Stocks also declined steeply, with the main index falling 2.2
percent to a new five-year low.
	   Heavy dollar buying on fears the peso would fall further pushed
the U.S. currency beyond the key level of 43 pesos, dealers said.
	   The dollar hit a high of 43.250 pesos in morning trading, its
highest level since late January. It averaged 42.817 pesos during
the morning session compared to 42.343 pesos on Thursday.
	   The dollar's record high this year was 46.500 pesos set Jan. 7.
	   Dealers said anxiety over a yuan devaluation, coupled with
continuing concerns over the Japanese yen, were expected to
continue pressuring the peso and other regional currencies.
	   The next major resistance point for the dollar was seen at 45
pesos.
	   A system of volatility bands to cushion sharp fluctuations in
the peso-dollar rate was abandoned earlier this year. ``The dollar
can go up to any point, trading won't be stopped,'' a currency
exchange official said.
	   The central bank has said it will only intervene in the currency
market in cases of extreme volatility.
	   Monetary authorities lost a costly battle to defend the peso
from speculative attack shortly after the Thai baht was devalued in
July 1997.
	   Since then, the central bank has been trying to replenish its
foreign reserves, which totaled dlrs 10.5 billion at the end of
June.
	   Traders said the weakening peso reverberated into the stock
market.
	   Preliminary figures showed the 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index declined 32.17 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,448.72,
its lowest level in more than five years. Friday's losses extended
a decline of 43.86 points on Thursday.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 8.01 points to 464.22 after
retreating 12.32 points on Thursday.
	   Decliners outnumbered gainers 96 to 18, with 40 issues
unchanged. Several major blue chips, including Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co., Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. and Manila
Electric Co., were among noticeable decliners.

Japan's new premier calls for improved relations with Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of foreign minister's name in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's new prime minister said Friday he wanted to
sign a peace treaty and normalize relations with Russia by 2000 and
planned a trip to Moscow in the fall.
	   In his first policy speech before Parliament since becoming
prime minister last week, Keizo Obuchi said he would continue the
progress in ties with Moscow begun under the previous
administration.
	   ``I will do my utmost to completely normalize Japan-Russian
relations by strengthening ties in various fields and by concluding
a peace treaty by 2000,'' said Obuchi, a former foreign minister.
	   The premier also said he would like to visit Russia sometime in
the fall.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura is reportedly planning a trip
to Moscow in September. Within the past year, then-Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held two
summits.
	   The two countries have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II, mainly because of a disagreement over control
of the Kuril Islands, claimed by Japan but held by Russia since the
end of the war. Relations between the two countries, however, have
improved in recent years.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices, afternoon dollar and bond
rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar traded higher against the yen
Friday on disappointment that Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
didn't introduce any new proposals to revive the economy in his
inaugural policy speech. Tokyo stock prices edged lower.
	   The dollar bought 145.23 yen in afternoon trading, up 0.30 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of
144.32 yen overnight.
	   The yen was also hurt by declines in other Asian currencies
against the dollar amid rumors China may soon decide to devalue its
yuan, dealers said.
	   In his speech, Obuchi outlined his plans for tax cuts exceeding
6 trillion yen (dlrs 41 billion) starting next year and an extra
budget of more than 10 trillion yen (dlrs 69 billion) this year.
But the proposals were no surprise as top policymakers have already
announced the measures over the last few weeks.
	   ``There weren't any especially new factors to react to,'' said
Yukihiko Hashimoto, senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank.
``Because there weren't any additional policies, there was some
dollar-buying and yen-selling.''
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices edged lower after
Obuchi's speech failed to dispel doubts about Japan's prospects for
recovery.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 47.05 points, or 0.30
percent, to close the session at 15,829.17 points. On Thursday, the
Nikkei index closed down 115.94 points, or 0.72 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section finished down 1.79 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,225.30.
The TOPIX closed down 8.69 points, or 0.70 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.195 percent from Thursday's close of
1.215 percent, driving its price up to 111.82 yen from 111.68 yen
Thursday.

Death toll in gas explosion rises to six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll in a gas explosion at an apartment
house in central Russia has risen to six, and several more victims
remained hospitalized Friday in critical condition, news reports
said.
	   The Thursday night explosion occurred in the village of
Novodmitrovka, in the central region of Nizhny Novgorod,
authorities told the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Three women and three children were killed by the blast, which
was apparently caused by a gas leak, officials said.
	   There were about 40 people living in the building, which was
destroyed by the blast, and even those that were not injured have
taken up temporary residence at a hospital, the reports said.
	   Gas explosions in apartment blocks occur periodically in Russia,
and are often blamed on poor maintenance.

peace deal
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from Ian Paisley and Conservative
Northern Ireland spokesman; UPPICKS graf 3 pvs

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The man who murdered the much-loved
great-uncle of Prince Charles _ the only member of the royal family
to be killed during the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict _ has
been freed under the controversial early release provisions of the
region's peace settlement.
	   Thomas McMahon was a serving a life sentence for the murder of
Lord Louis Mountbatten and four others who died when the Irish
Republican Army blew up his private boat in Mullaghmore, western
Ireland, in August 1979. He was released from prison Thursday night
under the terms of the Good Friday peace agreement.
	   The move has outraged some politicians. The Rev. Ian Paisley,
leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, a hard-line Protestant
party, said the release was ``outrageous.''
	   ``And the speed with which the government of the Irish Republic
are releasing IRA prisoners shows that there is no rhyme or reason
behind it,'' he told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio
interview Friday. ``These are prisoners who have carried out the
foulest of deeds and as far as the general public in Northern
Ireland is concerned, I think they will recognize that this has
nothing to do with justice _ this is entirely a political
decision.''
	   Andrew Mackay, spokesman on Northern Ireland for Britain's
opposition Conservative Party, told the BBC that ``what is worrying
is that so many IRA prisoners are being released even though the
IRA are still keeping up their punishment beatings in the north and
are showing no signs whatsoever of complying with the (weapons)
decommissioning commission.''
	   The handover of terrorist weapons also is part of the peace
deal.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The man who murdered the much-loved
great-uncle of Prince Charles _ the only member of the royal family
to be killed during the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict _ has
been freed under the controversial early release provisions of the
region's peace settlement.
	   Thomas McMahon was a serving a life sentence for the murder of
Lord Louis Mountbatten and four others who died when the Irish
Republican Army blew up his private boat in Mullaghmore, western
Ireland, in August 1979. He was released from prison Thursday night
under the terms of the Good Friday peace agreement.
	   The move has outraged some politicians. Peter Robinson of the
Democratic Unionist Party, a hard-line Protestant party, said the
release was ``outrageous.''

	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez hit his 33rd homer,
increasing his major league-leading RBI total to 118, and John
Burkett pitched 6 1-3 innings as the Texas Rangers beat the Boston
Red Sox 7-4 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory.
	   Gonzalez's 429-foot (131-meter) solo homer in the seventh was
just the fifth ball hit into the second deck in left field in the
five-year history of The Ballpark in Arlington.
	   Mo Vaughn hit his 28th and 29th homers for the Red Sox, who had
won eight of their last 10.
	   Burkett (7-11) gave up solo homers to Vaughn and Mike Stanley,
but the Red Sox managed just four other hits against him, all
singles. Burkett allowed three runs, struck out two and walked
three.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth and struck out Vaughn, the
potential tying run, to end the game.
	   Boston starter Bret Saberhagen (11-6) allowed five runs and
eight hits over six innings, struck out three and walked one in his
first loss since June 20.

IBM to stop IOC connection after Sydney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ IBM will not renew its contract as the
International Olympic Committee's technology sponsor after the
Sydney 2000 Games, an Australian IBM official said Friday.
	   IBM, which has been involved with the international Olympic
movement for 40 years, was widely criticized for problems with the
results service at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
	   Greg Ellevsen, IBM Australia's manager for corporate
communications, told Sydney radio station 2UE that the company was
parting ways with the IOC because the costs were becoming too high.
	   Jim Sloman, acting chief executive of the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), said Friday the committee
was confident that IBM would deliver outstanding information
technology for the 2000 Games, as it did at the Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan earlier this year.
	   ``IBM has today assured SOCOG that its staff will continue to
provide the same level of excellence, dedication and determination
to make the Sydney Olympic Games an outstanding success,'' Sloman
said. (djp)

Ranger arrested in fatal shooting of Bedouin man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Bedouin was shot dead early Friday in
Israel's Negev desert, and an Israeli park ranger was arrested in
the slaying, police said.
	   The ranger was to appear in court Friday in the southern town of
Beersheba, and police said they would ask that he be held pending
formal charges.
	   There have long been tense relations between Bedouin tribes and
the Nature Reserves and National Parks Authority, which enforces
land-use rules including grazing and water rights.
	   Police spokesman Armand Peretz said the shooting occurred after
the ranger spotted a pickup truck driving in an area used by the
army as a firing range. He tried to flag it down but the truck
drove off at high speed, Peretz said.
	   The ranger then fired what were meant to be warning shots,
striking the driver, Salman Abu Jelidan. He died shortly afterward
at a first-aid station at the community of Mitzpe Ramon.
	   Large tracts of the Negev are shared by Israel's nature reserves
system and the army. Access to the firing ranges is banned.

Davenport, Williams advance in Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hingis-Kruger match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Top-seeded Martina Hingis beat South
Africa's Joannette Kruger 6-1, 6-3 on Thursday night to advance to
the semifinals of the Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   ``I came into the match very confident,'' said Hingis, who beat
Kruger 6-0, 6-0 in the Lipton Championships in March. ``She's not
as fast as other players, so it gives you time to get into your
game.''
	   Hingis, the 17-year-old Swiss star preparing for her U.S. Open
title defense, reached the semifinals for the ninth time in 11
tournament this year. She has won four tournaments this year,
including the Australian Open.
	   On Saturday, she will face the winner of Friday's quarterfinal
match between third-seeded Venus Williams and Mary Pierce. Williams
overpowered Chanda Rubin 6-3, 6-2 in a second-round match Thursday.
	   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and eighth-seeded Nathalie
Tauziat also won second-round matches to set up a quarterfinal
meeting. Davenport beat Lisa Raymond 6-1, 6-4, and Tauziat defeated
Amy Frazier 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
	   Davenport rolled through the first set against Raymond, but fell
behind 4-2 in the second. She held serve in the seventh game en
route to the victory.
	   ``I think that was a big game,'' said Davenport, coming off a
three-set victory over Williams on Sunday in the final of the Bank
of the West tournament. ``Obviously, she was on a roll there and I
was struggling.''
	   Williams was not pleased with her play.
	   ``I think I was a little bit inconsistent today, making some bad
choices at times,'' she said. ``Chanda is a strong player and makes
good decisions. ... I just think that we weren't both on top to our
games.''

Economists optimistic on Singapore economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Amid a flurry of pessimistic predictions for
Singapore's economy, some economists have issued a more promising
forecast for the city-state's performance, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   Economists at the National University of Singapore predict mild
growth of 2 percent this year, above the government's more modest
estimate of 0.5 to 1.5 percent expansion in 1998, The Straits Times
reported.
	   Using a new economic model that links regional and global
economies and relies on historical data, the university's
Econometric Studies Unit also had good news for the region,
predicting ``a faster recovery for the Asian economies than
generally expected.''
	   The group's head, Tilak Abeysinghe, argued that the current
healthy outlook in the world's richest countries _ notwithstanding
Japan _ bodes well for recovery in Asian countries, which rely more
on these economies outside the region.
	   But he said that their forecast for Singapore's economic
performance assumed some second quarter growth in Japan, which is
struggling through its worst recession in half a century.
	   The unit forecasts a contraction in Singapore's gross domestic
product in the third quarter of 1998 but ``there will be a pick up
in the fourth quarter'' so long as Japan posts growth of 1.3
percent in its second quarter.
	   Those figures have not yet been released by the Japanese
government.
	   ``It is important to emphasize here that the course of
Singapore's growth over the next three quarters depend critically
on the second quarter performance of the Japanese economy,''
Abeysinghe said.

Japan's premier says will not visit militarist shrine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The new premier said Friday he will not visit a
shrine for war dead _ including convicted war criminals _ to mark
the anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender, a news report
said.
	   The Yasukuni Shrine is a memorial to the 2.4 million Japanese
service people who died in wars from 1853 until the end of World
War II, and is widely considered a symbol of Japanese militarism.
	   Keizo Obuchi, elected prime minister last week, was quoted by
Kyodo News agency as telling reporters outside his residence Friday
that, ``At the moment, I am not planning'' to go to Yasukuni.
	   He added, however, that individual ministers could decide for
themselves whether they wanted to go.
	   Despite protests by China, South Korea and other countries
invaded by Japan during the war, government officials often visit
the shrine to mark Japan's surrender on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   Obuchi's predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, drew angry criticism by
visiting the shrine in 1996. He decided not to visit the shrine on
the anniversary last year.
	   Before he became prime minister, Obuchi was an outspoken
supporter for state visits to Yasukuni. The shrine is controversial
because those honored there include executed war criminals. The
grounds include a war museum that houses a kamikaze plane.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka also said he will not
visit the shrine to avoid stirring criticism from China and other
Asian countries ahead of upcoming visits by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and South Korean President Kim Dae Jung.
	   ``We must be careful if we consider the political situation,''
Kyodo quoted Nonaka as saying Friday.

Mutiny 3, Fusion 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Steve Ralston and Alan Prampin scored
first-half goals as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the Miami Fusion 3-1
on Thursday night to snap a five-game home losing streak.
	   Jan Eriksson also scored for Tampa Bay (7-17), which moved a
point ahead of Miami (10-12) for fourth place in MLS' Eastern
Conference.
	   Frank Yallop, playing his 80th MLS game, picked up his first
career point with an assist on Ralston's 12th-minute goal. Paulinho
McLaren tied it on a penalty kick in the 34th minute, and Prampin
made it 2-1 in the 40th minute. Eriksson completed the scoring in
the 74th minute.
	   Carlos Valderrama practiced with the Fusion on Tuesday, but did
not travel with the team. He is expected to play Saturday against
New York-New Jersey. The midfielder was fined dlrs 10,000 after
refusing to participate in new coach Ivo Wortmann's first practice
session last month.

Report: U.S. State Department investigating Cambodian genocide
</HEADLINE>
project &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A U.S. State Department-funded
project set up to gather evidence of genocide carried out by
Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge guerrillas is being investigated
for financial improprieties, a Cambodian newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Cambodian Genocide Project, based at Yale University in New
Haven, Connecticut, is being investigated by the State Department's
Inspector General's office for alleged embezzlement and
mismanagement of funds, the English-language Phnom Penh Post
reported.
	   The Post, whose information was based on letters from third
parties concerning the case, said the investigation focused on the
program's director, Ben Kiernan of Australia.
	   Kiernan, according to a letter from U.S. Congressman Tom
Campbell to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, is being
investigated because he continued to draw his salary and exercise
control over fiscal and personnel matters while on a leave of
absence in January 1997.
	   The project was established in 1994 with a dlrs 500,000 grant
from the U.S. government. Its mission is to collect documents and
testimony about the activities of the communist Khmer Rouge when
they held power in 1975-79 and were responsible for the deaths of
as many as 2 million Cambodians.
	   A major goal is to organize evidence should major Khmer Rouge
figures ever face trial for crimes against humanity.
	   Kiernan has faced controversy before as the project's director,
largely because of political disputes over Cambodia.
	   Right-wing critics have said he was an inappropriate choice for
the position because of his sympathies for the Khmer Rouge in the
mid-1970s, and then his support for the more moderate communist
regime that replaced the Khmer Rouge in 1979.
	   The project has been criticized in some circles for guarding its
information too closely. U.S. investigators have alleged that the
group withheld clues into the fates of dozens of Americans still
listed as missing-in-action from the Vietnam War.
	   Kiernan could not be immediately reached for comment on the
Post's report.

Currency pressures, Japan's policies dominate downward market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of currency trading and
interest rates in Hong Kong, closing prices in Tokyo, Manila and
Taipei &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Nervous Asian markets fell again Friday due to
pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and fears China might be forced to
devalue its currency.
	   Traders, who also had been awaiting details of Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's policy speech in Tokyo, found little to
affect the market. Obuchi reiterated that he would go ahead with
tax cuts and new spending to revive the region's largest economy.
	   Those moves, although positive, largely were factored into
market calculations already.
	   Also, market sentiment was hurt by reports that Japanese
officials would issue a report next week saying Japan's financial
situation was worsening.
	   Much of the regional focus was on Hong Kong, where interbank
interest rates rose and the stock market slipped again. After
hitting a 3 1/2-year low at the close of Thursday trading, the Hang
Seng index continued to fall, dropping 198 points, or 2.7 percent,
to 7,056.34 by midday.
	   Markets are concerned about a chain reaction of currency
weakness and devaluation: continued slumping of the Japanese yen
inducing China, despite repeated denials, to devalue its yuan, thus
exerting pressure on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Hong Kong has huge currency reserves with which to protect its
dollar, the last freely convertible currency in Asia that has not
depreciated because of Asia's economic turmoil.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority moved this week to prop up the
currency against speculative attacks. Hong Kong media said at least
four U.S. investment banks were believed to be heavily selling Hong
Kong dollars, both on the spot and futures markets.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is pegged tightly to the U.S. dollar, and
has been trading close to 7.75 to the U.S. dollar, a level seen as
a trigger point for intervention.
	   After two rough days, interbank rates bounced around Friday _
opening higher on fears of more speculative attacks, then easing
because of thin trading, and rising again after Vietnam devalued
its currency. Overnight rates moved from 5.5 percent late Thursday
to 7.5 percent at midday Friday.
	   Dealers said that even though the Vietnamese currency is not
freely convertible, it takes little to unsettle such nervous
currency markets.
	   Asian markets were hit hard earlier in the week after the Dow
Jones industrial average fell nearly 300 points on Tuesday,
inciting fears that the U.S. economy might begin slowing.
	   Many Asian countries see demand for their exports by a strong
U.S. economy as the lifeline they need to pull them out of a
13-month economic crisis.
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock index rose in early trading, but
ended the day 47.05 points lower at 15,289.17, its fifth
consecutive loss. The yen fell against the dollar.
	   Most currencies in Southeast Asia were trading lower on fears of
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar. Pressure was strongest
in the Singapore dollar, the most liquid currency in the region.
	   Philippine shares, already at a five-year low, closed down
another 2.2 percent, and the peso currency fell as well over fears
that China might be forced to devalue.
	   Both share prices and the baht currency were down in Thailand,
and Indonesia's rupiah weakened in early trading. In Malaysia, the
stock market opened mixed, while the ringgit currency was down on
fears over the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Taiwan's market rebounded after 10 consecutive losses to close
58.28 points higher at 7,530.02.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A bus toppled 1,000 feet (300 meters)
down a ravine in northern Pakistan Friday, killing 30 people,
including 17 soldiers returning from leave.
	   Eleven others were seriously injured, according to news agency
NNI, which quoted doctors at the local hospital and villagers who
had rushed to the rescue.
	   The accident occurred near Shinkiyari, about 150 kilometers
(about 90 miles) north of Islamabad. The bus had been headed from
an area just north of Shinkiyari to Rawalpindi, near Islambad, when
it plunged off the road at a sharp curve.

Tanker spills oil after striking shoal near Singapore
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with direct attribution, additional details, spill was
within Singapore waters

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore-registered tanker bound for Hong
Kong struck a shoal and spilled about 400 tons of oil in Singapore
waters Friday.
	   The Ocean Gurnard, carrying 12,500 tons of marine gas oil used
to power ships, hit the edge of the South Ledge Shoal about 50
kilometers (30 miles) east of the coastline, damaging three of the
10 cargo tanks, the Maritime and Port Authority said.
	   The spill was expected to evaporate very quickly, the authority
said in a statement.
	   ``There is also no danger of pollution to the mainland of
Singapore and the beaches,'' it said.
	   Singapore navy and coast guard vessels were dispatched to the
scene to assist and monitor the situation, the statement added.
None of the 21 crew members were injured.
	   An official of Ocean Tanker, managers of the vessel, said the
damage was slight and arrangements were being made to transfer the
remaining oil into another tanker, probably Friday night after the
Maritime and Port Authority had completed its on-site
investigation.
	   ``Currently everything is under control,'' operations manager
Patrick Chua said. ``We're just waiting for the divers' report once
they finish their underwater inspection.'' He would not confirm the
cause of the accident or other details.
	   The maritime authority said the vessel was in stable condition
and there was no danger of it sinking. Salvage and oil-spill
response companies were on the scene and booms had been laid around
the ship to contain the spill.

South Korean chip makers to temporarily stop production again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ For the third time this year, South
Korea's major memory chip makers plan to halt production
temporarily this month in an attempt to boost prices in a glutted
market.
	   Production cutbacks in June and July by the three big Korean
firms and some Japanese chip makers helped increase prices, but not
enough to cover production costs.
	   A 64-megabit Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chip sold for
dlrs 8.80 in early August, up from dlrs 7.60 in July. Producers say
the price has to reach dlrs 10 to cover costs.
	   ``By reducing production, we can boost the world's chip prices.
If necessary, we will take a similar measure again later,'' said
Kim Byong-tak, a spokesman for LG Semicon.
	   Samsung Electronics Co., the world's biggest computer memory
chip maker, said it will stop production lines Aug. 16-22.
	   Hyundai Electronics Co., the nation's No. 2 chip maker, will
stop production Aug. 13-20, while LG Semicon, South Korea's third
largest chip maker, will halt production Aug. 10-16.
	   The production cutbacks will decrease their August output by 20
to 25 percent, they said. The three firms normally produce 53
million 16-megabit DRAM chips and 25 million 64-megabit DRAM chips
a month, supplying 40 percent of the world's memory chips.
	   Japanese and U.S. chip makers have charged that South Korea's
rapid expansion of facilities resulted in the drastic price cuts.
South Korea put the blame on such new market entries as Taiwan.
	   Memory chips store operating instructions for electronic
products such as personal computers.
	   In 1997, South Korea exported dlrs 17.5 billion worth of
semiconductors, or 12.8 percent of the country's total exports.

Opposition groups urge Myanmar people to overthrow regime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi Standoff

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Groups opposed to the military regime
in Myanmar urged people Friday to be alert to support pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a looming showdown with the government.
	   The appeals came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of a
nationwide uprising against military rule on Aug. 8, 1988, that was
eventually crushed by the army. As many as 3,000 people are
believed to have died. The date _ 8-8-88 _ resonates in a country
where many people believe strongly in numerology.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has meanwhile
demanded the government remove a unit of security personnel posted
at her home in the Myanmar capital, Yangon, but the government has
refused, military and opposition sources said.
	   The anniversary comes two weeks before a deadline set by Suu Kyi
for the ruling State Peace and Development Council to finally
permit a parliament elected in 1990 to convene. The military
refused to relinquish power after the opposition won.
	   The National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, as
Myanmar is also known, issued an appeal Friday supporting Suu Kyi
and her National League for Democracy in getting the military to
restore civilian rule, last seen in 1962.
	   The coalition, representing parliamentarians who have fled into
exile, urged ``the entire people to participate, unanimously on a
nationwide scale, in the effort to have the parliament convened by
Aug. 21, by holding fast to the spirit of the Four-8 movement.''
	   The National Council of the Union of Burma, an umbrella group
for ethnic minorities, some of whom have fought for more autonomy
for 50 years, issued a similar call and said it had launched an
undefined program called Operation People's Power 21.
	   ``Nowadays, it is not for the people to fear the SPDC military
dictators, but it is for the military dictators to cravenly fear
the people,'' the council said.
	   Despite anticipation that the anniversary could trigger fresh
unrest, the Myanmar capital has been quiet. There has been almost
no visible increase in security forces.
	   Suu Kyi, who has been confined to her home for most of the past
decade, raised the profile of her struggle two weeks ago by trying
to visit supporters in a provincial town.
	   Her car was stopped outside the capital and a six-day standoff
with authorities ensued. In the end, the security forces seized the
car and drove Suu Kyi back home. She is recovering from dehydration
but vows to keep struggling to force a political dialogue.
	   Saturday's anniversary has led human-rights groups to appeal for
the release of some of the estimated 1,200 political prisoners and
for the international community to review policy toward the
country.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said Friday that the chief
players in the country's drama _ the military, the Suu Kyi-led
opposition and the ethnic groups _ need to communicate.
	   Human Rights Watch called for international coordination that
would set specific, verifiable human rights improvements for the
country to follow that would lead to an incremental restoration of
economic and diplomatic relations.

China evacuates 330,000 people ahead of last-ditch measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with plan open floodgates or blow up
dike to divert the Yangtze river, 104 dikes abandoned in Hubei, new
figures on the levels of swollen rivers. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China was evacuating 330,000 people Friday from
land along the raging Yangtze River that officials were preparing
to sacrifice to flooding to safeguard cities downstream.
	   With the Yangtze at record levels and threatening to rise
further, officials were preparing to divert floodwaters along a
section of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river described
as the most dangerous. Under the plan, floodgates on the Yangtze
would be opened to divert water away and, if that failed, a dike
would be blown up, officials said.
	   The decision whether to deliberately flood towns and villages at
the Yangtze's Jingjiang section, in badly flooded central Hubei
province, would require the approval of China's State Council, or
Cabinet.
	   ``The worst moment of the year's flood control efforts is
probably coming,'' the official newspaper China Daily quoted
unidentified Yangtze River officials as saying.
	   The crisis was precipitated by a surge of floodwaters headed
down river Friday that officials feared could cause sodden levees
weakened by weeks of rain and floods to collapse.
	   To reduce pressure on the levees that protect cities and
millions of people downstream, officials have already begun
abandoning smaller dikes and were preparing for the possibility of
deflecting waters into the Jingjiang flood diversion area, where
more than 500,000 people live.
	   The last time the Yangtze was this high was in 1954, during
floods that forced officials to divert water three times. More than
30,000 people died in the flooding that year.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas. The floods have affected
240 million people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees,
the government says.
	   More than 330,000 people in the Jingjiang flood diversion area
south of Hubei's Shashi city were being moved out, said Chen
Zhichao, director of the Jinjiang Flood Diversion Management
Bureau.
	   Of those, 230,000 had already been moved and another 100,000
should be moved out by Friday evening, officials said. The
remainder of the 520,000 people who reside in the area live on high
or protected ground and are safe, Chen said.
	   He said they were waiting for an order from the State Council
before diverting the river.
	   If the order was given, officials first would raise floodgates
to deflect water from the Yangtze to the diversion area. If that
proved insufficient, a three-kilometer- (1.86 mile- ) long dike
that borders the river would be blown up to let the floodwaters
through, said Chen.
	   One method already being employed to lower the Yangtze was
breaking open or deliberately abandoning smaller, secondary dikes,
flooding farmland and taking pressure off the major embankments
that hem in the river.
	   Hubei, one of worst-hit provinces that declared a state of
emergency Thursday, has already sacrificed at least 104 levees,
forcing 270,000 people to move and inundating swathes of farmland,
the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Friday.
	   Among the cities protected by these ``selfless'' acts was Wuhan,
with 7 million people, the newspaper said.
	   Should officials decide to divert the Yangtze at Jingjiang too,
then Gong'an county, south of Shashi, would bear the brunt of the
flooding, the China Daily said.
	   ``The Jingjiang section is facing the worst flood challenge in
its history,'' the newspaper said, quoting Ge Shouxi, a Yangtze
River chief engineer.
	   The Yangtze at Shashi reached a record 44.68 meters (147.4 feet)
Thursday, a centimeter (0.4 inches) higher that in 1954's deadly
floods, the China Daily said. As the fourth flood crest this year
bore down, the river was expected to rise Friday to 44.95 meters
(148.3 feet), the paper said.
	   Officials first disclosed that they were considering diverting
the Yangtze at Jingjiang at a government news conference Thursday.
	   ``The possibility of flood diversion cannot be discounted,''
said Zhao Chunming, a deputy director at the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters. ``Preparations have already been
made.''
	   ``We will try our best not to divert water unless it is
absolutely necessary,'' he added.
	   However, other officials at the news conference were more
hopeful.
	   ``According to the situation now, it doesn't look like we need
to divert water,'' said Zhou Wenzhi, a vice minister of water
resources. ``But we have to make these preparations.''

Dengue fever epidemic in Cambodia escalates, 144 children dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Dengue fever cases in Cambodia
surged in the past month and have caused the deaths of at least 144
children so far this year, health officials said Friday.
	   ``It is a national epidemic, we have a very serious situation
here,'' said Dr. Stefan Hoyer, dengue and malaria officer for the
U.N.'s World Health Organization.
	   The mosquito-borne disease's symptoms of fever and muscle pain
are usually temporary for adults but sometimes fatal for small
children.
	   Because damp weather creates favorable breeding conditions for
mosquitoes, dengue cases regularly peak during the rainy season,
which officially starts in Cambodia in July.
	   The situation may be exacerbated this year by the El Nino
weather phenomenon, whose late rains and warm weather caused an
unusual dry season outbreak in early January.
	   The last dengue epidemic in Cambodia was in 1995, when there
were over 10,000 dengue cases and 450 deaths.
	   The spread of dengue from urban to rural areas has exacerbated
the situation in Cambodia, ``because of the remoteness of many
places and the difficult access to health facilities in areas where
dengue is erupting newly,'' said Hoyer.
	   He said that as a result, the fatality rate in Cambodia is
higher than in most other countries.
	   Hoyer praised the quick reaction of the international community,
which has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid for
insecticide spraying, health education and epidemic control.

Sydney and Australia's southeast coast buffeted by wild weather
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Powerful storms lashed Australia's
southeast coast Friday, causing minor floods, choppy seas and
chaotic traffic conditions in the nation's largest city.
	   Gale force winds and heavy rains buffeted Sydney and the coast
of New South Wales state, raising floodwaters which threatened
homes and farms in the northwest of the state while darkening skies
in the city, authorities said.
	   The northwest town of Wee Waa was isolated by floodwaters and
nearby Walgett was only accessible to emergency vehicles, an
emergency services spokesman said.
	   In Bathurst, a regional center in the state's central west,
residents prepared for floodwaters to threaten homes and stores.
	   In Sydney, severe weather conditions caused by a major low
pressure system centered due-east of the city, dumped more than
eight inches (214 millimeters) of rain in the 24 hours to midday
Friday, Bureau of Meteorology spokesman Bruce Buckley said.
	   Winds gusting to speeds of 57 mph (90 kph) blasted through the
Sydney metropolitan area about noon Friday, he said.
	   Two people were killed when a bus collided head-on with a truck
on a highway south of Sydney, police said.
	   Emergency personnel were battling pouring rain and savage winds
to rescue 48 other people trapped inside the wreckage, a Goulburn
police spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. One
person was extricated from the wreck late Friday and was in a
critical condition in hospital, he said.
	   Waves up to 20 feet (6 meters) high pummeled the coast south of
Sydney, with authorities closing beaches to swimmers and surfers
and issuing coastal erosion alerts to local residents.
	   The wild weather was expected to continue until Saturday
afternoon, although the rain was expected to ease by Sunday.
	   ``People should stay indoors if they can; they should watch
flash flooding when driving around and with these severe winds;
watch out for branches on roads when driving,'' Buckley said.
	   ``There could also be power blackouts, phones going out and many
more road accidents than usual,'' he said.

Tamil newspaper employee held for alleged link with Tamil Tigers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police have detained a fourth employee
of an ethnic Tamil newspaper for his suspected links with the
outlawed Tamil Tiger separatists, an official said Friday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to
elaborate on the allegations against K. Manikkavasagar, who worked
in the printing department of the Virakesari newspaper.
	   Three other employees of the respected Tamil-language daily _
two journalists and a former astrology columnist _ were detained
earlier on suspicion of being involved in a plot to assassinate
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Sunday Times newspaper has
reported.
	   The assassination was to have been carried out during a Hindu
cultural festival in the capital, Colombo, last month. The
president canceled her engagement on the advice of the police.
	   The plot was uncovered during the interrogation of a Tamil woman
arrested in May. She also led police to the Virakesari newspaper.
	   Rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka's
minority Tamils, saying the island's Sinhalese majority
discriminates against them. Their secessionist war has killed at
least 54,000 people since it began in 1983.
	   M.G. Wenceslaus, managing director of the Express Newspaper
(Ceylon) group, which owns Virakesari, said the paper's work force
was too large to ensure that none of its employees had any links to
the Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
	   The Tigers have been blamed for assassinating President
Ranasinghe Premadasa and several government ministers, as well as
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India.

Demonstrators attack Singapore as `arrogant'

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dozens of Malaysians protested
outside the Singapore High Commission Friday, accusing its
government of being ``indifferent and arrogant'' and demanding the
leaders of both countries meet.
	   The two Southeast Asian neighbors have been at each other's
throats for weeks, each accusing the other of bad faith and
reneging on deals. The latest flap is over a disputed border post.
	   About 75 members of the Indian Progressive Front, a party
belonging to Malaysia's ruling Barisan National coalition, handed
officials at the Singapore diplomatic compound a letter calling on
the Singapore leaders to ``come to their senses'' and put an end to
the border-post conflict.
	   Shouting,``We give you water, you spit on us!'' and ``Singapore
don't be arrogant,'' the mostly ethnic Indian demonstrators said
they were reflecting the views of all Malaysians ``against the
indifferent and arrogant attitude of the Singapore government.''
	   The latest flare-up was provoked by Singapore's relocation of
its immigration, customs and quarantine post Saturday, against the
wishes of its neighbor to the north.
	   Malaysia has condemned the move and kept its immigration
officers at the original Tanjong Pagar railway station bordering
Singapore's financial district in the south of the island, a move
Singapore has deemed unlawful.
	   Malaysia says it should be allowed to keep its immigration
control at the original site because it owns the land under an old
treaty.
	   Responding to claims that the relocation was sudden, unilateral
and deliberately timed when Malaysia was facing an economic crisis,
Singapore said the intention to shift the checkpoint was announced
back in 1989.
	   On Wednesday, the Singapore Home Affairs Ministry declared that
allegations of Singapore's arrogance and insensitivity over the
issue are ``what Malaysia usually says when it has no logical
arguments to offer.''
	   ``Unsubstantiated allegations from Malaysia, blaming everything
on Singapore, are nothing new,'' the ministry said.
	   The increasingly acrimonious squabble has aggravated
progressively souring relations between the two nations.
Longstanding unresolved issues include land disputes and the sale
of Malaysian water, on which Singapore depends heavily.
	   But the nations are also partners in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a regional body that is supposed to
promote a unified force in Asia and the rest of the world.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday cautioned
the city-state not to take his people for granted.
	   ``We are peace-loving but don't take us for granted,'' he warned
Singapore, which depends on Malaysia for more than half the water
its citizens use.

Bosnia struggles to care for youngest victims of its ethnic war

	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The playground echoed with
laughter and the clamor of children chasing a ball. For these
children of war, laughter has been largely missing from their
lives.
	   The 30 children at a newly renovated orphanage here -- one of
seven in the Muslim-Croat part of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- are among
thousands whose lives were unhinged by the 1992-1995 Bosnian war or
the turmoil that followed.
	   A total of 2,824 children are officially registered as orphans
by the Muslim-Croat Federation. Another 546 are so registered in
the Bosnian Serb half of the country. Their parents were either
killed in the war or abandoned them.
	   Most live with adoptive parents, either in Bosnia or abroad. The
U.N. organization UNICEF says 486 live in orphanages in the
Muslim-Croat Federation and another 120 in such facilities in the
Serb-ruled territory.
	   But hundreds, perhaps thousands, more are believed roaming the
streets of cities and towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina, begging,
stealing or foraging through garbage cans to survive.
	   Bosnian authorities have redirected international reconstruction
funds to renovate old orphanages and build new ones.
	   ``The question of the future of those children is difficult,''
Sabaheta Kadic, 35, head of the Mostar orphanage, said. ``Everybody
is running around to solve his own problems, and nobody cares about
these kids.''
	   For the time being, however, a relatively small percentage of
Bosnian children have been saved thanks to the few orphanages that
have been opened.
	   Among the children playing here under a blistering summer sun
were the three Gacanica sisters -- Dzenana, 12, Dzenita, 11, and
Dzana, 9. For more than a year, they had been living in a dung
heap.
	   ``It is very nice here, I'm sleeping on a bed and have many
friends,'' Dzana says and giggled. ``I would like to stay here
forever.''
	   Because they were Muslims, the sisters and their parents were
driven from their home in a Croat district of Mostar in 1993 and
took refuge in a shelled-shattered building in the Muslim quarter
in the east of the city.
	   The building was repeatedly struck by shell fire and Dzana
suffered severe burns. Since the city was occupied by Spanish U.N.
peacekeepers, she was evacuated to Spain for medical treatment.
	   In the meantime, wartime stress broke up their parents' marriage
and the remaining two sisters were abandoned. They started begging
and scrounging through garbage heaps to survive.
	   Charity organizations ultimately tracked down Dzana and reunited
the three sisters, said Alma Hozo, a local social worker. The girls
ended up in the orphanage and a bank account has been opened for
contribution for Dzana's further medical treatment for her burns.
	   In September, the three will all return to school.

Philippine Muslim extremists free kidnapped Chinese after 18 days

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim extremists have released a
kidnapped Chinese man after 18 days of captivity in the southern
Philippines, the military reported Friday.
	   Xiao Liuliu, 24, was handed over by his captors on Thursday in
Panlima Estimo in Sulu province following negotiations by local
officials, Southern Command spokesman Lt. Col. Horacio Lapinid
said.
	   Lapinid said no ransom was paid but a token amount of money was
given to Xiao's captors, members of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, for
``board and lodging.''
	   The rebels were allowed to escape after they released Xiao.
	   Xiao went to Sulu to arrange his wedding with Joselyn Ismael, a
Muslim woman he met in Japan.
	   Xiao, whose hometown in China has not been identified, was
talking with Joselyn's father at their home when 10 men dragged him
to a waiting vehicle, police said.
	   The Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for numerous ransom kidnappings
and other attacks in the southern Philippines.

Coke enlisting Indian film stars in new ad campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Taking a cue from its chief rival, the
Coca-Cola Co. has signed up a leading Indian film star to boost
sales of its flagship beverage, which has been targeted by radical
Hindu groups promoting Indian self-reliance.
	   Karishma Kapoor will feature in Coke's print and television
advertisements in India over the next two years, said George
Samuel, president of Bharat Coca-Cola South-East Pvt. Ltd., the
Indian subsidiary of the Atlanta-based company.
	   ``Their products, like our films, are favorites the world
over,'' said Kapoor, a fourth-generation actress who is currently
India's hottest star.
	   Coke would not reveal how much it is paying Kapoor, but company
sources said it was around 10 million rupees (dlrs 235,000).
	   Pepsi-Cola ads already feature popular Indian film stars, such
as Aamir Khan and Shahrukh Khan.
	   The Indian government that came to office in March adopted a
policy of promoting local goods and discouraging foreign investment
in new consumer products, but it has not hindered companies already
operating here.
	   Still, nationalist groups allied with the governing Bharatiya
Janata Party have burned trucks delivering Coke and Pepsi. They
have imposed a virtual ban on high-profile multinationals like the
soft drinks companies, which they say represent a new kind of
corporate imperialism and use their financial muscle to drive local
companies out of business.
	   Many government offices and university cafeterias no longer
stock Coke and Pepsi.

Rights group says two separatist activists missing in Indonesian
</HEADLINE>
province

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two separatist activists in the remote
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya have been missing since violent
pro-independence protests last month, a human rights group said
Friday.
	   The families of the two protesters said uniformed men abducted
them on July 7, one day after a demonstration, according to the
Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation in Jayapura, Irian Jaya's capital.
	   Abdurrahman Upara, a chief lawyer at the foundation, said his
office is investigating whether security forces were involved.
Police and military had no comment Friday.
	   In a separate case, a son-in-law of former President Suharto,
Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, and a dozen other soldiers are being
investigated in the abductions earlier this year of anti-government
activists.
	   Upara identified the missing protesters in Irian Jaya as
Fransiscus Gerson Gawe, 29, and Wilhelmus Rumpaisum, 63, both from
Biak, an island off the northern coast of New Guinea island.
	   Since the authoritarian Suharto resigned in May, demands for
independence in Indonesia's easternmost province have grown. There
are also separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and East
Timor.
	   In Irian Jaya last month, two protesters and one police officer
were killed in clashes with protesters in Jayapura and other towns.
	   One protester was killed in Biak, where police broke up a crowd
of hundreds of people who were guarding an independence flag. About
20 people are still in police custody in Biak, Upara said.
	   Indonesia took over Irian Jaya, which comprises the western half
of New Guinea, in 1963 from the Dutch. Six years later, people in
the territory formally chose integration with Indonesia through a
U.N.-sponsored vote.
	   Since then, a small rebel band called the Free Papua Movement
has been fighting for independence in the territory.

Ranger arrested in fatal shooting of Bedouin man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Bedouin man was shot dead early Friday in
Israel's Negev desert, and an Israeli park ranger was arrested in
the slaying, police said.
	   The ranger was to appear in court Friday in the southern town of
Beersheba, and police said they would ask that he be held pending
formal charges.
	   There have long been tense relations between Bedouin tribes and
the Nature Reserves and National Parks Authority, which enforces
land-use rules including grazing and water rights.
	   The Israeli government has actively sought to settle the
traditionally nomadic Bedouin in fixed communities, but some have
resisted. In the Negev and elsewhere, tribes have been forcibly
uprooted from land where they had lived for years but to which they
have no formal claim.
	   Police spokesman Armand Peretz said Friday's shooting occurred
after the ranger spotted a pickup truck driving in an area used by
the army as a firing range. He tried to flag it down but the truck
drove off at high speed.
	   Peretz said the ranger then fired what were meant to be warning
shots, striking the driver, Salman Abu Jelidan, who died shortly
afterward at a first-aid station at the nearby desert community of
Mitzpe Ramon.

Chief executive to focus on helping small business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Facing growing public dissatisfaction, Hong
Kong's chief executive is planning to focus on aiding small
business with the hope of turning the ailing economy around, a
newspaper said Friday.
	   The Hong Kong Standard quoted an unidentified government source
as saying Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had decided to make
assistance to small- and medium-sized businesses the top item in
his policy address, which will be delivered to the legislature in
two months.
	   Tung, a 61-year-old businessman, took over from the last British
colonial governor when China reassumed control over Hong Kong in
July 1997.
	   The report came as new evidence emerged of Tung's decreasing
popularity.
	   A new poll by the University of Hong Kong's Social Sciences
Research Center indicated that only 34 percent of those questioned
supported Tung's re-election in the year 2002. Forty percent were
opposed, and the rest had no clear opinion. The margin of error was
2 percent.
	   The chief executive is not chosen by direct, popular vote, but
by an 800-member election committee. The term of office is five
years.
	   Much of Hong Kong's economy is made of small businesses, and the
Standard quoted its source as saying Tung believes he can make a
major impact by focusing on them.
	   The economy is in recession, and the territory has been hit this
week by a string of bad economic news. The stock market has fallen
sharply because of a string of disappointing midyear earnings
reports from major corporations, and there are fears of a
speculative attack on the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the
U.S. currency.
	   Officials also announced this week that the economy shrank 2.8
percent in the first three months of the year. They say they expect
the second quarter to be worse.
	   In June, the government announced steps to combat economic
problems, including credit guarantees for small businesses. But the
government says there is relatively little that it can do without
intervening too far in the economy.
	   Hong Kong also has been plagued by a string of other troubles
including threats to its food supply and a bad start for its
showcase dlrs 20 billion airport.
	   The chief executive has come under criticism for being too
distant, and not providing leadership in times of crisis. Tung has
acknowledged the criticism, but says it is not his style to be more
visible.

Police guard temple as devotees pray
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GELUGOR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police stood guard outside a Hindu
temple in northern Malaysia Friday as thousands of devotees prayed,
leaving out a traditional ritual that was canceled after threats of
violence.
	   Penang state police advised the temple to scrap its annual
fire-walking ceremony, a form of penance by devotees, after
pamphlets were circulated in the town threatening violence during
the festivities and harm to the temple.
	   Friday's celebrations at the nearly century-old Veeramakaliamman
Devasthanam Temple were the culmination of an annual week of
special prayers attended by the local community of ethnic Indians.
	   Police officers peered into cars at roadblocks on the route to
the temple and special combat-trained forces stood by listening to
walkie-talkies for any signs of trouble.
	   Temple officials said many people had stayed away from the
rituals because of fear of violence.
	   More than 6,000 devotees, mostly from families which had
migrated from southern India in the early 1900s, gather
traditionally to watch the fire-walking, which involves treading
over a 21-foot-long bed of smoldering firewood.
	   ``But this time we don't want to take a risk and open ourselves
to any unwanted incident,'' said M.K. Samy, chairman of the
temple's managing committee. He had advised people to arrive in
small groups and leave as soon as they had finished praying.
	   On Wednesday, Penang's police chief had asked the temple to
scale down celebrations because of the risk of religious violence.
	   State Police Chief Abdul Hamid Mustapha said the pamphlets, one
written for Hindus and the other for Muslims, were found in several
places in the state.
	   Memories of Hindu-Muslim violence are fresh in the memory of
local residents and authorities.
	   In March, thousands of Muslims marched toward a Hindu temple in
Penang, swinging wooden planks and hurling stones. The Muslims were
rankled by Hindu rites at the temple, saying too much bell-ringing
disrupted Muslim prayers. The Hindu temple has since been moved to
another site.
	   Penang's multi-ethnic community of 1 million people comprises
Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Christians. Hindus account for about
10 percent of Malaysia's 22 million people.
	   ``Chinese, Indians and Malays have been living harmoniously for
more than one century in Penang,'' said Samy. He said the threats
to the temple were an isolated incident and did not reflect any
widespread tensions between the ethnic groups.
	   ``These are threats from unknown persons,'' he said.

Anglican bishops slap U.S. church over women priests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS grafs 1-2, UPDATES with Jamieson quote in grafs 8-9,
adds background in graf 6 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ A resolution intended to reduce
discord among Anglican churches over the ordination of women has
drawn protests from female bishops in the United States.
	   The resolution, proposed by the Right Rev. Penny Jamieson,
bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, implicitly rebukes the U.S.
Episcopal Church for cracking down on four bishops who have refused
to permit women priests in their dioceses.
	   Bishops meeting at the Lambeth Conference on Thursday endorsed
the resolution, which says there should be ``no compulsion on any
bishop in matters concerning ordination and licensing.''
	   It disagrees with changes in canon law adopted last year by the
Episcopal Church, giving the recalcitrant bishops until the year
2000 to comply.
	   As a consultative body of the 70 million worldwide Anglican
community, the Lambeth Conference has no authority to override the
decision of any national church.
	   Although the resolution expresses disapproval it doesn't legally
affect the position of the U.S. bishops.
	   The U.S. church began ordaining women in 1976, and now has an
estimated 1,500 women priests _ about 10 percent of the total.
About half of the national churches within Anglicanism now ordain
women as priests and three, in the United States, New Zealand and
Canada, have consecrated women bishops.
	   Jamieson, one of 11 women bishops at the Lambeth Conference,
proposed the resolution as an attempt to balance opposing views in
the church.
	   ``It affirms and enables room for difference while explicity
promoting a culture of respect and courtesy,'' she said.
	   The text, worked out in meetings with a group of traditionalist
bishops, urged, ``courtesy, tolerance, mutual respect and prayer
for one another.''
	   ``While the language indeed, seems gracious, it contravenes the
ordination canons of the Episcopal Church, U.S.A., and, I believe
the discipline in the provinces of Canada and New Zealand,'' said
the Rt. Rev. Barbara Harris, bishop of Massachusetts, and first
female Anglican bishop.
	   The Rt. Rev Catherine Waynick, bishop of Indianapolis, also
opposed the resolution.
	   ``What sort of unity would we be able to sustain in our
worldwide communion if provinces were not able to articulate their
own internal disciplines for themselves on any given issue?''
Waynick said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Michael Scott-Joynt, bishop of Winchester, England,
said he supported the ordination of women but opposed any coercion
of opponents.
	   Every report of coercion ``makes it all the harder for the many
people in all our churches who are seeking to hold in the greatest
possible fellowship those who take differing views on the
ordination of women,'' he said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Ray Smith of Sydney, Australia, warned against
forgetting assurances which were given to traditionalists when
Anglican churches began ordaining women.
	   ``There is a danger of traditionalists being coerced against the
conscience to do certain things, to allow to certain things, or if
they cannot comply, to be forced out of the communion,'' he said.

Small bomb explodes outside radio station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A bomb exploded early Friday outside the
offices of a radio station in a southern Athens suburb, causing
damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The home made device, consisting of dynamite and a fuse,
exploded outside the entrance of the small Rhythm FM radio station,
located on the fourth floor of an apartment building, police said.
	   The blast caused serious damage to the office, which was empty
at the time.
	   Police are not considering the attack to have been
terrorist-related, authorities said.

Three women arrested for trying to force teen to work as geisha
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mother and two other relatives of a 16-year-old
girl have been arrested for allegedly forcing the teen to work as a
geisha and raise money for gambling, a police spokesman said
Friday.
	   The girl's mother, Keiko Ueno, 46; her sister, Miyuki Yamazaki,
27; and her aunt, Noriko Suzuki, 56, were arrested after handing
the girl over to a geisha house in Nagano, 179 kilometers (112
miles) northwest of Tokyo, said police spokesman Kazuya Saegusa.
	   The three women allegedly turned the girl over to the geisha
house on June 11 after borrowing 1 million yen (dlrs 6,900) from
its owners. The women told police they used the money to play
pachinko, a kind of pinball game in which prizes can be exchanged
for cash, Saegusa said.
	   But the girl, whose name was not disclosed because of her age,
fled the geisha house and returned home, Saegusa said. She later
sought help from police after her mother beat her.
	   The 16-year-old had lived most of her life in a foster care
facility until her mother took her home earlier this year. She was
returned to the facility after her mother's arrest, Saegusa said.
	   Geisha, with their colorful kimono and white-painted faces,
entertain in exclusive restaurants with singing, dancing and
conversation.
	   If convicted, the three women will face up to 10 years in
prison, or a fine up to 500,000 yen (dlrs 3,450).

Coal miners ease blockade on Russia's Sakhalin Island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Electrical power was returning to normal across
the eastern island of Sakhalin as striking miners eased a rail
blockade and allowed coal to reach the region's main power plant, a
news report said Friday.
	   The miners agreed to let through 1,500 metric tons (1,650 tons)
of coal a day after regional officials raised 3 million rubles to
pay off part of their back wages, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Sakhalin, with a population of 650,000, depends on the power
plant for its power. Authorities have been rationing electricity
for much of the two-week blockade as the plant slowly ran out of
fuel reserves.
	   The compromise came one day after Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov warned that the government would stop financing mining
regions where unpaid workers block railroads.
	   Meanwhile, miners in the eastern Partizansk region called off an
11-day hunger strike after mine officials promised to pay their
overdue wages soon, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   A strike organized by the engine drivers' trade union began at
midnight Friday in the Tula region just south of Moscow. Later in
the morning, railway workers at depots around Moscow joined the
strike, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Protests over back wages have swept over Russia in recent
months. But the protests have rarely been coordinated, and workers'
pay still rarely arrives on time.
	   Because of a chronic cycle of non-payments that has gripped
Russia for years, millions of workers receive their salaries months
late, if at all.

World Bank scraps dlrs 53 million loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The World Bank has scrapped a dlrs 53.1
million loan to help Lebanon fight water and marine pollution
because of Parliament's delay in ratifying the loan, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The English-language Daily Star cited a World Bank letter
addressed to Fuad Saniora, the state minister for finance, as
saying that it has already extended the standard four-month
deadline for approval of the loan several times.
	   ``Unfortunately, we are unable to extend this deadline any
further,'' the letter said, according to the Star.
	   However, the Bank said it would be willing to consider a new
lending operation to contribute to the project, the Star said.
	   Saniora's office did not immediately comment on the report.
	   The European Bank for Investment, the Japanese government and
the European Union are participating in financing this project,
which will cost about dlrs 308 million.
	   The World Bank loan, announced in February 1997, was to be
repaid over a 17-year period with a five-year grace period.
	   It would have been the 11th loan by the World Bank to Lebanon
since March 1993. So far the World Bank has given dlrs 551 million
to Lebanon as it struggles to recover from the devastation of the
1975-90 civil war.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people returned
to their sodden, mud-caked homes around Seoul on Friday after some
of the worst flooding in years in South Korea.
	   The floods that struck the metropolitan area Thursday after a
night of torrential rain killed 119 people, left 53 others missing
and caused an estimated dlrs 323 million in property damage.
	   The deluge was brought by the same slow-moving storm system that
six days earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in
the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 64 campers and
leaving 32 missing and feared dead.
	   The combined toll of 183 dead and 85 missing from the twin
disasters was the worst since a typhoon claimed nearly 350 lives in
1987.
	   As flood waters receded, many of those returning to their homes
in Seoul's low-lying suburbs Friday found only shattered wreckage.
Many neighborhoods were littered with broken furniture, overturned
cars, dead animals and other debris.
	   Health authorities warned against outbreaks of diseases.
	   The storm dumped up to 62 centimeters (25 inches) of rain around
Seoul late Wednesday and early Thursday, one of the heaviest
downpours on record.
	   Rivers overflowed, breaking dikes, sweeping away roads, homes,
vehicles and telephone poles and triggering deadly landslides,
including one that killed 10 soldiers.
	   An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless, their dwellings
either completely submerged or swept away. Some 22,300 hectares
(55,000 acres) of farm land were covered by dark brown flood water.
	   ``Flood waters are retreating fast and people are returning
after spending overnight at schools. But the damage was far greater
than we first expected,'' said Park Hun, an official at the Home
Ministry's Disaster Relief Headquarters.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered tax breaks for flood victims.
Television stations and newspapers launched campaigns to collect
relief donations.
	   Thousands of soldiers and police waded into receding flood
waters to search for missing people. Helicopters moved rescue gear
to the sites of landslides.
	   In a riverside resort town north of Seoul, relief workers
working overnight recovered eight bodies from mudslides that
covered bungalows and shops. They were searching for 15 others who
were among the 53 missing.
	   Mudslides also washed away about 1,300 graves in four municipal
cemeteries in Seoul's suburbs. City workers and relatives were
trying to collect and identify remains, a doubly dispiriting task
in a largely Confucian society that honors its ancestors.
	   Hardest hit were Uijongbu, Paju, Dongduchon and Kanghwa,
satellite cities west and north of Seoul. The rains flooded some of
the tributaries of the Han River, which bisects the capital, and
the Imjin River, which flows along the border with North Korea.
	   About 10 tons of mortar rounds, antipersonnel land mines and
other ammunition were missing after flood waters swept through an
army depot near the border with North Korea, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   Soldiers with mine detectors were combing the area, but
officials feared many of the small, light land mines may have swept
downstream.
	   An unknown number of land mines were also uprooted and swept
away along a portion of the demilitarized zone separating South and
North Korea. The region was declared off limits. As many as a
million mines are believed strewn along the DMZ as a military
deterrent.
	   Operation at Seoul's Kimpo Airport returned to normal Friday,
two days after a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked tarmac, forcing one of the airport's two runways to
close. The runway reopened after the plane was towed away.

Ten Thais held by Myanmar army unit after wandering across border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ten civilians from Thailand have been
captured and are being held by a Myanmar army unit after wandering
across the border in search of bamboo, a Thai army officer said
Friday.
	   Four of the ten are ethnic Karens. They crossed the border near
Tha Song Yan in Tak province, 370 kilometers (230 miles) northwest
of Bangkok, on Wednesday while foraging for bamboo trees to sell,
when they were captured by the 28th Brigade of the Myanmar army.
	   Local officials from Tak were trying to negotiate with the
Myanmar army unit for the Thais' release, but so far the prisoners
have not been freed, said a Thai army officer who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dozens of Malaysians protested
outside the Singapore High Commission Friday, accusing its
government of being ``indifferent and arrogant'' and demanding the
leaders of both countries meet.
	   The two Southeast Asian neighbors have been at each other's
throats for weeks, each accusing the other of bad faith and
reneging on deals. The latest flap is over a disputed railroad
checkpoint at Tanjong Pagar.
	   About 75 members of the Indian Progressive Front, a party
belonging to Malaysia's ruling Barisan National coalition called on
the Singapore leaders to ``come to their senses.''
	   ``We have this peaceful demonstration to warn Singapore and its
leaders that Tanjong Pagar can be described as a hornet's nest and
Singapore and its leaders should not disturb it,'' the
demonstrators said in a letter handed to officials at the Singapore
diplomatic compound.
	   The mostly ethnic Indian demonstrators shouted ``Singapore don't
be arrogant'' and held signs that read ``We give you water, you
spit on us!''
	   They said they were reflecting the views of all Malaysians
``against the indifferent and arrogant attitude of the Singapore
government.''
	   The latest flare-up was provoked by Singapore's relocation of
its immigration, customs and quarantine post Saturday, against the
wishes of its neighbor to the north.
	   Malaysia has condemned the move and kept its immigration
officers at the original Tanjong Pagar railway station bordering
Singapore's financial district in the south of the island, a move
Singapore has deemed unlawful.
	   Malaysia says it should be allowed to keep its immigration
control at the original site because it owns the land under an old
treaty.
	   Responding to claims that the relocation was sudden, unilateral
and deliberately timed when Malaysia was facing an economic crisis,
Singapore said the intention to shift the checkpoint was announced
back in 1989.
	   On Wednesday, the Singapore Home Affairs Ministry declared that
allegations of Singapore's arrogance and insensitivity over the
issue are ``what Malaysia usually says when it has no logical
arguments to offer.''
	   ``Unsubstantiated allegations from Malaysia, blaming everything
on Singapore, are nothing new,'' the ministry said.
	   The increasingly acrimonious squabble has aggravated
progressively souring relations between the two nations.
Longstanding unresolved issues include land disputes and the sale
of Malaysian water, on which Singapore depends heavily.
	   But the nations are also partners in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a regional body that is supposed to
promote a unified force in Asia and the rest of the world.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday cautioned
the city-state not to take his people for granted.
	   ``We are peace-loving but don't take us for granted,'' he warned
Singapore, which depends on Malaysia for more than half the water
its citizens use.

Mandela puts jobs, fighting corruption at top of agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Creating jobs and battling
corruption are the key problems as South Africa looks back on four
years of democracy and forward to next year's second all-race
elections, President Nelson Mandela said Friday.
	   Mandela told Parliament's upper house in a mid-year review
speech that not enough jobs were being created in a country where
unemployment is estimated to 30 percent or higher.
	   ``(Though) the tide may have turned, the problem remains
massive,'' he said.
	   Mandela has ordered a special ``Presidential Jobs Summit'' for
later this year when government, business and labor will discuss
ways of creating jobs.
	   Despite its timetable being delayed several times, Mandela said
it was more important to reach consensus on what will be on the
summit's agenda than meeting deadlines.
	   Mandela also responded to opposition attacks that the government
is corrupt and said he would dedicate himself to uncovering fraud
and misuse of funds in public life.
	   ``I myself will leave no opportunity to root out of government
those who betray the calling of public service by treating it as a
chance to enrich themselves,'' he said.
	   Dressed in a dark suit, Mandela broke from his prepared speech
several times, pausing to take off his glasses and speak off the
cuff.
	   Mandela praised the work of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, saying it had fulfilled its job of seeking out the
truth about apartheid atrocities.
	   ``Apartheid was a crime against humanity,'' he said.
	   With an election looming next year, political slanging matches
are becoming more intense, but Mandela told opposition benches that
the ANC welcomed vigorous debate, as long as it came up with
constructive criticisms.
	   Warning against the potential for arrogance within his own
party, Mandela said he would ally himself with anyone willing to
combat such a trend, even after he retires next year.
	   ``The majority party can be arrogant and reject the view of the
minority,'' he said ``You can count on me as an ally if you fight
that.''
	   Mandela saved lavishing praise on the ANC for his final remarks,
saying no government could match its record of providing basic
services for the millions of poor people oppressed under centuries
of colonialism and white rule.
	   ``There is no government that has ever delivered in four years
what we have been able to achieve in this country and the masses of
the people appreciate what we have been able to do,'' he said.
	   Opposition parties welcomed Mandela's speech, but attacked the
government's record on crime, saying it was damaging to South
Africa's image abroad and discouraging foreign investment.
	   ``The results achieved by the government are not acceptable and
we are not willing to accept the situation of instability,'' said
Pieter Groenewald of the small, white right-wing Freedom Front
party.

Taiwan's trade plunges in July, cutting growth rate further
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's exports plunged 16.3 percent in
July to U.S. dlrs 8.96 billion _ the largest decline in 22 years _
because of Asia's economic turmoil, the government said Friday.
	   The decline was adjusted for seasonal factors, the Finance
Ministry said.
	   Imports fell 22.1 percent in July to U.S. dlrs 7.90 billion,
because domestic consumption dropped and demand for foreign raw
materials and spare parts fell in anticipation of export declines,
officials said.
	   Hsu Kuo-chung, a Finance Ministry official, said exports are
expected to drop 8 percent in 1998, which would be the biggest
annual drop since 1982 when exports fell 1.8 percent.
	   Hsu said economic growth is expected to reach 5 percent this
year because the government has pledged to spend more on
infrastructure projects to stimulate domestic investment and
consumption.
	   The forecast is down from the 5.49 percent the government
predicted only two weeks ago. Early this year, it projected 6.02
percent annual growth.
	   Hsu said economic growth for next year will be very hard to
predict, and the government is carefully monitoring the Asian
financial turmoil to decide on its possible impact on Taiwan.
	   The plunging exports were due largely to reduced demand from
Japan and Southeast Asian countries where the regional crisis
continued to dampen domestic consumption, he said.
	   Exports to Japan slumped 35 percent to U.S. dlrs 742.5 million,
while exports to Indonesia fell 68 percent and exports to South
Korea dropped 49 percent.
	   Exports to Hong Kong, through which 80 percent of Taiwan-China
trade passes, fell 23 percent to U.S. dlrs 1.95 billion, the
ministry report said.
	   However, exports to Europe rose 10.2 percent to U.S. dlrs 1.46
billion last month, making it the third largest market for
Taiwanese products after the United States and Hong Kong, it said.
	   Imports from Japan dropped 18.8 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.13
billion in July, and imports from the United States fell 38 percent
to U.S. dlrs 1.36 billion, it said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A huge explosion ripped apart a building
in the Kenyan capital, heavily damaging the adjacent U.S. Embassy
and killing dozens.
	   The cvehicles were wrecked, witnesses
said.
	   The blast started many fires that sent a plume of black smoke
into the sky, as police helicopters patroled.
	   Shattered windows littered many downtown streets.
	   Ambulances and police rushed to the chaotic scene. Rescuers
searched the rubble for survivors.
	   Phone calls to the U.S. Embassy were not answered. Armed U.S
Marines patrolled the street outside the embassy. The whereabouts
of U.S. Ambassador Prudence H. Bushnell was not immediately known.
	   A U.S. flag was blown off the building and was draped limply
over an iron fence.

Russian courts convict man who killed his cat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the case of ``Mr. Cat'' vs. his pet cat, a
Russian court has ruled in favor of the deceased feline.
	   Vladimir Kotov, whose last name means ``Mr. Cat'' in Russian,
has been convicted of cruelty to animals for beating his pet
against a door and tossing it to its death from a five-story
window, the daily Moscow Times newspaper reported Friday.
	   The cat fight took place May 28 when Kotov came home with two
bags of ground meat, which was going to be his dinner. But while he
was in the shower, his 1-year-old cat Grishka ate most of the meat
in one bag and hid the other under the couch.
	   An enraged Kotov grabbed his cat, banged its head against the
wall and threw it out the window, the newspaper reported.
	   Grishka died from the fall, and Kotov was nabbed because a
policeman had seen the falling cat and noticed that a nearby group
of children was disturbed by the incident, the newspaper added,
citing court testimony.
	   Kotov was sentenced to six months of community service and a 15
percent reduction of his wages during that time.
	   Cruelty to animals is a crime in Russia, but offenders are
rarely prosecuted.

Cambodia's political parties ponder, debate future partnerships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With the election battle over,
Cambodian leader Hun Sen and his rivals are now maneuvering to
strengthen their positions before the new government is formed,
analysts said Friday.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party was named the winner of the
July 26 poll this week, but the party will not have the two-thirds
majority it needs to form a government on its own.
	   While recounts have yet to be completed, the ruling party
appears to have captured 64 seats in the 122-member National
Assembly. But Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its
opposition ally the Sam Rainsy Party will control the other 58
seats, giving them the power to block Hun Sen in the assembly.
	   Threats by Hun Sen to rule the country alone and by the
opposition to boycott the National Assembly are bargaining ploys
ahead of the final showdown, but a coalition government appears
inevitable.
	   ``Each side is putting their cards on the bargaining table,
showing what they want little by little,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, head
of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a local think
tank.
	   He predicted that the ``intense negotiations'' will start
between them in the coming weeks.
	   Hun Sen has invited Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to join him in a
three-way coalition government.
	   But so far he has demanded that he be named prime minister, and
that his party keep control of all the key ministries: defense,
interior, justice, finance and foreign affairs.
	   Hun Sen also wants party president Chea Sim to hold onto the job
of National Assembly chairman _ a post that FUNCINPEC reportedly
wants.
	   The opposition believes that without any of these posts, they
might as well have nothing.
	   ``We want the winning party to divide power according to the
percentage of votes won,'' said FUNCINPEC member of parliament
Ahmad Yahya.
	   Hun Sen, a shrewd and tough bargainer, has warned if the
opposition spurns his invitation to join a coalition he will find a
way to run the government alone.
	   He said he might try to convene a session of the outgoing
National Assembly to amend the constitution so just 50 percent plus
one member of parliament would be needed to confirm a new
government.
	   Chea Vannath, president of the local non-governmental Center for
Social Development, said that while a settlement between the rival
political parties is a far way off, she doubts that Hun Sen would
take that course.
	   ``He cares about international recognition,'' she said. ``I
think so far the international community does not support that.''
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a coup d'etat.
	   Hun Sen hoped the poll would bring back his government's
legitimacy in the eyes of the international community and
much-needed aid, which was lost after his violent takeover.
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party have been united in demanding
that irregularities in the polling and counting process be
addressed before they will recognize the election results or
discuss forming a coalition.
	   ``If the Cambodian People's Party wants Cambodia to have peace,
they have to follow the will of the people,'' said FUNCINPEC's
Ahmad Yahya, claiming that until there is a recount no one will
know what that really is.
	   But FUNCINPEC especially is noted for a lack of internal
discipline, and it is not unlikely that Hun Sen might try to entice
some of its members to break ranks if he fails to win over the
party leadership.
	   It also seems likely that FUNCINPEC's bottom-line demand will be
for chairmanship of the National Assembly and control of the
Ministry of Defense.

Woman found after 60 days in jungle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A deaf-mute woman who spent two months
lost in the jungle has been found by her family, local police said
Friday.
	   Nguyen Thi Kim Oanh, 22, was little more than skin and bones
when her brothers spotted her on July 23, police officer Tran Xuan
Lan said by telephone.
	   She fainted when she saw her relatives and did not regain
consciousness until two days later in a hospital, where she is
slowly recovering. At only 16 kilograms (35 pounds), Lan said she
had lost about two-thirds of her body weight.
	   Oanh left her home in the northern province of Yen Bai on May 26
with 1 million dong (dlrs 77) and a gold ring, Lan said. She
reportedly survived by eating leaves and drinking stream water.

Share prices slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices slumped for a third straight
session Friday, with the key index tumbling 3.3 percent because of
speculative attacks on the local currency.
	   The Hang Seng Index fell 235.95 points to close at 7,018.41, it
lowest level since Jan. 24, 1995. The index closed just 51 points
shy of a five-year low, and a 58 percent fall from its all-time
high of 16,673.27, reached exactly a year ago.
	   Brokers attributed the slump to mounting concerns about
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar and China's ability to
resist devaluing the Chinese yuan.
	   If the yuan were devalued, it would pull the rug out from under
the Hong Kong currency and trigger another wave of currency
devaluations across the region.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.80 to the U.S. currency. In
late trading, the Hong Kong dollar was quoted at 7.7500 to the
dollar, barely changed from late Thursday's 7.7501.
	   ``People are concerned about the Hong Kong dollar, which has
pushed interbank rates higher,'' said James Osborn, head of sales
of ING Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.28 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
676 million), up from Thursday's 4.74 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 607 million).
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 6.50 Hong Kong dollars to
161.50, Hang Seng Bank fell 1.10 dollars to 37.40, Swire Pacific
``A'' fell 90 cents to 23.50, and Hutchison Whampoa fell 80 cents
to 32.60.

IBM to stop IOC connection after Sydney
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds IBM quotes, new material throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ IBM will not renew its contract as the
International Olympic Committee's technology sponsor after the
Sydney 2000 Games, an Australian IBM official said Friday.
	   IBM, which has been involved with the international Olympic
movement for 40 years, was widely criticized for problems with the
results service at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
	   Greg Ellevsen, IBM Australia's manager for corporate
communications, told Sydney radio station 2UE that the company was
parting ways with the IOC because the costs were becoming too high
and that the IOC wanted a separate Internet provider.
	   ``We've been negotiating for several months but it turned out
that the cost was way in advance of the benefits,'' Ellevsen said.
	   ``Paying more for reduced benefits just didn't make much sense.
We had a philosophical point of difference with the IOC _ they
decided they wanted an Internet-separate sponsor and we wanted to
showcase all of our technology.''
	   Ellevsen said IBM informed the IOC of its decision on Friday
``and they understand _ it was all very amicable.''
	   Jim Sloman, acting chief executive of the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), said Friday the committee
was confident that IBM would deliver outstanding information
technology for the 2000 Games, as it did at the Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan earlier this year.
	   ``IBM has today assured SOCOG that its staff will continue to
provide the same level of excellence, dedication and determination
to make the Sydney Olympic Games an outstanding success,'' Sloman
said. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi has demanded the military government remove its unit of
security personnel stationed at her home, military and opposition
sources said Friday.
	   The government ``is happy to comply and discussions are now
underway,'' the office of the military government spokesman said in
a press release late Friday.
	   Amid conflicting reports that the security detail had either
been increased or already removed, a deputy spokesman refused to
comment on the present status of the unit.
	   The dispute over the security detail represents the deepest
deterioration in relations between the 1991 Noble Peace Prize
winner and the military government since it released her from six
years of house arrest in July 1995.
	   It was also an ominous sign of increasing tensions immediately
before the tenth anniversary of the Aug. 8, 1988 nationwide
democracy uprising which the military crushed with brutal force,
killing and jailing thousands.
	   Suu Kyi left her home on Friday to meet supporters at the Yangon
office of her political party.
	   A statement from Suu Kyi's political party, the National League
for Democracy, said Suu Kyi sent a letter to the government on July
31 asking for the detail's removal.
	   ``Since the military unit did not leave her compound, Aung San
Suu Kyi told the commanding officer at 11:10 a.m. on Thursday to
withdraw the security personnel,'' the NLD statement said.
	   ``She told the captain that their presence would be treated as
trespassing if they did not move out by 11:30 a.m.,'' the party
statement said.
	   Upon her release in 1995, Suu Kyi asked to government to keep
some of her former guards at her compound as security, something
her party members were not trained to do.
	   NLD members said the move demonstrated a willingness to work
with the government, while at the same time placing her safety in
the hands of the military. If she was harmed, the military would
bear the blame.
	   The security detail, however, has functions other than
protecting the Nobel laureate.
	   Diplomats in Yangon told the Associated Press in Bangkok that
the detail is under the command of military intelligence and that
its duties include reporting on Suu Kyi's activities.
	   Military intelligence also keeps a house across the street from
Suu Kyi's home from which it monitors her visitors and movements.
Police have set up checkpoints on her street to screen and
sometimes stop visitors.
	   The status of the house and the checkpoints have not been
mentioned by the government.
	   The security detail follows her when she attempts to leave her
home, and has at times stopped her, the diplomats said.
	   That includes three incidents during July when Suu Kyi attempted
to leave Yangon to meet party members. During the last incident,
party leaders said the authorities manhandled Suu Kyi and dragged
her back home against her will.
	   The incident drew condemnations of the military government from
the international community.
	   Col. Hla Min, the government spokesman, said that Suu Kyi's
calls for a tourism boycott, economic sanctions and an end to
foreign investment until democratic reforms have taken place had
affected a lot of people.
	   ``We cannot rule out that those affected people may try to hit
back at any given time,'' Hla Min said.
	   Suu Kyi and her party members have been physically attacked
twice by mobs, in November 1996 and about a month ago in front of
her home.
	   Many analysts in Yangon blamed the government for staging the
attacks, but said Suu Kyi's security unit was not involved and had
tried to stop the violence.
	   The analysts attributed the attacks to harder-line elements in
the military who disagree with what they perceive as the
intelligence services's soft handling of Suu Kyi.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An explosion ripped apart a building in
the Kenyan capital, heavily damaging the adjacent U.S. Embassy and
apparently killing dozens of people. The American ambassador was
among hundreds injured, a local TV station said.
	   The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
	   The explosion at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the seven-story
Ufundi Cooperative building on to the embassy, where at least three
people were killed, witnesses said.
	   U.S. Ambassdor Prudence Bushnell had just finished a news
conference at the Cooperative Bank, which also was damaged in the
blast, journalists said. Kenya Television Network reported she was
lightly injured by flying debris.
	   U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment. Armed U.S. Marines
patrolled the street outside the embassy.
	   Dozens of people inside and outside the cooperative were killed,
witnesses said. Hundreds were sprawled screaming on the sidewalk
with bloody wounds. An unknown number of foreigners were hurt.
	   Two crowded buses and many vehicles were wrecked, witnesses
said. The blast started many fires that sent a plume of black smoke
into the sky, where police helicopters were patrolling. Glass from
shattered windows littered many downtown streets.
	   Ambulances and police rushed to the chaotic scene, while
rescuers searched the rubble for survivors.

Malaysian finance minister denies resignation rumors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stocks closing lower

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's finance minister on
Friday tried to put an end to weeks of rumors that his resignation
was imminent.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said there was ``no basis'' for
the rumors and blamed the media and financial markets for floating
the scuttlebutt.
	   ``We've heard that it's been going on for some time,'' Anwar
told reporters. He added that he meets with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on a daily basis, and there is no rift between them, as has
been widely reported.
	   Resignation rumors have been circulating with greater frequency
over the last couple of months, amid speculation of tensions
between Anwar and newly appointed economic minister Daim Zainuddin,
a close confidant of Mahathir. Daim has been pushing a relaxation
of the tight monetary policy previously pursued by Anwar.
	   Changes in the chief editorial positions at the two leading
Malay newspapers, seen as pro-Anwar, were also interpreted by
market observers as an attack on Anwar's support base.
	   The rumors were believed to have had some effect on the ringgit,
with dealers noting that persistent speculation about Anwar has
helped weaken the currency, which has lost more than 40 percent of
its value in the last year.
	   And shares on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange finished lower
Friday as fears of a possible devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar
and Chinese yuan, coupled with market rumors over Anwar's
resignation, spooked investors.
	   The Composite Index, which tracks share prices of 100 bluechip
stocks, ended at 364.05 points, down 10.73 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar is fighting publication of a book entitled,
``50 Reasons Why Anwar Can't Be Prime Minister,'' which came out
during the United Malays National Organization general assembly in
June. Anwar has obtained an injunction against its distribution.

Havel's feeling better, doctors say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - President Vaclav Havel's condition
has improved over the past 24 hours, doctors said Friday.
	   Havel is breathing spontaneously and both tests and X-ray
pictures showed the infection in his lungs is receding, said a
short statement by Havel's medical team.
	   ``The President is watching television and is interested in the
surrounding events,'' the statement said.
	   Havel suffered a ruptured colon in April while vacationing in
the Austrian Alps, and underwent emergency surgery. On July 26, a
combined Austrian-Czech medical team successfully closed the
colostomy. But Havel developed pneumonia related to the operation
on Monday.
	   On Tuesday, Havel's heart rate soared to 200 beats per minute,
leading doctors to stabilize the condition with electric shocks.
	   The president has been hospitalized five times since December
1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
Following his previous surgeries, breathing problems and infections
often leading to pneumonia hindered Havel's recovery.
	   But doctors were confident enough Friday that Havel's health is
on the upswing that the chief surgeon, Ernst Bodner of the
Innsbruck University Clinic in Austria, could leave Prague.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.

Philippine domestic airline suspended for safety violations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has
grounded a domestic airline for allowing a company officer who was
not certified to fly one of its planes, an official said Friday.
	   Air Transportation Office chief Jacinto Ortega said he suspended
the operating certificate of Grand International Airways for the
``very, very serious'' safety violation.
	   He said the company's director of flight operations was allowed
to fly a Boeing 737-200 with passengers from Manila to central Cebu
City and back to Manila on June 16.
	   The airline officer was not licensed to fly that type of
aircraft, ``exposing the passengers to danger,'' Ortega said.
	   The company has fired the officer and the pilot of the flight,
Ortega said.
	   Company officials were unavailable for comment.
	   Ortega said the cabin crew and the pilot later admitted the
officer had flown the plane on two other occasions. But he said an
informant who first reported the incident told him there were a
total of 15 other violations.
	   The company will undergo a reassessment before the suspension is
lifted, Ortega said.
	   When it was grounded, the airline only operated two 737-200s on
routes to southern cities.
	   It had earlier suspended its international routes to Hong Kong
and Taipei because of declining passenger volume and rising
operating costs.
	   The airline had hoped to benefit from a recent drastic cutback
in operations by the country's largest carrier, Philippine
Airlines, following a devastating pilots' strike.

IAEA says new restrictions make it impossible to detect new, covert
</HEADLINE>
research &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Iraq's new restrictions on U.N.
inspectors will make it difficult if not impossible for nuclear
experts to determine whether Baghdad has revived its secret program
to build nuclear weapons, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
	   David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency,
said teams from the Vienna-based agency would visit known Iraqi
nuclear sites again Saturday as part of its monitoring program
there.
	   But the Iraqis have refused to allow the teams to look for
possible clandestine nuclear research facilities, as the experts
have been doing since the end of the Gulf War in 1991 under orders
by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Kyd said the IAEA had asked for council for instructions on how
to respond to the Iraqi action but had received none as of Friday.
In the absence of fresh instructions, Kyd said the IAEA would
comply with Iraq's conditions and for the time being and limit
visits to known Iraqi nuclear sites.
	   ``But we can't detect any attempt at pumping up the (nuclear)
program, because obviously they wouldn't do that at known sites,''
Kyd said.
	   Kyd said the Iraqis had agreed to allow the IAEA to continue
``environmental testing'' of air and water samples near known
nuclear sites, which could detect unusual radiation levels.
	   Iraq imposed similar restrictions on the New York-based U.N.
Special Commission, which inspects for long-range missiles,
chemical and biological weapons.
	   Baghdad was ordered to destroy all mass destruction weapons in
1991 as a condition for lifting the crippling economic sanctions
imposed by the council in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein sent
his forces into Kuwait, triggering the Gulf War.
	   On Thursday, the 15-member council called Iraq's refusal to
allow unrestricted arms inspections ``totally unacceptable.'' But a
statement, issued by council President Danilo Turk of Slovenia,
gave no instructions to the IAEA or the commission.
	   Nor did the council indicate any new moves to force Iraqi
compliance.
	   The council's decision to avoid confrontation with Iraq reflects
international weariness with the issue, which Baghdad hopes will
speed the lifting of sanctions that have debilitated their country
for eight years.
	   Easing those sanctions short of unquestioned Iraqi compliance
with destruction orders would be a major diplomatic setback for the
Clinton Administration, which has consistently taken a hard line
against Saddam's government.

Allegations of fraud in Cambodia's elections mount as ballot
</HEADLINE>
recounts continue &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One day after Cambodian leader Hun
Sen warned of a new political crisis, the opposition stepped up
allegations of election fraud and called for a nationwide recount
of ballots from last week's parliamentary elections.
	   ``There have been a lot of irregularities, very serious
irregularities, in different places,'' FUNCINPEC member of
parliament Ahmad Yahya said Friday. ``We want an organized recount
in the whole country, not just one commune here and one there.''
	   He was speaking after a press conference held at FUNCINPEC party
headquarters to highlight concerns about voting and
ballot-counting.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as the winner of the
election when long-delayed complete preliminary results were
announced Wednesday, but FUNCINPEC and its ally in opposition, the
Sam Rainsy Party, are alleging there was rampant poll fraud.
	   They have threatened to block the formation of the new
government by boycotting the new National Assembly session if their
complaints are not addressed.
	   Hun Sen warned Thursday that if the opposition followed through
on its threat the old National Assembly would have to be dissolved,
forcing a constitutional crisis. He also said he was prepared to
rule on his own.
	   In response to the opposition's complaints, some recounts have
already taken place, but their results have not yet been officially
announced. Election officials on Friday started re-tallying votes
from five more communes in two province.
	   FUNCINPEC on Friday continued to report ``grave irregularities
in the handling of ballot boxes'' in several provinces,
``especially the eastern province of Prey Veng.''
	   They pointed to missing seals on bags used to transfer the votes
and ballots which allegedly ``disappeared.''
	   Cambodia's election on July 26 came one year after Cambodian
leader Hun Sen ousted FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup d'etat. Hun Sen hoped that,
through the polls, he would win back legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his takeover.

Rival Karen guerrilla groups exchange fire inside Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Rival Karen guerrilla groups engaged in
a fire fight inside Myanmar in which a prominent commander was
killed, one of the guerrilla groups said Friday.
	   About 100 troops from the Karen National Union, which opposes
the military government of Myanmar, battled for an hour with
guerrillas from the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, which is allied
with the military government, for about an hour on Monday, KNU
officers said.
	   The KNU officers claimed they killed six and wounded four of
their enemies and captured various weapons including rocket
propelled grenade launchers. The KNU claimed they suffered no
casualties.
	   Among the dead was DKBA Col. Maung Soe who handled several raids
into Thailand to burn down refugee camps where thousands of Karen
who support the KNU were sheltered, said the KNU officers who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The DKBA split from the KNU in late 1995 and allied themselves
with the government. The Karen have been fighting for autonomy from
the government in Yangon since 1948.

Ukrainian president signs decree on spending cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma signed a
decree that's aimed at bringing down this year's budget deficit,
his office said Friday.
	   The government wants to bring the deficit down from 3.3 percent
to 2.5 percent of the country's gross domestic products, which
would be in line with recent agreements with the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Kuchma's press service gave no details of the cuts, but noted
that they did not involve funds earmarked for paying wages,
pensions and social welfare subsidies.
	   Previously, government officials described the decree as
providing for a 20 percent cut in spending.
	   The measure was part of Cabinet efforts to adopt a new 1998
budget that will meet the demands of international financial
organizations. Parliament last month failed to discuss the budget,
leaving it to the government and Kuchma to adopt the required
changes.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is considering a new loan
to Ukraine, has made the reduction of the budget deficit a key
condition.
	   An IMF mission visited Kiev last month, and said it would
recommend the disbursement of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan for the
cash-strapped former Soviet republic.
	   No concrete budget figures were available. But an earlier draft
provided for revenues of 17.9 billion hryvna (dlrs 8.9 billion),
spending of 20.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 10.1 billion) and a deficit
of 2.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.2 billion).

Nigerian leader names officials to oversee democratic change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler has named a
new electoral commission and 15 new state deputies to help prepare
the sprawling West African country for a democratic transition by
next May.
	   Several allies of the country's notorious late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha were dropped from provincial administrations.
	   Military leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar warned Friday morning
that the newly-appointed Council of State _ which oversees the
governments of the country's 36 states _ should refrain from
meddling in civilian political affairs ahead of democratic
elections early next year.
	   ``We will not tolerate a situation in which you interfere in the
matters of political parties or in the political process,''
Abubakar said. ``As with other public officers, you are prohibited
from participating in partisan politics.''
	   The military council, which includes 15 new members appointed
late Thursday, excludes several known allies of the country's late
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha were dropped from the list.
	   Abubakar also appointed a new National Electoral Commission, to
be led by 71-year-old former appeals court judge Ephraim Omukese
Akpata, who spent several years of his early training in Canada.
	   The electoral body is responsible for registering the country's
newly formed political parties and overseeing democratic elections
early next year.
	   Since unveiling his plan to hand over the reigns of power to a
civilian government by the end of May next year, Abubakar has drawn
cautious praise from a legion of critics and pro-democracy
activists long accustomed to broken promises by Nigerian military
rulers.
	   Abacha had also pledged to allow democratic change, but instead
engineered himself as sole candidate for presidential elections in
the months before he died of heart failure in early June.
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and one of the world's
largest oil exporters, has been ruled by civilian governments for
only 10 of the 38 years since independence from Britain.
	   At least two new political coalitions have announced they are
ready to register for next year's poll.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A huge explosion ripped apart a building
in the Kenyan capital, heavily damaging the adjacent U.S. Embassy
and killing dozens, witnesses said. The U.S. ambassador was among
hundreds injured, local TV said.
	   A suspected car bomb exploded Friday outside the U.S. Embassy in
the capital of neighboring Tanzania, Dar Es Salaam, witnesses said.
	   The explosion in Nairobi toppled the seven-story Ufundi
Cooperative building on to the embassy, where at least three people
were killed, witnesses said. The cause of the blast was not
immediately known.
	   U.S. Ambassdor Prudence Bushnell was injured by flying debris
and was carried on a stretcher out of the cooperative, where she
had just given a news conference, the Kenya Television Network
reported.
	   U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment. Armed U.S. Marines
patrolled the street outside the embassy.
	   Dozens of people inside and outside the cooperative were killed,
witnesses said. Hundreds were sprawled screaming on the sidewalk
with bloody wounds.
	   Two crowded buses and many vehicles were wrecked, witnesses
said. The blast started many fires that sent a plume of black smoke
into the sky, where police helicopters were patrolling.
	   Shattered windows littered many downtown streets.
	   Ambulances and police rushed to the chaotic scene, and rescuers
searched the rubble for survivors.

Release of cancer-stricken British trader up to Singapore
</HEADLINE>
government

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It is up to the Singapore government, not the
courts, to decide whether former futures trader Nick Leeson will be
freed from prison following his diagnosis with colon cancer, a
spokesman for the British High Commission said Friday.
	   Leeson's London-based law firm Kingsley Napley has released a
statement saying the 31-year-old prisoner was diagnosed Aug. 5 with
colon cancer, which has spread to his lymph nodes.
	   Leeson is under guard in the prison ward of the New Changi
Hospital, which is near Changi Prison, where he has served 2 1/2
years of a 6 1/2 year sentence for fraud offenses that led to the
1995 collapse of Barings Bank.
	   A hospital doctor has been assigned to care for Leeson and
British consular officials visit him in the ward, where he is the
only patient, the British spokesman said. He could not confirm news
reports that Leeson was handcuffed.
	   To get Leeson out of the prison and back to Britain, his British
lawyers ``could write to the prison authorities here with a request
of early release on compassionate grounds,'' said the British
spokesman, who asked not to be named.
	   The spokesman said the request would be passed on to government
agencies and the Cabinet would ultimately make a recommendation to
the President on whether the prisoner should be released.
	   ``It's a government decision, not a legal decision,'' the
British official said.
	   Britain's Press Association news agency quoted Singapore
attorney John Koh on Thursday as saying a plea for early release
had already been filed.
	   ``An application has been made in order to allow Mr. Leeson to
return to Britain,'' Koh was quoted as saying by Press Association.
``We cannot say how long that will take or indeed whether it will
be successful.''
	   Koh's law office said he was unavailable Friday for further
comment.
	   On Thursday, his colleague, Eric Tan, had said the firm did not
know that Leeson was sick and would only take action on his behalf
at the request of the London lawyers.

Seven Germans detained while making porn film in tourist area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Seven Germans have
been arrested on the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca after
they were found filming a pornographic movie in a popular tourist
area, the Civil Guard confirmed Friday.
	   The two women and five men, were detained on Thursday afternoon
following a complaint to police by a woman who, accompanied by her
child, came across the seven on set in a cove close to the western
coastal town of Andratx.
	   The names of the seven were not released. Police said they faced
possible charges for exhibitionism and promiscuous behavior in
front of minors.
	   The film material was also confiscated, news reports said.

groom, hospitalized with salmonella, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Six of those hospitalized were in serious condition and one
woman spent several days in intensive care, Fakty said.
	   The illnesses were caused by food provided by the bride's
relatives, and included meat prepared at an unhygienic shop, the

Chancellor Kohl's party gains slightly in weekly election poll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Less than two months ahead of national
elections on Sept. 27, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservatives were
slowly closing the gap with the opposition Social Democrats,
according to a poll released Friday.
	   The n-tv news channel, citing a poll conducted by the respected
Emnid Institute, said Kohl's Christian Democrats and
Bavarian-sister party Christian Social Union were favored by 38
percent, up from 37 percent last week.
	   The Social Democrats, whose candidate Gerhard Schroeder is
Kohl's main challenger, held steady at 41 percent from a week
earlier.
	   The centrist Free Democrats, the junior partner in Kohl's
coalition, moved up to 6 percent from 5 percent, the report said.
Meanwhile, the environmentalist Greens party, seen as a likely
partner for the Social Democrats, dropped a percentage point from a
week earlier to 6 percent.
	   Emnid says the weekly survey of 1,000 eligible voters has a 2.5
percent margin of error.

Demonstrators attack Singapore as `arrogant'

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dozens of Malaysians protested
outside the Singapore High Commission Friday, accusing its
government of being ``indifferent and arrogant'' and demanding the
leaders of both countries meet.
	   The two Southeast Asian neighbors have been at each other's
throats for weeks, each accusing the other of bad faith and
reneging on deals. The latest flap is over a disputed railroad
checkpoint at Tanjong Pagar.
	   About 75 members of the Indian Progressive Front, a
pro-government party, called on the Singapore leaders to ``come to
their senses.''
	   ``We have this peaceful demonstration to warn Singapore and its
leaders that Tanjong Pagar can be described as a hornet's nest and
Singapore and its leaders should not disturb it,'' the
demonstrators said in a letter handed to officials at the Singapore
diplomatic compound.
	   Shouting, ``Singapore don't be arrogant'' and holding signs that
said, ``We give you water, you spit on us!'' the mostly ethnic
Indian demonstrators said they were reflecting the views of all
Malaysians ``against the indifferent and arrogant attitude of the
Singapore government.''
	   Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong ``has nothing to say
about this,'' an official in his office told the Associated Press.
Other Singapore officials declined comment.
	   The flare-up was provoked by Singapore's relocation of its
immigration, customs and quarantine post Saturday.
	   Malaysia has condemned the border move to a site 18 kilometers
(11 miles) north, even though its closer to Malaysia. It has kept
its immigration officers at the Tanjong Pagar railway station
bordering Singapore's financial district, a move Singapore has
deemed unlawful.
	   Malaysia says it should be allowed to keep its immigration
control at the original site because it owns the land under an old
treaty.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia would
hold its ground at the old railway checkpoint and he had no plan to
contact Goh anytime soon.
	   Mahathir said he was waiting for Singapore to ``respond
positively,'' according to Friday's Star newspaper.
	   Analysts say the squabble is underscored by problems related to
the region's economic turmoil, which has hurt Malaysia much more
than Singapore.
	   Responding to claims that the relocation was deliberately timed
when Malaysia was facing an economic crisis, Singapore said the
intention to shift the checkpoint was announced back in 1989.
	   The increasingly acrimonious squabble has aggravated
progressively souring relations between the two nations.
Longstanding unresolved issues include land disputes and the sale
of Malaysian water, on which Singapore depends heavily.
	   But the nations are also partners in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a regional body that is supposed to
promote a unified force in Asia and the rest of the world.
	   Mahathir on Tuesday cautioned the city-state not to take his
people for granted.
	   ``We are peace-loving but don't take us for granted,'' he warned
Singapore, which depends on Malaysia for more than half the water
its citizens use.

Woman diagnosed with cholera in southern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A woman stricken with cholera in southern
Ukraine may be the first registered case of the disease in the
country this year, local media reported Friday.
	   The unidentified employee of a metallurgical plant in the Azov
Sea city of Mariupol was hospitalized Sunday after swimming in a
local pond a few days earlier and complaining of stomach pains, the
Kievskie Vedomosti newspaper said.
	   Doctors examined 63 people who were in contact with the woman
and hospitalized five of them, the Interfax news agency said.
	   City officials have banned swimming in Mariupol's ponds and are
purifying drinking water and checking food sold at local markets.
	   The bacteria that causes cholera was found in Mariupol and
several other locations in Ukraine in June.
	   Three members of one family were hospitalized in Mariupol last
month after they were found to be carrying the bacteria, but none
of them developed the disease.
	   Three cases of cholera, an infectious, intestinal disease caused
by bacteria, have been reported this year in neighboring Russia.
Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, cramps and collapse.

	   In Nairobi, dozens of people were killed, witnesses said.
Hundreds were sprawled screaming on the sidewalk with bloody
wounds, and at least 54 were taken to hospital emergency rooms. An
unknown number of foreigners were hurt.
	   Two crowded buses and many vehicles were wrecked, witnesses
said. The blast started many fires that sent a plume of black smoke
into the sky patrolled by police helicopters.
	   Shattered windows littered many downtown streets.
	   Ambulances and police rushed to the chaotic scene. Rescuers
searched the rubble for survivors.
	   Armed U.S. Marines patrolled the streets outside both embassies.
	   A U.S. flag was blown off the embassy in Nairobi and was draped
limply on an iron fence.

Suu Kyi tells military to leave her home

 &UR; EDS: ADDS NLD members saying security detail still present in grafs

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi has demanded the military government remove its unit of
security personnel stationed at her home, military and opposition
sources said Friday.
	   The government ``is happy to comply and discussions are now
underway,'' the office of the military government spokesman said in
a press release late Friday.
	   NLD members who visited Suu Kyi's compound late Friday afternoon
said the security detail was still present, but had loaded its
equipment and belongings on to a truck in preparation to move.
	   Their numbers were the same as usual, and they were waiting for
instructions from their commanders as to when to leave, the NLD
members said.
	   The dismissal of the security detail represents the deepest
deterioration in relations between the 1991 Noble Peace Prize
winner and the military government since it released her from six
years of house arrest in July 1995.
	   It was also an ominous sign of increasing tensions immediately
before the tenth anniversary of the Aug. 8, 1988 nationwide
democracy uprising which the military crushed with brutal force,
killing and jailing thousands.
	   Suu Kyi left her home on Friday to meet supporters at the Yangon
office of her political party.
	   A statement from Suu Kyi's political party, the National League
for Democracy, said Suu Kyi sent a letter to the government on July
31 asking for the detail's removal.
	   ``Since the military unit did not leave her compound, Aung San
Suu Kyi told the commanding officer at 11:10 a.m. on Thursday to
withdraw the security personnel,'' the NLD statement said.
	   ``She told the captain that their presence would be treated as
trespassing if they did not move out by 11:30 a.m.,'' the party
statement said.
	   Upon her release in 1995, Suu Kyi asked to government to keep
some of her former guards at her compound as security, something
her party members were not trained to do.
	   NLD members said the move demonstrated a willingness to work
with the government, while at the same time placing her safety in
the hands of the military. If she was harmed, the military would
bear the blame.
	   The security detail, however, has functions other than
protecting the Nobel laureate.
	   Diplomats in Yangon told the Associated Press in Bangkok that
the detail is under the command of military intelligence and that
its duties include reporting on Suu Kyi's activities.
	   Military intelligence also keeps a house across the street from
Suu Kyi's home from which it monitors her visitors and movements.
Police have set up checkpoints on her street to screen and
sometimes stop visitors.
	   The status of the house and the checkpoints have not been
mentioned by the government.
	   The security detail follows her when she attempts to leave her
home, and has at times stopped her, the diplomats said.
	   That includes three incidents during July when Suu Kyi attempted
to leave Yangon to meet party members. During the last incident,
party leaders said the authorities manhandled Suu Kyi and dragged
her back home against her will.
	   The incident drew condemnations of the military government from
the international community.
	   Col. Hla Min, the government spokesman, said that Suu Kyi's
calls for a tourism boycott, economic sanctions and an end to
foreign investment until democratic reforms have taken place had
affected a lot of people.
	   ``We cannot rule out that those affected people may try to hit
back at any given time,'' Hla Min said.
	   Suu Kyi and her party members have been physically attacked
twice by mobs, in November 1996 and about a month ago in front of
her home.
	   Many analysts in Yangon blamed the government for staging the
attacks, but said Suu Kyi's security unit was not involved and had
tried to stop the violence.
	   The analysts attributed the attacks to harder-line elements in
the military who disagree with what they perceive as the
intelligence services's soft handling of Suu Kyi.

Commerce ministers from five Asian countries meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Commerce Ministers from BIMTS-EC, an
economic grouping of five Asian countries, held their first
ministerial meeting in Bangkok on Friday with the goal of achieving
free trade in the region.
	   BIMST-EC stands for the Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka
and Thailand Economic Cooperation Group.
	   During their one-day meeting, the five commerce ministers set
several priorities including building a trans-Asia highway and
boosting cooperation in the automobile and parts, food processing,
agriculture and plantation industries.
	   They also formed six committees to oversee investment, energy,
communications, technology, tourism and fisheries.
	   The Thai Commerce Minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, said these
issues would enable BIMST-EC member countries to be ready to
interact more efficiently with other regional groupings and world
bodies.

Indonesian military chief says troops will withdraw from northern
</HEADLINE>
province
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief on
Friday pledged a partial troop withdrawal from a northern province
where security forces have been accused of widespread abuses.
	   On a visit to Aceh province, Gen. Wiranto also apologized for
any wrongdoing by the military during operations aimed at crushing
an armed separatist movement.
	   International human rights groups have said Indonesian troops
were guilty of arbitrary killings and torture in the late 1980s and
early 1990s against Muslim separatists in Aceh, about 1,750
kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   ``I sincerely apologize to all Aceh people for the acts of some
soldiers,'' Wiranto told 500 local officials, security officers and
villagers in the coastal town of Lhokseumawe in Aceh.
	   The conciliatory remarks were the latest sign of an overhaul in
military thinking since political and economic turmoil forced
authoritarian President Suharto to quit in May. During his 32 years
in power, Suharto took a tough line on dissent.
	   It was not immediately known how many soldiers will leave Aceh,
a volatile region at times where the Dutch encountered stiff
resistance to colonial rule decades ago. The total number of
Indonesian soldiers there is at least several thousand.
	   Under new President B.J. Habibie, the reform-minded government
still opposes separatism but is relaxing its grip. This weekend,
the military is expected to wrap up a withdrawal of 1,000 soldiers
from the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. Eleven thousand
troops remain.
	   Indonesia has offered a measure of autonomy to East Timor, where
rebels have been fighting since Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   A small group of separatist guerrillas also operates in the
eastern province of Irian Jaya.
	   In Aceh, human rights workers reportedly plan next month to dig
up what villagers say are mass graves of victims of the military.
Many civilians have testified about atrocities committed by
soldiers years ago.
	   In pledging to scale back military activities in Aceh, Wiranto
said that over the next month he would relinquish some authority to
local leaders, including Muslims priests, teachers and government
officials.
	   ``I decided that the security arrangement in Aceh should be
fully handed over to the Acehnese themselves,'' he said.
	   Wiranto said Acehnese police and soldiers would retain their
posts and said he was hopeful that separatist rebels would give up
their arms and return to their homes.
	   He also said he would propose that Habibie grant amnesty to
political prisoners from Aceh, possibly on Aug. 17, Indonesia's
independence day.
	   Later, at a mosque, Wiranto repeated his pledge to pull out
troops. In response, several thousand worshippers chanted, ``God is
great.''

Share prices slump, but Hong Kong will defend currency peg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS chief executive's comments on currency peg &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices slumped for a third straight
session Friday, with the key index tumbling 3.3 percent because of
speculative attacks on the local currency.
	   However, the chief executive pledged that Hong Kong would defend
its currency link to the U.S. dollar.
	   The Hang Seng Index fell 235.95 points to close at 7,018.41, it
lowest level since Jan. 24, 1995. The index closed just 51 points
shy of a five-year low, and a 58 percent fall from its all-time
high of 16,673.27, reached exactly a year ago.
	   Brokers attributed the slump to mounting concerns about
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar and China's ability to
resist devaluing the Chinese yuan.
	   If the yuan were devalued, it would pull the rug out from under
the Hong Kong currency and trigger another wave of currency
devaluations across the region.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.80 to the U.S. currency. In
late trading, the Hong Kong dollar was quoted at 7.7500 to the
dollar, barely changed from late Thursday's 7.7501.
	   ``People are concerned about the Hong Kong dollar, which has
pushed interbank rates higher,'' said James Osborn, head of sales
of ING Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   But in comments after the market closed, Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa told reporters that Hong Kong had both the financial
reserves and the determination to defend its currency.
	   ``Our determination is to maintain the linked exchange rate as a
fundamental policy of the ... government,'' Tung said.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.28 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
676 million), up from Thursday's 4.74 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 607 million).
	   Among losers, HSBC Holdings fell 6.50 Hong Kong dollars to
161.50, Hang Seng Bank fell 1.10 dollars to 37.40, Swire Pacific
``A'' fell 90 cents to 23.50, and Hutchison Whampoa fell 80 cents
to 32.60.

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs saying offensive ``nearly'' over; Rugova
demanding Western military intervention; U.S. and Russian envoys in
Pristina.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite Serb claims that their
offensive in Kosovo was nearly over, the leader of secessionist
ethnic Albanians renewed his call Friday for Western military
intervention to ``stop the Serb war machinery.''
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that the Serb offensive in Kosovo, which uprooted nearly
200,000 people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said that the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   But the Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, said that ``The
Serb offensive against the (central) Drenica region, which has
triggered tens of thousands new refugees and killed civilians, is
continuing.''
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters.
	   He also said that ``aside from the offensive, the Serb prisons
in Kosovo have become mass camps where hundreds of Albanians are
molested.''
	   In a show of force put on for Serb leaders cracking down on
ethnic Albanians, hundreds of U.S. Marines will participate in NATO
military exercises in neighboring Albania and Macedonia in the
coming months
	   ``The current level of violence is unacceptable, and we're
trying to make that clear in all sorts of communications to
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic and to his army and his
police forces,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters
Thursday.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   There were some indications that fighting had somewhat ebbed in
Kosovo since Thursday, although sporadic clashes were reported from
several parts of the province.
	   U.S. envoy to Kosovo Christopher Hill and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Kosovo's capital Pristina
Friday. Both have this week urged Milosevic to stop the offensive
and urgently start talks with Rugova on the future status of the
Kosovo province within Yugoslavia.
	   The talks have also been hindered by the inability of Kosovo
Albanians to form a joint negotiating team that would also include
the Kosovo Libedration Army, the militant group which fights for
independence. Before the Serb offensive, the KLA was reluctant to
join the negotiations, seeking a war option.
	   But Rugova, who has so far advocated peaceful secession,
indicated Friday the KLA may soon name its representatives.
	   ``The KLA is ready to join our movement and they respect our
institutions,'' Rugova said Friday. ``We only have to see whom they
will chose as their representatives.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency has estimated the number of people who
are refugees in Kosovo at about 200,000. Many of them lack food,
water and other essentials.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement Thursday from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   Thousands were hiding in the hills around Negrovce, a village 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, in ``extremely difficult
conditions,'' with no shelter and daytime temperatures up to 38
degrees Celsius (100 F), a statement by the Doctors Without Borders
group issued in Geneva said Thursday.
	   Rugova, the unofficial president of Kosovo who is recognized
only by his own people, declared Friday a day of mourning for
hundreds killed by the fighting in the current Serbian offensive.

One Cambodian dead, 16 injured in two grenade blasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One elderly man was killed and 16
people were injured when two grenades exploded south of Phnom Penh
Friday, interior ministry officials said.
	   Details of the incident, which occurred 45 kilometers (27 miles)
south of the capital in Kandal province, were being investigated,
said Mom Vanna, a member of the interior police.
	   ``All we know now is that the blasts were caused by a drunken
soldier,'' he said, adding that the assailant was apparently
twirling a grenade on his finger when it flew out of his hand and
landed under a house.
	   A child was injured in the blast.
	   A crowd of angry villagers who gathered at the scene of the
incident confronted the soldier, making him so angry that he set
off the second grenade, Mom Vanna said.
	   Sixty-eight-year-old Nov Hy was killed in the new explosion and
15 other people were injured, he said. The soldier escaped.
	   Cambodia recently emerged from decades of war and civil strife
and is awash with weapons. Grenades and guns can be purchased
cheaply on the black-market and are often used to settle personal
disputes.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Suspected bombs exploded outside the U.S.
embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday, apparently
killing dozens of people, witnesses said.
	   The American ambassador to Kenya was among hundreds injured, a
local TV report said.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time,'' he said.
	   The Nairobi explosion at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
seven-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, where
at least three people were killed, witnesses said.
	   In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the
U.S. Embassy parking lot at the same time, witnesses said. At least
nine people were killed and 16 injured, they said.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in the
search for survivors. Official confirmation was not immediately
available.
	   The U.S. ambassdor to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and was carried on a stretcher out of the Cooperative Bank,
where she had just given a news conference, the Kenya Television
Network reported.
	   U.S. Embassy officials confirmed she was slightly injured.

Smith proclaims her innocence

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ireland's triple Olympic gold medalist
Michelle Smith on Friday maintained she was innocent of tampering
with a drug sample and vowed to fight the four year ban imposed on
her by swimming's governing body FINA.
	   A FINA doping panel Thursday ruled Smith was guilty of tampering
with an out-of-competition urine test taken at her home in Kilkenny
in January and banned her from competing for four years.
	   The ban would include the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2001
World Championships and effectively end the 28-year-old swimmer's
career.
	   ``On my life, I swear that I am innocent,'' Smith was quoted
saying in Friday's edition of the Irish Independent.
	   ``I'm really quite angry now and holding my tongue may be a
problem. I know that I am innocent, that I did not tamper with any
sample. Yet I am found to be guilty.
	   ``I'm all in favour of catching the drugs cheats but I have to
send out a clear warning to all athletes, no matter what sport you
are in,'' Smith said. ``If are not protected, you are not safe.''
	   Smith's lawyer Peter Lennon was to hold a press conference in
Dublin later Friday, when it was expected he would reveal his plans
to fight the FINA-imposed ban.
	   ``I intend to fight this all the way to prove my innocence.
Yesterday's ban by FINA does not change that at all,'' Smith said
in the report.
	   ``I had been expecting this sort of outcome since this
outrageous situation arose back in April.
	   ``I thought I had prepared myself for it, but no matter how
prepared I thought I was it still hurt when I finally did hear the
decision.''
	   Smith said she wanted the public to wait until they knew the
facts of her case before they judged her.
	   ``Right now I intend to take my case to the Sports Arbitration
Council (CAS), where all the facts will be presented. CAS is where
I know I will find justice,'' she said.
	   ``It would be optimistic to expect that things could be cleared
up quickly. However, I am not sure that I can wait around much
longer before putting my side of the story.''
	   Smith has faced a skeptical world ever since she defied
conventional wisdom and her own previous mediocre record to win
three gold medals and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   While fans said it demonstrated a triumph of will against the
odds, her detractors alleged the feat must have been aided by
illegal substances.
	   Smith has always denied using performance enhancing drugs and
said she has been subjected to more testing than any of her
competitors.
	   The FINA doping panel judgment emphasized that her original and
her back-up samples taken in January, which were stored and tested
separately, both contained the high-alcohol content.
	   This, it said, ruled out the possibility that anyone other than
Smith had tampered with the samples during transportation or in the
laboratory in Barcelona, Spain.
	   Smith's devoted circle in her native Rathcoole, west of Dublin,
has remained loyal to the woman lauded in local posters as ``our
belle Michelle.''
	   But the articulate, confident redhead has never been able to
translate her Olympic feats into commercial success even in her
native land, where less successful sports stars are national
heroes.
	   Hours before her ban was announced Smith appeared at the Dublin
Horse Show as a celebrity guest on Ireland's Gaelic-language
television channel, a fringe outlet in predominantly
English-speaking Ireland.
	   Since Atlanta the entire foundation of swimming in Ireland has
been tainted by other scandals. Smith's former coach, Derry
O'Rourke, was convicted last year of sexually abusing more than
dozen girls under his direction, though Smith says he never abused
her.
	   A second coach fled to the United States after evading similar
sex-abuse charges. A third coach was convicted of murdering his
wife and niece after fathering a child to another teen-age swimmer.
	   Smith's decision to dump O'Rourke as coach in 1993 proved
pivotal to her career.
	   Her new coach, Dutch discus thrower Erik de Bruin, was then
serving his own four-year ban from competition after testing
positive for excessive testosterone. She married de Bruin and today
credits his coaching methods for her success, though she has vowed
not to reveal what those methods are until she retires.

Currency pressures, Japan's policies dominate downward market

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Nervous Asian markets ended the week mostly
lower Friday due to pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and fears
China might be forced to devalue its currency.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 235.95, or 3.3 percent,
to close at 7,018.41, it lowest level since Jan. 24, 1995. The
index closed just 51 points shy of a five-year low, and a 58
percent fall from its all-time high of 16,673.27, reached exactly a
year ago.
	   Brokers attributed the slump to mounting concerns about
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar and China's ability to
resist devaluing the Chinese yuan.
	   If the yuan were devalued, it would pull the rug out from under
the Hong Kong currency and trigger another wave of currency
devaluations across the region.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.80 to the U.S. currency. In
late trading, the Hong Kong dollar was quoted at 7.7500 to the
dollar, barely changed from late Thursday's 7.7501.
	   Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa reiterated Friday that the
territory would defend the currency peg, saying it was a
``fundamental policy'' of the government.
	   Traders, who also had been awaiting details of Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's policy speech in Tokyo, found little to
affect the market. Obuchi reiterated that he would go ahead with
tax cuts and new spending to revive the region's largest economy.
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock index rose in early trading, but
ended the day 47.05 points lower at 15,289.17, its fifth
consecutive loss.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 145.54 yen in late-afternoon
trading, up 0.87 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and above its New
York rate of 144.32 yen overnight.
	   Malaysian shares also tumbled on fears of a possible devaluation
of the Hong Kong dollar and Chinese yuan, coupled with market
rumors over the possible resignation of finance minister Anwar
Ibrahim, which he denied.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index closed at
364.05 points, down 10.73 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Philippine shares, already at a five-year low, closed down
another 2.2 percent, and the peso currency fell as well over fears
that China might be forced to devalue.
	   The dollar averaged 42.916 pesos for the day, up from 42.343
pesos on Thursday. It reached a day-high of 43.490 pesos, which was
also its closing level.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 32.17
points to 1,448.72, adding to a 43.86-point decline on Thursday.
	   Thai stock prices continued their plunge to the lowest levels
for over eleven years, pushed down by continued uncertainty over
the future of the country's banks and weakness in the baht, dealers
said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.53 points, or 1.8
percent, to 247.54.
	   Asian markets were hit hard earlier in the week after the Dow
Jones industrial average fell nearly 300 points on Tuesday,
inciting fears that the U.S. economy might begin slowing.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply lower on renewed jitters over
the possibility of another round of regional currency falls and
slides in other Asian stock markets. The Straits Times Industrials
Index plunged 2.5 percent, or 26.51 points, to 1,039.27.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower for the eight consecutive
session, with the main index falling to a six-week low. The
Composite fell 10.220 points, or 2.4 percent, to 423.613.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on the back of overnight
gains on U.S. stock markets. The market's key Weighted Stock Price
Index rose 58.28 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,530.02.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 12.37 points, or 0.6 percent, to
2,031.18.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed narrowly lower in light
trading. The All Ordinaries Index fell 3.4 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 2,599.0.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher. The Korea Composite
stock Price Index rose 1.14 points, or 0.3 percent, to 321.71.

Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Nervous Asian markets ended the week mostly
lower Friday due to pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and fears
China might be forced to devalue its currency. In Hong Kong, the
Hang Seng Index fell 235.95, or 3.3 percent, to close at 7,018.41,

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In his first major policy speech before Parliament,
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi pledged on Friday to drive ahead with
tax cuts and new spending to revive Japan's sputtering economy.
Obuchi, who was elected premier last week, also said he would push
a plan to clean up the banks' bad debt mess, cut the bureaucracy
and put together a special economic strategy council. Japan's new
government is under mounting pressure to deal with the country's
deepening recession. Unemployment hit a record-high of 4.3 percent
in June and the banking system is groaning under bad debt.
(JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government on Friday
issued a report to the International Monetary Fund in which it
predicts the economy will contract by as much as 15 percent this
fiscal year. The assessment was presented by the government to the
lending agency as part of regular updates on the country's
shattered economy, which crumbled last year with the onset of the
Asian currency crisis. The IMF is managing a multibillion-dollar
bailout plan for Indonesia, which once enjoyed vigorous economic
growth. Inflation is now soaring and the nation expects over half
of its 202 million population to fall below the poverty line by
year's end. Deadly riots fueled by price increases in Jakarta in
May helped oust former President Suharto and the political turmoil
scared off more foreign investors. (INDONESIA-ECONOMY)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's exports plunged 16.3 percent in
July to U.S. dlrs 8.96 billion _ the largest decline in 22 years _
because of Asia's economic turmoil, the government said Friday. The
decline was adjusted for seasonal factors, the Finance Ministry
said. Imports fell 22.1 percent in July to U.S. dlrs 7.90 billion,
because domestic consumption dropped and demand for foreign raw
materials and spare parts fell in anticipation of export declines,
officials said. Hsu Kuo-chung, a Finance Ministry official, said
exports are expected to drop 8 percent in 1998, which would be the
biggest annual drop since 1982 when exports fell 1.8 percent.
(TAIWAN-TRADE)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ For the third time this year, South
Korea's major memory chip makers plan to halt production
temporarily this month in an attempt to boost prices in a glutted
market. Production cutbacks in June and July by the three big
Korean firms and some Japanese chip makers helped increase prices,
but not enough to cover production costs. A 64-megabit Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM) chip sold for dlrs 8.80 in early
August, up from dlrs 7.60 in July. Producers say the price has to
reach dlrs 10 to cover costs. Samsung Electronics Co., the world's
biggest computer memory chip maker, said it will stop production
lines Aug. 16-22. Hyundai Electronics Co., the nation's No. 2 chip
maker, will stop production Aug. 13-20, while LG Semicon, South
Korea's third largest chip maker, will halt production Aug. 10-16.

category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Suspected bombs exploded outside the U.S.
embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday, apparently
killing dozens of people, witnesses said. The American ambassador
to Kenya was among hundreds injured, a local TV report said. The
Nairobi explosion at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the seven-story
Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, where at least
three people were killed, witnesses said. In Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S. Embassy parking
lot at the same time, witnesses said. At least nine people were

was destroyed, witnesses said. Cranes were hurried to the site to

confirmation was not immediately available.(KENYA-EXPLOSION)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China began evacuating more than 300,000 people
Friday from land along the raging Yangtze River that could be
deliberately flooded in a desperate bid to safeguard areas
downstream. With the Yangtze at record levels and threatening to
rise higher, officials were preparing to divert floodwaters along a
section of the 3,900-mile (6,276- kilometer)-long river described
as the most treacherous. More than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In six hours of testimony fraught with peril
for Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky told grand jurors her firsthand
account of sexual encounters with the president inside the White
House, a legal source said. The former White House intern testified
``truthfully, completely and honestly,'' her spokeswoman declared
afterward. Creating an indelible account that the president must
confront before the same grand jury in 10 days, Ms. Lewinsky
relayed the same story she told prosecutors over the past week, a
legal source familiar with her testimony said. That account
includes that they had sexual encounters inside the White House,
including in a study near the Oval Office, and discussed how they
could conceal their relationship. But she says Clinton never
instructed her to lie under oath, the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. (CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi has demanded the military government remove its unit of
security personnel stationed at her home, military and opposition
sources said Friday. The government ``is happy to comply and
discussions are now underway,'' the office of the military
government spokesman said in a press release late Friday. NLD
members who visited Suu Kyi's compound late Friday afternoon said
the security detail was still present, but had loaded its equipment
and belongings on to a truck in preparation to move. Their numbers
were the same as usual, and they were waiting for instructions from
their commanders as to when to leave, the NLD members
said.(MYANMAR-SUU KYI STANDOFF)
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The man who murdered the much-loved
great-uncle of Prince Charles _ the only member of the royal family
to be killed during the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict _ has
been freed under the controversial early release provisions of the
region's peace settlement. Thomas McMahon was a serving a life
sentence for the murder of Lord Louis Mountbatten and four others
who died when the Irish Republican Army blew up his private boat in
Mullaghmore, western Ireland, in August 1979. He was released from
prison Thursday night under the terms of the Good Friday peace
agreement. The move has outraged some politicians. Peter Robinson
of the Democratic Unionist Party, a hard-line Protestant party,
said the release was ``outrageous.'' (NORTHERN IRELAND)

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs saying offensive ``nearly'' over; Rugova
demanding Western military intervention; U.S. and Russian envoys in
Pristina.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite Serb claims that their
offensive in Kosovo was nearly over, the leader of secessionist
ethnic Albanians renewed his call Friday for Western military
intervention to ``stop the Serb war machinery.''
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Serb offensive in Kosovo, which uprooted nearly 200,000
peoplece.
	   But Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova said ``The Serb
offensive against the (central) Drenica region, which has triggered
tens of thousands new refugees and killed civilians, is
continuing.''
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters.
	   He also said that ``aside from the offensive, the Serb prisons
in Kosovo have become mass camps where hundreds of Albanians are
molested.''
	   In a show of force put on for Serb leaders cracking down on
ethnic Albanians, hundreds of U.S. Marines will participate in NATO
military exercises in neighboring Albania and Macedonia in the
coming months
	   ``The current level of violence is unacceptable, and we're
trying to make that clear in all sorts of communications to
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic and to his army and his
police forces,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters
Thursday.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   There were some indications that fighting had somewhat ebbed in
Kosovo since Thursday, although sporadic clashes were reported from
several parts of the province.
	   U.S. envoy to Kosovo Christopher Hill and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met Friday in Kosovo's capital
Pristina. Both have this week urged Milosevic to stop the offensive
and urgently start talks with Rugova on the future status of the
Kosovo province within Yugoslavia.
	   The talks have also been hindered by the inability of Kosovo
Albanians to form a joint negotiating team that would also include
the Kosovo Liberation Army, the militant group which fights for
independence. Before the Serb offensive, the KLA was reluctant to
join the negotiations, seeking a war option.
	   But Rugova, who has so far advocated peaceful secession,
indicated Friday the KLA may soon name its representatives.
	   ``The KLA is ready to join our movement and they respect our
institutions,'' Rugova said Friday. ``We only have to see whom they
will chose as their representatives.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency has estimated the number of people who
are refugees in Kosovo at about 200,000. Many of them lack food,
water and other essentials.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement Thursday from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   Thousands were hiding in the hills around Negrovce, a village 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, in ``extremely difficult
conditions,'' with no shelter and daytime temperatures up to 38
degrees Celsius (100 F), a statement by the Doctors Without Borders
group issued in Geneva said Thursday.
	   Rugova, the unofficial president of Kosovo who is recognized
only by his own people, declared Friday a day of mourning for
hundreds killed by the fighting in the current Serbian offensive.

Kabila heads to former rebel base to rally support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Kabila heading to Lubumbashi. CHANGES
overline, byline. No pickup.
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Surrounded by an army of security forces
and promising a new people's war, President Laurent Kabila left his
tense capital on Friday and headed to his former rebel stronghold
of Lubumbashi to shore up support for his embattled regime.
	   Kabila went to the southern mining town to meet with a South
African delegation and later plans to attend a regional summit on
the conflict in Zimbabwe, state-controlled Voice of the People
radio reported.
	   Kabila's departure, described as ``administrative'' comes as
Tutsi fighters in the east consolidate their hold on several key
towns in Congo's Kivu region and fighting continues on the opposite
side of the country near the Atlantic coast.
	   Kabila is looking to win backing for what he calls a war against
neighboring Rwanda, which his spokesman says orchestrated a
rebellion that began Sunday and swiftly escalated into a full-scale
assault on Kabila's 14-month-old regime.
	   Rwanda on Friday denied involvement in the uprising, saying
Kabila's accusations were simply an effort to find a scapegoat for
disenchantment with his government.
	   ``We haven't crossed into Congo,'' Rwandan army spokesman Maj.
Emmanuel Ndahiro was quoted as saying by the private Rwandan News
Agency. ``The current crisis in Congo is to blame on Kabila himself
who has failed to deliver what he had promised to his country.''
	   Earlier in the week, gun battles broke out in the capital of
Kinshasa as rebellious Rwandan and Tutsi soldiers mutinied in their
barracks. That fighting quelled, the city is tense and on high
alert.
	   Troops have been deployed at key government and commercial
buildings in Kinshasa and checkpoints have been set up to check all
traffic entering and leaving the city.
	   The government earlier acknowledged the eastern city of Bukavu
had fallen to the rebel Tutsi and Rwandan allies, state radio on
Friday said the key city of Kisangani was in government hands.
	   ``The situation is perfectly calm in Kisangani,'' Voice of the
People reported. ``This quiet was marked after two days of
trouble.''
	   Kabila on Thursday promised to step up resistance against
Rwanda.
	   The rebellion that began late Sunday mirrors Kabila's own
guerrilla war which culminated in May 1997 with the ouster of
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Kabila, this time on the defensive, vowed to wage a people's war
against Rwanda.
	   ``The war will be long and popular, that is, the whole people of
Congo will defend their nation and sovereignty,'' said Kabila, who
wore a pair of green army fatigues Thursday as he addressed
government officials clad in military uniforms.
	   Tutsi fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan soldiers,
also Tutsis, who played a key role in Kabila's victory over Mobutu
last year, are leading the fighting.
	   Like Kabila's followers who swept across the country from east
to west in eight months, the renegades have quickly captured
Congo's eastern cities near Rwanda's borders, while moving west
through the jungle interior towards the country's third city,
Kisangani.
	   At the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby Kitona village and
military base, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   One government officer in Kinshasa who spoke on condition of
anonymity said rebels in Muanda and Kitona were slowly moving east
toward the capital. The report could not be independently
confirmed.

Anti-Taliban forces say Pakistanis captured on Afghanistan's
</HEADLINE>
battlefield &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern alliance said
Friday that it captured several hundred Pakistanis who were
fighting alongside extremist Islamic Taliban troops.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition did not say where or over what period
the Pakistanis were captured. Neighboring Pakistan has denied its
troops are helping the Taliban, which controls 85 percent of
Afghanistan, including Kabul, the capital.
	   Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in a statement Friday, also rejected
claims his fighters were aided by the Pakistani military in the
bloody conflict in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Afghan people alone, he said, defeated Soviet invaders and a
communist government, and they can face the ``evil and corrupt''
northern alliance without help.
	   Many outside observers have said Pakistan supplies weapons to
the Taliban, while Russia and Iran are believed to support the
northern alliance, which is fiercely holding on to a dwindling area
of northern Afghanistan.
	   Fighting was reported Thursday near the northern alliance's
stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, the only sizable Afghan city not held
by the Taliban. Both sides claimed victory. Independent
confirmation was not immediately available.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law. Most
women are barred from work, most girls are prevented from attending
school, music is banned, men are required to wear beards and public
mutilation of thieves is common.

Pakistan's technocrat economic chief seen making little impact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's depressed economy is
unlikely to get a boost from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's decision
to put a technocrat in charge of the country's finances, analysts
said Friday.
	   Sharif on Thursday shifted Sartaj Aziz from finance to foreign
affairs and named Hafiz Pasha, a respected economic scholar, as his
special financial adviser. Pasha will have the duties of finance
minister, but could not be named to the Cabinet because he is not a
member of parliament.
	   ``It's not the job of a technocrat. They lack vision. It is a
politician's job,'' said Qaiser Bengali, an economist at
Islamabad's Sustainable Development Policy Institute.
	   Pasha was quoted as telling the Wall Street Journal that he
would broadly follow the policies of Aziz. Asked whether Pakistan
would accept what are likely to be tough new loan terms from the
International Monetary Fund, Pasha said, ``We will do whatever is
necessary to revive the economy.''
	   The government is hard pressed by sanctions that the United
States, Japan and other industrial nations imposed after Pakistan
conducted nuclear tests in May. It is widely expected to seek at
least a partial moratorium on the repayment of its dlrs 30 billion
foreign debt.
	   Akbar Zaidi, an independent economist, estimated Pakistan's
current foreign exchange reserves at dlrs 750 million, including a
recent dlrs 200 million loan from Kuwait. That covers less than a
month of imports such as fuel and wheat for this country of 140
million people, Zaidi said. added.
	   As his appointment was being announced, Pasha was headed to the
Middle East, where he was reportedly negotiating a loan from the
Islamic Development Bank and trying to get a break for Pakistan in
oil prices.
	   Loans from the Middle East ``will probably allow the government
to stay afloat for another three-four months, but it will take away
the pressure to reform,'' said Jahanzeb Naseer, head of research at
Jardine Fleming Pakistan, a brokerage house.
	   ``All they need is implementation of the policies they have
announced earlier,'' he said. ``If they have the will, it really
doesn't matter who's manning the seat.''

Obuchi outlines tax cuts, pledges reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition leader reaction to bridge bank plan,
graf 16.
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In his first major policy speech before Parliament,
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi pledged on Friday to drive ahead with
tax cuts and new spending to revive Japan's sputtering economy.
	   Obuchi, who was elected premier last week, also said he would
push a plan to clean up the banks' bad debt mess, cut the
bureaucracy and put together a special economic strategy council.
	   ``I have a strong sense that without courage today, there is no
tomorrow _ mark my words,'' he told the first parliament session
under his rule. The session was opened Friday morning by Emperor
Akihito.
	   Japan's new government is under mounting pressure to deal with
the country's deepening recession. Unemployment hit a record-high
of 4.3 percent in June and the banking system is groaning under bad
debt.
	   Friday's speech failed to immediately dispel doubts in financial
markets about Japan's prospects for recovery.
	   Japan's key stock index gained in the morning before Obuchi's
speech but edged lower later, and the yen dropped slightly against
the U.S. dollar. Traders cited disappointment that Obuchi didn't
offer any fresh economic proposals.
	   In a further sign of economic weakness, the head of Japan's
Economic Planning Agency on Friday said he will issue a report next
week showing that the country's finances are worsening.
	   ``The economy is clearly floundering,'' Taichi Sakaiya told
reporters.
	   Obuchi's forcefully worded speech broke little new ground from
statements he and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa have made since
the new government was put together last week after Obuchi's
confirmation in Parliament.
	   But the new prime minister, who took office with approval
ratings hovering around 30 percent, vowed to implement the tough
reforms and policies needed to turn the economy around.
	   ``Our Cabinet's fate depends on us putting our country back on a
recovery path in the next couple of years,'' Obuchi said in a
speech interrupted several times by applause.
	   A major plank in Obuchi's program is a package of six bills
setting up a ``bridge bank'' system to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running while bad loans and remaining assets are
sold.
	   The legislation is needed to clean up the estimated 80 trillion
yen (dlrs 551 billion) in problem loans weighing down Japanese
financial institutions. Most of the debts are left over from the
collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   ``In order to revive Japan's economy, we must first of all ...
settle the bad debts held by financial institutions,'' he said,
calling for speedy implementation of the plan.
	   The plan faces problems, however, in Parliament, where Obuchi's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party only holds a majority in the lower
house.
	   The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Naoto Kan,
criticized the bill, saying it didn't make clear when banks should
be declared bankrupt and that it merely delayed the resolution of
the financial system's basic problems.
	   Critics of the bridge bank scheme object to the use of 11
trillion yen (dlrs 75.9 billion) in public funds to bail out the
banks. Others say the plan needs to be strengthened to allow weak
banks to fail, or that it should include penalties for directors of
mismanaged banks.
	   Another major piece of Obuchi's program is tax cuts aimed at
getting thrifty consumers to spend more money and give strapped
corporations more funds to keep afloat.
	   Obuchi said he planned about 4 trillion yen (dlrs 27.6 billion)
in personal tax cuts, moving to reduce the maximum combined
national and local income tax bite from 65 percent to 50 percent.
	   The prime minister also said he wanted to cut the corporate tax
rate from 46.3 percent to 40 percent, comparable to rates in other
countries. That was expected to amount to nearly 3 trillion yen
(dlrs 20.7 billion).
	   The other half of the stimulus is a planned 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 69 billion) in new spending. Obuchi said he would temporarily
suspend a new fiscal austerity law to allow the deficit spending.
	   Obuchi said he wanted to put in place a program to cut the
number of bureaucrats by 20 percent over the next decade and slash
government spending by 30 percent.
	   He also announced he had formed a special economic council
reporting to the prime minister, and offered that as a sign that
he, not the powerful bureaucracy, would be running the economy.
	   ``On the final policies, I myself will decide them and implement
them,'' he declared.

IAEA says new restrictions make it impossible to detect new, covert
</HEADLINE>
research &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Iraq's new restrictions on U.N.
inspectors will make it difficult if not impossible for nuclear
experts to determine whether Baghdad has revived its secret program
to build nuclear weapons, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
	   David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency,
said teams from the Vienna-based agency would visit known Iraqi
nuclear sites again Saturday as part of its monitoring program.
	   But the Iraqis have refused to allow the teams to look for
possible clandestine nuclear research facilities, as the experts
have been doing since the end of the Gulf War in 1991 under orders
by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Kyd said the IAEA asked for council for instructions on how to
respond to the Iraqi action but had received none as of Friday. In
the absence of fresh instructions, Kyd said the IAEA would comply
with Iraq's conditions and for the time being and limit visits to
known Iraqi nuclear sites.
	   ``But we can't detect any attempt at pumping up the (nuclear)
program, because obviously they wouldn't do that at known sites,''
Kyd said.
	   Kyd said the Iraqis agreed to allow the IAEA to continue
``environmental testing'' of air and water samples near known
nuclear sites, which could detect unusual radiation levels.
	   Iraq imposed similar restrictions on the New York-based U.N.
Special Commission, which inspects for long-range missiles,
chemical and biological weapons.
	   Baghdad was ordered to destroy all mass destruction weapons in
1991 as a condition for lifting the crippling economic sanctions
imposed by the council in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein sent
his forces into Kuwait, triggering the Gulf War.
	   On Thursday, the 15-member council called Iraq's refusal to
allow unrestricted arms inspections ``totally unacceptable.'' But a
statement, issued by council President Danilo Turk of Slovenia,
gave no instructions to the IAEA or the commission.
	   Nor did the council indicate any new moves to force Iraqi
compliance.
	   The council's decision to avoid confrontation with Iraq reflects
international weariness with the issue, which Baghdad hopes will
speed the lifting of sanctions that have debilitated their country
for eight years.
	   Easing those sanctions short of unquestioned Iraqi compliance
with destruction orders would be a major diplomatic setback for the
Clinton Administration, which has consistently taken a hard line
against Saddam's government.

Azerbaijan president ends censorship in advance of elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ With presidential elections planned for
October, authoritarian President Geidar Aliev issued a decree
Friday abolishing most forms of censorship in the former Soviet
republic.
	   Aliev, who also led Azerbaijan during Soviet times, disbanded
the Department for Protection of State Secrets in the Mass Media,
which handles most censorship work. It will be replaced with a body
that only checks for the publication of military secrets, the
decree said.
	   Aliev also called on his cabinet ministers to draft a program
that would protect the freedom of speech and information in
Azerbaijan, an oil-rich nation of 7 million on the Caspian Sea.
	   At present, Azerbaijan's media are fully supportive of Aliev and
rarely, if ever, criticize government policy.
	   Human rights groups have frequently denounced Aliev's government
for alleged human rights abuses and harassment of the press.
Western governments, eager to see the development of Azerbaijan's
oil industry, have been restrained in their criticism, but have
also urged Aliev to make Azerbaijan more open and democratic.
	   Aliev, who returned to power in a 1993 coup, has been trying to
improve his democratic credentials in advance of the October
election.
	   A member of Aliev's administration, Ali Hasanov, told the Turan
news agency that the decree was drafted in preparation for upcoming
October elections. He said the move would help in the ``development
of Azerbaijan as a democratic state,'' the news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium expressed concern about all-out
war in Congo but announced no immediate plans to fly the 3,000 or
so Belgians living in the Central African nation out of the
country.
	   Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said it was up to African nations
to resolve the crisis in Congo, but added Belgium, Congo's former
colonial ruler, would be ready to mediate.
	   Derycke told reporters ``a military solution will not last and
the crisis must be resolved by Africans.''
	   ``What we need to do is contain the crisis to prevent a witch
hunt against Tutsis,'' he added. He said some Tutsis have sought
asylum at the Belgian embassy in Kinshasa.
	   In years past, Belgian paratroopers have regularly evacuated
Belgian nationals from Congo in times of crisis but Derycke gave no
inkling plans were afoot to send military planes to the region now.

Havel's feeling better, doctors say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel's condition
has improved over the past 24 hours, doctors said Friday.
	   Havel is breathing spontaneously and both tests and X-ray
pictures showed the infection in his lungs is receding, said a
short statement by Havel's medical team.
	   ``The president is watching television and is interested in the
surrounding events,'' the statement said.
	   Havel suffered a ruptured colon in April while vacationing in
the Austrian Alps, and underwent emergency surgery. On July 26, a
combined Austrian-Czech medical team successfully closed the
colostomy. But Havel developed pneumonia Monday related to the
operation.
	   On Tuesday, Havel's heart rate soared to 200 beats per minute,
leading doctors to stabilize the condition with electric shocks.
	   The president has been hospitalized five times since December
1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
Following his previous surgeries, breathing problems and infections
often leading to pneumonia hindered Havel's recovery.
	   But doctors were confident enough Friday that Havel's health is
improving that the chief surgeon, Ernst Bodner of the Innsbruck
University Clinic in Austria, could leave Prague.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people returned
to their sodden, mud-caked homes around Seoul on Friday after some
of the worst flooding in years in South Korea.
	   The floods that struck the metropolitan area Thursday after a
night of torrential rain killed 131 people, left 61 others missing
and caused an estimated dlrs 323 million in property damage.
	   The deluge was brought by the same slow-moving storm system that
six days earlier sent flash floods raging down mountain valleys in
the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, killing 67 campers and
leaving 29 missing and feared dead.
	   The combined toll of 198 dead and 90 missing from the twin
disasters was the worst since a typhoon claimed nearly 350 lives in
1987.
	   As flood waters receded, many of those returning to their homes
in Seoul's low-lying suburbs Friday found only shattered wreckage.
Many neighborhoods were littered with broken furniture, overturned
cars, dead animals and other debris.
	   Health authorities warned against outbreaks of diseases.
	   The storm dumped up to 62 centimeters (25 inches) of rain around
Seoul late Wednesday and early Thursday, one of the heaviest
downpours on record.
	   Rivers overflowed, breaking dikes, sweeping away roads, homes,
vehicles and telephone poles and triggering deadly landslides,
including one that killed 10 soldiers.
	   An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless, their dwellings
either completely submerged or swept away. Some 22,300 hectares
(55,000 acres) of farm land were covered by dark brown flood water.
	   ``Flood waters are retreating fast and people are returning
after spending overnight at schools. But the damage was far greater
than we first expected,'' said Park Hun, an official at the Home
Ministry's Disaster Relief Headquarters.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered tax breaks for flood victims.
Television stations and newspapers launched campaigns to collect
relief donations.
	   Thousands of soldiers and police waded into receding flood
waters to search for missing people. Helicopters moved rescue gear
to the sites of landslides.
	   In a riverside resort town north of Seoul, relief workers
working overnight recovered 13 bodies from mudslides that covered
bungalows and shops. They were searching for a dozen others who
were among the 61 missing.
	   Mudslides also washed away about 1,300 graves in four municipal
cemeteries in Seoul's suburbs. City workers and relatives were
trying to collect and identify remains, a doubly dispiriting task
in a largely Confucian society that honors its ancestors.
	   Hardest hit were Uijongbu, Paju, Dongduchon and Kanghwa,
satellite cities west and north of Seoul. The rains flooded some of
the tributaries of the Han River, which bisects the capital, and
the Imjin River, which flows along the border with North Korea.
	   Some 1,000 American soldiers were evacuated from several small
camps near the border north of Seoul and moved further south. Sgt.
Major Billy Foster of the 2nd Infantry Division called damage to
the camps the worst ``I've seen in one place in my 30-year Army
career.''
	   The cleanup, Foster said, could cost millions of dollars.
``That's not to buy new stuff, that's just to get the camps back
into some semblance of order,'' he said.
	   No American soldiers were reported injured. About 37,000 U.S.
military personnel are stationed in South Korea under a defense
pact signed after the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   About 10 tons of mortar rounds, antipersonnel land mines and
other ammunition were missing after flood waters swept through an
army depot near the border with North Korea, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   Soldiers with mine detectors were combing the area, but
officials feared many of the small, light land mines may have swept
downstream.
	   An unknown number of land mines were also uprooted and swept
away along a portion of the demilitarized zone separating South and
North Korea. The region was declared off limits. As many as a
million mines are believed strewn along the DMZ as a military
deterrent.
	   Operation at Seoul's Kimpo Airport returned to normal Friday,
two days after a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked tarmac, forcing one of the airport's two runways to
close. The runway reopened after the plane was towed away.

New state minister approved in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Parliament on Friday approved the
nominee for state minister, the country's most powerful political
post after the presidency.
	   Vazha Lordkipanidze, previously the republic's ambassador to
Russia, was approved in a landslide vote of 122-2, and is now
second in rank to President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Lordkipanidze said he would push for economic reforms in
Georgia, and said relations with Russia were of ``great importance;
they should be based on equality, mutual esteem.''
	   His appointment is part of a cabinet-shakeup that Shevardnadze
said was necessary to revitalize the former Soviet republic.
	   Georgia struggles under many of the same financial problems as
other former Soviet republics, and has the added problem of a
conflict with separatists in the Black Sea province of Abkhazia.
	   Lordkipanidze has played an active role in negotiations with
Abkhazia, meeting periodically with separatist representatives in
Moscow.

Right-wing leader blamed for Bombay riots justifies his language
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BOM101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A Hindu nationalist leader blamed in a
judicial inquiry report for ordering attacks against Muslims in the
1992-93 Bombay riots described the report Friday as unfair but
justified his inflammatory language.
	   Bal Thackeray, leader of the governing Shiv Sena Party, wields
enormous power in Bombay even though he holds no office of power.
	   More than 2,000 people were killed in nationwide riots, more
than one-third in Bombay alone, after an ancient mosque was razed
by Hindu fundamentalists in northern India in December 1992.
	   During the riots, Thackeray ordered his party workers through
articles in his party newspaper, ``Saamna,'' or Confrontation, to
attack Muslims to avenge the killings of Hindus, the judge said in
his report made public Thursday.
	   Thackeray admitted at a news conference that his speeches and
statements were inflammatory.
	   ``They were bound to be ... At that time the situation was like
that,'' he said ``I may not use that language at this time.''
	   Judge B.N. Srikrishna said in his report that the state
government did not act swiftly to contain the violence, but he
mainly blamed Thackeray.
	   ``He has no proof against me,'' Thackeray said of the judge.
``If there is chaos in Bombay again, can I blame Srikrishna for
this?''
	   The right-wing government, led by the Shiv Sena Party, delayed
making the report public, saying the findings could again trigger
Hindu-Muslim tension. The opposition protested, saying the
government was keeping it secret because it was blamed for the
violence.
	   A debate is planned later in the legislature of Maharashtra
state, where Bombay is the capital.
	   Police in Bombay have been on alert for several days, fearing
clashes between Hindus and Muslims over the findings of the report.
But no violence has been reported so far.

Social Democratic government releases its programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The Czech government officially
released its political and economic programs Friday and will submit
them for a vote of confidence Aug. 18.
	   The 40-page document outlines the specific policies that the new
minority Social Democratic cabinet wants to introduce in the coming
years.
	   The program will stress fighting economic-related crime,
reviving economic growth, completing bank privatization by 2000,
and supporting exports.
	   The government also pledges to review all previous privatization
projects that have even a hint of impropriety. No specific projects
were named.
	   On the political front, the program supports fast integration
into the European Union and NATO in cooperation with Hungary and
Poland. The government would ask for a referendum on EU entry
before the country is admitted, the document states.
	   The center-left Social Democrats won early elections in June,
but secured only 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature. They failed
to find a coalition partner and formed a single-party minority
government with the tacit support of their archrivals, the Civic
Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The Social Democrats built their popularity on sharp opposition
to Klaus' government, blasting economic crime and corruption. They
also were critical of the rapid privatization and easing of price
controls that characterized Klaus' policies.
	   The government needs a simple majority to win the vote of
confidence, which means it will have to gain support of the
Communists or one of the smaller center-right parties that refused
to form a coalition with the Social Democrats.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Suspected bombs exploded outside the U.S.
embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday, killing at
least 50 people, witnesses said.
	   The American ambassador to Kenya was among hundreds injured.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time,'' he said.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, Uganda where vehicles were cleared away.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' said U.S.
Embassy spokesman Gene Bigler said in Italy. ``That's all I can
say.''
	   More than 40 people were killed in the Nairobi explosion, said a
Red Cross worker, who refused to give his name. ``There are too
many dead to count,'' he said.
	   The blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the four-story Ufundi
Cooperative building toward the embassy, which was badly damaged.
Cooperative Bank House, with government and private offices, also
was damaged.
	   In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the
U.S. Embassy parking lot at the same time, witnesses said. At least
nine people were killed and 16 injured, they said. Official
confirmation was not immediately available.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in the
search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   Witness Jim Owens told CNN that Americans were among the
injured.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   ``The U.S. Embassy is very concerned about the nature of this
explosion and is investigating the incident,'' spokesman said Chris
Scharf.
	   The blast shook downtown Nairobi, and shattered windows as far
as a 10 blocks away. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the
streets.
	   Several people were killed aboard two buses that were passing by
at the time of the blast, witnesses said.
	   Rescuers clamored atop a tangle of concrete and metal bars,
clawing through wreckage to try to reach dozens of trapped people,
witnesses said.
	   Passersby helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in their own cars. At least 54 people were being treated at Nairobi
Hospital.

Allegations of fraud in Cambodia's elections mount as ballot
</HEADLINE>
recounts continue

allocation and quotes from opposition politician Sam Rainsy in

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One day after Cambodian leader Hun
Sen warned of a new political crisis, the opposition stepped up
allegations of election fraud and called for a nationwide recount
of ballots from last week's parliamentary elections.
	   ``There have been a lot of irregularities, very serious
irregularities, in different places,'' FUNCINPEC member of
parliament Ahmad Yahya said Friday. ``We want an organized recount
in the whole country, not just one commune here and one there.''
	   He was speaking after a press conference held at FUNCINPEC party
headquarters to highlight concerns about voting and
ballot-counting. The opposition has also complained about a
controversial formula which will be used to allocate parliamentary
seats.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as the winner of the
July 26 election when long-delayed complete preliminary results
were announced Wednesday, but FUNCINPEC and its ally in opposition,
the Sam Rainsy Party, are alleging there was rampant poll fraud.
	   They have threatened to block the formation of the new
government by boycotting the new National Assembly session if their
complaints are not addressed.
	   Hun Sen warned Thursday that if the opposition followed through
on its threat the old National Assembly would have to be dissolved,
forcing a constitutional crisis. He also said he was prepared to
rule on his own.
	   In response to the opposition's complaints, some recounts have
already taken place, but their results have not yet been officially
announced. Election officials on Friday started re-tallying votes
from five more communes in two provinces.
	   FUNCINPEC on Friday continued to report ``grave irregularities
in the handling of ballot boxes'' in several provinces,
``especially the eastern province of Prey Veng.''
	   They pointed to missing seals on bags used to transfer the votes
and ballots which allegedly ``disappeared.''
	   The Sam Rainsy Party also released a statement complaining about
the controversial formula the official National Election Committee
will use to allocate parliamentary seats, calling it ``illegal.''
	   The formula, quietly changed from an earlier calculation, favors
the party getting the most votes in any particular province. In
practice it works to the advantage of the ruling party, which under
the original formula would have won 59 seats, less than a majority.
	   ``The National Election Committee is attempting to replace the
legal formula for seat allocation with another formula that is not
legal, was never presented in public and heavily favors the ruling
Cambodian People's Party,'' the Sam Rainsy Party said.
	   The party called on the international community ``to help ensure
that the will of the Cambodian people is not distorted by a
technical maneuver that has far-reaching political implications.''
	   The election committee has defended the formula, saying it was
legal and aboveboard, and no political parties had protested it
before the election.
	   Cambodia's election came one year after Hun Sen ousted FUNCINPEC
leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat. Hun Sen hoped that, through the polls, he would win back
legitimacy in the international arena and aid lost after his
takeover.

Annan optimistic about Angolan peace as he kicks off Portugal

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
optimistic on Friday that his special envoy to Angola could rescue
the country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said referring to the
meetings held earlier this week by his special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi _ leader the former rebel group UNITA.
	   Annan was speaking after arriving at Porto airport, 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Lisbon, to kick off a five-day
visit to Portugal.
	   During the trip, Annan is to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy. He is also to meet
officials close to peace efforts in Algeria and the former
Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   The U.N. sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an emergency
mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil war, four
years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the Security Council would be discussing Brahimi's
report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped the
council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring the
peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   The Secretary-General's arrival in Portugal had been postponed
for 24 hours due to Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting
in New York to discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons
inspectors. Annan did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan was due to attend the U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in
the northern city of Braga on Friday, before inaugurating a
ministerial conference on youth policy in Lisbon on Saturday.
	   His Friday agenda was also expected to include a meeting with
the high-level mission recently returned from a 10-day tour of
Algeria to investigate the roots of the political violence rocking
that country.
	   The mission, headed by former Portuguese president Mario Soares,
has yet to release its findings.
	   Annan's is also expected to meet President Jorge Sampaio,
Premier Antonio Guterres, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and, on
Sunday, visit to the Expo' 98 World Fair on United Nations Day.
	   He was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.

U.S. envoy: U.S. businessmen disconnected from Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The average American businessman sees little
connection between the Asian economic crisis and business
conditions in the United States, U.S. Ambassador Steven Green said
in an article in a Singapore newspaper Friday.
	   Green said he and other U.S. ambassadors assigned to Southeast
Asia had just returned from a three-week swing through the United
States to talk to businessmen about the region.
	   ``What we all found most remarkable during the tour was the
extent of the `total disconnect' between what's been going on in
Asia and the experiences and perceptions of the average American
businessman,'' Green said in a commentary printed in The Straits
Times.
	   ``While most were vaguely aware of the crisis that has engulfed
Asia, they see very little _ if any _ connection between this
distant crisis and economic conditions in the U.S.,'' he said.
	   Green said the ambassadors had told the U.S. businessmen that
the Asian economic crisis was bound to have a major impact on the
United States, and that the U.S. trade deficit figures have already
shown that.
	   The deficit in May shot up to another record high of dlrs 15.8
billion, he said.
	   Also, U.S. exports declined for the second month in a row to the
lowest level in 15 months, ``primarily due to weak demand across
Asia for U.S. goods and services,'' he wrote.
	   Green also said that Asian economic turmoil is already beginning
to have an effect on markets in Russia and Latin America.
	   His article concluded with an outline of what the United States
is doing to help, but gave no indication of how the U.S.
businessmen had reacted to his arguments about why they should care
about Asia.

Former premier warns of civil war in Central African Republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Former prime minister
Jean-Paul Ngoupande has accused President Ange-Felix Patasse's
government of provoking a potential civil war by stalling
legislative elections scheduled for September in Central African
Republic.
	   Ngoupande, who was fired last year after being accused of
backing the disgruntled soldiers who launched at least three bloody
mutinies against the government, said Thursday the government was
deliberately refusing to equip or fund the country's national
electoral commission.
	   Elections have been scheduled for September 20, although the
electoral commission has complained it is not prepared for it and
needs logistical equipment and at least another dlrs 3.1 million in
funding.
	   Government officials were not immediately available for comment
on the allegations.
	   Ngoupande, who served as prime minister for less than a year,
has since formed an opposition party that has accused the
government of distributing guns to civilians.
	   ``The refusal by President Patasse and the ruling party to
organize the legislative elections illustrates their plan to start
a civil war in the Central African Republic,'' Ngoupande said
Thursday.
	   Holding the elections were the only way to prevent hostilities
in the country, he added.
	   A number of opposition parties have so far boycotted the
election plans, accusing Patasse of trying to manipulate the

Iraqi newspapers seek to put positive spin on standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Seeking to put a positive spin on Iraq's
new dispute with U.N. arms inspectors, official newspapers Friday
focused on Secretary-General Kofi Annan's comments recognizing
Iraq's frustrations with economic sanctions.
	   The Al-Thawra newspaper reported Annan's statement Thursday that
diplomacy should be used to solve the dispute over Iraq's decision
this week to freeze cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   Annan made the comments after the U.N. Security Council termed
Iraq's position ``totally unacceptable.'' It had earlier heard a
report by chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, whose talks with
Iraq collapsed earlier this week.
	   But two Iraqi newspapers _ the only ones printed Friday, the
Muslim sabbath _ did not report the Security Council statement.
	   Instead, Al-Thawra and Al-Iraq published an official Iraqi News
Agency report from New York saying Iraq has informed the Security
Council about its ``legal stand'' and had complained about the U.N.
Special Commission's ``tricks.''
	   Iraq says UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating the
country's weapons of mass destruction, is manipulated by the United
States and is deliberately prolonging its work to keep the
sanctions in place.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of illegal weapons the
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, will not
be lifted. The sanctions ban the free sale of oil, Iraq's main
export.
	   On Thursday, Annan said the Iraqis ``seem to have gained the
view that whatever they do and all their efforts to comply or what
they call satisfactory compliance has not been recognized ... I
think the frustrations came through if not desperation.''
	   Annan said he consulted with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz about the dispute and ``I believe the Iraqi position on this
issue is not a closed one.''
	   ``... It might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely
than we have,'' he added.
	   The Iraqi papers reported these comments and also heaped their
usual criticism on United States.
	   ``We know as well as the whole Arab world that the United
States, not Iraq, is the party which does not implement its
commitments under U.N. resolutions,'' Al-Thawra said.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced Wednesday that UNSCOM
inspectors will no longer be allowed to search for weapons. But he
exempted U.N. monitors, who keep an eye on previously inspected
areas, from the restrictions.
	   On Friday, a U.N. team of monitors headed out as usual to an
undisclosed site for surveillance work, but no inspection teams
were seen leaving the U.N. headquarters.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad were not available for comment.
	   On Thursday, the inspectors were effectively blocked from
working when the Iraqi government told them that no escorts will be
provided. Under a U.N. agreement the inspectors must be accompanied
by Iraqi escorts everywhere they go.

Katayama, Noritake share 2-stroke second-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TANO, Japan (AP) _ Japanese pro golfers Shingo Katayama and
Masakazu Noritake shared a two-stroke lead at 11-under-par 133
Friday in the 100 million yen (dlrs 690,000) Sanko Grand Summer
championship.
	   The 25-year old Katayama, seeking his first title on the Japan
PGA tour, shot seven birdies and one bogey for a 6-under-par 66 on
the 7,066-yard, par-72 Sanko 72 Country Club course.
	   Noritake, 33, also seeking a first PGA tour title, walked off
with five birdies and a single bogey for a 4-under-par 68.
	   Close behind was Hirofumi Miyase with 135 in second place and
Hsieh Chin-sheng of Taiwan with a third place 136.
	   Defending champion Shoichi Kuwabara was tied for fifth place
with nine other golfers, including Paraguay's Carlos Franco, at a
six-under-par 138.
	   A total of 143 players, including 16 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather. But only 65 golfers, including 11 foreigners, made
the cut to advance to the final two rounds of play.
	   The winner will receive 18 million yen (dlrs 124,000).

Nuclear-weapons material talks waiting on Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos GEV102-103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The setting-up of talks on a treaty banning the
production of material used to make nuclear weapons was delayed
Friday to give Israel more time to consider the idea.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, had called a meeting to discuss the proposal
that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on so-called
``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched uranium.
	   But Israeli Ambassador Yosef Lamdan told reporters he was
``still awaiting instructions'' and was ``not in a position to
comment'' on when they would arrive.
	   ``It is a very serious decision that has to be made,'' he added.
	   Maimeskoul said delegates had decided to convene another meeting
Tuesday and were ``very optimistic'' of achieving the necessary
consensus.
	   ``We are pursuing consultations in order to get the result we
want,'' he said.
	   Under international pressure following their test explosions
earlier this year, Pakistan and India have both said they are ready
to engage in negotiations, as have all conference members except
Israel, which is considered an undeclared nuclear power.
	   Lamdan maintained the proposal was ``totally academic until a
few days ago.''
	   In Jerusalem, the Haaretz daily reported that Israel has
promised the United States it will form a final position next week.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied
the United States is putting pressure on Israel to join the treaty,
adding that ``Israel supports the spirit of the treaty but cannot
put it into practice until there is complete regional peace.''
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with countries at the
conference divided on whether they should aim to ban future
production of nuclear-weapons material or also address existing
stockpiles.
	   Pakistan said last week it wants negotiations to deal with
India's stocks.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

Vatican reminds Israel of autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican reminded Israel Friday that it
has the right to name bishops without outside interference. The
reminder came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried
to block the appointment of a Palestinian refugee as the archbishop
of Galilee.
	   Netanyahu said he had taken the unusal step of discussing the
appointment with Vatican officials because he was concerned about
the ``politicization of nominations.''
	   On Friday, the Vatican issued a statement recalling the
provisions of its diplomatic accord with Israel, which guarantees
the autonomy of the church.
	   It said the appointment of Butros Mualem, a Palestinian refugee
now serving as a bishop in Brazil, had been blessed by the pope and
that Greek Catholic bishops had nominated him without any outside
interference.
	   Netanyahu reportedly wanted another bishop, one considered
friendly to the Israeli government, for the Galilee post.
	   In Israel, a security official claimed that Palestinian leaders
had pressured the church to appoint Mualem and that that had
prompted Netanyahu to get involved. The unnamed offical said there
were fears Mualem might incite the Catholic community in Israel.
	   The Greek Catholic community is the largest Christian community
in Israel and the archbishop is its highest-ranking regional
authority.

Police arrest two more suspects in Taiwanese politician's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two suspects in the kidnapping and killing of a
Taiwanese politician have been arrested, but the man suspected of
plotting the crime remained at large, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported Friday.
	   Yang Rongxi was caught Thursday in the northeastern port city of
Dalian and another suspect, Zhao Chuang, surrendered at a police
station in the nearby city of Haicheng, the report said.
	   Xinhua reported earlier that another suspect who was captured
Tuesday had confessed that he was part of a gang of five men who
abducted Lin Ti-chuan, 32, and her boyfriend Wei Dan-kang on July
27.
	   Lin, a city councillor from the Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung,
began having trouble breathing after her captors gave her several
injections and the gang took her to a hospital in Haicheng, where
she died July 29, Huang was quoted as saying.
	   The kidnapping had been an attempt to force payment of business
debts owed by Wei, who escaped and alerted police.
	   Xinhua's report Friday said police were still hunting for Wei's
Chinese business partner, Li Guangzhi, who was suspected of
plotting the kidnapping.
	   Lin's remains were to be returned to Kaohsiung on Saturday.
	   Mindful of the Taiwanese public's sensitivity over such
incidents, China's state media have portrayed officials as anxious
to accommodate Lin's family.
	   Her killing reinforced perceptions in Taiwan that Chinese
officials neglect the safety of Taiwanese in China, where many have
business dealings. Such incidents put a damper on Taiwanese tourism
in China, and some Taiwanese politicians have called for a
suspension of investment and exchanges with China.
	   Both Taipei and Beijing have sought to prevent the incident from
slowing gradual movement toward a renewal of their dialogue, broken
off in 1995.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A U.S. Coast Guard delegation visited a naval base
on the Caspian Sea in Kazakstan, a news agency reported Friday.
	   The commander of the Kazak navy, Ratmir Komratov, said he hoped
the United States could assist him with training and maintaining
his fleet, Russia's Interfax news agency said.
	   This was the second time the U.S. Coast Guard had visited
Kazakstan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia. During the
first visit, they presented Kazakstan with six patrol boats,
Interfax said.

Greece evaluates offers of foreign aid to battle forest fires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighting crews around Europe mobilized
additional help for Greeks exhausted and overwhelmed by the
nation's worst season of forest and brush fires.
	   Germany promised 35 soldiers and four helicopters fitted with
5,000-liter water tanks, the German Defense Ministry said. The
choppers are expected to go into operation on Sunday.
	   Discussions were also under way with Russia and Spain for
aircraft and helicopters, Greek Interior Minister Alekos
Papadopoulos said.
	   The largest blazes Thursday flared in the southern Peloponnese
region, where most areas were placed under a state of emergency.
	   Five Italian and French aircraft helped fight a large fire in
Ilia where flames reportedly threatened five villages.
	   Meanwhile, firefighters managed to keep the blaze away from
Ancient Olympia, the birthplace of the ancient Olympic games.
	   Near Athens on Mount Pendeli, only small pockets of fire
remained of a huge forest and brush blaze. At least one person died
in the inferno, which began last week and consumed large areas of
one of the last wooded areas ringing Athens.
	   The entire Athens area, however, remained under a state of
emergency that allowed officials to close roads and ban public
access to forests. A 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew has been imposed in
the remaining wooded areas of Pendeli.
	   The interior minister also announced an increase in army and
police patrols in high-risk areas throughout the country.
	   Officials suspect arson in many of the fires. In the past, fires
have been set by people hoping to dodge legislation that forbids
building in forest areas. But authorities have also raised
speculation that organized eco-terrorists could have contributed to
the rash of fires.
	   ``We are sure that here some hand started the fires,'' said
Public Order Minister Giorgos Romaios.
	   Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos said no legal mercy would
be shown to suspected arsonists.
	   ``According to the whole-hearted voice of public opinion, (the
fires) did not occur by chance. They are intentional arson. They
are set by organized groups all over the country ... from enemies
of the country,'' Yannopoulos said. He did not elaborate on the
accusations.
	   Forest and brush fires are common during Greece's hot and dry
summers. But this season has been declared one of the worst ever.
	   In July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires were reported compared
with 2,800 for the entire summer season last year, the government
said.

Turkish government ponders reopening casinos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Just six months after it outlawed gambling
casinos, the Turkish government is thinking of opening them again
to lure back tourists.
	   A Tourism Ministry official, Vahit Aras, said Friday that the
Cabinet has ordered the ministry to draft new legislation. He said
the order came after Thursday's Cabinet meeting.
	   Aras said the idea is to set up special gambling areas ``open
only to foreigners.''
	   The government closed down the country's 76 casinos in February
saying they were a haven for money launderers, tax evaders and
gangsters.
	   The ministry says tourism got off to a slow start this year,
although it blames other factors like competition from the World
Cup in France.

Greek dictionary definition of Filipino women causes anger,
</HEADLINE>
soul-searching &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Greek dictionary that defines
Filipino women as housemaids or people with unimportant duties has
provoked widepread anger _ and a bout of soul-searching _ in the
Philippines.
	   ``It's a sad commentary on the status of our women,'' Dominique
Coseteng, one of four women in the 23-member Philippine Senate,
said Friday.
	   Filipinos have been stung by the definition of ``Filipineza'' in
a modern Greek dictionary as a ``domestic worker or a person who
performs non-essential auxiliary tasks.''
	   The government sent a diplomatic note asking Greek authorities
to encourage the author, Greek scholar George Babiniotis, to delete
the entry.
	   More than 6 million Filipinos work overseas, many as maids or
entertainers, because of a shortage of job opportunities at home.
The money they send home is the country's biggest source of foreign
exchange.
	   Many endure daily indignities ranging from verbal abuse to
sexual advances from their employers. But Filipinos at home
generally see them as privileged for being able to work overseas
for higher wages.
	   Manila's archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, even called overseas
Filipinos ``heroes'' for supporting their families and nation.
	   The linguistic flap has caught the attention of President Joseph
Estrada, who called the definition ``totally unacceptable'' and
``severely inaccurate.''
	   ``As much as it is offensive, its negative connotation
downgrades the positive contribution of Filipino women to the
economic and social development of the Philippines and of Greece,''
Estrada said.
	   Others saw some truth in the definition.
	   ``What we should really do is embark on a long-term and
sustainable program so that our women need not go abroad as
domestic helpers,'' Sen. Coseteng said.
	   To accomplish that, the Philippines should provide better
economic conditions at home and equal treatment of women, she said.
	   In 1997, overseas Filipino workers sent home dlrs 5.7 billion
through official channels and much more through other means,
helping soften the effects on the Philippines of the Asian currency
crisis.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Triple Olympic gold medalist Michelle
Smith on Friday vowed to fight a four-year ban imposed for
allegedly tampering with a drug sample and said she would sue
swimming's world governing body, FINA, for compensation.
	   ``It was a blatant attempt to ruin my swimming career,'' the
blonde Irish swimmer said of the ban imposed by FINA on Thursday.
	   ``I will vindicate my innocence. I don't think you can ever
recover completely. I will be seeking substantial damages.
	   ``We now go on to the appeal process which I know will prove my
total innocence in all this.''
	   A FINA doping panel ruled Smith was guilty of tampering with an
out-of-competition urine test taken at her home in Kilkenny in
January. The panel said that the sample had been spiked with a
large quantity of alcohol, probably whiskey, and banned her from
competing for four years.
	   The ban would include the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2001
World Championships and effectively end the 28-year-old swimmer's
career.
	   Reading from a statement at the offices of her lawyer, Peter
Lennon, Smith offered a 13-point criticism of the FINA ruling. But
she emphasized that the presence of alcohol hadn't prevented the
lab from determining that no performance-enhancing drug or signs of
abuse were present.
	   ``I'm really quite angry now and holding my tongue may be a
problem. I know that I am innocent, that I did not tamper with any
sample,'' Smith said in Friday's edition of the Irish Independent.
``Yet I am found to be guilty.
	   ``I'm all in favour of catching the drugs cheats but I have to
send out a clear warning to all athletes, no matter what sport you
are in,'' Smith said. ``If are not protected, you are not safe.
	   ``I had been expecting this sort of outcome since this
outrageous situation arose back in April.
	   ``I thought I had prepared myself for it, but no matter how
prepared I thought I was it still hurt when I finally did hear the
decision.''
	   Smith said she wanted the public to wait until they knew the
facts of her case before they judged her.
	   ``Right now I intend to take my case to the Sports Arbitration
Council (CAS), where all the facts will be presented. CAS is where
I know I will find justice,'' she said.
	   ``It would be optimistic to expect that things could be cleared
up quickly. However, I am not sure that I can wait around much
longer before putting my side of the story.''
	   Smith has faced a skeptical world ever since she defied
conventional wisdom and her own previous mediocre record to win
three gold medals and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   While fans said it demonstrated a triumph of will against the
odds, her detractors alleged the feat must have been aided by
illegal substances.
	   Smith has always denied using performance enhancing drugs and
said she has been subjected to more testing than any of her
competitors.
	   The FINA doping panel judgment emphasized that her original and
her back-up samples taken in January, which were stored and tested
separately, both contained the high-alcohol content.
	   This, it said, ruled out the possibility that anyone other than
Smith had tampered with the samples during transportation or in the
laboratory in Barcelona, Spain.
	   Smith's devoted circle in her native Rathcoole, west of Dublin,
has remained loyal to the woman lauded in local posters as ``our
belle Michelle.''
	   But the articulate, confident redhead has never been able to
translate her Olympic feats into commercial success even in her
native land, where less successful sports stars are national
heroes.
	   Hours before her ban was announced Smith appeared at the Dublin
Horse Show as a celebrity guest on Ireland's Gaelic-language
television channel, a fringe outlet in predominantly
English-speaking Ireland.
	   Since Atlanta the entire foundation of swimming in Ireland has
been tainted by other scandals. Smith's former coach, Derry
O'Rourke, was convicted last year of sexually abusing more than
dozen girls under his direction, though Smith says he never abused
her.
	   A second coach fled to the United States after evading similar
sex-abuse charges. A third coach was convicted of murdering his
wife and niece after fathering a child to another teen-age swimmer.
	   Smith's decision to dump O'Rourke as coach in 1993 proved
pivotal to her career.
	   Her new coach, Dutch discus thrower Erik de Bruin, was then
serving his own four-year ban from competition after testing
positive for excessive testosterone. She married de Bruin and today
credits his coaching methods for her success, though she has vowed
not to reveal what those methods are until she retires.

Netanyahu says trying to `balance' competing demands on pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday
he was trying to strike a balance on how much territory should be
handed over to the Palestinians in the long-delayed Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Also Friday, an Israeli newspaper published maps it said showed
the rival demands being made by right-wing and centrist elements in
Netanyahu's coalition government.
	   The choice is between land in the West Bank hill region, which
is densely populated with Palestinians and where most of the Jewish
settlements are located, and land in the largely unpopulated Judean
desert, which Israel has traditionally wanted to retain for
security reasons.
	   The United States has proposed that Israel give up 13 percent of
the West Bank in this long-delayed troop redeployment. The
Palestinians reluctantly agreed, although they had hoped for much
more territory.
	   Netanyahu for several months rejected the 13 percent as
excessive, on the grounds that too many Jewish settlements in the
West Bank would be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory
as a result.
	   In an attempt to bridge the gap, Netanyahu recently suggested
that three of the 13 percentage points consist of land in the
sparsely populated Judean Desert, which the Palestinians would
receive in the form of two nature reserves where no housing could
be built.
	   This proposal is opposed by the Third Way, a centrist party in
Netanyahu's coalition government. Third Way lawmaker Yehuda Harel
said Israel should retain the Judean Desert both for security
reasons and because very few Palestinians live in it.
	   For more than 30 years, since the 1967 Mideast war, Israel has
maintained that the Jordan Valley and the Judean Desert are vital
for Israel's security, to ensure that no Arab army ever crosses the
Jordan River.
	   Harel said the entire 13 percent withdrawal should be from the
hill region, precisely because that is where most of the
Palestinians live.
	   However if Netanyahu complies with the Third Way's demand,
far-right parties in the coalition threaten to bring down the
government.
	   Interviewed on Israel radio Friday, Netanyahu said security
concerns, not trying to keep his coalition together, were his top
priority. ``A balance has to be found between the two security
considerations,'' he said.
	   Later, he told reporters: ``There is no reason why we can't
achieve an agreement with the Palestinians in short order. It
requires negotiations ... and we're prepared to engage in this.''
	   The two maps appeared in the newspaper Haaretz two days after
Netanyahu submitted to his 12-member security Cabinet maps showing
alternative proposals for the Israeli withdrawal.
	   The prime minister's office refused to confirm whether the maps
published by Haaretz were the maps submitted to the security
Cabinet.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said only that ``these are
not the final maps of the negotiations.''
	   Palestinian officials have already rejected the Judean desert
proposal. Palestinian Cabinet minister Hassan Asfour said the
Palestinians have no objection to accepting existing nature
reserves, but will not agree to set any up for the express purpose
of preventing Palestinians from living there.

Japan's Kido, Nakano share second-round lead in Mizuno Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Japan's Fuki Kido and Aki Nakano shared a
one-stroke lead Friday with two-under-par 142s in the second round
of the 60 million yen (dlrs 414,000) Mizuno Ladies Golf Tournament.
	   Kido, hoping for her first Japan LPGA tour win since 1995, shot
three birdies and one bogey for a 70 on the 6,480-yard, par-72
Asahi Kokusai Tojo Country Club Tojo course.
	   Nakano, who won the Sumitomo Visa Taiheiyo Club Ladies last
week, tapped in three birdies and two bogeys for a 72.
	   Two of Thursday's leaders, Kozue Azuma and Yuka Irie, vied for
second place with current JLPGA money leader Kaori Harada, all
three of whom stood at a one-under-par 143.
	   South Korea's Kim Ai-sook was tied for fourth place with seven
other golfers with a one-over par 145.
	   Play on Friday was disrupted for an hour-and-a-half due to rain.
	   Just 51 players had scores of five-above-par or better, the cut
off for advancement to the next round.
	   The winner will receive 10.8 million yen (dlrs 74,000).

Nuclear-weapons material talks waiting on Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos GEV102-103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The setting-up of talks on a treaty banning the
production of material used to make nuclear weapons was delayed
Friday to give Israel more time to consider the idea.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, called a meeting to discuss the proposal
that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on so-called
``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched uranium.
	   But Israeli Ambassador Yosef Lamdan told reporters he was
``still awaiting instructions'' and was ``not in a position to
comment'' on when they would arrive.
	   ``It is a very serious decision that has to be made,'' he added.
	   Maimeskoul said delegates decided to convene another meeting
Tuesday and were ``very optimistic'' of achieving the necessary
consensus.
	   ``We are pursuing consultations in order to get the result we
want,'' he said.
	   Under international pressure following their test explosions
earlier this year, neighbors Pakistan and India have said they are
ready to engage in negotiations, as have all conference members
except Israel, which is considered an undeclared nuclear power.
	   Lamdan maintained the proposal was ``totally academic until a
few days ago.''
	   In Jerusalem, the Haaretz daily reported Israel has promised the
United States it will form a final position next week.
	   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied
the United States is putting pressure on Israel to join the treaty,
adding that ``Israel supports the spirit of the treaty but cannot
put it into practice until there is complete regional peace.''
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with countries at the
conference divided on whether they should aim to ban future
production of nuclear-weapons material or also address existing
stockpiles.
	   Pakistan said last week it wants negotiations to deal with
India's stocks.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

Xiao &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim extremists have released a
kidnapped Chinese man after 18 days of captivity in the southern
Philippines, the military reported Friday.
	   Xiao Liuliu, 24, was handed over by his captors on Thursday in
Panlima Estimo in Sulu province following negotiations by local
officials, Southern Command spokesman Lt. Col. Horacio Lapinid
said.
	   Lapinid said no ransom was paid but a token amount of money was
given to Xiao's captors, members of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group, for
``board and lodging.''
	   The rebels were allowed to escape after they released Xiao.
	   Xiao was later flown to Davao City where he met with President
Joseph Estrada, who is making his first visit to the southern
Philippines since becoming president in June.
	   Xiao had gone to Sulu to arrange his wedding with Joselyn
Ismael, a Muslim woman he met in Japan.
	   Xiao, whose hometown in China has not been identified, was
talking with Joselyn's father at their home when 10 men dragged him
to a waiting vehicle, police said.
	   The Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for numerous ransom kidnappings
and other attacks in the southern Philippines.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Former Defense Minister Francois Leotard was placed
under formal investigation Friday, one step short of being charged,
in a money-laundering case involving his political party, a Leotard
aide said.
	   Leotard and one of his closest allies, lawmaker Renaud Donnedieu
de Vabres appeared before an investigating judge and were put under
investigation for allegedly breaking political financing laws, the
aide said on condition of anonymity.
	   Both men refused to comment to reporters upon leaving the office
of Judge Laurence Vichnievsky.
	   At the center of the probe is the transfer of 5 million francs
(dlrs 830,000) between banks in Luxembourg and Italy and accounts
opened in 1996 by Leotard's former Republican Party, now called
Liberal Democracy.
	   New hearings were planned next month, the Leotard aide said.
	   Leotard was defense minister under the conservative government
of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur from 1993-95.

Netanyahu says trying to `balance' competing demands on pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday
that he was trying to strike a balance on how much territory should
be handed over to the Palestinians in the long-delayed Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   Also Friday, an Israeli newspaper published maps it said showed
the rival demands being made by right-wing and centrist elements in
Netanyahu's coalition government.
	   The choice is between land in the West Bank hill region, densely
populated with Palestinians and where most of the Jewish
settlements are located, and land in the largely unpopulated Judean
desert, which Israel has traditionally wanted to retain for
security reasons.
	   The United States has proposed that Israel give up 13 percent of
the West Bank in this long-delayed troop redeployment. The
Palestinians reluctantly agreed, although they had hoped for much
more territory.
	   Netanyahu for several months rejected the 13 percent as
excessive, on the grounds that too many Jewish settlements in the
West Bank would be surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory
as a result.
	   In an attempt to bridge the gap, Netanyahu recently suggested
that 3 percent out of the 13 percent consist of land in the
sparsely populated Judean Desert, which the Palestinians would
receive in the form of two nature reserves where no housing could
be built.
	   This proposal is opposed by the Third Way, a centrist party in
Netanyahu's coalition government. Third Way lawmaker Yehuda Harel
said Israel should retain the Judean Desert both for security
reasons and because very few Palestinians live in it.
	   For more than 30 years, since the 1967 Mideast war, Israel has

Jordan River.
	   Harel said the entire 13 percent withdrawal should be from the
hill region, precisely because that is where most of the
Palestinians live.
	   However if Netanyahu complies with the Third Way's demand,
far-right parties in the coalition threaten to bring down the
government.

Former East German agent convicted in 1956 kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German agent was convicted Friday of
being an accessory to the 1956 kidnapping of a suspected U.S. spy
in West Berlin and given a six-month suspended sentence.
	   Harry Mittenzwei, 67, testified in Berlin state court this week
that he organized the kidnapping on orders of superiors who wanted
the man tried in East Germany on espionage charges.
	   In explaining the light sentence, the court said Mittenzwei
didn't order the kidnapping, but merely helped carry it out. His
actions still were illegal, and he should have known a suspected
U.S. spy would face a grim fate in East Germany, the court said.
	   The man, Werner Chrobock, was convicted of espionage in East
Germany and served seven years of a 15-year prison term.
	   Mittenzwei said Chrobock was suspected of recruiting spies for
the defunct U.S. military agency Counter Intelligence Corps in East
Berlin in the 1950s, but fled to West Berlin in 1955.
	   Mittenzwei said he arranged to have other agents of East
Germany's secret police, or Stasi, befriend Chrobock in West Berlin
bars, abduct him and drive him across the border into East Berlin
in 1956.

Mexican was arrested in hotel near Zurich, Swiss say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A former Mexican airline executive
wanted in a massive airline fraud case was arrested in a hotel near
Zurich last weekend, Zurich state police said Friday.
	   The Mexican attorney general's office announced Thursday the
arrest of Gerardo de Prevoisin on an extradition request by Mexico
charging administrative fraud against the country's largest
airline, Aerovias de Mexico, or Aeromexico.
	   It said Mexican officials would complete a petition for
extradition in the next few days.
	   De Prevoisin, charged with a dlrs 60 million fraud, was arrested
Sunday at the hotel in Kuesnacht, near Zurich, police said.
	   He had checked into the hotel under his own name, which was
noticed in a routine check of hotel registrations.
	   Swiss authorities have asked Mexico to make a formal petition
for the extradition of a former airline executive by Aug. 19, said
Folco Galli, spokesman for Switzerland's Office of Police Affairs.
	   Galli said Swiss authorities will meet Friday with Mexican
embassy and judicial officials to discuss the extradition
procedure.
	   Switzerland will ask for legal assurances from Mexico, as there
is no extradition treaty between the two countries, he added.
	   De Prevoisin has been detained in Zurich while extradition
procedures take place.

NATO Council says Kosovo planning nearly ready
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO's top policymaking body discussed
the situation in Kosovo Friday during an informal meeting and took
a look at the current state of NATO planning for military action in
the Serbian Province.
	   The North Atlantic Council, made up of ambassadors from the 16
NATO nations, expressed its ``concern about continuing Serb attacks
and its impact on the civilian population'' in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   The NATO council may hold a formal session next week to approve
plans for military action in and around Kosovo. The plans
essentially involve three options: a preventive deployment of
troops along the borders of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and
Macedonia; a graduated air campaign against targets in Yugoslavia;
and a deployment of peacekeeping troops into Yugoslavia.
	   ``The planning of a wide range of military options has reached a
high state of readiness so that the full range of options is
available and plans can be implemented quickly if necessary,'' a
NATO spokesman said.
	   The NATO ambassadors repeated their call for a negotiated
settlement and rejected violence as a means of pursuing political
aims, either by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic or the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   ``Milosevic has the primary responsibility to protect the human
and political rights of all Yugoslav citizens and his actions are
putting Yugoslavia in direct confrontation with the international
community,'' the spokesman said.
	   ``On the other hand, NATO equally condemns violence of the UCK
(Albanian rebel forces) and members of the international community
do not endorse the aim of an independent Kosovo.''

Greece evaluates offers of foreign aid to battle forest fires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighting crews around Europe mobilized
additional help Friday for Greeks exhausted and overwhelmed by the
nation's worst season of forest and brush fires.
	   Germany promised 35 soldiers and four helicopters fitted with
5,000-liter water tanks, the German Defense Ministry said. The
choppers are expected to go into operation Sunday.
	   Discussions were also under way with Russia and Spain for
aircraft and helicopters, Greek Interior Minister Alekos
Papadopoulos said.
	   The largest blazes Thursday flared in the southern Peloponnese
region, where most areas were placed under a state of emergency.
	   Five Italian and French aircraft helped fight a large fire in
Ilia where flames reportedly threatened five villages.
	   Meanwhile, firefighters managed to keep the blaze away from
Ancient Olympia, the birthplace of the ancient Olympic games.
	   Near Athens on Mount Pendeli, only small pockets of fire
remained of a huge forest and brush blaze. At least one person died
in the inferno, which began last week and consumed large areas of
one of the last wooded areas ringing Athens.
	   The entire Athens area, however, remained under a state of
emergency that allowed officials to close roads and ban public
access to forests. A 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew has been imposed in
the remaining wooded areas of Pendeli.
	   The interior minister also announced an increase in army and
police patrols in high-risk areas throughout the country.
	   Officials suspect arson in many of the fires. In the past, fires
have been set by people hoping to dodge legislation that forbids
building in forest areas. But authorities have also raised
speculation that organized eco-terrorists could have contributed to
the rash of fires.
	   ``We are sure that here some hand started the fires,'' said
Public Order Minister Giorgos Romaios.
	   Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos said no legal mercy would
be shown to suspected arsonists.
	   ``According to the whole-hearted voice of public opinion, (the
fires) did not occur by chance. They are intentional arson. They
are set by organized groups all over the country ... from enemies
of the country,'' Yannopoulos said. He did not elaborate on the
accusations.
	   Forest and brush fires are common during Greece's hot and dry
summers. But this season has been declared one of the worst ever.
	   In July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires were reported compared
with 2,800 for the entire summer season last year, the government
said.

Russian tax officials say crack down on debtors is in the works
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's tax revenues are rising steadily, and the
government is prepared to take on tax deadbeats by freezing their
bank accounts and seizing their property, the nation's
tough-talking tax chief said Friday.
	   In its uphill struggle to increase tax collections, the
government has targeted some of the country's biggest tax-dodgers _
the powerful oil and gas companies.
	   ``If we don't collect taxes ... we will have the same situation
the Soviet government found itself in,'' tax service chief Boris
Fyodorov said Friday. ``It sat around, had no resources, and
pretended that it was governing. This we will not allow.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government has made countless pledges
to improve tax collection, but has consistently failed to raise the
revenues needed to provide basic services and pay millions of state
workers on a timely basis.
	   However, Fyodorov, a wealthy businessman who was recently
appointed to his post, is regarded as a strong-willed figure who's
willing to confront the country's most powerful corporations.
	   To underscore the government's new resolve, the Fuel and Energy
Ministry ruled that access to oil export pipelines would be cut for
two chronic debtors, oil companies Sidanko and Onako.
	   The oil companies and other large firms have argued that the
government is among their biggest customers and has not paid its
bills for oil it has consumed. The companies say they cannot pay
their taxes until the government first pays up.
	   But Fyodorov has shown only limited sympathy for such arguments.
	   His service plans to start seizing assets, replacing management
and lowering top executives' salaries in state-controlled
companies, and initiating bankruptcy proceedings against failing
firms, he said.
	   ``We will take every measure, starting with freezing bank
accounts, seizing assets, seizing property, company cars, offices _
all the way down the line,'' Fyodorov told reporters.
	   He specifically singled out Onako as a target, saying it has
made ``the most dismal impression'' among Russia's oil companies.
Fyodorov vowed to have Onako's management replaced and warned the
state-run company might be put up for a privatization sale.
	   The government has threatened previously to seize the assets of
several oil giants, but never followed through. Fyodorov said that
the debts of some of these companies remain huge, but most are
working to make good on what they owe.
	   Fyodorov conceded that major improvements in government revenues
would only be possible if Russia's economy starts to grow. The
country's economy has been contracting throughout the 1990s.
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved in recent months,
but are still lower than hoped for.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from 12.1 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.9 billion) in July, which in its turn was higher than in
June.
	   ``The figures confirm that we have made a certain progress,''
Fyodorov said.

Annan optimistic about Angolan peace as he kicks off Portugal
</HEADLINE>
visit &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
optimistic Friday that his special envoy to Angola could rescue the
country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said referring to the
meetings held earlier this week by his special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi, leader the former rebel group UNITA.
	   Annan was speaking after arriving at Porto airport, 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Lisbon, to kick off a five-day
visit to Portugal, where he is to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   He is also to meet officials close to peace efforts in Algeria
and the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and
East Timor.
	   The United Nations sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an
emergency mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil
war, four years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the Security Council would be discussing Brahimi's
report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped the
council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring the
peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   Annan's arrival in Portugal had been postponed for 24 hours due
to Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting in New York to
discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons inspectors. Annan
did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan was due to attend the U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in
the northern city of Braga on Friday, before inaugurating a
ministerial conference on youth policy in Lisbon on Saturday.
	   His Friday agenda was also expected to include a meeting with
the high-level mission recently returned from a 10-day tour of
Algeria to investigate the roots of the political violence rocking
that country.
	   The mission, headed by former Portuguese president Mario Soares,
has yet to release its findings.
	   Annan is also expected to meet President Jorge Sampaio, Premier
Antonio Guterres, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and, on Sunday, visit
to the Expo' 98 World Fair on United Nations Day.
	   He was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.

UEFA warns major clubs not to rush into breakaway league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner
on Friday announced plans to meet with major football clubs in an
attempt to head off threats of a breakaway European Super League.
	   Aigner's offer to meet with the clubs comes in the wake of
recent confirmations from Manchester United, Arsenal and Dutch team
Ajax that they are involved in talks on forming a new Super League.
	   Aigner is urging European clubs not to rush into hasty
agreements with any ``private breakaway leagues whose future might
be questionable.''
	   ``I would like to stress to the clubs that it is not the moment
for nerves and haste,'' said Aigner in a written statement. ``They
should not be afraid of missing the train.
	   ``Our route to the future is based on consultation and
cooperation,'' Aigner continued. ``So there is no need for any club
to be pushed into signing an agreement which it might regret
afterwards.''
	   In search of a peaceable resolution, Aigner said the meetings
would serve to exchange points of view regarding the future of
European club competition.
	   Threatened by the possible creation of a new league _ which
would effectively wipe out UEFA's Champions League _ both FIFA and
UEFA, soccer's world and European governing bodies, have warned
that clubs and players involved in a breakaway could be kicked out
from international competition.
	   The English Premier League has also threatened to ban any clubs
which join without permission.
	   According to FIFA, any competition has to be organized by the
recognized soccer authorities, in this case UEFA.
	   However, legal experts say it might be impossible to halt the
league, protected by restraint-of-trade laws.
	   A Super League is an enticing prospect for European teams, with
the clubs involved promised more money from TV and advertising than
they currently receive from UEFA competitions.
	   Clubs would also be guaranteed a permanent place in the league,
without having to requalify every year as for the UEFA tournaments.
	   UEFA committees will meet among themselves at the end of August
to deal with the Super League matter, the statement said.

Anwar: Debt restructuring committee to help economic recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
announced Friday the framework of a Corporate Debt Restructuring
Committee which will aim to relieve the debt burden of foundering
companies and help accelerate Malaysia's economic recovery.
	   The committee will allow a 60-day moratorium that gives troubled
companies and their creditors _ both foreign and domestic _ time to
reach a compromise on how to reschedule and restructure debt.
	   Anwar said that the debt workout will be on a voluntary basis. A
full-time secretariat will be set up at Bank Negara (Central Bank)
to help the committee, he said.
	   The new body has no legal status, and works as an alternative to
companies seeking court protection from creditors while they
restructure. Already, 21 listed companies have been granted court
protection under Section 176 of Malaysia's Companies Act.
	   The committee, chaired by the central bank's deputy governor
Fong Weng Phak, will be appointed by Bank Negara and will comprise
representatives from the Finance Ministry as well as legal and
banking experts from the private sector.
	   It will start working from August 17, and will continue to
operate until the end of next year or earlier, as decided by the
committee.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Not for immediate circulation, Finance
Minister Theo Waigel on Thursday minted a test run of euro coins to
be issued when 11 European nations adopt a single currency.
	   Monetary union begins Jan. 1, but new coins and bills won't go
into circulation until 2002.
	   Each of the 11 nations joining the currency union will mint
coins incorporating national symbols. Germany alone will circulate
more than 12.1 billion marks (dlrs 6.8 billion) worth of coins.
	   Actual production of the German version of the coins will start
early next year.

	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Darren Gough gave England an important
breakthrough before lunch to bowl the home side back into the fifth
cricket test on Friday.
	   Gough ended a threatening third-wicket stand between Jacques
Kallis, 25 not out, and Daryll Cullinan (27) after Angus Fraser had
dismissed both openers in the space of 28 balls on the second
morning.
	   South Africa bowled England out for 230 on the first day but
also struggled on the uneven Headingley pitch to go into lunch at
88 for three.
	   With the odd ball keeping dangerously low, South Africa was made
to work for every run by England's four-pronged medium pace attack.
	   Resuming on nine for no loss, South Africa lost Gary Kirsten (6)
and Gehardus Liebenberg (21) in Fraser's first spell of the day.
	   Kirsten was unlucky when Pakistani umpire Javed Akhtar adjudged
him leg before wicket, when the ball appeared to bounce over the
stumps.
	   Liebenberg, who had occupied the crease for just over an hour
for his 42-ball innings, pushed forward to Fraser and Graeme Hick
completed a good reflex catch at second slip.
	   Kallis and Cullinan put on 47 runs in 54 minutes before Gough
made the breakthrough.
	   Gough, returning for his second spell, forced Cullinan to chase
a wide delivery and found the edge enroute to wicketkeeper Alec
Stewart.
	   Skipper Hansie Cronje (four not out) kept Kallis company for 17
minutes before the break.
	   Fraser's two wickets have cost him 16 runs in 10 overs while
Gough has 1-19 in 11.

Forest group's profit triples to dlrs 185 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Metsa-Serla, a leading European forest
products company, more than tripled its first-half pretax profit to
1billion markkaa (dlrs 185 million), because of higher prices and
strong demand.
	   The concern's net sales grew during January to June to 10.9
billion markkaa (dlrs 2.0 billion), from 8.8 billion markkaa during
the same period in 1997, Metsa-Serla said Friday.
	   The pretax profit for the first six months of 1997 was 306
million markkaa.
	   Delivery volumes and sale prices for all main products were at a
clearly higher level than in the same period a year ago,
Metsa-Serla said.
	   The first-half profit nearly equals the company's full-year 1997
figure of 1.01 billion markkaa. That was a strong improvement over
previous years and the company said it was benefitting from
improved cost-effectiveness and the successful incorporation of
newly acquired companies into the concern.
	   Metsa-Serla employs 14,000 people, up from 13,000 a year
earlier.

Smith proclaims her innocence, says she'll sue for compensation

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Triple Olympic gold medalist Michelle
Smith on Friday vowed to fight a four-year ban imposed for
allegedly tampering with a drug sample. Accusing FINA, swimming's
world governing body, of a conspiracy to end her career, she said
she'll sue for compensation.
	   ``It was a blatant attempt to ruin my swimming career,'' the
blonde Irish swimmer said of the ban imposed by FINA on Thursday.
	   ``I will vindicate my innocence. I don't think you can ever
recover completely. I will be seeking substantial damages.
	   ``We now go on to the appeal process which I know will prove my
total innocence in all this.''
	   A FINA doping panel ruled Smith was guilty of tampering with an
out-of-competition urine test taken at her home in Kilkenny in
January. The panel said that the sample had been spiked with a
large quantity of alcohol, probably whiskey, and banned her from
competing for four years.
	   The ban would include the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2001
World Championships and effectively end the 28-year-old swimmer's
career.
	   Reading from a statement at the offices of her lawyer, Peter
Lennon, Smith offered a 13-point criticism of the FINA ruling. But
she emphasized that the presence of alcohol hadn't prevented the
lab from determining that no performance-enhancing drug or signs of
abuse were present.
	   In her statement, Smith said FINA's action ``can only be
described as a blatant and mischievous attempt to ruin my swimming
career and my international standing.
	   ``In the course of work that he did in this case Peter Lennon
has uncovered a significant body of evidence which leads one to the
undeniable conclusion that it has been the intention of FINA to
ensure that by whatever method I should take no further part in
swimming and particularly should not be allowed to compete at the
Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.
	   ``I firmly believe that there has been a concerted effort on the
part of FINA to ensure that I did not swim again and to ensure that
by whatever method available to them a ban would be imposed.''
	   Lennon described FINA's finding that she manipulated the doping
sample as ``absolutely bizarre'' and said the next step was to
appeal to the Sports Arbitration Court in Lausanne.
	   ``They have produced no evidence to support this conviction, it
is as simple as that,'' said Lennon who hoped the appeal
proceedings would begin within four to six weeks.
	   Smith has faced a skeptical world ever since she defied
conventional wisdom and her own previous mediocre record to win
three gold medals and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   While fans said it demonstrated a triumph of will against the
odds, her detractors alleged the feat must have been aided by
illegal substances.
	   Smith has always denied using performance enhancing drugs and
said she has been subjected to more testing than any of her
competitors.
	   The FINA doping panel judgment emphasized that her original and
her back-up samples taken in January, which were stored and tested
separately, both contained the high-alcohol content.
	   This, it said, ruled out the possibility that anyone other than
Smith had tampered with the samples during transportation or in the
laboratory in Barcelona, Spain.
	   Smith's devoted circle in her native Rathcoole, west of Dublin,
has remained loyal to the woman lauded in local posters as ``our
belle Michelle.''
	   But the articulate, confident redhead has never been able to
translate her Olympic feats into commercial success even in her
native land, where less successful sports stars are national
heroes.
	   Her coach, Dutch discus thrower Erik de Bruin, was serving his
own four-year ban from competition after testing positive for
excessive testosterone when he took over the running of her
training.
	   She married de Bruin and today credits his coaching methods for
her success, though she has vowed not to reveal what those methods
are until she retires.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Simultaneous bombs exploded outside the
U.S. embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday, killing
at least 50 people and injuring more than 1,000, officials said.
	   Americans were among the dead, and the U.S. ambassador to Kenya
was injured, the State Department said. More than 40 were killed
and 1,000 wounded in Nairobi, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina
Galbe. Witnesses said at least nine were killed and 16 hurt in

	   ``Once the rubble is cleared further we expect to find more
bodies,'' Galbe said.
	   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed bombs
caused the two explosions.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' U.S. Embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler said in Italy. ``That's all I can say.''

	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the
U.S. Embassy parking lot, witnesses said. At least nine people were
killed and 16 injured, they said. Official confirmation was not
immediately available.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in the
search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was awakened before dawn and told of
the bomb attacks.
	   ``He's watching it very closely,'' an administration official
said. ``Obviously, at this point (the reaction is) shock. ``We're
just trying to get more information.''
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   The blast shook downtown Nairobi, and shattered windows as far
as a 10 blocks away. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the
streets.
	   Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said.
	   Rescuers clamored atop a tangle of concrete and metal bars,
clawing through wreckage to try to reach dozens of trapped people,
witnesses said.
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,000 people were being treated in three
hospitals.

Philippine president seeks release of ship's crew allegedly
</HEADLINE>
kidnapped in Malaysia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he will seek the help of the Malaysian government in
freeing 22 Filipinos who were allegedly taken by pirates to an
island near Borneo after their boat sank four months ago.
	   Estrada ruled out paying ransom in exchange for the freedom of
the 15 crewmen and seven passengers of the 275-ton Virgin Pearl who
were allegedly taken by pirates to Nunukan Timur island.
	   Relatives say the pirates have asked for 1 million pesos (dlrs
23,800) for each hostage.
	   The ship was en route to the port city of Davao from Manado,
Indonesia, on April 4 when rough seas damaged its wooden hull,
reportedly causing it to sink near Balut Island in the Philippines.
	   The coast guard said its crew and passengers were picked up by a
passing ship which sailed to an undisclosed destination. Two of its
crewmen were later found dead near Sabah and the rest remained
missing.
	   Following the discovery of the two bodies, the Philippine and
Malaysian navies launched searches but gave up after several weeks.
	   Relatives of the missing crewmen and passengers said Thursday
they have received reports that their relatives were seen alive in
Nunukan.
	   They said a pirate emissary had contacted the owner of the ship
and claimed the pirates have the ship and crew and demanded money
for their release.
	   Former Muslim rebel leader Nur Misuari, who is now governor of a
Muslim autonomous region in the southern Philippines, offered to
verify the report and promised to work for the release of the
hostages if the report is true.
	   Meanwhile, Philippine Commodore Adolf Borje said Malaysian naval
officials attending a border patrol meeting in the central city of
Cebu promised to try to verify the report and ask Malaysian police
to conduct a land search in Nunukan.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
party refused an invitation Friday to meet a leader of the military
regime because she was forbidden from attending, the party said.
	   The invitation came after Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize, demanded that the government remove security personnel
stationed at her home, a new challenge to the military's authority
ahead of Saturday's anniversary of nation-wide anti-government
protests Aug. 8, 1988.
	   Anticipation has been high in Myanmar, also known as Burma, of
new tensions marking what is commonly known as 8-8-88, though there
has been no visible increase of troops in the capital.
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy issued a statement
saying that the party had declined an invitation to meet the deputy
home minister, Brig. Gen. Myint Maung, on Saturday.
	   The invitation was addressed to NLD Chairman Aung Shwe and said
he could bring any NLD official he liked _ except Suu Kyi or the
two party vice chairmen, Tin Oo and Kyi Maung, the NLD said.
	   ``Since the purpose of the meeting was not mentioned in the
letter, and also because the party cannot accept the conditions ...
the invitation was declined by the party,'' the statement said.
	   Government officials met Aung Shwe last year but have
steadfastly refused to see Suu Kyi, the party's secretary general
and an international symbol of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, has painted
Suu Kyi as selfish and stubborn for insisting that no meeting with
her party be held without her. The party accuses the government of
trying divide-and-rule tactics.
	   Suu Kyi's request for the dismissal of the security detail
represents the deepest deterioration in her relations with the
government since she was released from six years of house arrest in
July 1995. She still remains largely confined to her home.
	   The squad remained Friday, but party members said upon leaving
Suu Kyi's compound that the personnel had put their gear on trucks
in preparation to depart. There had been no change in numbers.
	   A government spokesman said in a press release that authorities
were ``happy to comply and discussions are now under way.''
	   Suu Kyi left home Friday to meet supporters at the party office.
Earlier, a party statement said she had sent a letter to the
government July 31 asking for the detail's removal.
	   The NLD said that since the government did not comply, Suu Kyi
gave the unit 20 minutes' notice Thursday to leave her compound or
``be treated as trespassing.''
	   Upon her release in 1995, Suu Kyi asked to government to keep
some of her former guards at her compound. The party said it showed
willingness to work with the government and made the military
responsible for her safety.
	   The detail, however, has other functions. Diplomats told the
Associated Press in Bangkok that its duties include reporting on
Suu Kyi's activities. Authorities also keep a house across the
street to monitor visitors and movements.
	   The detail follows her when she attempts to leave her home, and
has at times stopped her, the diplomats said.
	   That includes three incidents during July when Suu Kyi attempted
to leave Yangon to meet party members. During the last incident,
party leaders said the authorities manhandled Suu Kyi and dragged
her back home against her will after a six-day standoff.
	   The higher-profile confrontations and Saturday's sensitive
anniversary come ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline set by Suu Kyi for
the ruling State Peace and Development Council to allow the
parliament elected in 1990 to finally convene.
	   The election was overwhelmingly won by the NLD, but the military
refused to relinquish power and has instead embarked on a
years-long process to craft a new constitution that the NLD is
boycotting.
	   The National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma,
representing exiled legislators, issued a statement Friday urging
``the entire people to participate, unanimously on a nationwide
scale, in the effort to have the parliament convened by Aug. 21, by
holding fast to the spirit of the Four-8 movement.''

Former top Spanish banker out of jail on weekend furlough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Despite criticism from opposition parties,
former high-flying banker Mario Conde was allowed leave jail Friday
on his first weekend furlough since being convicted on embezzlement
charges.
	   Once a leading financier who hobnobbed with King Juan Carlos,
Conde began serving a sentence of four years and two months in
February for misappropriating funds from a firm connected to his
former bank, Banesto.
	   Along with 10 other former Banesto directors and associates, he
is also currently on trial for other charges relating to the
alleged mismanagement of the bank and for which he could face a
sentence of more than 40 years.
	   Earlier this week, prison authorities agreed that Conde should
be allowed out of jail two weekends each month.
	   The leading opposition Socialist party and other groups have
accused the conservative government Prime Minister, Jose Maria
Aznar, of giving Conde preferential treatment because of his close
ties with the banker in the past.
	   The National Prison Directorate said its decision was routine
for a case such as Conde's, involving a nonviolent crime with a
relatively short sentence and good behavior by the inmate.
	   With his slicked-back hair and high-society friends, Conde was
for many a garish symbol of the get-rich-quick mentality that
characterized much of Spanish business in the 1980s.
	   The former Socialist government oversaw the Bank of Spain's
seizure of Banesto in 1993 after a massive shortfall in funds was
found in the bank's books.

Barcelona to test out South Korean defender in De Boer's absence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ FC Barcelona is to try out South Korea's
World Cup defender, Yoo Sang Chul, as a possible alternative to
wanted Dutch star Frank de Boer, news reports said Friday.
	   According to the Barcelona-based sports daily El Mundo
Deportivo, the 26-year-old defender who plays for Ulsan-Hyundai is
scheduled to arrive Sunday.
	   The Spanish league champion's Dutch coach, Louis Van Gaal, has
said Barcelona badly needs a left-footed central defender and De
Boer is the ideal choice. His hopes of signing the Netherlands'
international, however, have been dashed so far by Ajax of
Amsterdam's insistence that the player should fulfill his contract
until 2004 with the club.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday,
toppling a four-story building and killing at least 50 people. More
than 1,000 others were injured, officials said.
	   Americans were among the dead, and the U.S. ambassador to Kenya
was injured, the State Department said. More than 40 were killed
and 1,000 wounded in Nairobi, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina
Galbe. Witnesses said at least nine were killed and 16 hurt in
Tanzania.
	   ``Once the rubble is cleared further we expect to find more
bodies,'' Galbe said.
	   The blast shook downtown Nairobi, and shattered windows as far
as a 10 blocks away. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the
streets.
	   Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said.
	   Rescuers clamored atop a tangle of concrete and metal bars,
clawing through wreckage to try to reach dozens of trapped people,
witnesses said.
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,000 people were being treated in three
hospitals.
	   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed bombs
caused the two explosions.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' U.S. Embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler said in Italy. ``That's all I can say.''
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the
U.S. Embassy parking lot, witnesses said. At least nine people were
killed and 16 injured, they said. Official confirmation was not
immediately available.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in the
search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was awakened before dawn and told of
the bomb attacks.
	   ``He's watching it very closely,'' an administration official
said. ``Obviously, at this point (the reaction is) shock. ``We're
just trying to get more information.''
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   No figures were available on the number of dead Americans, said
U.S. embassy spokesman Chris Scharf in Nairobi.

Doubts about Kohl's successor cause uncertainty in Bonn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hints that the man whom Helmut Kohl wants to
replace him eventually as chancellor doesn't really want the job
set off new political jockeying Friday, less than two months before
national elections.
	   Kohl, who is seeking a fifth term, said last fall that he wanted
his parliamentary leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, to succeed him in the
chancellery someday.
	   But Schaeuble's wife, Ingeborg, told Stern magazine this week
she had ``very great reservations'' about her husband ever becoming
chancellor.
	   ``I think it's an office that takes a huge amount of energy and
would leave him even less elbowroom,'' she said. ``And aside from
that, I don't think it would be easy to sell the public on a
picture of a chancellor in a wheelchair.''
	   Schaeuble has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was
shot by a crazed assailant during a campaign appearance in 1990.
	   The campaign manager for the opposition Social Democrats, Franz
Muentefering, said Mrs. Schaueble would not have made such comments
so close to the Sept. 27 election without checking with her husband
first.
	   That indicates, he said, that Schaeuble ``doesn't want to be
Kohl's crown prince any more.''
	   If Schaeuble stepped aside, Kohl's ambitious defense minister,
Volker Ruehe, would become the favorite.
	   Adding to the uncertainty, Social Democratic candidate Gerhard
Schroeder, who is leading Kohl in the polls, told an interviewer
he'd rather work with Ruehe anyway if it came to a ``grand
coalition'' between his party and Kohl's after the election.
	   Some political analysts believe such an outcome is increasingly
likely, but Kohl insists he would ``not be available'' for such a
partnership. If Kohl stepped down as party chairman, Schaeuble
would likely take his place.
	   Schroeder, however, told Die Zeit weekly newspaper that he found
Schaeuble ``very conservative,'' while Ruehe was ``maybe more open
for the opposing side to begin with.''
	   Ruehe called Schroeder's praise a ``red herring'' meant to
divert attention away from his true intention: a coalition with the
ecology-minded Greens party.
	   The Greens have raised voter ire in recent months with such
proposals as raising gasoline taxes and imposing speed limits on
the autobahns.

Muslim students demand investigation of 1984 killings in Jakarta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of Muslim students staged a
protest at the defense ministry Friday, demanding new
investigations into a riot that left more than a dozen Muslims dead
in the Indonesian capital 14 years ago.
	   Waving banners and posters, about 100 students accused
ex-President Suharto, former Vice President Try Sutrisno and former
Armed Forces Commander Benny Murdani of being responsibility for
the killings. All three are retired army generals.
	   On Sept. 12, 1984, soldiers opened fire on protesters demanding
the release of several Muslims arrested following a series of
anti-government sermons at mosques in northern Jakarta.
	   Some reports say the clash in Jakarta's impoverished port area
of Tanjung Priok, left scores dead and hundreds missing.
	   Murdani, then armed forces commander, said 18 people were killed
and nobody was missing. Sutrisno was then chief of Jakarta Military
Command.
	   The students of the Islamic Preacher Institute, said an
immediate probe into the case would serve as proof that the current
government under President B.J. Habibie was not a continuation of
the authoritarian Suharto regime.
	   Demands for independent investigations of alleged human rights
violations, including killing by the military, have flared up since
Habibie came to power.
	   His predecessor, Suharto, had ruled the country with an iron
fist for more than three decades.
	   Suharto resigned May 21 amid violence and student-led protest
against his authoritarian rule.

No talks yet in ambulance strike crippling emergency care in
</HEADLINE>
Vladivostok &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE ECKEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ A strike by ambulance workers and
paramedics crippled emergency services in the Far Eastern port of
Vladivostok for a fourth day on Friday, and there were no signs of
compromise.
	   Workers said four of the city's 30 ambulance teams were
responding to life-threatening calls and those involving babies and
pregnant women, and that no one had died as a result of their
action.
	   But all other callers were being referred to outpatient clinics
or given advice over the telephone.
	   The workers are demanding wages that have not been paid for
months, and in some cases, more than a year, and more funding for
emergency medical equipment.
	   ``How many times have we asked `Who will finance us?''' asked
Dr. Larisa Lazarevna, the duty physician at the main city ambulance
station Friday night.
	   ``Neither the krai (regional government), nor the city have
responded. Here we are on the fourth day, and not one authority has
even approached us to discuss the situation. Thank God there
haven't been any deaths.''
	   The Vladivostok prosecutor's office opened a criminal
investigation Wednesday into the city government's failure to
finance the ambulance service.
	   Mayor Viktor Cherepkov says he doesn't have the money and that
emergency services should be paid for by the region's compulsory
medical insurance program.
	   But Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko issued a decree earlier this year
declaring that cities are responsible for funding their own
ambulances and paramedics.
	   The mayor and the governor have been locked in a political feud
for years, and the city's economy and infrastructure have suffered
as a result.
	   Vladivostok's ambulance workers have held periodic one- and
two-day strikes in the past year to protest overdue wages, but they
have always returned to the job afterward. This week they vowed to
stay off the job until their demands are met.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their salaries months late
due to a chronic cycle of non-payments that has plagued the country
for years.
	   Protests over back wages have swept over Russia in recent
months. But the protests have rarely been coordinated, and workers'
pay is still arriving months late.

Galbe. Witnesses said at least nine were killed and 16 hurt in
Tanzania.
	   ``Once the rubble is cleared further we expect to find more
bodies,'' Galbe said.
	   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed bombs
caused the two explosions. The State Department called the blasts,
which occurred five minutes apart, ``terrorist attacks.''
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal looking for victims, calling out and waving their arms for
help to free trapped people.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Dazed and
bloody survivors lay on the ground until led away.
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,000 people were being treated in three
hospitals.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S.
Embassy parking lot, witnesses said. At least nine people were
killed and 16 injured, they said. Official confirmation was not
immediately available.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in the
search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   Witness Jim Owens, who was at a meeting inside the embassy when
the bomb went off, told CNN that Americans were among the injured.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' he said. He said one woman was injured
when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' U.S. Embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler said in Italy. ``That's all I can say.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was awakened before dawn and told of
the bomb attacks.
	   ``He's watching it very closely,'' an administration official
said. ``Obviously, at this point (the reaction is) shock. ``We're
just trying to get more information.''
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   No figures were available on the number of dead Americans, said
U.S. embassy spokesman Chris Scharf in Nairobi.

Banyamulenge soldiers refused refugee status in Zambia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) - A small number of rebel Congolese soldiers
have fled to Zambia and want to move on to Rwanda, which is
dominated by their fellow Tutsis.
	   Zambia's Commissioner for Refugees at the Ministry of Home
Affairs Eric Tukumbe said Friday his ministry was ``discussing with
relevant authorities'' to decide whether the rebel soldiers should
go to Rwanda or remain in Zambia.
	   He said by Thursday 68 Congolese Tutsi -- called Banyamulenge --
fighters had entered Zambia and all had been disarmed before
location by the authorities at Kitwe, northern Zambia.
	   The Banyamulenge have joined with some army units in a rebellion
against Congo President Laurent Kabila, who has accused Rwanda of
helping the rebels.
	   ``The Banyamulenge soldiers have said that they do not want to
stay in Zambia, but that they be repatriated to Rwanda. We are
considering them as people in transit because we cannot impose
refugee status on them,'' Tukumbe said.
	   The Inter-African Network for Human Rights and Development
Thursday urged governments not to support Kabila's government
because it was ``a dictatorship.''
	   Executive Director Ngande Mwanajiti warned that Congo was
sliding into anarchy and the situation was likely to degenerate,
leaving no basis for ``supporting an illegitimate regime.''

Judge blocks unauthorized Delon biography, before it's written
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Actor Alain Delon has persuaded a French judge to
block an unauthorized biography of him even before it's written.
The publisher is complaining of creeping censorship.
	   The 62-year-old star demanded to read an 18-page synopsis of the
book and decided ``spelunkers of the garbage can and investigators
in the gutter must be stopped from causing damage,'' he said in
Friday's France-Soir.
	   After a hearing, Judge Marie-Claude Domb on Wednesday banned the
book at least until another hearing Oct. 14.
	   In her ruling, the judge noted what she called ``the gravity of
the attacks on intimacy and privacy.'' Author Bernard Violet faces
a 30,000-franc (dlrs 5,000) fine per infraction if he goes ahead
with the book.
	   Violet reportedly did not show up at Monday's hearing and was
not immediately available for comment.
	   There's no word on what was in the outline, but after reading
it, the star of ``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers'' said
he ``will let no one sully me.''
	   The book's publishers, Editions Grasset, accused Delon of
``reinventing the process'' of determining a book to be damaging.
	   Grasset's director, Denis Bourgeois, told France-Soir he was
surprised ``that one can ban something that hasn't been done.''
	   Still, Grasset has decided not to publish Violet's proposed
book. Delon took action to prevent anyone else from printing it.
	   French judges have banned other books in recent years, including
one by a former doctor to the late President Francois Mitterrand
that said the president lied to the public about his cancer.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A split was reported in President Robert
Mugabe's cabinet Friday over an investigation into fraud claims
involving a fund for those injured in the 1972-80 war to overthrow
white rule in former Rhodesia.
	   High Court judge Godfrey Chidyausiku has issued a report into
fraudulent claims on the 450 million Zimbabwean dollars (dlrs 28
million) fund.
	   ``The report has been the subject of heated debate in Cabinet
between those calling for caution, in anticipation of an
ex-combattants' backlash, and others who insist on the process of
law,'' reported the Zimbabwe Mirror, whose editor, Ibbo Mandaza, is
a member of the ruling Zanu party central committee.
	   One of the most the most controversial pay outs was 800,000
Zimbabwean dollars (dlrs 50,000) to Mugabe's brother-in-law, Reward
Marufu. Some 60 percent of claimants based their demands on
``invisible injuries,'' the report said.
	   At a press conference Thursday restricted to representatives of
Zimbabwe's state-controlled media, Labour and Social Welfare
Minister Florence Chitauro said attempts would be made to recover
money fraudulently claimed, and to check future abuses.
	   -----
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Human rights group Amnesty
International has urged Republic of Congo to allow an independent
probe of genocide claims during the central African country's civil
war last year.
	   Speaking to reporters Thursday in the capital Brazzaville,
Godfrey Byaruhanga, who is leading an Amnesty International
fact-finding mission, said an independent probe was essential to
establish the rule of law in the country.
	   After President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's forces ousted his
predecessor, Pascal Lissouba, last October following a five-month
civil war, the new president vowed to persecute his opponents, whom
he accused of mass killings.
	   But the country still has no legislation or institutions to
handle the matter of persecuting war criminals.
	   More than 10,000 people were killed during the conflict which
broke out after ousted President Pascal Lissouba tried to disarm
Nguesso's private militia prior to presidential elections that both
men planned to contest.
	   Byaruhanga said Amnesty International was also interested in
investigating allegations of human rights abuses by Sassou
Nguesso's government, including reports of torture and summary
executions of opponents.
	   The rights group had urged the country's information minister to
remove existing curbs on press freedoms.
	   ------
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Police in Nigeria's capital of Abuja have
arrested the contractor and engineer responsible a building which
collapsed during construction work earlier this week, killing at
least two people.
	   Three other people are wanted for arrest in connection with the
accident Sunday, which occurred when the first floor of the
building near the capital of Abuja caved in, police spokesman Kene
Onwuemelie said Friday.
	   The arrested men, who allegedly bolted from the scene of the
accident, are expected to be charged with criminal negligence
causing death.
	   Rescue efforts were called off Thursday evening after searchers
scouring through the debris of the building failed to turn up more
bodies.
	   The collapsed building was part of a huge housing complex about
20 kilometers (12 miles) from Abuja.
	   Construction accidents are fairly common in Nigeria, where the
industry is known for corruption and incompetence.
	   -------
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ U.S.-based oil giant Exxon
will begin drilling offshore early next year under an exploration
permit granted by Republic of Congo's former government and renewed
by the new one, a company spokesman said.
	   Under the deal signed with the Congolese government in 1996,
about 60 percent of the proceeds _ expected to eventually reach
about 300 million barrels a day _ will go to Exxon while the
government will receive 40 percent of the profits.
	   President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's government came to power last
October after a five-month rebel war that ended in the ouster of
the country's elected president, Pascal Lissouba.
	   Lissouba has accused France of giving monetary and military
support to Sassou-Nguesso in a bid to win lucrative oil drilling
rights for several French companies.
	   Exxon is a partner in several other exploration contracts in the
oil-rich central African country with other companies such as
Shell, Elf and Agip.

FIFA refuses to extend deadline for Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Friday refused to extend a
midnight deadline for the Polish Football Association to resolve
its dispute with the government.
	   FIFA and UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, are demanding that
Poland's sport minister Jacek Debski reinstate Polish Soccer
Federation administrators he suspended in May after they refused to
submit to an investigation into accusation of mismanagement.
	   In a fax to the Polish Federation President Marian Dziurowicz,
FIFA insisted that if the suspensions imposed on the Polish F.A.
committee members are not lifted by the midnight Aug. 7 deadline,
the national association will be suspended indefinitely as of the
next day.
	   Such a suspension would mean that Polish clubs and national
teams could not take part in any international competitions.
	   Poland's sports minister argues that FIFA cannot expect Poland
to cease applying its own laws in order to follow FIFA regulations,
while the international federations argue that national soccer
unions should remain independent from the government.
	   Debski added that administrators would be immediately reinstated
if a government investigation of union files concludes all is in
order.
	   In a statement, FIFA said it hoped that the disagreement would
be satisfactorily resolved in time to avoid a suspension.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday,
toppling a four-story building and killing at least 50 people. More
than 1,000 others were injured, officials said.
	   Americans were among the dead, and the U.S. ambassador to Kenya
was injured, the State Department said. More than 40 were killed
and 1,000 wounded in Nairobi, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina
Galbe. Witnesses said at least nine were killed and 16 hurt in
Tanzania.
	   ``Once the rubble is cleared further we expect to find more
bodies,'' Galbe said.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However the Islamic Jihad
vowed last week to strike American interests because some of its
members were arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt,
according to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language
newspaper published in London.
	   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed bombs
caused the two explosions. The State Department called the blasts,
which occurred five minutes apart, ``terrorist attacks.''
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal looking for victims, calling out and waving their arms for
help to free trapped people.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Dazed and
bloody survivors lay on the ground until led away.
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,000 people were being treated in three
hospitals.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S.
Embassy parking lot, witnesses said. At least nine people were
killed and 16 injured, they said. Official confirmation was not
immediately available.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in the
search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   Witness Jim Owens, who was at a meeting inside the embassy when
the bomb went off, told CNN that Americans were among the injured.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' he said. He said one woman was injured
when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' U.S. Embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler said in Italy. ``That's all I can say.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was awakened before dawn and told of
the bomb attacks.
	   ``He's watching it very closely,'' an administration official
said. ``Obviously, at this point (the reaction is) shock. ``We're
just trying to get more information.''
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   No figures were available on the number of dead Americans, said
U.S. embassy spokesman Chris Scharf in Nairobi.

Israeli Arabs demonstrate against making mosque into tourist site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Amid a heavy police presence, about 300
Israeli Arabs marched Friday to protest Israeli government plans to
make a disused mosque into a tourist site.
	   Several scuffles broke out between protesters and neighborhood
residents in the Old Jaffa section of Tel Aviv. Army Radio reported
five Arabs were arrested for stone-throwing.
	   The marchers made their way to the site of the 300-year-old El
Tabih mosque, shouting ``God is Great'' and waving banners with
slogans denouncing the decision.
	   In February, local Muslims began holding daily prayers in the
mosque until the police sealed off the building and put it under
armed guard.
	   Previously, the mosque had not been used for prayer since 1948,
when it was abandoned during Israel's War of Independence. Israel
intends to sell the building to the Old Jaffa Development company,
which plans to make it into a tourist complex.
	   There is a large Israeli Arab community in Jaffa.
	   ``It's ours and we want it back,'' Sami Karim, a 30-year-old
Muslim shopkeeper, said of the mosque.
	   The Wafq, the organization that administers Islamic holy sites
in the West Bank and Jerusalem, petitioned the Supreme Court
Thursday against the decision to transform the mosque into a
tourist site.

Slovenia restores power to neighboring Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia's energy company restored
electricity Friday to lines running to neighboring Croatia after
having shut down the lines, saying Croatia had failed to settle its
debts.
	   The state-run Slovene electric company cut the flow of
electricity from the jointly owned nuclear power plant in Krsko on
July 30, saying Croatia had not paid its bills since June. The
Slovenes say the Croatians owe a total of dlrs 14 million.
	   In addition to power from Slovenia, the lines also carry
electricity imported by Croatia from other European countries.
	   The Slovenes decided to reopen the lines running to the Croatian
capital, Zagreb, due to an energy crisis caused by wild fires that
have damaged electrical lines in the southern Adriatic region of
Dalmatia.
	   Croatian-Slovenian relations so far have been better than among
any other former Yugoslav republics. The quarrel is the first
serious dispute between the two former Yugoslav republics, which
simultaneously proclaimed independence in June 1991.
	   Krsko is the only nuclear plant in former Yugoslavia. It was
jointly built by Slovenia and Croatia.
	   After some heated debate between the two neighbors, Slovenia
eventually accepted Croatia's 50 percent ownership. But tensions
arose again last month after negotiations broke down over who would
finance the plant's upgrading and the Croats walked out of talks.

Truth panel has dealt with two thirds of amnesties in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing apartheid
atrocities said on Friday it had dealt with about two-thirds of
people applying for amnesty.
	   Of 7,060 applications, 4,443 had been processed, the commission
said. It granted amnesty to 151 people, and denied it for the rest.
	   Charged with uncovering the truth about apartheid-era human
rights abuses, the Truth Commission has the power to grant amnesty
to people who fully confess their crimes and prove a political
motivation.
	   Recent high profle cases include the release from prison last
month of the four killers of American exchange student Amy Biehl
who was stabbed and stoned to death in a township near Cape Town in
1993.
	   Delayed by the enormous workload and drawn-out procedures for
verifying facts, the amnesty work of the commission has been
extended to July 31, 1999, though it admits it may go on past that
date.
	   Commissioner Denzil Potgieter told a news conference that one of
the reasons for the delay was the action of applicants' lawyers,
who treated the hearings like criminal cases and sought to drag
them out with legal argument.
	   ``If you don't keep the lawyers in check, they will run you to
kingdom come,'' he said ``There has been abuse of the process.''
	   The vast majority of cases dealt with so far have been for small
incidents that were decided upon by commissioners in private. Of
the remaining workload the commission estimates about 1,200
applications are sufficiently serious cases to be held in public _
a far more lengthy procedure.
	   Major applications still to be heard include former army
officers, scientists working on biological and chemical warfare
experiments and atrocities committed by members of Winnie Mandela's
bodyguard.
	   The commisson was set up in 1995, a year after all-race
elections ended apartheid.

Fresh Pakistani firing kills four Indian civilians in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A fresh burst of Pakistani artillery
firing killed four Indian civilians in troubled northern Kashmir on
Friday, a military spokesman said.
	   The civilians died when their truck was hit by a shell and it
caught fire in Kargil sector, 225 kilometers (140 miles) northwest
of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, said Major
P. Purshottam, the defense ministry spokesman. Another three
civilians were wounded.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani side.
	   The Indian military fired back but the exchange of firing ebbed
later, the spokesman said.
	   The India-Pakistan border was mostly calm Friday after a
weeklong exchange of heavy artillery and mortar firing that killed
120 people on both sides. This was one of the heaviest peacetime
duels between the arch-rivals.
	   Firing erupted as the prime ministers of India and Pakistan
failed to agree on modalities to discuss Kashmir and other issues
during their meeting in the Sri Lankan capital last week on the
sidelines of a regional summit.
	   India and Pakistan blamed each other for what they described as
unprovoked firing.
	   Meanwhile, New Delhi-based military attaches of 25 countries
visited areas close to the disputed border in Jammu region. They
were briefed by Indian military commanders, the spokesman said.
	   The military attaches were from the United States, Russia,
Britain and some European, African and Middle-East countries.

Karassev's 31 points lead Russia past Lithuania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russia win, consolation games. DELETES old
material. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Vassily Karassev's 31 points and tight
second-half team defense helped Russia beat Lithuania 82-67 Friday
to move into the semifinals at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Karassev scored 19 in the second half and Sergey Babkov added 10
points and 6 rebounds for Russia, which next faces the winner of
the quarterfinal between the United States and Italy.
	   Russia pulled away with a 9-0 run late in the second half, after
Lithuania had closed to within 63-61.
	   Russia, silver medalist at the 1994 worlds, had used a 14-4 run
_ with Karassev scoring nine points _ to go ahead 49-42 with 15:00
minutes left. It never relinquished that lead.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists at the last two Olympics, went
without a field goal for the first six minutes of the second half
and shot just 17-of-48 (35 percent) from the field for the game.
	   The other quarterfinal matchups were Yugoslavia vs. Argentina
and Greece vs. Spain.
	   The loss knocked Lithuania out of medal contention, a
disappointment after the team handed the United States its lone
loss at the tournament in preliminary round action.
	   And Lithuania led by as many as nine in the back-and-forth first
half Friday, going up 32-23 with 3:20 remaining on two free throws
by Seton Hall product Arturas Karnisovas.
	   There were five ties or lead changes in the opening 20 minutes,
which ended with Lithuania ahead 38-35.
	   But Russia shut down Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of
Karnisovas and Saulius Stombergas after the break. Stamburgas
finished with 17 points and Karnisovas with 14, but they combined
for just eight in the second half.
	   Karassev, who plays in the German League, made 9-of-14 shots
from the field and 12-of-14 from the free throw line.
	   The two countries used to supply players for the Soviet
juggernaut that for years was the only true challenger to the
United States in international play.
	   In consolation games played Friday, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's
33 points led Australia past Canada 88-71, while Rogerio Klafke had
19 points and 7 rebounds as Brazil defeated Puerto Rico 76-64. The
winners will play Saturday for ninth place, and the two losers will
meet for 11th.

Saab reports loss despite higher sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Despite rising sales, Swedish automaker
Saab on Friday reported a loss for the first half of the year of
978 million kronor (dlrs 122 million).
	   The loss was more than 50 percent bigger than the 600 million
kronor reported a year ago.
	   The company, jointly owned by General Motors and Sweden's
Investor, said sales for the period increased 18 percent to 12.97
billion kronor (dlrs 1.62 billion) while the number of sold cars
rose 14 percent to 58,077.
	   The cost of launching the new 9-3 and 9-5 models generated large
costs, said chief executive Robert W. Hendry.
	   ''With these launches now behind us we see a substantial
improvement in the result and even if 1998 as a whole will have a
loss we expect a positive operating result for the rest of 1998,''
he said.

13 treated in hospital in Bahrain heat wave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Thirteen men, most of them laborers, were
treated for dehydration after they fainted while working in
temperatures exceeding 50 C (122 F), the Gulf Daily News reported
Friday.
	   None of the workers suffered seriously from the heat wave on
Thursday and all were discharged from hospital, the newspaper said.
	   No deaths have been reported in this Gulf island from the hot
weather, which has sent the mercury soaring to 54 Celsius (129
Fahrenheit). Humidity has hit a record-breaking 90 percent.
	   Newspapers have urged readers to avoiding direct exposure to the
sun.
	   Last month in the neighboring state of Qatar, five workers died
while working at a construction site and more than 150 people were
treated for sunstroke, exhaustion and dehydration as temperatures
exceeded 50 C (122 F).
	   Summer temperatures in the Gulf usually hover around 45 C (113
F), although 50 C (122 F) temperatures are not uncommon.

Russia's oil giant Lukoil seeks to expand presence in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Russia's oil giant Lukoil is prepared to
invest dlrs 150 million to dlrs 200 million in Ukraine's oil
refining industry within the next three years, Lukoil president
Vagit Alekperov said Friday.
	   ``The Ukrainian market is very important for Lukoil,'' Alekperov
said. He said Lukoil was currently refining only about 20 million
tons of oil out of the more than 60 million tons it produces a year
because of a shortage in refining plants.
	   ``Therefore, Ukrainian plants are attracting our attention,''
Alekperov said, according to the Interfax news agency. Lukoil also
wants to take part in privatization of some Ukrainian oil
refineries and to expand its gas sales network in Ukraine to
eventually cover 15 percent to 20 percent of the market, he said.
	   Lukoil presently has two gas stations on the Black Sea Crimea
peninsula.
	   Alekperov was in Crimea Friday to take part in weekend
celebrations of Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's 60th birthday.
Kuchma is now vacationing in Crimea.
	   Separately Friday, Alekperov signed a cooperation agreement with
Crimean Prime Minister Serhiy Kunitsyn.
	   The sides agreed to work on a long-term plan of oil products'
deliveries, and the government of the autonomous Ukrainian republic
promised to help Lukoil with expanding its network of gas stations
in Crimea.

IAAF president calls for global list of doping substances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Primo Nebiolo, head of track and field's
world governing body, has called for a global anti-doping program
with equal procedures for all sports.
	   The IAAF president, who touched off controversy last month when
he singled out tennis, cycling and volleyball as sports which
refused to sign an Olympic accord for harmonizing anti-drugs
programs, said all sports federations should join the anti-doping
effort.
	   Nebiolo made the comments Friday in a letter to Italy's largest
sports daily, Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   ``We must work out new measures for blocking this dangerous
moral drift (of doping),'' the letter said.
	   Nebiolo said the IAAF supported the International Olympic
Committee's plans for a world anti-doping conference.
	   In the meantime, he recommended some suggestions for fighting
the use of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   ``In my opinion the first measure is to elaborate a unique list
of doping substances for all sports ... the second action should
provide random tests in all sports ... and controls that tests are
carried out according to equal procedures accepted by everybody,''
Nebiolo said.
	   Nebiolo's comments come at a time when sports is going through a
series of drugs-related problems.
	   The Tour de France, which ended Sunday, was plagued by a doping
scandal with officials of several teams arrested and their rooms
searched. Last week U.S. athletes Randy Barnes and Dennis Mitchell
tested positive for drugs and, on Thursday, triple Olympic swimming
champion Michelle Smith was banned for four years for allegedly
tampering with a test sample.
	   Nebiolo called for better cooperation between sporting and civil
authorities to avoid long and costly trials initiated by athletes
opposing suspensions for testing positive of banned substances.
	   ``Rights of the citizen-athlete must be guaranteed, but we have
often the impression .. of an excess of nationalistic protection,''
Nebiolo wrote.

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian officials claimed Friday
that their offensive in Kosovo was nearly over, but there were
reports of more fighting, and the leader of secessionist ethnic
Albanians renewed his call for Western military intervention.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that the Serb offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly
200,000 people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said that the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   But the Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, said the Serb
offensive against the Albanian stronghold of Drenica region is
continuing. He also accused Serbs of molesting ``hundreds'' of
Albanians in their prisons that have become ``mass camps.''
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also claimed the Drenica villages
continued to be under Serb shelling Friday, including Likovac,
where U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met KLA leaders last week.
	   The Kosovo Information center claimed that ``houses are being
burned'' in the village, indicating that Likovac may have fallen to
the Serbs, but the center did not say if it had.
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters in Pristina.
	   In another show of force aimed at letting Serb leaders know the
West is running out of patience with the Kosovo crackdown, the
Pentagon announced that hundreds of U.S. Marines are to participate
in NATO military exercises in neighboring Albania and Macedonia in
the coming months, starting with a one-week maneuver that begins in
Albania on Aug.17.
	   A NATO spokesman at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
Friday in Brussels said different option plans are nearly ready for
a possible military intervention in Kosovo.
	   In Paris, Anne Gazeau-Secret, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said that if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't heed
calls to start a political dialogue and stop military action, he
faces ``all the consequences, and I make a point of saying all.''
	   France and Germany are planning a joint mission to Belgrade Aug.
12 to assess the situation.
	   Rugova declared Friday a day of mourning for hundreds killed by
the fighting in the current Serbian offensive.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   In the provincial capital Pristina, Hill, the U.S. envoy, met
with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky Friday.
Throughout the week, both negotiators met individually with
Milosevic, urging him to stop the offensive and start talks with
Rugova. Both also met Rugova separately Friday.
	   The Serb-Kosovo Albanian talks have run into a series of
problems, including the inability of the Albanians to form a joint
negotiating team together with the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
militant group fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   But Rugova, who has so far advocated peaceful secession of the
province, indicated Friday the KLA may soon name its
representatives.
	   Hill said after meeting Rugova that ``we have to get the
negotiations started ... that will lead to some results in a short
order of time.''
	   Afanasyevsky urged an end of hostilities and said, ``We are
trying with our American and European colleagues to find a platform
for the negotiations.''
	   ``I hope the decision on the resumptions of the negotiations
will be taken in the coming days.''
	   The latest offensive has also forced international aid workers
to declare the situation in Kosovo a ``humanitarian disaster.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates roughly 200,000 people have
fled to Kosovo's woods and hills, and many of them lack food, water
and other essentials. Officials worry that searing summer
temperatures and a lack of hygiene could cause disease to set in.

Protective barricades erected at US Harare embassy

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwean police Friday hurriedly
erected barricades in front of the U.S. Embassy after the blasts at
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   No vehicles were allowed to park along tree-lined Herbert
Chitepo Avenue in front of the embassy.
	   The two-story building, set back from the avenue a mile from the
city center, was last attacked in 1986 when a mob from President
Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu party youth wing threw stones to
protest the air crash death of Mozambican President Samora Machel.
	   A spokesman at the embassy in Namibia, which borders South
Africa, said extra guards had been posted.

Mugabe rules out military confrontation in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe Friday ruled out
military confrontation as a solution to the conflict in Congo,
state-run radio reported.
	   Speaking to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation on arrival at
the resort town for a meeting of seven African heads of state,
Mugabe said he ``hopes the conflict does not escalate and cause
political turmoil to the whole of the Southern African region and
scare away investors.''
	   Mugabe told the ZBC he was confident the conflict would be
resolved by the seven leaders meeting in Victoria Falls, including
President Laurent Kabila of the Republic of Congo Kinshasa and the
man he accuses of ``invading'' his country, Pasteur Bizimungu of
Rwanda.
	   The official Zimbabwean news agency ZIANA reported Friday Kabila
and Bizimungu were still definitely due to attend, along with
Mugabe, Ben Mukapa of Tanzania, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia.
	   Ziana said Kabila's ``No. 2, Senior Minister Victor Mtoyo'' was
already in Victoria Falls with Justice Minister Mwende Kongolo.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 60 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   Six Americans were among the dead, and the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya was injured, the State Department said. More than 40 were
killed and 1,100 wounded in Nairobi, said Red Cross spokeswoman
Nina Galbe. At least seven were killed and 72 hurt in Tanzania,
officials said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' Galbe said.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed last week to strike American interests because some of its
members were arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt,
according to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language
newspaper published in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed bombs
caused the two explosions. The State Department called the blasts,
which occurred five minutes apart, ``terrorist attacks.''
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal looking for victims, calling out and waving their arms for
help to free trapped people.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Dazed and
bloody survivors lay on the ground until led away.
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,100 people were being treated in three
hospitals.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S.
Embassy parking lot, witnesses said. At least seven people were
killed and 72 injured, officials said. No Americans were among the
dead in Tanzania.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
The nearby Nigerian Embassy and Algerian diplomatic residence were
damaged. Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in
the search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' witness Jim Owens told CNN. He said one
woman was injured when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her
nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' U.S. Embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler said in Italy. ``That's all I can say.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was expected to make a statement
later Friday about the bomb attacks.
	   ``He's watching it very closely,'' an administration official
said. ``Obviously, at this point (the reaction is) shock. ``We're
just trying to get more information.''
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   Officials made an urgent plea for blood donations and medical
help.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China began evacuating more than 300,000 people
Friday from land along the raging Yangtze River that could be
deliberately flooded in a desperate bid to safeguard areas
downstream.
	   With the Yangtze at record levels and rising, officials were
preparing to open floodgates and even blow up a dike to divert
floodwaters away from one of the most threatened sections of the
6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river.
	   In a giant exodus, villagers streamed out the flood-threatened
area, eaving their homes behind. Many carried belongings on their
back and took livestock with them as they walked ``solemnly'' away,
Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported.
	   Local authorities in badly flooded Hubei province declared an
around-the-clock curfew over the area designated for possible
flooding, Xinhua said. Only military personnel were permitted in
the area.
	   A decision to proceed with the plan to deliberately flood towns
and villages at the Jingjiang section of the Yangtze in Hubei would
require the approval of the State Council, or Cabinet.
	   ``The worst moment of the year's flood control efforts is
probably coming,'' the official newspaper China Daily quoted
unidentified Yangtze River officials as saying.
	   The crisis was precipitated by a surge of floodwaters headed
down river Friday that officials feared could cause sodden levees
weakened by weeks of rain and floods to collapse.
	   In a nightmare come true for officials, embankments protecting
Jiujiang city, down the Yangtze in southeast Jiangxi province,
partly collapsed Friday, releasing a torrent of floodwaters two
meters (6.6 feet) deep that began to inundate parts of the city,
Xinhua said.
	   Disaster workers sunk three boats to try to plug the 40-meter-
(132-foot- ) wide breach and attempted to build a second emergency
dike, it said.
	   To reduce pressure on major levees that protect cities and
millions of people downstream, officials have already begun
abandoning smaller dikes and were preparing to deflect waters into
the Jingjiang flood diversion area, where more than 500,000 people
live, if need be.
	   The last time the Yangtze was this high was in 1954, during
floods that forced officials to divert water three times. More than
30,000 people died in the flooding that year.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas. The floods have affected
240 million people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees,
the government says.
	   More than 330,000 people in the Jingjiang flood diversion area
south of Hubei's Shashi city were being evacuated, said Chen
Zhichao, director of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Management
Bureau.
	   Of those, 230,000 had already been moved, with another 100,000
were expected to leave by Friday evening, officials said. The
remainder of the area's 520,000 people live on high or protected
ground and are safe, Chen said.
	   He said they were waiting for an order from the State Council
before diverting the river. As of Friday evening, the council had
not made a decision, officials said. Xinhua said the government was
``still pondering.''
	   If the order was given, officials first would raise floodgates
to deflect water from the Yangtze to the diversion area. If that
proved insufficient, a three-kilometer- (1.86 mile- ) long dike
that borders the river would be blown up to let the floodwaters
through, said Chen.
	   One method already being employed to lower the Yangtze was
breaking open or deliberately abandoning smaller, secondary dikes,
flooding farmland and taking pressure off the major embankments
that hem in the river.
	   Hubei, one of worst-hit provinces that declared a state of
emergency Thursday, has already sacrificed at least 104 such
levees, forcing 270,000 people to move and inundating swathes of
farmland, the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Friday.
	   Among the cities protected by these ``selfless'' acts was Wuhan,
with 7 million people, the newspaper said.
	   Hubei officials breached another six small levees around
Jingzhou city, next to Shashi, Thursday and Friday, forcing 100,000
people to evacuate, said a Jingzhou flood official, who gave his
surname, Li.
	   Should officials decide to divert the Yangtze at Jingjiang too,
then Gong'an county, south of Shashi, would bear the brunt of the
flooding, the China Daily said.
	   ``The Jingjiang section is facing the worst flood challenge in
its history,'' the newspaper said, quoting Ge Shouxi, a Yangtze
River chief engineer. Xinhua said the government would compensate
people who lose their homes in the diversion.
	   The Yangtze at Shashi reached a record 44.68 meters (147.4 feet)
Thursday, a centimeter (0.4 inches) higher that in 1954's deadly
floods. On Friday, as the fourth flood crest this year bore down,
the river rose again to 44.77 meters (147.7 feet), Xinhua said.

(132-foot- ) wide breach and attempted to build a second emergency
dike, it said.
	   To reduce pressure on major levees that protect cities and
millions of people downstream, officials have already begun
abandoning smaller dikes and were preparing to deflect waters into
the Jingjiang flood diversion area, where more than 500,000 people
live, if need be.
	   The last time the Yangtze was this high was in 1954, during
floods that forced officials to divert water three times. More than
30,000 people died in the flooding that year.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas. The floods have affected
240 million people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees,
the government says.
	   More than 330,000 people in the Jingjiang flood diversion area
south of Hubei's Shashi city were being evacuated, said Chen
Zhichao, director of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Management
Bureau.
	   Of those, 230,000 had already been moved, with another 100,000
were expected to leave by Friday evening, officials said. The
remainder of the area's 520,000 people live on high or protected
ground and are safe, Chen said.
	   He said they were waiting for an order from the State Council
before diverting the river. As of Friday evening, the council had
not made a decision, officials said. Xinhua said the government was
``still pondering.''
	   If the order was given, officials first would raise floodgates
to deflect water from the Yangtze to the diversion area. If that
proved insufficient, a three-kilometer- (1.86 mile- ) long dike
that borders the river would be blown up to let the floodwaters
through, said Chen.
	   One method already being employed to lower the Yangtze was
breaking open or deliberately abandoning smaller, secondary dikes,
flooding farmland and taking pressure off the major embankments
that hem in the river.
	   Hubei, one of worst-hit provinces that declared a state of
emergency Thursday, has already sacrificed at least 104 such
levees, forcing 270,000 people to move and inundating swathes of
farmland, the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Friday.
	   Among the cities protected by these ``selfless'' acts was Wuhan,
with 7 million people, the newspaper said.
	   Hubei officials breached another six small levees around
Jingzhou city, next to Shashi, Thursday and Friday, forcing 100,000
people to evacuate, said a Jingzhou flood official, who gave his
surname, Li.
	   Should officials decide to divert the Yangtze at Jingjiang too,
then Gong'an county, south of Shashi, would bear the brunt of the
flooding, the China Daily said.
	   ``The Jingjiang section is facing the worst flood challenge in
its history,'' the newspaper said, quoting Ge Shouxi, a Yangtze
River chief engineer. Xinhua said the government would compensate
people who lose their homes in the diversion.
	   The Yangtze at Shashi reached a record 44.68 meters (147.4 feet)
Thursday, a centimeter (0.4 inches) higher that in 1954's deadly
floods. On Friday, as the fourth flood crest this year bore down,
the river rose again to 44.77 meters (147.7 feet), Xinhua said.

Karassev's 31 points lead Russia past Lithuania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, attendance &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Vassily Karassev's 31 points and tight
second-half team defense helped Russia beat Lithuania 82-67 Friday
to move into the semifinals at the World Basketball Championship.
	   Karassev scored 19 in the second half and Sergey Babkov added 10
points and 6 rebounds for Russia, which next faces the winner of
the quarterfinal between the United States and Italy.
	   Russia pulled away with a 9-0 run late in the second half, after
Lithuania had closed to within 63-61 on two free throws by
2.18-meter (7-foot-2) center Eurelijus Zukauskas.
	   Karassev scored nine points in an earlier 14-4 spurt that gave
Russia, silver medalist at the 1994 worlds, the lead for good early
in the second half.
	   ``The difference in the game was defense and pressure on
offense. The man with the hot hand today was Karassev so we just
gave him the ball,'' said Russian forward Yevgeny Kissourine, who
helped contain Lithuania's Arturas Karnisovas.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists at the last two Olympics, went
without a field goal for the first six minutes of the second half
and shot just 17-of-48 (35 percent) from the field for the game,
which was attended by about 2,000 people at the 18,000-capacity
Olympic arena.
	   The other quarterfinal matchups were Yugoslavia vs. Argentina
and Greece vs. Spain.
	   The loss knocked Lithuania out of medal contention, a
disappointment after the team handed the United States its lone
loss at the tournament in preliminary round action.
	   And Lithuania led by as many as nine in the back-and-forth first
half Friday, going up 32-23 with 3:20 remaining on two free throws
by Seton Hall product Karnisovas.
	   There were five ties or lead changes in the opening 20 minutes,
which ended with Lithuania ahead 38-35.
	   But Russia shut down Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of
Karnisovas and Saulius Stombergas after the break. Stamburgas
finished with 17 points and Karnisovas with 14, but they combined
for just eight in the second half.
	   ``We were holding them and holding them,'' said Karnisovas, who
entered averaging 18.2 points per game, second-best at the
tournament. ``We got as close as two points, then we made such big
mistakes on defense.''
	   Karassev, who plays in the German League, made 9-of-14 shots
from the field and 12-of-14 from the free throw line.
	   The two countries used to supply players for the Soviet
juggernaut that for years was the only true challenger to the
United States in international play.
	   In consolation games played Friday, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's
33 points led Australia past Canada 88-71, while Rogerio Klafke had
19 points and 7 rebounds as Brazil defeated Puerto Rico 76-64. The
winners will play Saturday for ninth place, and the two losers will
meet for 11th.

Portuguese capital hit by power outage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Business in the Portuguese capital was
hit Friday when more than half the city was left without power.
	   The Electricidade de Portugal utilities company said 60 percent
of the city was left without power when the outage struck at 2.30
p.m. (1330 gmt), according to the national news agency Lusa.
	   The electricity company was unable to say what had caused the
power cut.
	   The outage halted trading on the city's stock exchange and
affected business at banks and stores. Power had still not been
restored two hours later.
	   Telephone communications were not affected.

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with report of fighting in Drenica region,
French Foreign Ministry statement, comments from U.S. and Russian
envoys, NATO spokesman. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian officials claimed Friday
that their offensive in Kosovo was nearly over, but there were
reports of more fighting, and the leader of secessionist ethnic
Albanians renewed his call for Western military intervention.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Serb offensive in Kosovo, which uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   But Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova said the Serb
offensive against the Albanian stronghold of Drenica region is
continuing. He also accused Serbs of molesting ``hundreds'' of
Albanians in their prisons that have become ``mass camps.''
	   Ethnic Albanian sources also claimed the Drenica villages
continued to be under Serb shelling Friday, including Likovac,
where U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met KLA leaders last week.
	   The Kosovo Information center claimed ``houses are being
burned'' in the village, indicating Likovac may have fallen to the
Serbs, but the center did not say if it had.
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters in the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   In another show of force aimed at letting Serb leaders know the
West is running out of patience with the Kosovo crackdown, the
Pentagon announced that hundreds of U.S. Marines are to participate
in NATO military exercises in neighboring Albania and Macedonia in
the coming months, starting with a one-week maneuver that begins
Aug. 17 in Albania.
	   In Brussels, a NATO spokesman at the meeting Friday of the North
Atlantic Council said different option plans are nearly ready for a
possible military intervention in Kosovo.
	   In Paris, Anne Gazeau-Secret, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't heed calls to
start a political dialogue and stop military action, he faces ``all
the consequences, and I make a point of saying all.''
	   France and Germany are planning a joint mission Wednesday to
Belgrade to assess the situation.
	   Rugova declared Friday a day of mourning for hundreds killed by
the fighting in the current Serbian offensive.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   In Pristina, Hill met Friday with Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky. Throughout the week, both
negotiators met individually with Milosevic, urging him to stop the
offensive and start talks with Rugova. Both also met Rugova
separately Friday.
	   The Serb-Kosovo Albanian talks have run into a series of
problems, including the inability of the Albanians to form a joint
negotiating team together with the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
militant group fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   But Rugova, who has so far advocated peaceful secession of the
province, indicated Friday the KLA may soon name its
representatives.
	   Hill said after meeting Rugova that ``we have to get the
negotiations started ... that will lead to some results in a short
order of time.''
	   Afanasyevsky urged an end of hostilities and said, ``We are
trying with our American and European colleagues to find a platform
for the negotiations.''
	   ``I hope the decision on the resumptions of the negotiations
will be taken in the coming days.''
	   The latest offensive has also forced international aid workers
to declare the situation in Kosovo a ``humanitarian disaster.''
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates roughly 200,000 people have
fled to Kosovo's woods and hills, and many of them lack food, water
and other essentials. Officials fear summer temperatures and a lack
of hygiene could prompt diseases.

Germany says it doesn't deserve US criticism on refugee policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel deflected
U.S. criticism of Germany's policy of repatriating of Bosnian
refugees, saying that the returning Bosnians were helping to
rebuild their nation, not destabilize it.
	   The U.S. State Department on Thursday criticized what it called
an accelerated repatriation of refugees from Germany, saying many
of them still aren't able to return to their prewar homes.
	   Germany, which took in 350,000 Bosnian refugees after the war
broke out in 1992 and has spent more than dlrs 11 billion providing
for them, has offered incentives and taken other measure to
encourage Bosnians to return home.
	   ``We are doing everything to ensure those returning to Bosnia _
who, by the way, are needed to rebuild their country _ are able to
find livable accommodations,'' Kinkel said. He said the German
policy did not contribute to any ``destabilization'' of Bosnia.
	   ``We believe that he have not earned any criticism from our
American partner and friend over our generous refugee policy and
circumspect repatriation efforts,'' Kinkel said.
	   Some 75,000 refugees have returned voluntarily from Germany this
year, some through economic incentives offered by state
governments. About 1,200 were forced to return _ most of those
because they had criminal records.
	   U.S. officials say many of the repatriations are at odds with
the goal of enabling refugees _ Muslim, Serb and Croat _ to return
to the homes from which they had been driven.
	   Returning Muslims, for example, are reluctant to return to their
prewar homes in Serb-controlled territory. U.S. officials contend
this plays into the hands of Bosnian hard-liners whose goal has
always been dividing the nation along ethnic lines.
	   German officials maintain it's better for refugees to return _
even if not in their prewar homes _ than to establish roots abroad,
where they may decide never to go back. Those returning can bring
skills and money earned in Germany to help in postwar
reconstruction, German officials say.
	   Other German officials have been less diplomatic than Kinkel.
	   Interior Minister Manfred Kanther called the U.S. criticism
absurd, saying angrily Thursday that the country that took in
350,000 fleeing Bosnians needs no advice on how to deal with the
issue.

Buffaloes blow out Marines as Clark hits back-to-back homers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Infielder Phil Clark led the Kintetsu Buffaloes to
a 7-4 victory Friday over the Lotte Marines at Chiba Marine
Stadium.
	   Clark, a former Boston Red Sox player, nailed back-to-back
three-run homers, allowing starting pitcher Akira Okamoto to take
the win.
	   Elsewhere in the Pacific League, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks walked
away with a 3-2 win against Orix BlueWave in Kobe as the Hawks'
Yoshihiro Suzuki singled home to give the team its sixth straight
victory over the BlueWave.
	   In Central League action on Friday, the Yokohama BayStars added
another win to their Central League-leading tally by besting the
Hiroshima Carp 8-5, thanks to a trio of home runs.
	   Yokohama's Tatsuya Shindo slugged a three-run home run at
Hiroshima Stadium, helping to give the BayStars a fifth consecutive
win. Starting pitcher Hiroki took the win, even though he gave up
five runs on three home-runs.
	   The Chunichi Dragons, ranked second in the Central League, were
beaten by the third place Yomiuri Giants at the Tokyo Dome. Yomiuri
took the game 7-3 due in part to a pair of home runs by power
batter Hideki Matsui.
	   Meanwhile, the Yakult Swallows managed to beat the Hanshin
Tigers 1-0 after Mitsuru Manaka pounded out a home run in the
bottom of the eighth inning.

Kipketer returns in Monte Carlo meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) - After setting two world records in
the 800 meters last year, winning his second world title and
capturing the Grand Prix overall title, Wilson Kipketer has been
slowed this year by a bout with malaria.
	   The Kenyan-born Dane makes his season debut in the Herculis
track meet, part of the lucrative Golden League series this year.
	   Kipketer had a superb 1997. He broke the world indoor record
twice in Paris in March then bettered the world outdoor record
twice, bringing it down to 1 minute, 41.11 seconds in Cologne after
a 1:41.24 in Zurich.
	   He also added the world title in Athens last year and finished
the season with a victory in the Grand Prix finals in Japan, giving
him the overall title.
	   This year has been a washout, however. He contracted malaria in
January and has been far behind in training and he hopes to salvage
the season with a good start in Monaco. He likes the Monaco track.
He has won here the last three years, all under 1:43.
	   The 800 is not one of the 12 events eligible for the dlrs 1
million bonus that will be shared among the athletes who remain
unbeaten in their specialities plus the Grand Prix final in Moscow
in September.
	   The field is now down to eight athletes after the Bislett Games
in Oslo, July 9 and the Golden Gala July 14.
	   Sprinters Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Marion Jones of the
United States are seeking their third victories in the Golden
League 100s.
	   Fredericks has a tough task to remain eligible. Olympic champion
and world-record holder Donovan Bailey is back in form, beating a
top field in Paris on July 29.
	   However Bailey's Canadian compatriot, Bruny Surin, is fresh from
a 9.89 at the Canadian championships where Bailey did 9.93.
	   Also in the field is Ato Boldon, who has done 9.86 twice this
year.
	   Jones looks to continue unbeaten in the women's 100. With a best
of 10.71 this year, she has dominated the event this year although
France's Christine Arron did 10.85 Wednesday.
	   In the 400 Michael Johnson looks for some redemption. He was
third in Oslo, losing out on a chance for part of the bonus. He
came back to win in Rome and posted a fast 43.76 at the Goodwill
Games two weeks ago, where he anchored the American team to a world
record in the 1,600-meter relay.
	   The last time Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran in a Golden
League meet, in Rome, he set a world record in the 1,500 in
3:26.00. He also won in Oslo in 3:29.12.
	   He could go for another record. The track in Monaco has seen
Noureddine Morceli twice come within a second of his former world
mark at 3:27.37.
	   Other men still in contention for the bonus include American
Bryan Bronson in the 400 hurdles, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie in
the 3,000 and Britain's Jonathan Edwards in the triple jump.
	   On the women's side besides Jones, Russian Svetlana Masterkova
in the 1,500 and Nigerian Charity Opara in the 400 are still
unbeaten in the Golden League.
	   After Monaco, the Golden League series continues in Zurich with
the Wletklasse meet on August 12.

Saab reports loss despite higher sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Despite rising sales, Swedish automaker
Saab on Friday reported a loss for the first half of the year of
978 million kronor (dlrs 122 million).
	   The loss was more than 50 percent bigger than the 600 million
kronor reported a year ago.
	   The company, jointly owned by General Motors and Sweden's
Investor, said sales for the period increased 18 percent to 12.97
billion kronor (dlrs 1.62 billion) while the number of sold cars
rose 14 percent to 58,077.
	   The cost of launching the new 9-3 and 9-5 models generated large
costs, said chief executive Robert W. Hendry.
	   ``With these launches now behind us we see a substantial
improvement in the result and even if 1998 as a whole will have a
loss we expect a positive operating result for the rest of 1998,''
he said.

Peru's prime minister resigns after clashes with government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra has
offered to resign, saying it would be ``madness'' for him to stay
in power given his differences with the government of President
Alberto Fujimori.
	   Valle Riestra, a former political opponent whom Fujimori named
to the post two months ago, said in a television interview Thursday
night that the president has not yet told him if he will accept his
resignation.
	   He said he was resigning because of repeated clashes with
hard-liners in Fujimori's government and the armed forces.
	   ``I cannot live among these constant disputes. I am a democrat,
and here, there is a totalitarian spirit,'' he said.
	   Fujimori surprised even his own supporters when he named the
outspoken Valle Riestra, known for his defense of human rights, to
the post. Analysts say it was an attempt to improve his
government's authoritarian image.
	   Since coming to power, Valle Riestra had come under fire from
his own government after saying Fujimori should not run for a third
consecutive term in office and protesting human rights abuses.
	   Valle Riestra also offered to resign June 24 after Fujimori
rejected his suggestion that the government free Lori Berenson, a
New York-native serving a life sentence in a Peruvian prison for
treason.
	   Fujimori did not accept his resignation on that occasion.
	   The clash that caused this latest resignation threat was a
statement issued Wednesday by Peru's military courts that attacked
Valle Riestra for claiming jailed Shining Path leader Abimael
Guzman received special privileges.
	   ``There is a conspiracy against me. The president of Congress
attacks me, and the Supreme Court of Military Justice treats me
with disrespect and irreverence,'' he said.
	   In Peru's non-parliamentary system of government, the prime
minister is not elected and has little power.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 60 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   Six Americans were believed to be among the dead, and the U.S.
ambassador to Kenya was injured, the State Department said. More
than 60 were killed and 1,100 wounded in Nairobi, Red Cross and
ambulance officials said. At least seven were killed and 72 hurt in
Tanzania, officials said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed last week to strike American interests because some of its
members were arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt,
according to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language
newspaper published in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
Africa.
	   ``We are treating this as a terrorist attack,'' National
Security Adviser P.J. Crowley said in Washington. A State
Department official confirmed bombs that went off five minutes
apart caused the two explosions.

Killer of Prince Charles' great-uncle freed in peace gesture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The early release of the imprisoned IRA
killer of Prince Charles' great-uncle outraged many members of the
public Friday, but the father of a teen-age boy also slain by
bombmaker Thomas McMahon called it a matter of promoting peace.
	   ``Keeping him in prison will unfortunately not bring my son
back,'' said John Maxwell, whose 15-year-old son, Paul, was killed
along with Lord Mountbatten and two royal relatives by an Irish
Republican Army bomb 19 years ago.
	   The Irish government released McMahon, 50, from Dublin's
Mountjoy prison late Thursday as part of the Northern Ireland peace
agreement's promise to free more than 400 convicted members of the
IRA and pro-British paramilitary gangs.
	   ``Peace is the imperative now and we must look forward, so that
perhaps Paul's death and those of thousands of others from both
sides of the political divide here will not have been entirely in
vain,'' Maxwell said.
	   Spokespeople for the royal family said both Queen Elizabeth II
and her son Charles had been informed of McMahon's release, but had
no comment.
	   McMahon had been convicted and received a life sentence for
planting the bomb that destroyed Mountbatten's 29-foot-long
(9-meter) yacht. He took part in an abortive IRA escape bid in
1985, and fired a smuggled handgun inside a courtroom when he was
being tried for that crime.
	   Prison officials had begun letting him out of prison for weekly
workshops to learn carpentry skills after he signed a declaration
in 1992 breaking ties with the IRA.
	   The father of two boys told prison officials he planned to make
a living as a woodworker in his native Carrickmacross, a town near
the border with Northern Ireland.
	   The IRA had an easy target in Mountbatten, who was Britain's
last viceroy in India, a World War II hero and Charles' beloved
mentor in affairs of state.
	   He went against police advice and kept vacationing at his
ancestral castle near Mullaghmore, western Ireland, after the IRA
launched its campaign to smash Northern Ireland and its British
links in 1970.
	   The outlawed group's attack also killed his 14-year-old grandson
Nicholas and 83-year-old Lady Brabourne, the mother of his
son-in-law, and badly wounded three other relatives.
	   Maxwell said his son had considered it a great honor to serve as
Mountbatten's boatsman that sunny day while the rest of the family
sailed on another boat.
	   After Paul's death, Maxwell helped found an elementary school in
Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, in which Catholics and Protestants
are taught together.
	   He said McMahon shouldn't be kept in prison for the sake of
revenge.
	   ``Thomas McMahon has served his time and, if he is no longer a
danger to society, then he should be released,'' Maxwell said.

England let South Africa off the hooks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England clawed its way back into the fifth
cricket test against South Africa when Mark Ramprakash took a
brilliant catch, but squandered the chance by dropping three
catches in 22 balls.
	   The spilt chances gave South Africa breathing space in the tense
battle for supremacy in the final test at Headingley on Friday.
	   The visitors went to tea at 168 for five, just 62 runs behind
England's first innings total of 230.
	   Jonty Rhodes (32) was dropped twice and skipper Hansie Cronje,
28 not out, was dropped once as South Africa progressed to tea on
the second day.
	   On a pitch where the odd ball has kept dangerously low, a vital
first innings lead could prove to be a decisive factor in tilting
the balance of a series that is deadlocked at 1-1.
	   England's seam attack gave nothing away and has proved to be far
more effective compared with South Africa's attack.
	   Cronje, keeping in mind the importance of consolidation, has
batted for almost two hours and 20 minutes to hold the innings
together in a typical captain's knock.
	   However, new batsman Brian McMillan has played and missed more
often in his 10-minute stay than putting bat to ball in his
unbeaten four.
	   Rhodes broke the afternoon shackles scoring at almost a
run-a-ball in his 39-ball innings after Mark Ramprakash had taken a
brilliant catch to dismiss Jacques Kallis.
	   Kallis (40) pulled Dominic Cork and Ramprakash flung himself to
his right at mid wicket to take the catch of the series.
	   But the subsequent dropped catches dampened England's spirit.
	   Nasser Hussain grassed a regulation slip catch offered by Cronje
on 20. Then Rhodes was dropped twice in three balls _ on 19 and 20
_ Ramprakash a head-high catch and Graeme Hick, a `sitter' at
second slip.
	   Rhodes, living dangerously in his 38 minute innings, finally
drove at Darren Gough and edged a catch to wicketkeeper Alec
Stewart.
	   After resuming on nine without loss, South Africa lost both
openers _ Gary Kirsten and Gehardus Liebenberg _ in the first hour
of play.
	   Struggling on 36 for two, Kallis and Daryll Cullinan (27) put on
47 runs for the third wicket before Gough, the local hero, struck
17 minutes before lunch.
	   Cullinan, going for an expensive drive, edged a catch to
Stewart.
	   Fraser, who claimed the first two wickets, has 2-29 while Gough
has 2-35.

Kosovo foundation appeals freezing of Swiss account
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The lawyer for a Swiss-based Kosovo Albanian
foundation said Friday it has appealed a decision by Swiss
authorities to block an account it holds.
	   Last week, Switzerland froze the account held by the Kosovo
Foundation in Geneva, as well as one run by the Popular Movement of
Kosovo, a group supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army, amid
suspicions that money from them is used to finance illegal arms
trafficking in the Yugoslav province.
	   The foundation is run by Xhafer Shatri, a spokesman for the
Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Its lawyer, Guy Fontanet, told a news conference he has lodged
an appeal against the block with Switzerland's supreme court.
	   He said Switzerland had to prove any crime took place and called
for police observers to be sent to verify that the money is being
used for humanitarian purposes, as Shatri insists it always has
been.
	   Fontanet said the foundation's account holds a total of some 8
million Swiss francs (dlrs 5.3 million).
	   Shatri last week said several tens of millions of Swiss francs
(dlrs) donated by the Kosovo Albanian population in Switzerland had
passed through it since it was opened six years ago.
	   The Swiss Federal Prosecutor was aiming at the wrong target,
Fontanet said.
	   Shatri added that the intervention came a day after a meeting
with Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry officials.

Japan's second remote satellite docking attempt fails
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second docking attempt to be made Saturday; Edits
to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A second remote docking experiment between two
Japanese satellites in outer space failed Friday morning, a month
after the first attempt succeeded, Japan's space agency said.
	   Friday's failed attempt came after the satellites docked after
briefly separating at a maximum distance of two meters (6.6 feet)
on July 7.
	   Japan's National Space Development Agency had initially planned
to try again Friday to dock the satellites, but those plans have
been postponed until Saturday, Kyodo News reported.
	   Space agency technicians intend to link up the two satellites
with signals transmitted from Earth, said agency spokeswoman Akiko
Suzuki.
	   The succesful experiment in July marked the first ever such
outer space maneuver carried out via remote control from Earth. The
two satellites were hooked up before being launched into space last
November.
	   It is hoped that such remote-controlled docking can be used to
ferry supply shipments via unmanned craft to the space stations of
the future.
	   The two satellites _ ``Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi''
(altair) _ were named after two stars which cross each other on
July 7 each year.
	   On Friday, the satellites were successfully separated at an
altitude of 550 kilometers (341 miles) above Earth beginning around
3:00 a.m. (1800 GMT Thursday), Suzuki said.
	   About 90 minutes later, they were about 520 meters (1,706 feet)
apart, keeping that distance during a 15-minute rendezvous flight.
	   The Hikoboshi, using its laser beam, then began to approach the
Orihime. But the radar response was soon lost, Suzuki said.
	   After that, the Hikoboshi went into an automatic safety flight
mode via computer programs built in to avoid collisions, she said.
	   ``There was a shaking in part of the Hikoboshi and a slight
vibration in the other at the approach stage,'' Suzuki said.
	   Later, the two satellites moved into stable flight about 2
kilometers (1.24 miles) apart, she said.
	   Japan is spending 310 billion yen (dlrs 2.15 billion) to build
four modules for the International Space Station, a joint project
with the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency
scheduled for completion in 2003.
	   The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science also plans to
send a probe to the Moon next year and to explore a nearby asteroid
early in the next millennium.

Ukrainian premier threatens to send tax debtors to tent camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - In a desperate attempt to persuade tax
debtors to pay, Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
threatened Friday to bring top executives to a tent camp for civil
defense and management training.
	   Pustovoitenko said he would force the officials to appear at the
camp in Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky, near the capital, Kiev, in his
capacity as head of the country's Civil Defense system.
	   Many of the executives also are civil defense officials.
Pustovoitenko told a Cabinet meeting on Friday the camp would have
3,000 tents for them to ``engage in what they have to do under the
law,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ukraine's Pension Fund is owed some 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.5
billion) in back payments, and the budget has been short of about 7
billion hryvna (dlrs 3.5 billion) in revenues as of July 1,
officials say.
	   The cash-strapped government long has been looking for ways to
increase budget revenues and diminish the mounting wage and pension
arrears, and the premier recently has taken to some highly unusual
measures.
	   At a meeting Wednesday with executives from some 2,300 debtor
companies and organizations, Pustovoitenko told the officials they
could not leave the room until some of the debts were paid.
	   Many executives then signed obligations pledging to pay 30
percent of the debts within days and the rest by the end of the
year. But only 81.6 million hryvna (dlrs 40.8 million) in actual
payments have been received so far, the Interfax news agency.
	   Speaking at another expanded Cabinet session Friday,
Pustovoitenko said his new step was the second part of an
undisclosed five-stage plan aimed at forcing reluctant debtors to
pay.
	   ``The situation is really critical,'' said Pustovoitenko.
	   Apparently trying to show that it meant business, the government
issued an order Friday dismissing 20 district administration chiefs
and the head of a regional administration who are among the biggest
debtors, and asked President Leonid Kuchma to approve the measure.
	   The Cabinet also warned the state tax service and Pension Fund
chiefs that they would be personally responsible for collecting the
payments.

Georgian suspect arrested in killing of UN worker

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A suspect confessed and pleaded guilty
Friday to last month's shooting death of a Polish woman who worked
for the United Nations in Georgia, officials said.
	   Police arrested Zurab Bregvadze, 20, on Thursday night, said
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Maya Musidze. They also seized a
Makarov handgun of the same type that was used to shoot the UN
worker, Musidze said.
	   Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at point-blank range on
July 14, when she apparently startled a burglar in her apartment in
central Tbilisi.
	   Bregvadze, who lived nearby, was apparently identified by
neighbors, who reported seeing him run out of Wewiorska's house
shortly after the shooting, police officials have said.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, citing investigator Revaz Zarandia,
said Bregvadze pleaded guilty and gave details of the killing to
police on Friday.
	   U.N. officials said Wewiorska had recently moved to Tbilisi and
was working as a secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in
Georgia.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

Pakistan says Indian firing in Kashmir killed 130 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistan Cabinet minister said
Friday that 130 Pakistanis, mostly civilians, were killed by Indian
firing in the last nine days in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
The figures were significantly higher than previously reported.
	   Also, 425 others were wounded, mostly civilians, Majeed Malik,
the minister in charge of Pakistani policy on the disputed
territory of Kashmir, told reporters in Muzaffarabad, capital of
Pakistan-held Kashmir.
	   Neighboring India and Pakistan have fought two wars over
Kashmir, the Himalayan territory divided between them. Firing
across the disputed Kashmir border is common. Most recently, fierce
exchanges broke out July 30 and began to die down only a few days
ago.
	   The area was reported calmer Friday, but the Indian military
spokesman said four more Indians died when a Pakistani shell hit
the truck in which they were riding. That brought the Indian toll
to 58, including 16 soldiers.
	   No Pakistani deaths were reported Friday.
	   Pakistani military officials earlier put their toll at much
closer to the Indian figures. But Friday, a spokesman said Malik's
figure were correct, and reflected people who the military had been
unable to count.
	   India and Pakistan have each accused the other of starting the
firing.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's northern alliance said
Friday that it captured several hundred Pakistanis who were
fighting alongside extremist Islamic Taliban troops.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition did not say where or over what period
the Pakistanis were captured. Neighboring Pakistan has denied its
troops are helping the Taliban, which controls 85 percent of
Afghanistan, including Kabul, the capital.
	   Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in a statement Friday, also rejected
claims his fighters were aided by the Pakistani military in the
bloody conflict in northern Afghanistan.
	   The Afghan people alone, he said, defeated Soviet invaders and a
communist government, and they can face the ``evil and corrupt''
northern alliance without help.
	   Many outside observers have said Pakistan supplies weapons to
the Taliban, while Russia and Iran are believed to support the
northern alliance, which is fiercely holding on to a dwindling area
of northern Afghanistan.
	   Northern alliance spokesman Abdullah, who like many Afghans uses
one name only, said his forces repelled a Taliban attack Friday
about 25 kilometers west of Mazar-e-Sharif, the only sizable city
not held by the Taliban. Independent confirmation of his report was
not immediately possible.
	   Fighting in the area also was reported Thursday, with both sides
claiming victory. The fighting seems to have slowed a Taliban
attempt to take Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The Taliban have, 7th graf pvs.

IBM pulling out as worldwide Olympics sponsor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with confirmation from IBM headquarters; PRECEDES Sydney
dateline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ IBM is ending its 38-year relationship with the
Olympic Games, deciding after months of negotiations not to sign an
8-year deal with the International Olympic Committee, the company
said Friday.
	   IBM, which spent more than dlrs 100 million to sponsor the 1998
Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, and provided much of the
behind-the-scenes technology for free, wanted local Olympic
organizing committees to share the technology costs.
	   But the two sides never agreed on how much money should be paid
to IBM or how much the company should do for free in exchange for
marketing rights. IBM executives were upset by an IOC decision to
seek a more profitable sponsorship deal for upcoming Games'
Internet services and sites, a role IBM held in the last two
Olympics, in Nagano and Atlanta.
	   ``The IOC asked for a significant increase in our sponsorship
commitment. We felt that was not commensurate with the marketing
benefits we would receive in return,'' IBM spokeswoman Debbie
Gottheimer said, confirming reports that the company was pulling
out.
	   The IOC concluded that IBM's projected costs were too high,
Richard Pound, an IOC vice president in charge of sponsorships,
told The Wall Street Journal.
	   Greg Ellevsen, IBM Australia's manager for corporate
communications, similarly told Sydney radio station 2UE that the
company was parting ways with the IOC because of increasing costs
and that the IOC wanted a separate Internet provider.
	   ``We've been negotiating for several months but it turned out
that the cost was way in advance of the benefits,'' Ellevsen said.
	   ``Paying more for reduced benefits just didn't make much sense.
We had a philosophical point of difference with the IOC _ they
decided they wanted an Internet-separate sponsor and we wanted to
showcase all of our technology.''
	   IBM's sponsorship will end with the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia. At the Nagano and Atlanta games, the company supplied
computers and staff to run Web sites, score boards and other
technology. It promoted its Olympics involvement in television and
print advertisements.
	   IBM came under severe criticism for its performance in Atlanta,
with the results delivery system incurring many problems and unable
to meet its promises to news organizations.
	   The decision means the company won't be involved in the 2002
Winter Games in Salt Lake City. U.S. Olympic Committee marketing
chief John Krimsky expressed some concern about the timing.
	   ``With less than four years to go (before the 2002 Games), it is
absolutely essential for the organizing committee to move quickly
in replacing IBM's technical capability with a results system
necessary for the conduct of the Games,'' he told The Salt Lake
Tribune.
	   Still, officials of both the Salt Lake and U.S. Olympic
committees expect to benefit from the change.
	   ``It increases the chances of revenues from the sales of
sponsorships to several parties instead of one,'' SLOC President
Frank Joklik told the Tribune.
	   He envisions sponsorships worth tens of millions of dollars from
separate companies offering computer hardware, software, results or
system integration.
	   ``The value of marketing rights in the computer category has
increased because technology has expanded so rapidly. It's hard for
one sponsor to put adequate valuation into it,'' he said.
	   IBM was one of 11 global sponsors of the 1998 Games. Most paid
the IOC more than dlrs 40 million for their sponsorship packages,
but IBM spent roughly twice that to fill the additional role of
technology provider.

Sudanese minister says peace talks with rebels have collapsed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Peace talks between the Sudanese
government and southern insurgents have collapsed, Sudan's Foreign
Minister announced Friday.
	   ``The talks failure is the result of the stubborness of the
(rebel) movement and its premeditated determination to lead the
talks into an impasse,'' Mustafa Osman Ismail told reporters in the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, where the talks began Tuesday.
	   The official Sudan News Agency quoted Osman as accusing the
Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army delegation of backtracking from a
committment to accept the borders of southern Sudan as defined when
the country took independence from Britian and Egypt in 1956.
	   The SPLA has wanted to add the Nuba mountain area and Blue Nile
province, which lie in northern Sudan, to the south. The government
delegation rejected this.
	   Ismail said the government also rejected SPLA proposals for the
interim period between a permanent cease-fire and a referendum on
self-determination for the south. Among other things, the SPLA
wants the north and the south to have separate legislatures and
armed forces during this period.
	   The SPLA rejected government proposals for extending the current
three-month cease-fire, Ismail told the agency.
	   The cease-fire was agreed last month to enable aid organizations
to distribute food and medicine to people facing starvation in the
south.
	   The talks failed ``because the SPLA planned it that way from the
beginning,'' the agency quoted Ismail as saying.
	   In Cairo, the spokesman of the SPLA was not available for
comment.
	   The Addis talks were the second this year between the warring
parties. Negotiations in Nairobi ended in failure in May. Both
rounds were hosted by the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development, which groups Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan,
Somalia and Djibouti.
	   The SPLA, which draws support from the south's Christian and
animist peoples, has fought since 1983 for autonomy for the south
from the Islamic north.
	   More than 1.5 milion people have died due to the fighting and
consequent famines.

Police search bishop's residence as part of fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Police have searched the home of a
Cypriot bishop in connection with an alleged scam involving dlrs
1.5 million, the attorney-general said Friday.
	   Alecos Markides declined to say what the police found when they
searched the Limassol residence of Bishop Chrysanthos of the Cyprus
Orthodox Church.
	   ``The investigation is continuing and it is too early to say
anything more,'' Markides told reporters.
	   The probe was prompted by a complaint from three Portuguese
businessmen who have said they transferred dlrs 1.5 million to the
bishop for investment in bonds and shares. The money has apparently
disappeared.
	   The bishop has already been mentioned in connection with a fraud
case involving foreign exchange worth dlrs 3.7 million which is
being investigated the Cypriot police and Scotland Yard, the London
police's detective department.
	   The bishop's four sons have been detained in Britain in
connection with the case.
	   The Holy Synod of the church has criticized Chrysanthos for
undertaking financial commitments and business deals without its
approval. The synod, which is the supreme controlling body of the
church, has said it would also investigate the bishop's various
business deals.
	   The soft-spoken Chrysanthos has welcomed the investigations,
saying he has nothing to hide.
	   Several members of parliament have called for legislation to
control the financial and business activities of the church, which
is not accountable to anyone.
	   The church is the biggest land-owner in Cyprus. It owns hotels,
mines, factories and other businesses worth hundreds of millions of
dollars.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 67 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least six Americans were believed to be among the dead in
Kenya, and the U.S. ambassador to Kenya was injured, the State
Department said. More than 60 were killed and 1,100 wounded in
Nairobi, Red Cross and ambulance officials said. At least seven
were killed and 72 hurt in Tanzania, officials said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed last week to strike American interests because some of its
members were arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt,
according to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language
newspaper published in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.'' The United States rushed
medical supplies and investigators to both Tanzania and Kenya.
	   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhumane,'' the president said, interrupting a bill-signing
ceremony in the Rose Garden to comment. ``We will use all the means
at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice no matter
what or how long it takes.''
	   A State Department official confirmed bombs that went off five
minutes apart caused the two explosions.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   Witness Julius Koiyet told The AP he saw three men throw a tin
container about 30 centimeters long (12 inches) towards the
embassy, but it bounced onto an adjacent building where it
exploded. A fourth man fired a gun randomly, striking the preacher
in the shoulder.
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal trying to reach trapped people who were crying for help.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Dazed and
bloody survivors lay on the ground until led away.
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,100 people were being treated in three
hospitals.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S.
Embassy parking lot, witnesses said. At least seven people were
killed and 72 injured, officials said. No Americans were among the
dead in Tanzania.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy was destroyed, witnesses said.
The nearby Nigerian Embassy and Algerian diplomatic residence were
damaged. Cranes were hurried to the site to tear apart wreckage in
the search for survivors. Many cars were in flames.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' witness Jim Owens told CNN. He said one
woman was injured when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her
nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   Officials made an urgent plea for blood donations and medical
help.

Security heightened at all U.S. embassies

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police hurriedly erected barricades in front of
the U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe. Extra guards were posted at the
embassy in Namibia, and additional security measures were taken at
the American mission in Rome.
	   The twin bombings Friday of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania sparked fears of a more extensive terrorist campaign
against U.S. embassies worldwide _ and security at American
diplomatic missions was immediately stepped up.
	   ``Security globally has been heightened at all U.S. embassies,''
said U.S. Embassy spokesman John Burgess in London, who refused to
disclose exactly what new measures were taken.
	   The London embassy, in fashionable Grosvenor Square, is already
ringed by 87 steel-reinforced concrete posts, installed in February
and designed to prevent terrorists from targeting the building with
car bombs.
	   In Cairo, Egyptian police strengthened security outside the U.S.
Embassy and U.S. Agency for International Development offices. The
embassy was closed Friday for the Islamic sabbath.
	   The Ugandan government ordered traffic police to move vehicles
from the building housing the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, and
additional security officers ringed the building near Parliament
housing the mission.
	   In many capitals, including Bangkok and Bucharest, U.S. Embassy
officials refused to discuss security.
	   ``Additional security measures have been taken,'' said U.S.
Embassy spokesman Gene Bigler in Rome. ``That's all I can say.''
	   A U.S. Defense Department official said the threat condition at
the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam had been considered low.
	   Eight Marines are detailed to the Tanzanian embassy and 33
Department of Defense employees are associated with the Kenyan
embassy, including eight Marines and two Navy SeaBees.
	   The principal security for embassy buildings is provided by
local governments.
	   U.S. Defense Department personnel are usually involved as
military liaisons or attaches and the Marines are posted at
embassies to ensure sensitive materials are destroyed if necessary.
	   After Friday's bombings, armed U.S. Marines patrolled the
streets outside both embassies.
	   British security specialist Michael Yardley, who has written a
number of books on terrorism, said the terrorists would probably
not have succeeded in causing such devastating casualties if they
had attacked embassies in Cairo, Paris or London, where security is
tight.
	   ``If you harden one target ... terrorism merely deserts to a
softer target. That seems to be exactly what's happened here,'' he
said.
	   From a U.S. standpoint, Yardley said, ``it's almost impossible
to protect yourself globablly from this sort of attack.''

Doubts about Kohl's successor cause uncertainty in Bonn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder comments about Greens, grand coalition &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strategy to win over
conservative voters who feel it's time for new blood has been to
designate an heir who might be able to step in midway through a
fifth term.
	   But that strategy showed signs of fraying Friday.
	   The wife of Kohl's heir-apparent, Wolfgang Schaeuble, hinted
that her husband might not want the job, leaving an opening for
Kohl's challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, to say Schaeuble's not the
conservative he'd most like to work with if elected anyway.
	   Germany's two main parties, staunch political rivals, could be
forced to work together if neither is able to form a coalition with
one or more smaller party after the Sept. 27 election.
	   Kohl, who has led Germany for 16 years, has made clear he'd have
no part of such a ``grand coalition,'' though, making way for a
successor.
	   As early as last fall, Kohl said he wanted Schaeuble, his
parliamentary leader and No. 2 man in Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, to succeed him someday.
	   But Schaeuble's wife, Ingeborg, told Stern magazine this week
she had ``very great reservations'' about her husband ever becoming
chancellor.
	   ``I think it's an office that takes a huge amount of energy and
would leave him even less elbowroom,'' she said. ``And aside from
that, I don't think it would be easy to sell the public on a
picture of a chancellor in a wheelchair.''
	   Schaeuble has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was
shot by a crazed assailant during a campaign appearance in 1990.
	   The campaign manager for the opposition Social Democrats, Franz
Muentefering, said he thought Mrs. Schaeuble would not have made
such comments so close to the election without checking with her
husband first.
	   That indicates, he said, that Schaeuble ``doesn't want to be
Kohl's crown prince any more.''
	   If Schaeuble stepped aside, Kohl's ambitious defense minister,
Volker Ruehe, would probably become the favorite.
	   Meanwhile, Schroeder, the Social Democratic challenger, told Die
Zeit weekly newspaper he'd rather work with Ruehe anyway if it came
to a grand coalition.
	   Schroeder said he found Schaeuble ``very conservative,'' while
Ruehe was ``maybe more open for the opposing side to begin with.''
	   With the smaller parties hovering around the 5 percent minimum
needed to make it into parliament at all, some political analysts
believe such a coalition is increasingly likely.
	   In an interview Friday with RTL television, Schroeder seemed to
strengthen that view, saying he'd turn quickly to Kohl's Christian
Democrats if coalition talks with the ecology-minded Greens fail.
	   Schroeder said three conditions would be decisive for him to
form a coalition with the Greens: a guarantee of economic
stability, no discussion about basic law and order issues and
continuity in foreign policy.

Two tourist islands ablaze as fires rage in southern Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Fires apparently ignited by lightning and
sparks from failing power lines continued raging out of control
Friday across southern Croatia and several islands.
	   More than 50 separate blazes were reported by noon. The most
serious fires were on the islands of Korcula and Lastovo, where
manpower was thin before flames rapidly began spreading.
	   Tourists and locals were being evacuated by ferry. Unlike
Thursday, when two people died, no injuries were reported.
	   However, the danger to homes and property remained high as the
fires swept through hundreds of hectares (acres) of pine and brush
and approached isolated towns.
	   ``When a person sees the extent of the damage firsthand, the
devastation is much grimmer,'' said President Franjo Tudjman, who
flew down to inspect the southern peninsula of Peljesac, where
blazes fanned by gale-force winds wreaked the widest damage.
	   State officials declared a state of emergency Thursday. More
than 30 homes, a tourist camp and a kindergarten were destroyed in
Peljesac. Key power and water outlets were damaged.
	   Tudjman vowed that the government would provide aid to victims
and assist in the reconstruction of their scorched homes.
	   More than 1,200 professional firefighters, joined by army units
and civilian volunteers, were battling the blazes.
	   They were supported by custom-made aircraft dumping water on the
flames. Two Canadair planes dispatched from France were immediately
directed to critical areas Friday afternoon.
	   Huge clouds of smoke and soot tainted the blue skies above the
islands and television footage showed locals wrapping cloths across
their faces to prevent smoke inhalation.
	   Coastal roads along the Adriatic and in the hinterlands of the
ancient resort town of Dubrovnik were closed to all traffic except
bustling fire engines and water tankers.
	   In the central Adriatic cities of Zadar and Sibenik, where more
than 30 fires have raged since Wednesday, only a few remained out
of control. Most of the problems were due to land mines, which were
planted during Croatia's war for independence in 1991 and now
hampered firefighters.
	   Southern Croatia has been in the throes of more than a week of
extremely hot, dry weather, often aggravated by high winds that can
quickly whip a fire out of control and turn huge forests into
tinderboxes.
	   Officials from the Interior Ministry said they hoped to have
most of the fires contained by early evening.

Sudanese minister says peace talks with rebels have collapsed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Peace talks between the Sudanese
government and southern insurgents have collapsed, Sudan's Foreign
Minister announced Friday.
	   ``The talks failure is the result of the stubborness of the
(rebel) movement and its premeditated determination to lead the
talks into an impasse,'' Mustafa Osman Ismail told reporters in the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, where the talks began Tuesday.
	   The official Sudan News Agency quoted Osman as accusing the
Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army delegation of backtracking from a
committment to accept the borders of southern Sudan as defined when
the country took independence from Britian and Egypt in 1956.
	   The SPLA has wanted to add the Nuba mountain area and Blue Nile
province, which lie in northern Sudan, to the south. The government
delegation rejected this.
	   Ismail said the government also rejected SPLA proposals for the
interim period between a permanent cease-fire and a referendum on
self-determination for the south. Among other things, the SPLA
wants the north and the south to have separate legislatures and
armed forces during this period.
	   The SPLA rejected government proposals for extending the current
three-month cease-fire, Ismail told the agency.
	   The cease-fire was agreed last month to enable aid organizations
to distribute food and medicine to people facing starvation in the
south.
	   The talks failed ``because the SPLA planned it that way from the
beginning,'' the agency quoted Ismail as saying.
	   In Cairo, the spokesman of the SPLA was not available for
comment.
	   The Addis talks were the second this year between the warring
parties. Negotiations in Nairobi ended in failure in May. Both
rounds were hosted by the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development, which groups Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan,
Somalia and Djibouti.
	   The SPLA, which draws support from the south's Christian and
animist peoples, has fought since 1983 for autonomy for the south
from the Islamic north.
	   More than 1.5 milion people have died due to the fighting and
consequent famines.

Zabaleta stages unlikely comeback to upset Dosedel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Argentinian Mariano Zabaleta
survived six match points Friday to come back from 5-1 down in the
third set at the Grolsch Open, upsetting Czech Slava Dosedel 2-6,
7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5).
	   Zabaleta faces a Saturday semifinal against 42nd-ranked Swede
Magnus Norman, also unseeded here, who earlier in the afternoon
easily disposed of Spaniard Galo Blanco in straight sets 6-2, 6-4.
	   Defending champion Dosedel, seeded eight at this dlrs 500,000
ATP clay court tourney, looked to be cruising in the first set.
	   But the first four games of the second set all produced service
breaks as both players drifted into unforced errors.
	   The set settled down with both players holding serve but at 5-5
in the tiebreaker Zabaleta produced a stunning backhand pass and
converted the set point it gave him.
	   Dosedel then charged to 5-1 in the third set but missed two
match points before dropping his own service.
	   The 20-year-old Zabaleta then saved four more match points on
his own service in the next game, put together a five-game winning
streak and found himself leading 6-5.
	   Dosedel had enough fight left to break serve and force another
tiebreaker but then at 5-5 a fortunate net cord gave the
Argentinian his first match point and he made no mistake.
	   Norman began aggressively, hitting the ball hard and low over
the net and broke 102nd-ranked Blanco's service to love in the
first game to set the pattern of the match.
	   Blanco put up tougher resistance in the second set but Norman
broke decisively in the seventh game.
	   Saturday's other semifinal pits top-seeded Slovakian Karol
Kucera, 14 in the rankings, against the No.6 seed 37th-ranked
Australian Richard Fromberg.

Judge bans unwritten Delon bio; author cries creeping censorship
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Actor Alain Delon has persuaded a French judge to
block an unauthorized biography of him even before it's written,
and the author threatened countersuits Friday, complaining of
France's worst censorship since World War II.
	   The 62-year-old screen idol demanded to read an 18-page synopsis
of the book linking him to shady figures, and he decided that
``spelunkers of the garbage can and investigators in the gutter
must be stopped,'' he said in Friday's France-Soir.
	   Judge Marie-Claude Domb on Wednesday blocked the book at least
until another hearing Oct. 14. The action again raised questions of
how far censorship should go in a country that has repeatedly
banned literature in recent years.
	   In her ruling, the judge noted what she called ``the gravity of
the attacks on intimacy and privacy.'' Author Bernard Violet faces
a 30,000-franc (dlrs 5,000) fine per copy if he goes ahead with the
book.
	   Violet's lawyer Jean Chevais said Friday he would sue Delon for
``damages and interest for attacking the honor and the reputation''
of his client and planned to sue the publishers Grasset for passing
the synopsis to Delon.
	   Violet said if Judge Domb maintains the book ban, ``it means
France is no longer a country of free expression but a totalitarian
country.
	   ``This has never happened except during the Second World War,''
he said in a telephone interview.
	   The author received support from the Reseau Voltaire, or
Voltaire network, an association of writers, journalists and
lawyers defending free speech.
	   ``It's a precedent. The magistrate blocked a book that hasn't
been written yet,'' said the group's president, Thierry Meyssan.
	   Meyssan said only under the collaborationist Vichy regime during
World War II did France exercise ``prior censorship.''
	   Violet said three-fourths of his book was to cover Delon's
career but that he also examined Delon's links to controversial
figures he's been photographed with, including maverick Russian
politician Alexander Lebed.
	   After reading the outline, Delon, a dashing star in dozens of
movies including ``The Leopard'' and ``Rocco and his Brothers''
told France-Soir that he ``will let no one sully me.''
	   The book's publishers, Editions Grasset, accused Delon of
``reinventing the process'' of determining a book to be damaging.
	   Grasset's director, Denis Bourgeois, told France-Soir he was
surprised ``that one can ban something that hasn't been done.''
	   Still, Grasset has decided not to publish Violet's proposed
book. Delon took action to prevent anyone else from printing it.
	   French judges have banned other books in recent years, including
one by a former doctor to the late President Francois Mitterrand
that said the president lied to the public about his cancer.

Yugoslavia demands unconditional readmission to OSCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Yugoslavia demanded its unconditional
readmission to the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe during recent talks, the Polish diplomat who represented the
OSCE said Friday.
	   Jerzy M. Nowak told The Associated Press that the talks, held in
Warsaw on Tuesday, ``did not bring the desired result'' and showed
Yugoslavia's ``quite unyielding attitude in demanding an
unconditional readmission to the OSCE.''
	   Nowak, a Foreign Ministry ambassador to the OSCE, represented
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, who chairs the OSCE this
year.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.
	   First word of the latest talks emerged Friday, three days after
they took place. Nowak blamed the delay on unspecified technical
errors.
	   The talks between the OSCE and Yugoslavia began on July 3 with
the OSCE seeking to set conditions for Yugoslavia's readmission to
the OSCE.
	   Those conditions include basing a permanent OSCE mission in
Kosovo province, where Serb forces are battling ethnic Albanians
who seek autonomy. In addition, the OSCE wants former Spanish Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez to help mediate the Kosovo crisis and
discuss democracy in Yugoslavia on behalf of the European Union.
	   Another condition is Yugoslavia's participation in talks with
ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Due to the ongoing violence in Kosovo, especially the Serb
offensive in the province, Nowak said were no plans for the talks
to resume soon.
	   ``That would require a change of Belgrade's policy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Choosing words over warfare, the Security
Council called Iraq's refusal to allow arms inspections ``totally
unacceptable'' but dangled the possibility of U.N. concessions if
Saddam Hussein cooperated.
	   The 15-member council on Thursday condemned Iraq's decision to
snub weapons chief Richard Butler, but did not disclose what it
planned to do about it, except to engage more closely with Iraq.
	   ``The Security Council called the Iraqi action totally
unacceptable,'' said the council's current president, Ambassador
Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
	   But in a follow-up briefing on Friday, Turk told reporters that
the council did not discuss consequences for Iraq _ and said that
alleviating sanctions would not be out of the question if there is
``progress'' in arms inspections in coming months.
	   ``There have been situations when sanctions regimes have
changed,'' Turk said.

Few new HIV cases found in Romanian children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The number of new children testing
positive for HIV has tumbled from nearly 2,000 per year a decade
ago to two last year, the National Commission for Fighting Against
AIDS reported Friday.
	   ``In 1988, 1,801 children were infected and 1,827 in 1989, but
infections decreased in the last years to only two new cases
recorded in 1997'', said Dr. Adrian Streinu, the chief of the
National Commission for Fighting Against AIDS.
	   Before 1990, the majority of medical instruments were
unsterilized, said Ioana Buzoiany of the anti-AIDS group.
	   But improved sterilization methods slashed the number of cases,
and today the virus is typically passed from mother to child during
birth, she said.
	   Since 1985, 1,122 adults and 7,762 children have been infected
with HIV.
	   Nearly 2,000 of the children and 200 adults have died, the
anti-AIDS group said.
	   Most of the cases have been diagnosed in the capital, Bucharest,
in the eastern county of Constanta and in the southern county of
Giurgiu, said Streinu.
	   Monthly treatment for each infected child is around dlrs 1,000,
Streinu said. The average salary in Romania is dlrs 110.

German candidate calls for new debate on Holocaust memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ The opposition candidate for German
chancellor said Friday he would put the long-debated national
Holocaust Memorial on hold if elected, casting fresh doubt on
whether it will ever be built.
	   Saying the Holocaust's horror cannot be represented by an
abstract memorial, Social Democratic challenger Gerhard Schroeder
told a television interviewer that he would call for a new national
debate if elected this fall.
	   ``I think that an open discussion about this lies before us,''
Schroeder told the RTL network.
	   More than 10 years in the planning, work is set to begin in
Berlin on the memorial next year, although the final winner of a
design competition has yet to be chosen.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, one of the monument's key backers, has
said he wants plans for the memorial wrapped up before the Sept. 27
election.
	   But some Berlin officials, who are to debate the plans Aug. 25,
have voiced reservations about it as well. And it's unlikely work
would go forward without the backing of the post-election federal
government.
	   This summer, Schroeder's pick to be his culture czar, Michael
Naumann, caused a stir by saying he thought a monument was too
grandiose and antiseptic. He suggested the money might be better
spent maintaining former concentration camps, which carry more
direct emotional impact.
	   Schroeder has been the front-runner in the race most of the
year. But a poll broadcast Friday showed Kohl's party closing to
nearly neck-and-neck.

Obuchi outlines tax cuts, pledges reform

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's first major policy
speech Friday outlining his plan to revive Japan's ailing economy
was greeted with yawns from financial markets and derisive scoffs
from rival political parties.
	   Obuchi, who was elected prime minister last week, used unusually
forceful language in promising major tax cuts and bold action to
clean up the debt-plagued banking system _ but offered little in
the way of new policy initiatives.
	   ``I have a strong sense that without courage today, there is no
tomorrow _ mark my words,'' he told the first parliament session
under his rule.
	   Analysts said financial markets had already factored in the
major points of Obuchi's speech, and would only have responded
positively if the new premier had announced surprise measures to
boost the economy.
	   ``It's pretty clear the markets aren't impressed by the
speech,'' said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Securities
(Japan). ``We didn't hear anything new.''
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 47.05 points, or 0.30
percent, closing at 15,829.17 in a fifth decline in a row. The
dollar bought 145.54 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.87 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and above its New York rate of 144.32
yen overnight.
	   Japan's main opposition parties said Obuchi had failed to
distinguish his policies from those of his predecessor, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who has received much of the blame for triggering
Japan's severe recession.
	   The prime minister's speech was ``ornamented with many flowery
words, but what he actually said was that he will follow the old
trail,'' Naoto Kan, the head of the main opposition Democratic
Party, was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.
	   Japan's trading partners have been stepping up pressure on the
new government to lift the economy out of recession and bring
relief to the country's struggling Asian neighbors.
	   Washington gave a cautious welcome to Obuchi's speech, saying
that the policies he outlined Friday would help the economy
provided they are implemented quickly.
	   ``Prime Minister Obuchi outlined some promising and constructive
steps to stimulate Japan's economy,'' a senior U.S. Treasury
Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We
urge the government to move as quickly as possible to put them into
place.''
	   But even members of Obuchi's own Cabinet say the fledgling
government has a tough road ahead. The head of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency on Friday said he will issue a report next week
showing that the country's finances are worsening.
	   ``The economy is clearly floundering,'' Taichi Sakaiya told
reporters.
	   A major plank in Obuchi's program is a package of six bills
setting up a ``bridge bank'' system to take over insolvent banks
and keep them running while bad loans and remaining assets are
sold.
	   The legislation is needed to clean up the estimated 80 trillion
yen (dlrs 551 billion) in problem loans weighing down Japanese
financial institutions. Most of the debts are left over from the
collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   The plan faces problems, however, in Parliament, where Obuchi's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party only holds a majority in the lower
house. Critics say that the proposal will only bail out struggling
banks without attacking the bad loan problem head on.
	   Another major piece of Obuchi's program is tax cuts aimed at
getting thrifty consumers to spend more money and give strapped
corporations more funds to keep afloat.
	   Obuchi said he planned about 4 trillion yen (dlrs 27.6 billion)
in personal tax cuts, moving to reduce the maximum combined
national and local income tax from 65 percent to 50 percent.
	   The prime minister also said he wanted to cut the corporate tax
rate from 46.3 percent to 40 percent. That was expected to amount
to nearly 3 trillion yen (dlrs 20.7 billion).
	   The other half of the stimulus is a planned 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 69 billion) in new spending.
	   Obuchi said he wanted to put in place a program to cut the
number of bureaucrats by 20 percent over the next decade and slash
government spending by 30 percent.
	   But the general mood after Obuchi's speech appeared to be that
Japan has heard all of that before.
	   ``(Obuchi) should know that a list of big numbers alone is not
enough to help the public regain their confidence,'' the
mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A power outage left much of Lisbon
without electricity for about two hours Friday, halting trading on
the stock exchange and stopping subway trains in their tracks.
	   The blackout, which affected more than half the city, was
triggered by a failure in a high-voltage cable supplying Lisbon's
electricity, said Jose Borges da Fonseca, a spokesman from the
Electricidade de Portugal utilities company.
	   Fonseca was unable to say what caused the failure.
	   The outage, which struck at 2:22 p.m. (1322 GMT), halted trading
on the Lisbon stock exchange and affected business at banks and
stores.
	   Traffic lights were out and most subway trains were stopped in
their tracks.
	   Telephone communications were not affected.

German group announces corporate university to teach global goals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Looking ahead to the mega-merger with
U.S. auto giant Chrysler, Daimler-Benz announced the opening Friday
of a corporate university to school executives on both sides of the
Atlantic on the merged firm's common goals.
	   The university addresses a key concern that emerged after the
creation of DaimlerChrysler was announced in the spring: the
challenge of integrating corporate cultures of the United State's
third biggest automaker and Germany's largest industrial firm.
	   Daimler-Benz Chairman Juergen Schrempp said the university was
the first of its kind in Germany and would cooperate with leading
international business schools.
	   ``The Daimler-Benz Corporate University means leadership in
management development,'' Schrempp said in a statement.
	   While the university will be managed from the Daimler-Benz'
headquarters in Stuttgart, Daimler spokesman Marc Binder said, with
seminars held at the European Institute of Business Administration
in Fontainebleau, France; the Centre for Executive Education
Programs at Hong Kong University; and Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, among others.
	   Daimler-Benz plans to enroll all of its 5,000 managers in the
university program, Binder said. Once the merger with Chrysler is
complete, their managers will also be included in the program.
	   The merger has been approved by regulatory officials in Europe
and the United States, the last major hurdle before shareholders
for both companies vote on the plan Sept. 18.
	   Some of the remaining cultural differences will have to be
worked out in the boardroom, not the classroom. Analysts have
expressed concern that the vast differences in executive pay scales
could cause friction, not least of all among more conservative
German shareholders.
	   In an indication of the sensitivity of the issue, Daimler-Benz
is not breaking out executive pay levels in its merger plan that it
is presenting to shareholders, said Daimler spokesman Eckhard
Zanger.
	   He said that the Daimler-Benz annual report showed that its top
10 executives were paid a total of 20 million marks (dlrs 11.1
million) per year and that it wouldn't be broken down any further
in the merger plan.
	   Chrysler, meanwhile, detailed Chairman Robert Eaton's dlrs 69.9
million compensation in its statement released Thursday in Traverse
City, Michigan.

Russian tax officials say crack down on debtors is in the works

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new tax chief threatened tough action
against the country's tax deadbeats on Friday, saying the
government is prepared to take ``every measure,'' including
freezing their bank accounts and seizing their property.
	   Boris Fyodorov also said tax revenues are rising steadily,
indicating progress in a struggle that has targeted some of the
country's biggest tax-dodgers _ the powerful oil and gas companies.
	   ``If we don't collect taxes ... we will have the same situation
the Soviet government found itself in,'' Fyodorov told reporters.
``It sat around, had no resources, and pretended that it was
governing. This we will not allow.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin's government has made countless promises
to improve tax collection. But it has consistently failed to raise
the revenues needed to provide basic services and pay millions of
state workers on a timely basis.
	   However, Fyodorov, a wealthy businessman who was recently
appointed to his post, is regarded as a strong-willed figure with
the courage to confront the country's most powerful corporations.
	   To underscore the government's new resolve, the Fuel and Energy
Ministry ruled late Thursday that access to oil export pipelines
would be cut for two chronic debtors, oil companies Sidanko and
Onako.
	   The companies say they cannot pay their taxes because the
government, one of their biggest customers, has not paid its oil
bills. But Fyodorov showed limited sympathy for such arguments.
	   He threatened to fire or demote top officers of state-controlled
companies as well as regional tax directors. He also said the
government would initiate bankruptcy proceedings against failing
firms.
	   ``We will take every measure, starting with freezing bank
accounts, seizing assets, seizing property, company cars, offices _
all the way down the line,'' Fyodorov told reporters.
	   He singled out Onako, saying it has made ``the most dismal
impression'' among Russia's oil companies. Fyodorov vowed to have
Onako's management replaced and warned the state-run company might
be put up for a privatization sale.
	   The government has threatened previously to seize the assets of
several oil giants, but never followed through. Fyodorov said 5,000
big companies owe a total of dlrs 50 billion in taxes.
	   Fyodorov conceded that major improvements in government revenues
would only be possible if Russia's economy starts to grow. The
country's economy has been contracting throughout the 1990s.
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved in recent months,
though not as much as hoped.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from 12.1 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.9 billion) in July, which in its turn was higher than in
June.
	   ``The figures confirm that we have made a certain progress,''
Fyodorov said.
	   In other economic news, the Finance Ministry and the
International Monetary Fund said that Russia is committed to
raising 18 billion rubles (dlrs 3 billion) through privatization by
the end of the year. The move is part of a reform plan demanded by
international lenders before they agreed to a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 67 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least six Americans were believed to be among the dead in
Kenya, and the U.S. ambassador to Kenya was injured, the State
Department said. More than 60 were killed and 1,100 wounded in
Nairobi, Red Cross and ambulance officials said. At least seven
were killed and 72 hurt in Tanzania, officials said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt, according to a report
Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published
in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.''
	   In Nairobi, three American officials were confirmed dead along
with one dependent of a U.S. government employee, a State
Department official said. Two other American officials were listed
as possibly dead and another was unaccounted for and presumed dead,
the official said.
	   No Americans were killed in the bombing near the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania, but three Tanzanians who worked at the embassy were
killed, the department official said.
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
both Tanzania and Kenya.
	   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhumane,'' Clinton said, interrupting a bill-signing ceremony in
the Rose Garden to comment. ``We will use all the means at our
disposal to bring those responsible to justice no matter what or
how long it takes.''
	   A State Department official confirmed bombs that went off five
minutes apart caused the two explosions.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   Preacher Julius Koiyet told The AP he saw three men throw a tin
container about 30 centimeters long (12 inches) towards the
embassy, but it bounced onto an adjacent building where it
exploded. A fourth man fired a gun randomly, striking Koiyet in the
shoulder.
	   Koiyet said he heard at least two bomb blasts. Police were
unable to confirm the number of explosions.
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal trying to reach trapped people who were crying for help.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Police
helicopters hovered overhead, and helped with evacuations.
	   ``There was a huge blast and everything was flying,'' said
witness Pastor Wachira. ``It was all confusion.''
	   Gesturing at dazed and bloody survivors crumpled on sidewalks
and in the road, Wilberforce Mariaria asked, ``How can someone
think of doing this kind of thing.''
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,100 people were being treated in four
hospitals.
	   In Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S. Embassy
parking lot, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said. At least seven
people were killed and 72 injured, officials said.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy in Dar es Salaam was destroyed,
witnesses said. The nearby Nigerian Embassy and Algerian diplomatic
residence were damaged. Cranes were hurried to the site to tear
apart wreckage in the search for survivors. Many cars were in
flames.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' witness Jim Owens told CNN. He said one
woman was injured when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her
nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   ``I condemn in the strongest terms such acts of terrorism
perpetrated not only in Kenya but anywhere else in the world,''
said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who surveyed the wreckage.
	   Officials made an urgent plea for blood donations and medical
help.

Lawyer: Former British spy will stay in jail to prove point
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A former British counterintelligence agent contends
information he revealed about the MI5 service was in the public
interest and he is willing to stay in jail to prove it, his lawyer
said Friday.
	   Attorney John Wadham met for about 90 minutes with David
Shayler, 32, at La Sante prison in southern Paris. It was the first
visit since Shayler's arrest last Saturday.
	   Britain is seeking the extradition of Shayler for disclosing
information on MI5 operations to the Mail on Sunday newspaper. The
government obtained an injunction last August to stop the paper
from publishing further articles.
	   ``He'll definitely plead not guilty ... He believes he has a
case and is prepared to wait in prison'' in France or Britain,
Wadham said outside the high prison wall following the visit.
	   Wadham said there would likely be no hearing in the case before
September of October and that Britain has 40 days to set out the
details in the case. The official British file as it stands says he
is wanted for breaches of the officials secrets act.
	   Shayler is willing to stay in prison ``to prove any revelations
that were made were in the public interest,'' Wadham said.
	   Wadham was accompanied by Shayler's girlfriend, Annie Machon,
with whom the ex-agent had been living in a remote farmhouse in
France while trying to negotiate a return to Britain, Press
Association said.
	   Shayler's brother, Jeremy, was coming to Paris but was unlikely
to be unable to visit him over the weekend, said Wadham said, an
attorney with Liberty, a human rights group.
	   ``I don't think there is any conspiracy against David, just
hurdles to jump,'' Wadham said.
	   Shayler, who left MI5 last year, has been held at La Sante since
his arrest.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said at the time Shayler had
access ``to highly sensitive information which he has undertaken
never to reveal.''
	   The Sunday Times reported that Shayler was planning to divulge
further details of MI5 operations on an Internet website. The
Sunday Times said Shayler was working with Richard Tomlinson, a
former agent of the spy agency MI6.
	   Tomlinson served a year in prison after admitting giving secret
information to a publisher, The Sunday Times said.
	   ``There was never any intention to damage national security. The
French authorities should not therefore extradite him,'' Wadham
said last week.
	   In the Mail on Sunday articles last year, Shayler said MI5 had
kept files on prominent politicians, including Straw and Peter
Mandelson, now the trade secretary in Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Cabinet.
	   Shayler had resigned from MI5 five months before the Mail on
Sunday articles. He had worked for the agency for 4 1/2 years.

Cross controversy the latest and most intractable at Auschwitz

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ On the surface, it seems a straightforward
dispute _ Jews don't like a large cross erected by Poland's
Catholics near Auschwitz, the symbol of Nazi brutality and
calculated killing.
	   But finding a solution has been anything but straightforward.
	   For the third time since Poland's borders opened following the
end of communist rule in 1989, the former Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz has become embroiled in controversy.
	   The focus now is an eight-meter (26-foot) brown cross standing
on property bordering Auschwitz that in recent weeks has become a
sore point in Israeli-Polish relations.
	   To Poles who put it up in 1988, the cross is a memorial to 152
Polish resisters killed at the site and other Polish victims of the
Nazis. To Jews, it is a stain on the memory of the more than 1
million Jews killed at Auschwitz and nearby Birkenau camp.
	   While outside the actual border of Auschwitz, the cross can be
seen from parts of the camp, particularly the notorious ``death
wall'' where thousands were shot to death.
	   ``A tall papal cross overshadowing the largest Jewish cemetery
is unacceptable to Jews,'' said Konstanty Gebert, editor-in-chief
of the Jewish monthly magazine Midrasz. ``It is a symbol of
persecution that Jews suffered from the Catholic Church.''
	   But to Poles, especially conservative Catholics, the cross from
a 1979 mass Pope John Paul II celebrated at Birkenau represents
Polish nationalism.
	   ``I don't care about Polish-Israeli relations. I am defending
the cross,'' said activist Kazimierz Switon, one of its most
extreme supporters.
	   Below the surface arguments lie the intricacies of Polish
society, especially the power of the Catholic church. More than 90
percent of Poland's 40 million people are Catholic, and
conservative Catholics are using the cross as a rallying point.
	   Last week, a conservative radio station linked to the Solidarity
political movement inspired supporters to place about 50 smaller
crosses next to the papal cross. Another two crosses, both 10-feet
(three meters) or more, have gone up in recent days.
	   The new crosses caused the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in
Jerusalem, which is funded by Israel's government, to deliver a
formal protest to the Polish government. Clearly wishing to avoid a
showdown with the church, the Polish government responded it lacked
any authority to get involved.
	   Both the Polish church and Jewish groups appear to believe that
any concession regarding Auschwitz will bring total surrender on
how it is preserved.
	   A dispute over the presence of Carmelite nuns next door to
Auschwitz required intervention in 1993 by the pope, who asked the
nuns to leave. Jewish groups were quiet then about the papal cross,
which is at the former nunnery.
	   When businessmen wanted to build shops across the road from
Auschwitz in 1996, the international committee that runs the
memorial stopped them. That led to an agreement between Jewish
groups and the Polish government last year on spending dlrs 93.5
million to expand and preserve the Auschwitz museum.
	   But Jewish groups balked at signing the agreement this year,
demanding the removal of the papal cross. In response, Switon and
other Catholics inspired by the conservative Radio Maryja put up
the additional smaller crosses.
	   The death camp memorial is a UNESCO heritage site with a
500-meter (yard) protective zone around it to preserve its historic
character.
	   Jewish groups argue the cross, which stands in the protective
zone, adds a religious aspect and therefore violates the UNESCO
convention. But Poles say nothing in the UNESCO convention bans
religious symbols.
	   Gebert, the Jewish writer, said a monument to Polish victims
that includes a small cross would probably be acceptable. But
Archbishop Tadeusz Goclowski, a prominent church leader, said:
``Then someone would come and say: it is still too big, and another
one would say: still too big.''

Mexican drug cartel's financial chief ordered to prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexican district court has ordered the
``financial brains'' of the Juarez drug cartel be held in prison on
charges of money laundering for allegedly transferring funds
between Mexico and Chile.
	   Manuel de Jesus Bitar Tafich is accused of laundering some dlrs
400,000 in drug profits for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who died last
year in a botched cosmetic surgery operation.
	   The formal order that Bitar be held in a Mexico City prison was
handed down Thursday, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Carrillo Fuentes, who based his cocaine-smuggling ring in the
northern border city of Juarez, was one of Mexico's most-wanted
traffickers at the time of his death. Investigators believe he had
been trying to establish himself in Chile.

US rallies past Italy to set up semifinal against Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with US win. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The United States withstood a 32-point
performance by Carlton Myers and rallied to edge Italy 80-77 Friday
to set up a semifinal meeting with Russia at the World Basketball
Championship.
	   Michael Hawkins led the U.S. collection of castoffs with 16
points and Wendell Alexis added 14, including two free throws with
25.7 seconds left that put the Americans ahead 79-77.
	   Myers missed a 28-foot 3-point attempt that would have won the
game with 2.9 seconds on the clock, and Kiwane Garris (11 points)
added a free throw for the final margin.
	   ``Eventually we wore them down and made the baskets that
counted,'' said Alexis, a star at Syracuse in the 1980s who now
plays in the German League. ``We would have loved to win the game
by 30 points, but now it's down to the medal round and every game
is going to be hard.''
	   The Dream Team probably would have beaten Italy by about 30
points, but USA Basketball dumped the NBA stars in mid-June in the
midst of the league's ongoing labor dispute.
	   In their place is a rag-tag mix of players drawn mainly from the
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   Russia moved into the semifinals by pulling away from Lithuania
82-67 as Vassily Karassev had 31 points. Russia lost the United
States in the gold medal game at the 1994 worlds.
	   Yugoslavia played Argentina and Greece faced Spain in Friday's
later quarterfinals.
	   The London-born Myers, whose mother is Italian, repeatedly found
seams in the American defense for slashes to the basket, often
resulting in trips to the line. He made all 15 of his free throws,
but shot 7-for-18 (39 percent) from the field.
	   ``This game was tough to lose. We were there to the end,'' Myers
said.
	   Slovenian-born center Gregor Fucka added 11 points for Italy.
	   Hawkins and backup guard Kiwane Garris (11 points) scored
several key baskets down the stretch as the United States clawed
back from a 73-66 deficit with 4:57 left.
	   Jimmy Oliver, the Purdue product whose 14.0 scoring average led
the United States in preliminary-round play, had just two points,
on a pair of free throws with 2:45 remaining.
	   Karassev scored 19 in the second half and Sergey Babkov added 10
points and 6 rebounds for Russia.
	   ``Today we had some bad moments on offense and somebody had to
take over,'' said Karassev, who made 9-of-14 shots from the field
and 12-of-14 free throws. ``Sometimes you're a hero when you do
that and sometimes you're not.''
	   Russia pulled away with a 9-0 run late in the second half, after
Lithuania had closed to within 63-61 on two free throws by
2.18-meter (7-foot-2) center Eurelijus Zukauskas.
	   Karassev scored nine points in an earlier 14-4 spurt that gave
Russia the lead for good early in the second half.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists at the last two Olympics, went
without a field goal for the first six minutes of the second half
and shot just 17-of-48 (35 percent) from the field for the game,
which was attended by about 2,000 people at the 18,000-capacity
Olympic arena.
	   The loss knocked Lithuania out of medal contention, a
disappointment after the team handed the United States its lone
loss at the tournament in preliminary round action.
	   But Russia shut down Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of
Karnisovas and Saulius Stombergas after the break. Stamburgas
finished with 17 points and Arturas Karnisovas with 14, but they
combined for just eight in the second half.
	   ``We were holding them and holding them,'' said Karnisovas, who
entered averaging 18.2 points per game, second-best at the
tournament. ``We got as close as two points, then we made such big
mistakes on defense.''
	   In consolation games played Friday, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's
33 points led Australia past Canada 88-71, while Rogerio Klafke had
19 points and 7 rebounds as Brazil defeated Puerto Rico 76-64.

Wasps vs. mealybugs war intensifies in Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE BULLOCK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The invading forces
have long since taken the beachheads and are now spreading inland,
laying waste. But fresh troops are coming to try to turn them back.
	   The war between the invading pink hibiscus mealybug and the
residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands is intensifying. The residents
have brought in mercenaries: stinging wasps from Taiwan that are
the sworn enemies of the mealybug.
	   The mealybugs must be stopped, say Virgin Islands Agriculture
Department officials before they destroy local farms _ and gain
another stepping stone toward reaching the U.S. mainland.
	   The mealybugs get their name from their taste for hibiscus sap,
but more than flowers are at stake. The insect destroys 125
different commercial plant species.
	   Since it invaded the Caribbean, Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago
have suffered the worst damage, estimated at dlrs 170 million
between 1994, when it was first spotted, and April 1997. The insect
probably came from India or Egypt on planes or ships, experts
believe.
	   Earlier this year, the Virgin Islands Agriculture Department
began breeding stinging wasps imported from Taiwan to be released
in the fields and kill at least some of the mealybugs.
	   ``Eliminating it now is virtually impossible,'' said Dr. Arthur
Petersen, commissioner of agriculture for the U.S. territory.
	   Production of the wasps at the department's breeding facility
has been increased to 3,000 a week, up from 500 a week. The wasps
are released not just in the Virgin Islands, but also in Grenada,
the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
	   The possibility of spreading to the larger island of Puerto Rico
concerns officials because of the number of farms there that could
be affected and because of the hundreds of flights per week and the
heavy ship traffic between the island and the United States. From
Puerto Rico, the mealybug could establish another beachhead, in the
50 states.

Blatter: 2002 World Cup will go ahead as planned, 2006 could go to
</HEADLINE>
Africa

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ FIFA president Sepp Blatter sees no danger that
South Korea will pull out of staging the next World Cup and
indicated the 2006 tournament should be held in Africa.
	   Blatter, recently elected head of soccer's world governing body,
says he is not concerned about the ability of South Korea and Japan
to host the event for any reason, economic or bad weather.
	   ``The FIFA contracts for the basic finance support of this
competition _ television and marketing rights _ are already signed
and ensured, so we do not have any concern about the economic
situation,'' he told BBC radio on Friday.
	   The Koreans suggested the month-long competition be put back to
September to avoid the rainy season. But Blatter confirmed the 2002
World Cup would not be rescheduled because the dates _ in the
summer months of June and July _ had been agreed.
	   Blatter also revealed Africa was a ``logical'' choice to host
the 2006 World Cup. South Africa had applied to become the first
African nation to stage the competition and faces opposition from
front-running candidates Germany and England.
	   ``I would say if the conditions are fulfilled by one of the
associations bidding in Africa, then logically FIFA should give the
World Cup to an African country,'' he said.
	   ``But it is not my decision. The decision will be of the
executive committee and will be taken in the first half of the year
2000.
	   ``England is definitely a good candidate, but other associations
will have good documentation.
	   ``We definitely know the ability of England to organise
international football competition after the European Championships
in 1996.''

Olympic champ Michelle Smith says she's innocent of masking drug

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Banned triple Olympic gold medalist
Michelle Smith on Friday maintained her innocence of a doping
violation and accused swimming's governing body of conspiring to
end her career.
	   Facing FINA's four-year ban for allegedly tampering with a drugs
sample smelling strongly of whiskey, she vowed to clear her name at
an appeals hearing and sue the organization for compensation.
	   At a packed Dublin news conference Smith, flanked by her lawyer
Peter Lennon and husband Erik de Bruin, said she would seek
``significant damages against FINA for what can only be described
as a blatant and mischievous attempt to ruin my swimming career and
my international standing.''
	   A FINA doping panel on Thursday ruled Smith was guilty of
tampering with an out-of-competition urine test taken at her
Kilkenny home in January. The panel said that the sample had been
spiked with a large quantity of alcohol, probably whiskey, and
banned her from competing for four years.
	   The ban would include the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2001
World Championships and effectively end the 28-year-old swimmer's
career.
	   ``I am fighting for my reputation and for my right to go to
Sydney,'' she told Irish national broadcasters RTE after her news
conference. ``I want to be up on the winner's blocks again.
	   ``I'm not going to crawl under a stone and never be heard from
again and not fight against this ban,'' she emphasized on the
program, during which she fielded questions from supporters and
skeptics alike.
	   ``I know I have never done anything in the past to put myself or
my family or my country to shame. I am determined to follow this
through to the end. I look forward to doing my country proud
again.''
	   Earlier, reading from a 12-page statement at her lawyer's
offices, Smith emphasized that the alcohol present in the sample
hadn't prevented the laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, from
determining that no performance-enhancing drug or signs of abuse
were present.
	   ``I had no motive for introducing alcohol or indeed any other
masking agent into my sample, as I have never tested positive for
the use of any banned substance throughout my career,'' she said.
``And as the laboratory has confirmed there was no banned substance
(in the sample), the issue of motive does not arise.''
	   Smith said FINA had produced no proof that she was to blame for
the added alcohol. She accused FINA officials of conspiring ``to
ensure that I did not swim again and to ensure that, by whatever
method was available to them, a ban was imposed.''
	   When asked why swimming authorities might pursue such a
vendetta, Smith gestured to the taciturn de Bruin beside her: ``I'm
married to this man. Some people think that's motive enough.''
	   De Bruin was the Netherlands' champion discus thrower before
testing positive for excessive testosterone, for which he served
his own career-ending, four-year ban from competition.
	   FINA officials were unavailable for comment on Smith's
accusations Friday or to react to her plans to appeal.
	   Lennon said their first step would be to appeal FINA's decision
at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne,
Switzerland. But if they didn't win that appeal, he said the
European Court for Human Rights might be a venue for a further
challenge.
	   Smith overcame conventional wisdom and her own previous mediocre
record to win three gold medals and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, three years after de Bruin became her coach.
	   While fans said it demonstrated a triumph of will against the
odds, her detractors alleged the feat must have been aided by
illegal substances.
	   Smith has always denied using performance-enhancing drugs and
said she has been subjected to more testing than any of her
competitors.
	   The FINA judgment emphasized that her original and her back-up
samples taken in January, which were stored and tested separately,
both contained the high-alcohol content.
	   This, it said, ruled out the possibility that anyone other than
Smith had tampered with the samples during transportation or in the
laboratory.
	   Smith's devoted circle in her native Rathcoole, west of Dublin,
has remained loyal to the woman lauded in local posters as ``our
belle Michelle.'' Some said they would donate to a legal ``fighting
fund'' if Smith wanted.
	   Of her many Rathcoole relatives, she said: ``It's a disaster,
they're devastated really, they can't believe that it's happening
and they're very upset.''
	   The articulate, confident strawberry blonde has never been able
to translate her Olympic feats into commercial success even in her
native land, where less successful sports stars are national
heroes.
	   Hours before her ban was announced Smith appeared at the Dublin
Horse Show as a celebrity guest on Ireland's Gaelic-language
television channel, Telefis na Gaelige, a fringe outlet in
predominantly English-speaking Ireland.
	   Smith thanked the Irish-language authority Bord na Gaelige as
well as the shampoo manufacturers Nexus for maintaining
sponsorship, but admitted that the scandal ``has certainly damaged
my ability to become involved with major sponsors.''

Wasps vs. mealybugs war intensifies in Virgin Islands

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Preparing to step up
their war against the invading pink hibiscus mealybug, U.S. Virgin
Islands residents have been breeding stinging wasps from Taiwan to
kill at least some of the mealybugs.
	   The mealybugs must be stopped, say Virgin Islands Agriculture
Department officials, before they destroy local farms and get
closer to the U.S. mainland.
	   The mealybugs get their name from their taste for hibiscus sap,
but more than flowers are at stake. The insect destroys 125
different commercial plant species and has caused millions of
dollars in damages on several islands.
	   The insect probably came from India or Egypt on planes or ships,
experts believe.
	   Earlier this year, the Virgin Islands Agriculture Department
began breeding stinging wasps imported from Taiwan to be released
in the fields.
	   ``Eliminating it now is virtually impossible,'' said Dr. Arthur
Petersen, commissioner of agriculture for the U.S. territory.
	   Production of the wasps at the department's breeding facility
has been increased to 3,000 a week, up from 500 a week.
	   Officials want to keep the bug from spreading to neighboring
Puerto Rico, with its hundreds of flights per week and the heavy
ship traffic to the United States.

	   PRIJEDOR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ About 3,000 Bosnian Serbs
attended the funeral Friday of Milan Kovacevic, a war crimes
suspect who died during his trial before a U.N. tribunal.
	   Relatives, supporters and top Bosnian Serb hard-line politicians
paid their last respect to the man they say was wrongly charged
with atrocities, genocide and crimes against humanity the Serbs are
accused of committing against Muslims and Croats at three infamous
prison camps in northwestern Bosnia.
	   Kovacevic died last Saturday in his prison cell in The Hague,
the Netherlands, where the U.N. war crimes tribunal and the
high-security prison for arrested war crimes suspects are based.
His body was flown back to the region on Thursday.
	   Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb nationalist hard-liner and
member of Bosnia's three-man presidency, attended the funeral.
Krajisnik is also considered close to the ousted Bosnian Serb
leader and most wanted war crimes suspect, Radovan Karadzic.
	   Krajisnik made no comment at the ceremony, a a major event in
this drab town.
	   The coffin with a glass cover showing Kovacevic's face was first
displayed at city hall. More than a thousand marched past it in a
sign of respect.
	   The actual funeral was 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, in his
native village of Bozici.
	   ``Do not judge so you won't be judged. Do not be afraid of those
who kill the body, the soul cannot be killed,'' a Serb Orthodox
priest said as the coffin was lowered into the grave.
	   Kovacevic, a pre-war anesthesiologist, had pleaded innocent to
all 15 counts against him. He faced a possible life sentence in
case of conviction.
	   An official report from his autopsy is yet to be released, but
sources close to the forensic experts have claimed Kovacevic died
slowly and painfully from a ruptured aorta.
	   The Yugoslav government, which is requested to cooperate with
the tribunal in The Hague and to surrender war crimes suspects, has
protested to U.N. authorities, saying Kovacevic was denied proper
hospital treatment, but the tribunal rejected the accusation as
unfounded.
	   U.N. troops in Bosnia arrested Kovacevic in July last year in
Prijedor. The town's authorities had warned U.N. officials not to
attend the funeral, saying this could trigger unrest.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 67 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least eight Americans were among the dead in Kenya and a
ninth was missing and presumed dead, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris
Scharf said. The U.S. ambassador to Kenya was among the injured.
	   More than 60 were killed and 1,100 wounded in Nairobi, Red Cross
and ambulance officials said. At least seven were killed and 72
hurt in Tanzania, officials said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated

	   Police made no immediate comment but told state-owned Kenya
Broadcasting Corp. they suspected a van loaded with explosives and
parked behind the embassy caused the blast.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The early release of the imprisoned IRA
killer of Prince Charles' great-uncle outraged many members of the
public Friday, but the father of a teen-age boy also slain by
bombmaker Thomas McMahon called it a matter of promoting peace.
	   ``Keeping him in prison will unfortunately not bring my son
back,'' said John Maxwell, whose 15-year-old son, Paul, was killed
along with Lord Mountbatten and two royal relatives by an Irish
Republican Army bomb 19 years ago.
	   The Irish government released McMahon, 50, from Dublin's
Mountjoy prison late Thursday as part of the Northern Ireland peace
agreement's promise to free more than 400 convicted members of the
IRA and pro-British paramilitary gangs.
	   ``Peace is the imperative now and we must look forward, so that
perhaps Paul's death and those of thousands of others from both
sides of the political divide here will not have been entirely in
vain,'' Maxwell said.
	   Spokespeople for the royal family said both Queen Elizabeth II
and her son Charles had been informed of McMahon's release, but had
no comment.
	   Sandra Peacock, whose husband was killed by a Protestant
paramilitary group in 1993, said she was leaving Northern Ireland
in disgust over the early paroles.
	   ``If you get life here in Northern Ireland, life should mean
life,'' she said. ``If you get 25 years, it should mean 25 years.''

 &UR; Rwanda leader threatens retaliation against Congo's Kabila &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Hours before a summit including
Congo President Laurent Kabila, Rwanda's leader on Friday
threatened his country will ``hit back'' if neighboring Congo
attacked its forces.
	   Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu arrived here for
a quickly called meeting of seven regional heads of state to deal
with the conflict in the former Zaire, now called the Republic of
Congo.
	   Kabila has accused Tutsi-dominated Rwanda of invading Congo to
create a ``Tutsi empire'' and has promised to take the conflict to
Rwanda. Rwanda and the Congolese Tutsi fighters, called
Banyamulenge, backed Kabila last year on his way to toppling
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but have since grown disaffected.
	   At a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia, on his way to Victoria
Falls, Bizimungu demanded that Kabila justify his allegation that
Rwanda was involved in the fighting.
	   ``I understand that (Kabila) has declared war by arming 10
million people, so if we are provoked of course we will hit back,''
Bizimungu said.
	   He said the leaders at the Victoria Falls summit would ask
Kabila to explain the current situation in his country and how the
region could help.
	   Earlier Friday, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe ruled out
military confrontation as a solution to the conflict in Congo,
state-run radio reported.
	   Speaking to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. on arrival at
Victoria Falls, Mugabe said he ``hopes the conflict does not
escalate and cause political turmoil to the whole of the Southern
African region and scare away investors.''
	   Mugabe said he was confident the conflict would be resolved by
the leaders.
	   The official Zimbabwean news agency ZIANA reported Friday that
also planning to attend were Ben Mukapa of Tanzania, Sam Nujoma of
Namibia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 67 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least six Americans were believed to be among the dead in
Kenya, and the U.S. ambassador to Kenya was injured, the State
Department said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt, according to a report
Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published
in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.''
	   In Nairobi, three American officials were confirmed dead along
with one dependent of a U.S. government employee, a State
Department official said. Two other American officials were listed
as possibly dead and another was unaccounted for and presumed dead,
the official said.
	   No Americans were killed in the bombing near the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania, but five Tanzanians who worked at the embassy were
killed, the department official said.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Battling to stem the rising tide of a
rebellion that appears to be sweeping into Congo's dense jungle
interior, President Laurent Kabila left his troubled capital Friday
in search of support for his weakened 14-month-old regime.
	   Just days after renegade troops waged gun battles in two army
barracks in Kinshasa, Kabila took the gamble of leaving the city in
the hands of his military and headed to his former rebel base of
Lubumbashi where he was to meet with a visiting South African
delegation.
	   A popular rebel leader who last year was hailed as a hero,
Kabila's presidency and government has failed to keep the support
of many Congolese. In Lubumbashi he hopes to recapture some of that
past glory and sorely needed backing.
	   ``We must prepare ourselves to resist the aggression and to
finish the war in the aggressors' home,'' Kabila told an earlier
press conference.
	   Kabila says Rwanda is behind the rebellion and hopes to drum up
patriotic support against Congo's eastern neighbor.
	   Rather than pushing his enemies back, however, just the opposite
appears to be true.
	   In the eastern region of Kivu, Tutsi rebels and Rwandan soldiers
_ Kabila's erstwhile allies _ have been pushing into the interior
from the border with Rwanda.
	   On the other side of the country, rebels appear to be marching
inland toward Kinshasa from Kitona, a small village and military
camp near the Atlantic coast.
	   Kabila says Rwanda is behind the growing revolt, accusing the
very troops that helped bring to power in May 1997 of ``treason.''
	   Rwanda on Friday denied involvement in the uprising, saying
Kabila's accusations were simply an effort to find a scapegoat for
disenchantment with his government.
	   ``We haven't crossed into Congo,'' Rwandan army spokesman Maj.
Emmanuel Ndahiro was quoted as saying by the private Rwandan News
Agency. ``The current crisis in Congo is to blame on Kabila himself
who has failed to deliver what he had promised to his country.''
	   Kabila intends to travel on from Lubumbashi to Zimbabwe to
attend a regional summit over the weekend. There he hopes to meet
with Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame to
demand the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from Congo, the president's
office said Friday.
	   Officials from Uganda, Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania will also
attend the summit.
	   Troops have been deployed at key government and commercial
buildings in Kinshasa and checkpoints have been set up to search
all traffic entering and leaving the city.
	   The government earlier acknowledged the eastern city of Bukavu
fell to the rebel Tutsi and Rwandan allies, state radio on Friday
said the key city of Kisangani was in government hands.
	   ``The situation is perfectly calm in Kisangani,'' Voice of the
People reported. ``This quiet was marked after two days of
trouble.''
	   Diplomats in Kinshasa, however, said they had received reports
of gunfire in and around Kisangani.
	   The rebellion that began late Sunday mirrors Kabila's own
guerrilla war, which culminated 14 months ago with the ouster of
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Unlike last year, Kabila is on the defensive while the rebels
swiftly advance through Congo's interior.
	   And Kabila's allies this time have turned against him and many
of his former foes _ Mobutu's armed forces _ appear to be backing
the one-time rebel leader.
	   Mobutu's former army chief of staff, Gen. Eluki Monga Aundu,
plans to issue an appeal to his troops to take up arms and fight
for Kabila against Rwandan soldiers and Tutsi rebels.
	   Aundu, living in exile, will call on his troops, defeated and
disarmed by Kabila, to join the fray.
	   ``The general will ask his men to take arms and fight the
Rwandan invaders,'' Aundu's spokesman, Jean-Claude Molimo, said in
a telephone interview.
	   Kabila vowed to wage a people's war against Rwanda.
	   ``The war will be long and popular, that is, the whole people of
Congo will defend their nation and sovereignty,'' said Kabila, who
wore a pair of green army fatigues Thursday as he addressed
government officials clad in military uniforms.
	   Tutsi fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan soldiers,
also Tutsis, who played a key role in Kabila's victory over Mobutu
last year, are leading the fighting.
	   At the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby Kitona village and
military base, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the capital of
Kinshasa.

UN envoy says climate of war in Angola has dissipated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. special envoy on an emergency
mission to rescue Angola's faltering peace process said Friday that
``the climate for war has dissipated.''
	   Lakhdar Brahimi was speaking in Luanda after a meeting of the
so-called Joint Commission that includes representatives of the
government, the former rebel movement UNITA and international
observers.
	   ``It was a positive meeting. We heard people from both sides
speaking about peace rather than the preparation for war,'' Brahimi
told reporters.
	   The commission was set up to monitor implementation of a 1994
U.N.-brokered peace accord that sealed a tenuous end to a 20-year
civil war between UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, and the government
of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   Recent reports of a military buildup on both sides and the
massacre of over 100 civilians triggered fears of an imminent
return to civil war, and prompted U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
to send in Brahimi who arrived a week ago.
	   The envoy said he would release more details of what he called
``the new dynamic in Angola's peace process'' at a press conference
Saturday before leaving Angola for Namibia. He was also expected to
visit Zimbabwe and Zambia as part of a regional tour to meet
leaders close to either Dos Santos or Savimbi.
	   Also Friday, Brahimi revealed that the U.N. has nominated a new
representative to replace Alioune Blondin Beye, who was killed in
an air crash in June. Issa Diallo, from the Republic of Guinea,
would be in Angola before the end of the month, he said.
	   ``We are very pleased with the nomination, and promise to help
the new mediator as we did the deceased Beye,'' said the government
representative on the Joint Commission, Higino Carneiro.
	   UNITA Joint Commission representative Isaias Samakuva refused to
comment on Diallo's nomination before consulting with the group's
leadership in its highland headquarters at Andulo, 480 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   Samakuva's arrival in the capital on Thursday night from Andulo,
with news that he was was carrying a proposal to the Joint
Commission, was one of the first signs that Brahimi's mission was
yielding results.
	   The envoy had flown to Andulo earlier in the week to meet with
Savimbi.
	   Few details of the proposal were available, although Samakuva
said it included a new calendar for UNITA's withdrawal from its
four remaining rural strongholds and could ``relaunch the peace
process.''
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of these so-called
``sensitive areas'' has been a major sticking point, prompting the
U.N. to impose harsh sanctions.
	   Government spokesman Carneiro refused to comment on the UNITA
proposals. ``The threat of war is still real'' he said.
	   Earlier Friday, Annan said in Lisbon that the Security Council
would be meeting Monday to discuss Brahimi's report on his Angolan
mission.

US rallies past Italy to set up semifinal against Russia

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time of Myers 3-pointer in graf 3. UPDATES with
Tomjanovich quote. EDITS to trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The United States withstood a 32-point
performance by Carlton Myers and rallied to edge Italy 80-77 Friday
to set up a semifinal meeting with Russia at the World Basketball
Championship.
	   Michael Hawkins led the U.S. collection of castoffs with 16
points and Wendell Alexis added 14, including two free throws with
25 seconds left that put the Americans ahead 79-77.
	   Myers missed a 28-foot 3-point attempt with 7 seconds on the
clock, and Kiwane Garris (11 points) added a free throw at the
other end for the final margin.
	   ``Eventually we wore them down and made the baskets that
counted,'' said Alexis, a star at Syracuse in the 1980s who now
plays in the German League. ``We would have loved to win the game
by 30 points, but now it's down to the medal round and every game
is going to be hard.''
	   The Dream Team probably would have beaten Italy by about 30
points, but USA Basketball dumped the NBA stars in mid-June after
the players threatened to boycott the worlds because of the
league's labor dispute.
	   In their place is a rag-tag mix of players drawn mainly from the
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``A true sign of character is when a team can be in a hole and
they don't fall apart and splinter. We feel fortunate to be where
we are,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   Russia moved into the semifinals by pulling away from Lithuania
82-67 as Vassily Karassev had 31 points. Russia lost to the United
States in the gold medal game at the 1994 worlds.
	   Yugoslavia played Argentina and Greece faced Spain in Friday's
later quarterfinals.
	   The London-born Myers, whose mother is Italian, repeatedly found
seams in the American defense for slashes to the basket, often
resulting in trips to the line. He made all 15 of his free throws,
but shot 7-for-18 (39 percent) from the field.
	   ``This game was tough to lose. We were there to the end,'' Myers
said.
	   Slovenian-born center Gregor Fucka added 11 points for Italy.
	   Hawkins and Garris scored several key baskets down the stretch
as the United States clawed back from a 73-66 deficit with 4:57
left.
	   They needed to step forward because Jimmy Oliver, the Purdue
product whose 14.0 scoring average led the United States in
preliminary-round play, had just two points, on a pair of free
throws with 2:45 remaining.
	   Karassev carried Russia, scoring 19 points in the second half.
Sergey Babkov added 10 points and 6 rebounds.
	   ``Today we had some bad moments on offense and somebody had to
take over,'' said Karassev, who made 9-of-14 shots from the field
and 12-of-14 free throws. ``Sometimes you're a hero when you do
that and sometimes you're not.''
	   Russia pulled away with a 9-0 run late in the second half, after
Lithuania had closed to within 63-61.
	   Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of Arturas Karnisovas
and Saulius Stombergas wasn't a factor in the second half.
Stamburgas finished with 17 points and Karnisovas with 14, but they
combined for eight after halftime.
	   In consolation games, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's 33 points led
Australia past Canada 88-71, while Brazil defeated Puerto Rico
76-64.

Juventus star-forward sues Roma coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero, angered by
reported suggestions by Roma's coach Zdenek Zeman that his muscular
growth may be drug-helped, on Friday instructed his agent to sue
for libel.
	   Agent Claudio Pasqualin, a lawyer, said Del Piero will seek
compensation for damages.
	   Zeman, the Czech coach of the Roman team, has caused a storm in
Italy's soccer world this week by alleging that a number of Serie A
players possibly use substances to stimulant muscle growth.
	   In interviews with some Italian daily newspapers and Rome weekly
magazine Espresso, Zeman also said he was amazed with the quick
muscular growth of some players such as Del Piero and Gianluca
Vialli.
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus, is currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League.
	   ``I know that many doctors-pharmacologists have moved from
cycling to soccer. One must avoid that the (Italian) league turns
like the Tour of France,'' Zeman told Epresso.
	   The French cycling race, which ended Sunday, was plagued by a
doping scandal.
	   Zeman never mentioned doping substances openly. He always
referred to medicines.
	   ``Also some Roma players may have used pills. At home they can
do what they want, with the help of a friendly doctor. I'm not
talking of doping,'' Zeman was quoted as saying.
	   ``Zeman's remarks are very serious and hurt the entire soccer
world,'' Pasqualin said. ``Personal sacrifice is the base of Del
Piero's success in soccer.''
	   Vialli, in Sicily for an exhibition match of his English team,
angrily refused to comment on Zeman's allegations.
	   Del Piero, Italy's No.1 star and one of the most popular
players, had some lackluster performances in the World Cup as his
preparation for France '98 was hampered by a thigh strain.
	   Meanwhile Professor Carlo Tranquilli, who heads the anti-doping
commission of the Italian soccer federation, told the ANSA news
agency that 2,500 random anti-doping tests were carried out in
Italy last season.
	   ``The Italian anti-doping system is one of the most advanced ...
for sure frequent tests decided by the federation have defeated the
use of anabolic steroids (which help muscular growth),'' the
professor said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Powerful bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
more than 67 people. More than 1,100 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least eight Americans were among the dead in Kenya and seven
more were missing, U.S. Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said. The
U.S. ambassador to Kenya was among the injured.
	   More than 60 were killed and 1,100 wounded in Nairobi, Red Cross
and ambulance officials said. At least seven were killed and 72
hurt in Tanzania, officials said.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
Rescuers worked beneath huge studio lights set up outside the
embassy as darkness fell.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment but told state-owned Kenya
Broadcasting Corp. they suspected a van loaded with explosives and
parked behind the embassy caused the blast.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt, according to a report
Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published
in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.''
	   In Nairobi, eight American were confirmed dead including
officials and at least two U.S. dependents, Scharf said. Seven
others were missing, ``and some may be dead, but others may be at
hospitals,'' he said.
	   No Americans were killed in the bombing near the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania, but five Tanzanians who worked at the embassy were
killed, a state department official said.

 &UR; Rwanda leader threatens retaliation against Congo's Kabila &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with leaders arriving, more background, color &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Hours before a summit including
Congo President Laurent Kabila, Rwanda's leader on Friday
threatened his country will ``hit back'' if neighboring Congo
attacked its forces.
	   Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu arrived here for
a quickly called meeting of seven regional heads of state to deal
with the conflict in the former Zaire, now called the Republic of
Congo.
	   Kabila has accused Tutsi-dominated Rwanda of invading Congo to
create a ``Tutsi empire'' and has promised to take the conflict to
Rwanda. Rwanda and the Congolese Tutsi fighters, called
Banyamulenge, backed Kabila last year on his way to toppling
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but have since grown disaffected.
	   The resurgence of conflict in the former Zaire, as the Congo was
known until last year, and the prospect of civil war in Congo's
neighbor to the south, Angola, has alarmed regional leaders.
	   The fighting appears to threaten the spirit of peace that rose
after apartheid's end in South Africa in 1994. Kabila's ouster of
the corrupt Mobutu raised hopes for Congo's future, and after 20
years of civil war, Angola's warring factions had appeared to be
ready to carry out a 1994 peace accord.
	   At a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia, on his way to Victoria
Falls, Bizimungu demanded that Kabila justify his allegation that
Rwanda was involved in the fighting.
	   ``I understand that (Kabila) has declared war by arming 10
million people, so if we are provoked of course we will hit back,''
Bizimungu said.
	   He said the leaders at the Victoria Falls summit would ask
Kabila to explain the current situation in his country and how the
region could help.
	   Earlier Friday, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe ruled out
military confrontation as a solution to the conflict in Congo,
state-run radio reported.
	   Speaking to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. on arrival at
Victoria Falls, Mugabe said he ``hopes the conflict does not
escalate and cause political turmoil to the whole of the Southern
African region and scare away investors.''
	   Mugabe said he was confident the conflict would be resolved by
the leaders, who planned to meet all day Saturday.
	   Wearing a trademark khaki safari suit, a smiling Kabila arrived
just as the sun was setting.
	   Presidents Ben Mkapa of Tanzania, Sam Nujoma of Namibia and
Frederick Chiluba of Zambia also arrived Friday. Uganda's President
Yoweri Museveni of Uganda had not yet arrived by nightfall.
	   Noticably absent was South African President Nelson Mandela. It
was not clear whether he had been invited.

UN envoy says climate of war in Angola has dissipated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. special envoy on an emergency
mission to rescue Angola's faltering peace process said Friday that
``the climate for war has dissipated.''
	   In Luanda, Lakhdar Brahimi made the comment after a meeting of
the so-called Joint Commission that includes representatives of the
government, the former rebel movement UNITA and international
observers.
	   ``It was a positive meeting. We heard people from both sides
speaking about peace rather than the preparation for war,'' Brahimi
told reporters.
	   The commission was set up to monitor implementation of a 1994
U.N.-brokered peace accord that sealed a tenuous end to a 20-year
civil war between UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, and the government
of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   Recent reports of a military buildup on both sides and the
massacre of more than 100 civilians in the former Portuguese colony
triggered fears of an imminent return to civil war, and prompted
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to send in Brahimi who arrived a
week ago.
	   The envoy said he would release more details of what he called
``the new dynamic in Angola's peace process'' at a press conference
Saturday before leaving Angola for Namibia. He was also expected to
visit Zimbabwe and Zambia as part of a regional tour to meet
leaders close to either Dos Santos or Savimbi.
	   Also Friday, Brahimi revealed the United Nations has nominated a
new representative to replace Alioune Blondin Beye, who was killed
in an air crash in June. Issa Diallo, from the Republic of Guinea,
would be in Angola before the end of the month, he said.
	   ``We are very pleased with the nomination, and promise to help
the new mediator as we did the deceased Beye,'' said the government
representative on the Joint Commission, Higino Carneiro.
	   UNITA Joint Commission representative Isaias Samakuva refused to
comment on Diallo's nomination before consulting with the group's
leadership in its highland headquarters at Andulo, 480 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   Samakuva's arrival in the capital on Thursday night from Andulo,
with news that he was was carrying a proposal to the Joint
Commission, was one of the first signs that Brahimi's mission was
yielding results.
	   The envoy flew to Andulo earlier in the week to meet with
Savimbi.
	   Few details of the proposal were available, although Samakuva
said it included a new calendar for UNITA's withdrawal from its
four remaining rural strongholds and could ``relaunch the peace
process.''
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of these so-called
``sensitive areas'' has been a major sticking point, prompting the
U.N. to impose harsh sanctions.
	   Government spokesman Carneiro refused to comment on the UNITA
proposals. ``The threat of war is still real'' he said.
	   Earlier Friday, Annan said in Lisbon that the Security Council
would be meeting Monday to discuss Brahimi's report on his Angolan
mission.

Petrol giant reports Greenpeace for minor oil spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _Greenpeace found itself on the other side of an oil
spill controversy when British Petroleum Co. Ltd reported a
minuscule slick _ less than four cups (one liter) _ in the Atlantic
Ocean near a ship owned by the environmental group.
	   Greenpeace acknowledged its vessel was likely to blame, but
contended that BP, with whom it has clashed frequently over oil
drilling in the North Atlantic, blew the incident out of
proportion.
	   The Marine Pollution Control Unit agreed the spill _ small
enough to break apart naturally by the wind and tide _ did not
warrant a prosecution.
	   ``This is insignificant. It is not a problem,'' said Matt Clark,
a spokesman for the pollution unit. ``It was such a small amount.''
	   The alert was raised July 13 after a BP crew spotted a
Greenpeace ship near one of its own production vessels, about 100
miles west of the Shetland Islands, northeast of Scotland.
	   After the Greenpeace ship departed, BP staff noticed an oil
slick on the water, BP spokesman Robert Wine said.
	   They took samples of the spill and then sent the information to
the Department of Trade and Industry, which passed the report along
to the Marine Pollution Control Unit.
	   Wine said BP did not accuse Greenpeace in the report, but did
note the Greenpeace ship had been in the vicinity.
	   ``It was a minimal amount, but the law says if you see oil in
the water, you report it,'' Wine said.
	   Greenpeace said the sheen probably was caused by oil washing off
the deck of its ship or other ships' decks.

Right-wing leader blamed for Bombay riots justifies his language
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with uproar in the state legislature &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo BOM101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A Hindu nationalist leader blamed in a
judicial inquiry report for ordering attacks against Muslims in the
1992-93 Bombay riots described the report Friday as unfair but
justified his inflammatory language.
	   Bal Thackeray, leader of the governing Shiv Sena Party, wields
enormous power in Bombay even though he holds no office of power.
	   More than 2,000 people were killed in nationwide riots, more
than one-third in Bombay alone, after an ancient mosque was razed
by Hindu fundamentalists in northern India in December 1992.
	   During the riots, Thackeray ordered his party workers through
articles in his party newspaper, ``Saamna,'' or Confrontation, to
attack Muslims to avenge the killings of Hindus, the judge said in
his report made public Thursday.
	   Thackeray admitted at a news conference that his speeches and
statements were inflammatory.
	   ``They were bound to be ... At that time the situation was like
that,'' he said ``I may not use that language at this time.''
	   Judge B.N. Srikrishna said in his report that the state
government did not act swiftly to contain the violence, but he
mainly blamed Thackeray.
	   ``He has no proof against me,'' Thackeray said of the judge.
``If there is chaos in Bombay again, can I blame Srikrishna for
this?''
	   The right-wing government, led by the Shiv Sena Party, delayed
making the report public, saying the findings could again trigger
Hindu-Muslim tension. The opposition protested, saying the
government was keeping it secret because it was blamed for the
violence.
	   In the Maharashtra state legislature Friday, the opposition
demanded the resignation of Manohar Joshi, chief minister of
Maharashtra state, who rejected the judge's report. The legislature
met briefly Friday but was adjourned amid chaos and exchange of
shouts by the opposition and governing party lawmakers.
	   ``The chief minister should resign immediately. Nobody is above
law, definitely not Thackeray. He should be prosecuted,'' said R.R.
Patil, a Congress Party lawmaker.
	   Narsaya Addam of the Communist Party of India said: ``Since the
government will not resign on its own, I urge the president of
India to dismiss it.''
	   Police in Bombay have been on alert for several days, fearing
clashes between Hindus and Muslims over the findings of the report.
But no violence has been reported so far.

Glitch at Spain's Prado museum left some works covered in dirt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Choking clouds of sand and dirt filled two
rooms at Madrid's prize art museum, El Prado, when debris from
renovation work got into the air conditioning system, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The glitch occurred twice, back in May, but only recently came
to light, El Pais said. The museum confirmed the mishap but
downplayed it, insisting that no art works had been damaged.
	   On May 8, visitors in a small anteroom next to a hall housing
works by El Greco heard a rumbling noise and then saw clouds of
dust spew from air conditioning ducts for half an hour.
	   ``There was so much dust you couldn't see two meters in front of
you,'' El Pais quoted one witness, historian Teresa de Angulo, as
saying.
	   Museum staff came out with feather dusters and cleaned off two
Dutch Baroque paintings that had been covered with dirt, she said.
``Then everything went back to normal, as if nothing had
happened.''
	   But it all happened again the next day, this time in a room with
works by Bartolome Esteban Murillo, El Pais said.
	   The acting director of the museum, Andres Ubeda, called both
incidents ``minor.''
	   However El Pais quoted unidentified art experts as saying it may
take up to two years to determine if the dust caused lasting damage
to any paintings.
	   The paper said this was not the first time concern has been
raised over whether museum officials have jeopardized priceless art
works in pushing on with a vast renovation and expansion project
without closing the museum.
	   The paper quoted employees as saying that when construction
crews used jackhammers, the noise and vibrations were unbearable.
	   ``One day even the ground shook,'' one employee said. ``And the
walls, well, I prefer not to even think about them.''

Report: son of Belarusian president bound for army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The eldest son of Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko, who had been rumored to be in line for a diplomatic
post, will be drafted into the army in two months, a news agency
reported Friday.
	   In an interview with Interfax, Lukashenko denied reports in
opposition newspapers that Viktor Lukashenko, a recent college
graduate, would be appointed to a diplomatic post in Switzerland.
	   He said his son would be working for two months in the Foreign
Ministry, but that ``his road leads directly to the armed forces,''
and that he probably would join the border guard service.

Annan optimistic about Angolan peace as he kicks off Portugal visit

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
optimistic on Friday that his special envoy to Angola could rescue
the country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said, referring to meetings
held this week by his special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi _ leader of the
former rebel group UNITA.
	   Annan was speaking after arriving at Porto airport, 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Lisbon, to kick off a five-day
visit to Portugal.
	   During the trip, Annan is to attend a U.N.-sponsored
international conference on youth policy. He is also to meet
officials close to peace efforts in Algeria and the former
Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and East Timor.
	   The U.N. chief sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an
emergency mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil
war, four years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the Security Council would be discussing Brahimi's
report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped the
council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring the
peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   The Secretary-General's arrival in Portugal had been postponed
for 24 hours due to Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting
in New York to discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons
inspectors. Annan did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan's first engagement in Portugal on Friday took him to the
closing ceremony of a U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in the
northern city of Braga. ``The voice of the young will be heard,''
he promised.
	   The Forum's recommendations to a ministerial conference on youth
policy beginning Saturday in Lisbon are expected to include
creation of a special rapporteur for youth at the U.N. and a
commitment from all states to elaborate a national youth strategy.
	   Annan's Saturday agenda included a meeting with former
Portuguese president Mario Soares to discuss the findings of the
recent high-level mission to Algeria investigating the roots of the
political violence rocking that country.
	   The mission has yet to release its findings.
	   Annan is also scheduled to meet President Jorge Sampaio, Premier
Antonio Guterres, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and, on Sunday, to
visit the Expo' 98 World Fair on United Nations Day.
	   He was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Albanian TV report &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran the former
Albanian rebel headquarters in central Kosovo on Friday and
appeared to have driven the secessionists from most of their
remaining strongholds in the strategic region.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said that the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   Later Friday, Serb forces entered the village of Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met last week with commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Under sniper fire, Serb troops moved from house-to-house,
clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the village and
setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into Albania, where the rebels maintain
sanctuaries.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, state television reported that
71 Kosovo Albanian refugees had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours.
	   Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova accused Serbs of molesting
``hundreds'' of Albanians in their prisons that have become ``mass
camps.''
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters in the provincial capital
Pristina.

Arsenal manager to turn down Japan job but will offer advice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Japanese soccer official sent to London to
persuade Arsene Wenger to take over as Japan's national coach is
unlikely to go home with a signature. But he won't return
completely empty handed.
	   Wenger, who steered Arsenal to an FA Cup and League championship
double last season, is almost certain to turn down an offer to
coach Japan at the 2002 World Cup but said he is prepared to advise
the team.
	   ``They need somebody and I'm desperate for them to get the right
manager to have a good World Cup,'' the Arsenal manager said
Friday. ``So, if I can help them, then I will _ indirectly.''
	   A Japanese Football Association official was reportedly in
London this week trying to lure Wenger back to Japan, which is
co-hosting the 2002 World Cup with South Korea.
	   Wenger coached Japanese club side Nagoya Grampus Eight before he
moved to Arsenal, he can speak the language and has acted as an
advisor for the Japan FA.
	   The Frenchman is expected to sign an extension to his contract
at Highbury which would rule him out of the Japan job. But he said
Friday that he was uncertain where he would be in three years.
	   ``I have one year to go on my contract and in the next two weeks
the situation will be solved and I will stay for a longer time,''
he said.
	   ``I had a great time in Japan, I love the attitude they have
towards football and I'm an advisor for the Japanese Football
Federation.
	   ``So I still have strong connections there....but I want to keep
my full concentration here at Arsenal for the next two or three
years. After that I don't know.''
	   Wenger is currently preparing his team for the Charity Shield
match against Manchester United at Wembley on Sunday.

Lawyer: Former British spy will stay in jail to prove point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A former British counterintelligence agent contends
information he revealed about the MI5 service was in the public
interest and he is willing to stay in jail to prove it, his lawyer
said Friday.
	   Attorney John Wadham met for about 90 minutes with David
Shayler, 32, at La Sante prison in southern Paris. It was the first
visit since Shayler's arrest last Saturday.
	   Britain is seeking the extradition of Shayler for disclosing
information on MI5 operations to the Mail on Sunday newspaper. The
government obtained an injunction last August to stop the paper
from publishing further articles.
	   ``He'll definitely plead not guilty ... He believes he has a
case and is prepared to wait in prison'' in France or Britain,
Wadham said outside the high prison wall following the visit.
	   Wadham said there would likely be no extradition hearing in the
case before September or October and that Britain has 40 days to
set out the details in the case. The official British file as it
stands says he is wanted for breaches of the Official Secrets Act.
	   Shayler is willing to stay in prison ``to prove any revelations
that were made were in the public interest,'' Wadham said.
	   The attorney said Shaylor was staying in a ``VIP suite'' in the
prison and can talk with other prisoners.
	   Wadham was accompanied by Shayler's girlfriend, Annie Machon,
with whom the ex-agent had been living in a remote farmhouse in
France while trying to negotiate a return to Britain, Press
Association said. She was not allowed to visit Shayler.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said at the time Shayler had
access ``to highly sensitive information which he has undertaken
never to reveal.''
	   The Sunday Times reported that Shayler was planning to divulge
further details of MI5 operations on an Internet website. The
Sunday Times said Shayler was working with Richard Tomlinson, a
former agent of the spy agency MI6.
	   Tomlinson served a four-month prison sentence after admitting
giving secret information to a publisher, The Sunday Times has
reported.
	   Tomlinson was served with an injunction Wednesday as he arrived
in Auckland, New Zealand in an attempt by the British government to
prevent him from making more ``damaging disclosures.''
	   Wadham has served as the attorney for both men.
	   In the Mail on Sunday articles last year, Shayler said MI5 had
kept files on prominent politicians, including Straw and Peter
Mandelson, now the trade secretary in Prime Minister Tony Blair's
Cabinet.
	   Shayler had resigned from MI5 five months before the Mail on

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Hours before a summit including
Congo President Laurent Kabila, Rwanda's leader on Friday
threatened his country will ``hit back'' if neighboring Congo
attacked its forces.
	   Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu arrived here for
a quickly called meeting of seven regional heads of state to deal
with the conflict in the former Zaire, now named the Republic of
Congo.
	   Kabila has accused Rwanda of invading Congo and has promised to
take the conflict to Rwanda. Rwanda and Congolese Tutsi fighters,
called Banyamulenge, backed Kabila last year on his way to toppling
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but have since grown disaffected.

Kipketer returns in Monte Carlo meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Jones, Johnson
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) - After setting two world records in
the 800 meters last year, winning his second world title and
capturing the Grand Prix overall title, Wilson Kipketer has been
slowed this year by a bout with malaria.
	   The Kenyan-born Dane makes his season debut in the Herculis
track meet, part of the lucrative Golden League series this year.
	   Kipketer had a superb 1997. He broke the world indoor record
twice in Paris in March then bettered the world outdoor record
twice, bringing it down to 1 minute, 41.11 seconds in Cologne after
a 1:41.24 in Zurich.
	   He also added the world title in Athens last year and finished
the season with a victory in the Grand Prix finals in Japan, giving
him the overall title.
	   This year has been a washout, however. He contracted malaria in
January and has been far behind in training and he hopes to salvage
the season with a good start in Monaco. He likes the Monaco track.
He has won here the last three years, all under 1:43.
	   The 800 is not one of the 12 events eligible for the dlrs 1
million bonus that will be shared among the athletes who remain
unbeaten in their specialities plus the Grand Prix final in Moscow
in September.
	   The field is now down to eight athletes after the Bislett Games
in Oslo, July 9 and the Golden Gala July 14.
	   Sprinters Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Marion Jones of the
United States are seeking their third victories in the Golden
League 100s.
	   Fredericks has a tough task to remain eligible. Olympic champion
and world-record holder Donovan Bailey is back in form, beating a
top field in Paris on July 29.
	   However Bailey's Canadian compatriot, Bruny Surin, is fresh from
a 9.89 at the Canadian championships where Bailey did 9.93.
	   Also in the field is Ato Boldon, who has done 9.86 twice this
year.
	   Jones looks to continue unbeaten in the women's 100. With a best
of 10.71 this year, she has dominated the event this year although
France's Christine Arron did 10.85 Wednesday.
	   Jones has no worry about a slight injury that forced her to pull
out of Wednesday's DN Galan meet.
	   ``I had a little cramp in my hamstring,'' Jones said.``Contrary
to rumors it wasn't my back or my thigh. I'm ready to run 100 per
cent.''
	   In the 400 Michael Johnson looks for some redemption. He was
third in Oslo, losing out on a chance for part of the bonus. He
came back to win in Rome and posted a fast 43.76 at the Goodwill
Games two weeks ago, where he anchored the American team to a world
record in the 1,600-meter relay.
	   ``My training has been going well. I have had a couple injuries
and I think I have that behind me now,'' Johnson said. ``So I am
looking forward to a good race tomorrow.''
	   Johnson started training late this year because of injuries from
last season, including the quadricep strain in the 150-meter match
race against B Bailey.
	   He bypassed the USA Championships at the end of June to
concentrate on training.
	   The last time Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran in a Golden
League meet, in Rome, he set a world record in the 1,500 in
3:26.00. He also won in Oslo in 3:29.12.
	   He could go for another record. The track in Monaco has seen
Noureddine Morceli twice come within a second of his former world
mark at 3:27.37.
	   Other men still in contention for the bonus include American
Bryan Bronson in the 400 hurdles, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie in
the 3,000 and Britain's Jonathan Edwards in the triple jump.
	   On the women's side besides Jones, Russian Svetlana Masterkova
in the 1,500 and Nigerian Charity Opara in the 400 are still
unbeaten in the Golden League.
	   After Monaco, the Golden League series continues in Zurich with
the Weltklasse meet on August 12.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Elected on promises to battle corruption
and end a 34-year-old leftist insurgency, Colombia's new president
was sworn in on Friday.
	   Colombians hope Pastrana, a 44-year-old former television
journalist, can restore authority to an office whose clout has been
eroded under the scandal-plagued administration of outgoing
President Ernesto Samper.
	   Congress cleared Samper in 1996 of charges he knowingly accepted
dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from cocaine lords in
defeating Pastrana four years ago. But central authority suffered,
the economy declined and rebels grew stronger.
	   The inauguration of the Conservative Party leader, son of the
late former president Misael Pastrana and a former Bogota mayor,
was held in the capital's central plaza and attended by eight heads
of state and other dignitaries.
	   A devastating rebel offensive this week highlights Pastrana's
greatest challenge: making peace with an insurgency that earns
millions of dollars a month by taxing drug dealers in the vast
rural areas it controls.
	   By their count, guerrillas this week killed at least 143
soldiers and police and captured 133. The rebel force that wiped
out an anti-narcotics base in the southern town of Miraflores had
at least the tacit support of local civilians who live off the
cocaine trade, the army says.
	   Pastrana has worked hard to find common ground with the rebels,
putting himself at considerable risk by meeting without bodyguards
in the jungle with Manuel Marulanda, head of the largest rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he favors trying to get the estimated half a million Colombians
dependent on coca-growing to switch to other crops. That could
bring him into a head-on collision with Washington drug warriors
pushing for increased aid to Colombia's military as part of a more
hard-line approach.
	   ``Eradication is the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics
thinking...that can't be taken off the table,'' White House drug
expert Barry McCaffrey said Friday in Bogota before attending the
inauguration.
	   But too much U.S. pressure could cripple Pastrana, one analyst
believes.
	   ``The United States needs to really defer to this new government
that shows a lot of promise and is capable of understanding the
situation,'' said Michael Shifter, senior fellow at Inter-American
Dialogue, a Washington think-tank.
	   ``If the drug strategy continues to focus on eradication as the
main element, that could be at odds with a peace strategy in the
sense that it will play into the guerrillas' hands,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan's Friday attendance of Youth Forum; Meeting
on Algeria now expected Saturday sted Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
optimistic Friday that his special envoy to Angola could rescue the
country's fragile peace process.
	   ``The talks have gone well,'' Annan said referring to the
meetings held earlier this week by his special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas
Savimbi, leader the former rebel group UNITA.
	   Annan was speaking after arriving at Porto airport, 300
kilometers (190 miles) north of Lisbon, to kick off a five-day
visit to Portugal, where he is to attend a U.N-sponsored
international conference on youth policy.
	   He is also to meet officials close to peace efforts in Algeria
and the former Portuguese colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau and
East Timor.
	   The United Nations sent Brahimi to Angola last Friday on an
emergency mission triggered by fears of an imminent return to civil
war, four years after a U.N.-brokered deal sealed a tenuous peace.
	   Annan said the Security Council would be discussing Brahimi's
report on his Angolan mission on Monday. He said he hoped the
council would extend the mandate of the U.N. mission monitoring the
peace process, which is due to run out Aug. 15.
	   Annan's arrival in Portugal had been postponed for 24 hours due
to Thursday's emergency Security Council meeting in New York to
discuss Iraq's new restrictions on U.N. weapons inspectors. Annan
did not comment on Iraq.
	   Annan's first engagement in Portugal on Friday took him to the
closing ceremony of a U.N.-organized World Youth Forum in the
northern city of Braga. ``The voice of the young will be heard,''
he promised.
	   The Forum's recommendations to a ministerial conference on youth
policy beginning Saturday in Lisbon are expected to include
creation of a special rapporteur for youth at the U.N. and a
commitment from all states to elaborate a national youth strategy.
	   Annan's Saturday agenda included a meeting with former
Portuguese president Mario Soares to discuss the findings of the
recent high-level mission to Algeria investigating the roots of the
political violence rocking that country.
	   The mission has yet to release its findings.
	   Annan is also expected to meet President Jorge Sampaio, Premier
Antonio Guterres, Foreign Minister Jaime Gama and, on Sunday, visit
to the Expo' 98 World Fair on United Nations Day.
	   He was due to leave Portugal on Tuesday for a vacation in his
native Ghana.

Fraser (5-42) bowls England back into the test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Angus Fraser's inspired spell of pace
bowling on Friday gave England every chance of winning the fifth
and final cricket test against South Africa at Headingley.
	   Fraser, who took 10 wickets in England's eight-wicket win over
South Africa in the fourth test, grabbed three wickets in 11 balls
as South Africa crashed from 237 for six to be all out 252 on day
two of the five day match.
	   England, trailing by 22 runs, batted out the one remaining over
of the day and goes into the third day at one without loss. Mike
Atherton is on one and Mark Butcher is yet to score.
	   Fraser took 5-42 Friday _ his third five-wicket haul in as many
innings _ and was well supported by local hero Darren Gough (3-58)
and Dominic Cork (2-72).
	   Umpiring decisions have added further controversy to the series,
which is deadlocked at 1-1, as 20 wickets fell in two days at
Headingley.
	   The International Cricket Council's independent umpire,
Pakistan's Javed Akhtar, gave two contentions decisions Friday _
ruling both Gary Kirsten and Allan Donald out to leg before wicket
appeals.
	   Hansie Cronje was also given out for 57 by Akhtar, ending a
fledging stand with Shaun Pollock (31) after South Africa had been
reduced to 184 for six.
	   Cronje anchored the innings for four hours, giving his side
hopes of a big reply after England had been bowled out for 230 on
the first day.
	   Cronje scored his fifth consecutive half century, following up
his innings of 81 at Lord's, unbeaten 69 at Old Trafford and 126
and 67 at Trent Bridge.
	   He shared significant partnerships with Jonty Rhodes (32) and
Pollock on a difficult pitch where the ball at times had kept
dangerously low.
	   It was a remarkable comeback by England after it had dropped
four catches _ grassing chances from both Cronje and Rhodes _
before and after tea.
	   The marginal 22-run lead could be a decisive factor for South
Africa as the visitors aim for their first series win on English
soil since its return to international cricket in 1992.
	   England's seam attack gave nothing away and has proved to be far
more effective compared with South Africa's attack.
	   Rhodes broke the afternoon shackles scoring at almost a
run-a-ball in his 39-ball innings after Mark Ramprakash had taken a
brilliant catch to dismiss Jacques Kallis.
	   Kallis (40) pulled a Cork delivery and Ramprakash flung himself
to his right at midwicket to take the catch of the series.
	   But the subsequent dropped catches dampened England's spirit.
	   Nasser Hussain grassed a regulation slip catch offered by Cronje
on 20. Then Rhodes was dropped twice in three balls _ on 19 and 20
_ Ramprakash a head-high catch and Graeme Hick a `sitter' at second
slip.
	   Rhodes, living dangerously in his 38 minute innings, finally
drove at Gough and edged a catch to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart.
	   After resuming on nine without loss, South Africa lost both
openers _ Gary Kirsten and Gehardus Liebenberg _ in the first hour
of play.
	   Struggling on 36 for two, Kallis and Daryll Cullinan (27) put on
47 runs for the third wicket before Gough, struck 17 minutes before
lunch.
	   Cullinan, going for an expensive drive, edged a catch to
Stewart.

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serbs overruning Likovac; KLA driven from
most strongholds in central Drenica region; CHANGES byline, no
pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran the former
Albanian rebel headquarters in central Kosovo on Friday and
appeared to have driven the secessionists from most of their
remaining strongholds in the strategic region.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said that the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   Later Friday, Serb forces entered the village of Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met last week with commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Under sniper fire, Serb troops moved from house-to-house,
clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the village and
setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into Albania, where the rebels maintain
sanctuaries.
	   In the provincial capital Pristina, Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova acused Serbs of molesting ``hundreds'' of Albanians
in their prisons that have become ``mass camps.''
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters.
	   Rugova's aides said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who expressed support for his ``peaceful
policy'' in resolving the crisis. The statement made no mention of
any promise of U.S. military intervention.
	   Rugova declared Friday a day of mourning for hundreds killed by
the fighting in the current Serbian offensive. About 2,500 Albanian
women held a brief candlelight vigil in Pristina in solidarity with
those affected by the fighting.
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates roughly 200,000 people have
fled to Kosovo's woods and hills, and many of them lack food, water
and other essentials. Officials worry that searing summer
temperatures and a lack of hygiene could cause disease to set in.
	   In Washington, the Pentagon announced that hundreds of U.S.
Marines are to participate in NATO military exercises in
neighboring Albania and Macedonia in the coming months, starting
with a one-week maneuver that begins in Albania on Aug.17.
	   A NATO spokesman at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
Friday in Brussels said plans for possible military intervention in
Kosovo were nearly complete.
	   In Paris, Anne Gazeau-Secret, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said that if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't heed
calls to start a political dialogue and stop military action, he
faces ``all the consequences, and I make a point of saying all.''
	   France and Germany are planning a joint mission to Belgrade Aug.
12 to assess the situation.
	   But with the KLA clearly on the run, it appeared likely that
fighting could die simply because the Serbs have gained the upper
hand.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.

Doubts about Kohl's successor cause uncertainty in Bonn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Schaeuble comments, deletes outdated
material &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strategy to win over
conservative voters who feel it's time for new blood has been to
designate an heir who might be able to step in midway through a
fifth term.
	   But that strategy showed signs of fraying Friday.
	   The wife of Kohl's heir-apparent, Wolfgang Schaeuble, hinted
that her husband might not want the job, leaving an opening for
Kohl's challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, to say Schaeuble's not the
conservative he'd most like to work with if elected anyway.
	   Schaeuble spoke up later Friday to say it's premature to discuss
whether he would be Kohl's successor, but that he thinks he's up to
the job.
	   ``Until the question comes up, I don't think I have to answer
it,'' Schaeuble said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine.
	   Germany's two main parties, staunch political rivals, could be
forced to work together if neither is able to form a coalition with
one or more smaller party after the Sept. 27 election.
	   Kohl, who has led Germany for 16 years, has made clear he'd have
no part of such a ``grand coalition,'' though, making way for a
successor.
	   As early as last fall, Kohl said he wanted Schaeuble, his
parliamentary leader and No. 2 man in Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, to succeed him someday.
	   But Schaeuble's wife, Ingeborg, told Stern magazine this week
she had ``very great reservations'' about her husband ever becoming
chancellor.
	   ``I think it's an office that takes a huge amount of energy and
would leave him even less elbowroom,'' she said. ``And aside from
that, I don't think it would be easy to sell the public on a
picture of a chancellor in a wheelchair.''
	   Schaeuble has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was
shot by a crazed assailant during a campaign appearance in 1990.
	   Schaeuble dismissed concerns over his disability in the Spiegel
interview, saying he could perform the job of chancellor in a
wheelchair.
	   If Schaeuble stepped aside as Kohl's political successor, the
ambitious defense minister, Volker Ruehe, would probably become the
favorite.
	   Meanwhile, Schroeder, the Social Democratic challenger, told Die
Zeit weekly newspaper he'd rather work with Ruehe anyway if it came
to a grand coalition.
	   Schroeder said he found Schaeuble ``very conservative,'' while
Ruehe was ``maybe more open for the opposing side to begin with.''
	   With the smaller parties hovering around the 5 percent minimum
needed to make it into parliament at all, some political analysts
believe such a coalition is increasingly likely.
	   In an interview Friday with RTL television, Schroeder seemed to
strengthen that view, saying he'd turn quickly to Kohl's Christian
Democrats if coalition talks with the ecology-minded Greens fail.
	   Schroeder said three conditions would be decisive for him to
form a coalition with the Greens: a guarantee of economic
stability, no discussion about basic law and order issues and
continuity in foreign policy.

Anglican conference closing after debates over Bible
</HEADLINE>
interpretation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ In three weeks of debate ranging over
issues including homosexuality, Third World debt and euthanasia,
bishops of the worldwide Anglican Communion often returned to a
fundamental point: How should they interpret the Bible?
	   ``The wider our family becomes, the more you want to have
something in common,'' the Rt. Rev. Alexis Bilindabagabo, bishop of
Gahini, Rwanda, said during a debate in the conference's closing
week.
	   He complained, however, that some churches, particularly in the
industrial world, did not share his understanding of Scripture.
	   ``When you talk about sin in certain places, it has ceased to
exist,'' he said. ``When you talk about repentance in certain
places, it has ceased to exist.''
	   The interpretation of Scripture was at the center of the debate
over whether to ordain practicing homosexuals and bless same-sex
unions.
	   Conservative bishops, pointing to plain condemnations of
homosexuality in the Bible, easily won the vote Wednesday to
denounce homesexuality as a sin.
	   The Rt. Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the Bishop of Johannesburg, South
Africa, chaired the group that struggled with the homosexuality
resolution, but was sanguine about the intense debate.
	   ``One of the nice things about being an Anglican,'' he said,
``is that you can both doubt and disagree.''
	   Most churches experience disagreements about interpreting the
Bible, and such disputes are perhaps inevitable in an Anglican
Communion that extends around the world and embraces disparate
cultures and languages.
	   Although rooted in the faith of the Church of England, the
Anglican Communion is now mainly an African church: 17.5 million
members in Nigeria and 8 million in Uganda dwarf the Church of
England's 2 million active members _ roughly the size of Anglican
churches in Kenya, South Africa and South India.
	   A common understanding of Scripture eluded the more than 700
bishops, but before Saturday's end of the Lambeth Conference _ held
every 10 years _ they took some small steps to promote cohesion
among fiercely independent national churches.
	   Bishops voted to extend the powers of the primates of the
national churches, who meet every two years. They would be
permitted to intervene in exceptional cases and give guidelines
``on the limits of Anglican diversity.''
	   The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, serves as president
of the primates conference, but has no special powers comparable to
a Roman Catholic pope.
	   Anglican churches still have no common policy on ordaining women
priests, the big issue at Lambeth 10 years ago. But they all seem
to be learning to live with it, and the presence of 11 women
bishops from the United States, Canada and New Zeland provoked no
large protest.
	   The bishops did rebuke the Episcopal Church in the United
States, however, for setting a deadline for four reluctant bishops
to accept women priests in their dioceses, and said no bishops
should be forced to act against their consciences.
	   On Friday, the bishops adopted a resolution opposing euthansia
but allowing one exception: that it might be permissible to
withdraw nourishment from someone in a permanent vegetative state.
	   The big issue this time, especially for the African bishops, was
Third World debt. The conference adopted a resolution calling for
debt payments to be sharply reduced so that payments are not made
``at great cost to human lives.''
	   Bishops also had an opportunity to personally lobby British
Prime Minister Tony Blair at a reception at Lambeth Palace, Carey's
official resience in London, and there was talk about organizing
protests to put the issue on the agenda on the Group of Eight
summit in Germany next year.
	   At a news conference Friday, Carey said debt would be a
continuing concern. ``It is a challenge not only to politicians and
economists, but to the churches as well,'' he said.
	   ``We are all affected by the problems which come with abject
poverty, international debt, persecution, with secularization and
technological change,'' Carey said.
	   The church doesn't have all the answers, he added, ``but we are
inviting others to hear us, and to join us in our continued
thinking.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran the former
Albanian rebel headquarters in central Kosovo on Friday and
appeared to have driven the secessionists from most of their
remaining strongholds in the strategic region.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which uprooted nearly 200,000 people
and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   Later Friday, Serb forces entered the village of Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met last week with commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Under sniper fire, Serb troops moved from house-to-house,
clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the village and
setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into neighboring Albania, where the
rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, state television reported 71
Kosovo Albanian refugees had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours.
	   Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova accused Serbs of molesting
``hundreds'' of Albanians in their prisons that have become ``mass
camps.''
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters in the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   Rugova's aides said he spoke Friday with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who expressed support for his ``peaceful
policy.'' The statement made no mention of any promise of U.S.
military intervention.
	   Rugova declared Friday a day of mourning for hundreds killed by
the fighting in the current Serbian offensive. About 2,500 Albanian
women held a brief candlelight vigil in Pristina in solidarity with
those affected by the fighting.
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates roughly 200,000 people have
fled to Kosovo's woods and hills, and many of them lack food, water
and other essentials. Officials worry that searing summer
temperatures and a lack of hygiene could cause disease to set in.
	   In Washington, the Pentagon announced that hundreds of U.S.
Marines are to participate in NATO military exercises in Albania
and neighboring Macedonia in the coming months, starting with a
one-week maneuver that begins in Albania on Aug.17.
	   A NATO spokesman at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
Friday in Brussels said plans for possible military intervention in
Kosovo were nearly complete.
	   In Paris, Anne Gazeau-Secret, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said that if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't heed
calls to start a political dialogue and stop military action, he
faces ``all the consequences, and I make a point of saying all.''
	   France and Germany are planning a joint mission Wednesday to
Belgrade to assess the situation.
	   But with the KLA clearly on the run, it appeared likely that
fighting could die simply because the Serbs have gained the upper
hand.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.

Suspended shot putter files appeal with U.S. federation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Shot putter Randy Barnes, suspended for a
second time after testing positive for a banned substance, filed an
appeal Friday with USA Track and Field, the American athletics
federation, for a hearing.
	   The 1996 Olympic gold medalist and world indoor and outdoor
record-holder is trying to avoid a lifetime ban. Barnes was first
suspended for two years in 1991 by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation for the steroid methyltestosterone.
	   He tested positive again April 1 in an out-of-competition test
at Charleston, West Virginia, for the nutritional substance
androstenedione, which increases the body's ability to produce its
own testosterone naturally.
	   To escape a permanent ban, Barnes first must win a hearing
before USATF's three-member Doping Hearing Board.
	   ``They won't talk to me about a hearing date until they select a
panel, which will be at least a week,'' lawyer Bob Duplantis, who
with his son Greg represents Barnes, said after filing the request
for the hearing.
	   If the doping board finds Barnes guilty, he would be suspended
for life. If the panel decides he is not guilty, he would be free
to compete again.
	   Should the board vote against Barnes, he can go before USATF's
Doping Appeals Board, a different three-member group. The appeals
board cannot hear new evidence; it can only determine whether
proper procedures were followed.
	   If discrepancies are found, the appeals board can dismiss the
case. It then returns to the IAAF, which can agree with the board
or say Barnes is banned. If the IAAF bans Barnes, he can go to
binding arbitration.

Shift by Canadian logging company elates anti-logging protesters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Graphic  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANAIMO, British Columbia (AP) _ The environmental activists are
back five years after hundreds were jailed in a crusade to block
logging of pristine forests. But this time, they are celebrating.
	   Veterans of the 1993 Clayoquot Sound protest _ Canada's biggest
act of civil disobedience _ are holding a reunion this weekend that
coincides with dramatic changes in British Columbia's forest
industry.
	   MacMillan Bloedel, the logging company targeted during the 1993
protest, announced in June that it would phase out all
clear-cutting in British Columbia in the next five years.
	   For environmentalists, it was a stunning victory. Greenpeace
activists drank champagne toasts to MacMillan Bloedel's chief
executive, Tom Stephens, an American hired last year to reverse a
sharp drop in profits.
	   ``There's no doubt this marks a big shift in forestry in British
Columbia,'' said Valerie Langer, a key organizer of the 1993
protests and the weekend reunion. ``This is MacMillan Bloedel
breaking from what we call the clear-cutting cartel. It woke up to
the fact that the markets were demanding something different.''
	   Among those attending the reunion is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the
Kennedy clan's foremost environmental activist and a lawyer for the
U.S.-based Natural Resources Defense Council. He made repeated
visits to the 1993 Clayoquot protest, where more than 800 people
were arrested.
	   ``It's really a profound victory,'' he said. ``We can look back
and say `What did we accomplish?' and pat ourselves on the back. We
really did something historic.''
	   Before the protests, he said, logging policy was set by a few
corporate executives.
	   ``We helped democratize the process,'' Kennedy said. ``Now
you've got everybody involved _ environmentalists, Indians,
workers, companies. Everybody's talking about the sustainable use
of this land.''
	   There also has been a change of attitude at MacMillan Bloedel,
said Glen Dunsworth, a biodiversity expert at the company's office
in Nanaimo.
	   ``You tend to demonize your adversaries,'' he said. ``But in
fact, there's a lot of common ground between us.''
	   MacMillan Bloedel's five-year plan calls for varying the number
of trees cut down on different types of logging sites.
	   In the mountainous woodlands around Nanaimo, some
recently-logged tracts had just a few trees left. The effect was
barely more attractive than traditional clear-cutting, which
Kennedy once likened to carpet-bombing.
	   But on other tracts, where loggers had left just 10 or 15
percent of the trees, the land looked vibrant and inviting.
	   Esthetics is one of several priorities under the new program,
which also considers economics, wildlife preservation and
post-logging reforestation. Longstanding beliefs that clear-cutting
is safer than selective cutting also have placed importance on
worker safety.
	   Tom Holmes, general manager of MacMillan Bloedel woodlands
around Nanaimo, said the biggest challenge will come in rugged
areas of old-growth forest, where the company has pledged to leave
at least two-thirds of the trees.
	   The company also plans to double its use of heli-logging,
eliminating the need for cutting roads into the site. Crews on foot
cut down trees, then helicopters lift away loads of up to 28,000
pounds (12,700 kilos).
	   Only in rugged old-growth areas does MacMillan Bloedel
anticipate higher costs under the new plan. Even then, the company
expects to profit because many of its overseas customers are
insisting on wood logged in an eco-friendly fashion.
	   MacMillan Bloedel hopes the shift will give it an edge over
rival companies, and environmentalists hope the company's rivals
will emulate the plan.
	   Most companies may be willing to allow an independent review of
their logging practices so that timber exports can be certified as
ecologically responsible.
	   Holmes said he initially felt the company's shift was a
misguided capitulation to the environmentalists.
	   ``I thought it was a foolish exercise at first,'' he said. ``But
I can show you now, from the business side, it's the right thing to
do.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Survivors wandered in a daze amid burning
cars and the twisted steel and concrete of a collapsed building
Friday after a deadly terrorist bombing outside the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi.
	   ``People were running everywhere,'' said Paul Muhoho, a
journalist who had just left a news conference in one of the
stricken buildings in Nairobi.
	   A car bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania produced similar
scenes. At least 67 people were killed and 1,100 injured in the two
mid-morning attacks, which occurred within minutes of each other.
	   The Nairobi explosion toppled the four-story Ufundi Cooperative
Building, which fell over onto part of the embassy. Hundreds of
rescue workers and residents scrambled through the wreckage,
listening for the crying of trapped victims.
	   There were cheers when a survivor was found and loud mourning
when rescuers uncovered a dead body.
	   Other survivors made their own way out of the damaged buildings
and into the chaos. The streets were littered with paper, shoes and
clothing, along with the glass of shattered windows. The blast
could be heard four miles (six kilometers) away and blew out
windows up to 10 blocks away.
	   A passing public bus and a minibus caught fire and a Kenya Red
Cross worker said at least eight passengers died in the inferno.
Cars parked near the damaged buildings also caught fire.
	   Police helicopters flew overhead, as shouting rescue workers did
what they could in the confusion immediately after the blast.
Thousands of spectators often blocked ambulances.
	   Later in the day, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi toured the
bombed area and assured Kenyans and foreigners of his government's
determination to find the bombers. One man was taken into custody,
but police did not comment on the arrest.
	   As dusk fell, relief workers _ some with shovels, others with
bare hands, and assisted by two cranes _ continued their gruesome
task.
	   Smoke also poured from damaged buildings and cars in Dar es
Salaam, where a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of the U.S.
Embassy in the exclusive Oyster Bay suburb.
	   ``The Fire Brigade arrived a half hour after the explosion. Some
people (from the embassy) were screaming. Some cried and most hid
behind the building in shock,'' said Abdalla Riyami, a Tanzanian
journalist.
	   Officials said seven people were killed and at least 72 injured
in that blast.

Glitch at Spain's Prado museum left some works covered in dirt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Choking clouds of sand and dirt filled two
rooms at Madrid's prize art museum, El Prado, when debris from
renovation work got into the air conditioning system, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   The glitch occurred twice, back in May, but only recently came
to light, El Pais said. The museum confirmed the mishap but
downplayed it, insisting no art work was damaged.
	   On May 8, visitors in a small anteroom next to a hall housing
works by El Greco heard a rumbling noise and then saw clouds of
dust spew from air conditioning ducts for half an hour.
	   ``There was so much dust you couldn't see 2 meters in front of
you,'' El Pais quoted one witness, historian Teresa de Angulo, as
saying.
	   Museum staff came out with feather dusters and cleaned off two
Dutch Baroque paintings covered with dirt, she said. ``Then
everything went back to normal, as if nothing had happened.''
	   But it all happened again the next day, this time in a room with
works by Bartolome Esteban Murillo, El Pais said.
	   The acting director of the museum, Andres Ubeda, called both
incidents ``minor.''
	   However El Pais quoted unidentified art experts as saying it may
take up to two years to determine if the dust caused lasting damage
to any paintings.
	   The paper said this was not the first time concern has been
raised over whether museum officials have jeopardized priceless art
works in pushing on with a vast renovation and expansion project
without closing the museum.
	   The paper quoted employees as saying that when construction
crews used jackhammers, the noise and vibrations were unbearable.
	   ``One day even the ground shook,'' one employee said. ``And the
walls, well, I prefer not to even think about them.''

Zabaleta stages unlikely rally to upset Dosedel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Argentinian Mariano Zabaleta
survived six match points Friday and rallied from a 5-1 deficit in
the third set to upset Czech Slava Dosedel 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6
(7-5) in the Grolsch Open quarterfinals.
	   Zabaleta faces a Saturday semifinal against 42nd-ranked Swede
Magnus Norman, also unseeded, who earlier in the afternoon easily
disposed of Spaniard Galo Blanco in straight sets 6-2, 6-4.
	   Dosedel, the defending champion and seeded eightt at this dlrs
500,000 ATP tour clay court event, looked to be cruising in the
first set.
	   But the first four games of the second set all produced service
breaks as both players drifted into unforced errors.
	   The set settled down with both players holding serve the rest of
the way, but at 5-5 in the tiebreaker, Zabaleta produced a stunning
backhand pass and converted the set point it gave him.
	   Dosedel then charged to 5-1 in the third set but missed two
match points before dropping his own service.
	   The 20-year-old Zabaleta then saved four more match points on
his own service in the next game, put together a five-game winning
streak and found himself leading 6-5.
	   Dosedel had enough fight left to break serve and force another
tiebreaker, but again at 5-5 a fortunate net cord gave the
Argentinian his first match point and he converted.
	   Norman began aggressively, hitting the ball hard and low and
broke the 102nd-ranked Blanco's service at love in the first game
to set the pattern of the match.
	   Blanco put up tougher resistance in the second set but Norman
broke decisively in the seventh game.
	   Saturday's other semifinal pits top-seeded Slovakian Karol
Kucera, 14 in the rankings, against the No.6 seed 37th-ranked
Australian Richard Fromberg.

Horton, Gale share lead at halfway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Former Ryder Cup player Tommy
Horton birdied four of the last five holes Friday for a 4-under 68
and a share of the halfway lead in the 375,000-pound (dlrs 619,000)
Senior British Open.
	   Never a winner of the title despite 19 victories on the European
Senior Tour, Horton went to 4-under for the championship with a
two-round 140. He was tied for the lead with Australia's Terry Gale
who has carded back-to-back 70s at the Royal Portrush course.
	   ``It was a dream day,'' Horton said. ``I holed four or five long
putts and that is a real bonus here.
	   ``This is the one I want. I would dearly love to make this my
20th win. An Open championship like this is something that isn't on
my CV.''
	   Horton and Gale are one stroke ahead of Welshman Brian Huggett,
whose 70 gave him a halfway score of 141.
	   Brian Barnes was well placed on the leaderboard until a
double-bogey seven on the 17th, where he found a bunker with his
second shot and left his recovery in the sand.
	   The Scot is still one of only five players under par having shot
a 73 to be one under for the championship and three shots adrift on
143.
	   Defending champion Gary Player, who was two strokes off the lead
after an opening round 70, slipped to five behind after a 3-over
75.

FIFA refuses to extend deadline for Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA on Friday refused to extend a
midnight deadline for the Polish Football Association to resolve
its dispute with its government.
	   FIFA and UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, are demanding that
Poland's sports minister, Jacek Debski, reinstate Polish federation
administrators he suspended in May after they refused to submit to
an investigation into accusation of mismanagement.
	   In a fax to the Polish federation President Marian Dziurowicz,
FIFA insisted that if the suspensions imposed on the Polish F.A.
committee members was not lifted by midnight Friday, the national
association will be suspended indefinitely.
	   Such a suspension would mean that Polish clubs and national
teams could not take part in any international competitions.
	   Poland is scheduled to play Bulgaria on Sept. 6 in the opener of
2000 European Championship qualifying for both teams.
	   Poland's sports minister argues that FIFA cannot expect Poland
to cease applying its own laws in order to follow FIFA regulations,
while the international federations argue that national soccer
unions should remain independent from the government.
	   Debski added that administrators would be immediately reinstated
if a government investigation of federation files concludes all is
in order.
	   In a statement, FIFA said it hoped that the disagreement would
be satisfactorily resolved in time to avoid a suspension.

No surprises: Yugoslavia, US, Russia into semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslavia win. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia and the United States both
averted upsets Friday to scrape into the World Basketball
Championship semifinals, while another of the favorites, Russia,
also stayed in the medal hunt.
	   Yugoslavia trailed Argentina by as many as seven points in the
second half of their quarterfinal, but the reigning European
champions came back to win 70-62.
	   The U.S. collection of castoffs withstood a 32-point performance
by Carlton Myers and rallied to edge Italy 80-77 to set up a
semifinal meeting with Russia, which beat Lithuania 82-67 behind
Vassily Karassev's 31 points.
	   Russia still relies on the core of the team that lost to a U.S.
Dream Team in the gold medal game at the 1994 worlds.
	   Yugoslavia will play the winner of Friday's last quarterfinal
between Greece and Spain.
	   The Russian and U.S. victories were each seen by fewer than
4,000 spectators, but the 18,000-capacity Olympic arena was about
two-thirds full for the Yugoslavia-Argentina game.
	   Argentina held its first lead of the game at 38-36 with 16:52
remaining, when Marcelo Nicola (10 points) hit a jumper in the
lane. The South Americans then used a 9-0 string to go ahead 49-42,
but Yugoslavia came right back with a 9-0 run of its own, on the
strength of seven straight points from guard Aleksandar Djordjevic
(13 points).
	   Dejan Bodiroga led five Yugoslavs in double figures with 14
points and added 8 rebounds.
	   Juan Alberto Espil paced Argentina, which at 3-3 had the worst
round-robin record among the final eight teams, with 18 points, but
had just two after halftime.
	   Michael Hawkins led the United States with 16 points and Wendell
Alexis added 14, including two free throws with 25 seconds left
that put the Americans ahead 79-77.
	   Myers missed a 28-foot 3-point attempt with 7 seconds on the
clock, and Kiwane Garris (11 points) added a free throw at the
other end for the final margin.
	   Italy was held without a field goal for the final 7:22.
	   ``Eventually we wore them down and made the baskets that
counted,'' said Alexis, a star at Syracuse in the 1980s who now
plays in the German League. ``We would have loved to win the game
by 30 points, but now it's down to the medal round and every game
is going to be hard.''
	   The Dream Team probably would have beaten Italy by about 30
points, but USA Basketball dumped the NBA stars in mid-June after
the players threatened to boycott the worlds because of the
league's labor dispute.
	   In their place is a rag-tag mix of players drawn mainly from the
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``A true sign of character is when a team can be in a hole and
they don't fall apart and splinter. We feel fortunate to be where
we are,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   Myers repeatedly found seams in the American defense for slashes
to the basket, often resulting in trips to the line. He made all 15
of his free throws, but shot 7-for-18 (39 percent) from the field.
	   ``This game was tough to lose. We were there to the end,'' Myers
said.
	   Slovenian-born center Gregor Fucka added 11 points for Italy.
	   Hawkins and Garris scored several key baskets down the stretch
as the United States clawed back from a 73-66 deficit with 4:57
left.
	   They needed to step forward because Jimmy Oliver, the Purdue
product whose 14.0 scoring average led the United States in
preliminary-round play, had just two points, on a pair of free
throws with 2:45 remaining.
	   Karassev carried Russia, scoring 19 points in the second half.
Sergey Babkov added 10 points and 6 rebounds.
	   ``Today we had some bad moments on offense and somebody had to
take over,'' said Karassev, who made 9-of-14 shots from the field
and 12-of-14 free throws. ``Sometimes you're a hero when you do
that and sometimes you're not.''
	   Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of Arturas Karnisovas
and Saulius Stombergas wasn't a factor in the second half, when
they scored just eight of their combined 31 points.
	   In consolation games, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's 33 points led
Australia past Canada 88-71, while Brazil defeated Puerto Rico
76-64.

Campbell fights wind to take two-stroke lead at German Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ New Zealand's Michael Campbell took a
two-stroke lead Friday after the German Open's second round by
firing a 70 on a windy day.
	   Campbell strung together four birdies in five holes midway
through his round as he climbed to the top of the leaderboard at
the drls 1.15 million event with a 5-under 137.
	   Scotland's Scott Henderson, the European tour's
rookie-of-the-year last season, was at 139 along with Spain's
Ignacio Garrido.
	   Campbell, who shook off two early bogies including one in which
he missed two short putts, said he had learned from his experience
at leading the 1995 British Open.
	   The New Zealander led the major heading into the final day, then
faded to a joint third.
	   ``I learned a lot in that last round, more than you could pay
any psychologist,'' said Campbell, 29. ``Now I'm just trying to be
nice and calm and see what happens.''
	   France's Olivier Edmond, Japan's Katsuyoshi Tomori and England's
Paul Lawrie were three back at 140 as players again had trouble
solving the Nick Faldo-designed course.
	   Only 27 golfers were under par at the hilly course with the deep
bunkers at the Sporting Club Berlin, which was used for the first
time for the German Open.
	   ``This is probably the best coure I've played on,'' said
Campbell.
	   Henderson, fighting a flu, fired the day's best round with a
5-under 67. After playing par, he made a late charge by ringing up
five birdies in his last eight holes.
	   ``I can't believe the way I scored, considering the way I
feel,'' said Henderson. ``But I'm getting better. This score
helps.''
	   Garrido, who won the event last year when it was staged at
Stuttgart, settled for a 72 to go along with his first day 67 after
recovering from two early bogies.
	   ``This wind makes scoring tough,'' said Garrido. ``But I've got
no complaints about being 5-under-par at this point.''

Organizers hoping for trouble-free San Sebastian Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ With the cycling world still reeling
from the Tour de France doping debacle, organizers of the San
Sebastian Classic are hoping for a trouble-free event this weekend.
	   In the first world ranking race since the tour finished last
Sunday, 24 teams, including several affected by the French race's
doping scandal, are down for the 232-kilometer (144-mile) world cup
event in an around this northern coastal city.
	   The race will be the second appearance for Alex Zulle's Festina
team since it was ejected from the Tour de France at the beginning
of the doping scandal. On Tuesday it took part in the
Cross-Lausanne event.
	   Also taking part will be the four Spanish teams _ ONCE,
Vitalicio Seguros, Kelme, and Banesto _ that pulled out of the Tour
in protest over the manner in which cyclists and team officials
were being harassed in the doping probe.
	   Topping the entrants' list is the American Bobby Julrich of
Cofidis crew, who was No. 3 in France.
	   Italian rider Marco Pantani, who won the Tour de France, pulled
out of the San Sebastian race, deciding to take a vacation.
	   And Jan Ullrich of the Deutsche Telekom team, who finished
second in the Tour, was not on his team's list this time round.
Team officials declined to comment.
	   Organizers want to put the Tour de France behind them.
	   ``After what happened in France, we're working to ensure this is
a race free of all difficulties for those participating,'' said
Jose Luis Arieta of the organzing committee.
	   He said the the organizers planned no change from the customary
urine tests for doping checks and didn't think International
Cycling Union officials would press for any other tests ``given the
mess things are in.''
	   The race comes in the wake of the withdrawal of Spanish teams
from the women's Tour de France later this month and a decision by
organizers to study a change in the route for next month's Tour of
Spain to avoid entering France as a protest against the Tour.
	   Arieta said the San Sebastian Classic, the sixth of the 10 world
cup events, had not noticed any negative fallout from the French
tour so far.
	   ``Participation and expectations are as high as any year,'' he
said.
	   Heading the field will be Italian Michele Bartoli who tops the
world individual standings with 206 points followed by fellow
countryman Franco Ballerini, who has 132.
	   Last year's winner, Italy's Davide Rebellin, is also
participating.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Elected on promises to battle corruption
and end a 34-year-old leftist insurgency, Colombians prepared to
swear in their new president on Friday.
	   Colombians hope Pastrana, a 44-year-old former television
journalist, can restore authority to an office whose clout has been
eroded under the scandal-plagued administration of outgoing
President Ernesto Samper.
	   Congress cleared Samper in 1996 of charges he knowingly accepted
dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from cocaine lords in
defeating Pastrana four years ago. But central authority suffered,
the economy declined and rebels grew stronger.
	   The inauguration of the Conservative Party leader, son of the
late former president Misael Pastrana and a former Bogota mayor, is
to be held in the capital's central plaza. At least eight heads of
state and other dignitaries are expected to attend.
	   A devastating rebel offensive this week highlights Pastrana's
greatest challenge: making peace with an insurgency that earns
millions of dollars a month by taxing drug dealers in the vast
rural areas it controls.
	   By their count, guerrillas this week killed at least 143
soldiers and police and captured 133. The rebel force that wiped
out an anti-narcotics base in the southern town of Miraflores had
at least the tacit support of local civilians who live off the
cocaine trade, the army says.
	   Pastrana has worked hard to find common ground with the rebels,
putting himself at considerable risk by meeting without bodyguards
in the jungle with Manuel Marulanda, head of the largest rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he favors trying to get the estimated half a million Colombians
dependent on coca-growing to switch to other crops. That could
bring him into a head-on collision with Washington drug warriors
pushing for increased aid to Colombia's military as part of a more
hard-line approach.
	   ``Eradication is the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics
thinking...that can't be taken off the table,'' White House drug
expert Barry McCaffrey said Friday in Bogota before attending the
inauguration.
	   But too much U.S. pressure could cripple Pastrana, one analyst
believes.
	   ``The United States needs to really defer to this new government
that shows a lot of promise and is capable of understanding the
situation,'' said Michael Shifter, senior fellow at Inter-American
Dialogue, a Washington think-tank.
	   ``If the drug strategy continues to focus on eradication as the
main element, that could be at odds with a peace strategy in the
sense that it will play into the guerrillas' hands,'' he said.

Juventus star-forward sues Roma coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vialli comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero, angered by
reported suggestions by Roma's coach Zdenek Zeman that his muscular
growth may be drug-helped, on Friday instructed his agent to sue
for libel.
	   Agent Claudio Pasqualin, a lawyer, said Del Piero will seek
compensation for damages.
	   Zeman, the Czech coach of the Roman team, has caused a storm in
Italy's soccer world this week by alleging that a number of Serie A
players possibly use substances to stimulate muscle growth.
	   In interviews with some Italian daily newspapers and Rome weekly
magazine Espresso, Zeman also said he was amazed with the quick
muscular growth of some players such as Del Piero and Gianluca
Vialli.
	   Vialli, a former player of Juventus, is currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League.
	   ``I know that many doctors-pharmacologists have moved from
cycling to soccer. One must avoid that the (Italian) league turns
like the Tour of France,'' Zeman told Epresso.
	   The French cycling race, which ended Sunday, was plagued by a
doping scandal.
	   Zeman never mentioned doping substances openly. He always
referred to medicines.
	   ``Also some Roma players may have used pills. At home they can
do what they want, with the help of a friendly doctor. I'm not
talking of doping,'' Zeman was quoted as saying.
	   ``Zeman's remarks are very serious and hurt the entire soccer
world,'' Pasqualin said. ``Personal sacrifice is the base of Del
Piero's success in soccer.''
	   Vialli, in Sicily for an exhibition match of his English team,
was angered by Zeman's allegations and told the Italian television
network RAI ``the Federation should suspend him for at least one
year.''
	   ``He's a terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world,''
Vialli said.
	   Del Piero, Italy's No.1 star and one of the most popular
players, had some lackluster performances in the World Cup as his
preparation for France '98 was hampered by a thigh strain.
	   Meanwhile Professor Carlo Tranquilli, who heads the anti-doping
commission of the Italian soccer federation, told the ANSA news
agency that 2,500 random anti-doping tests were carried out in
Italy last season.
	   ``The Italian anti-doping system is one of the most advanced ...
for sure frequent tests decided by the federation have defeated the
use of anabolic steroids (which help muscular growth),'' the
professor said.

Campbell fights wind to take two-stroke lead at German Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Van Phillips name in 3rd graf to second place

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ New Zealand's Michael Campbell took a
two-stroke lead Friday after the German Open's second round by
firing a 70 on a windy day.
	   Campbell strung together four birdies in five holes midway
through his round as he climbed to the top of the leaderboard at
the drls 1.15 million event with a 5-under 137.
	   Scotland's Scott Henderson, the European tour's
rookie-of-the-year last season, was at 139 along with Spain's
Ignacio Garrido and England's Van Phillips.
	   Campbell, who shook off two early bogies including one in which
he missed two short putts, said he had learned from his experience
at leading the 1995 British Open.
	   The New Zealander led the major heading into the final day, then
faded to a joint third.
	   ``I learned a lot in that last round, more than you could pay
any psychologist,'' said Campbell, 29. ``Now I'm just trying to be
nice and calm and see what happens.''
	   France's Olivier Edmond, Japan's Katsuyoshi Tomori and England's
Paul Lawrie were three back at 140 as players again had trouble
solving the Nick Faldo-designed course.
	   Only 27 golfers were under par after the cut at the hilly course
with the deep bunkers at the Sporting Club Berlin, which was used
for the first time for the German Open.
	   ``This is probably the best coure I've played on,'' said
Campbell.
	   Henderson, fighting a flu, fired the day's best round with a
5-under 67. After playing par, he made a late charge by ringing up
five birdies in his last eight holes.
	   ``I can't believe the way I scored, considering the way I
feel,'' said Henderson. ``But I'm getting better. This score
helps.''
	   Garrido, who won the event last year when it was staged at
Stuttgart, settled for a 72 to go along with his first day 67 after
recovering from two early bogies.
	   ``This wind makes scoring tough,'' said Garrido. ``But I've got
no complaints about being 5-under-par at this point.''

King Hussein rebukes his government for Amman's polluted water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein lambasted his government
Friday, accusing it of negligence and warning he would punish those
responsible for the pollution of drinking water in this capital
city.
	   Writing from his hospital bed in the United States, Hussein told
his younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan, that he was waiting
``impatiently'' for the report of a five-member committee
investigating the pollution.
	   ``This is what we want to uncover and to take appropriate
measures ... to teach people in all fields to carry out their
duties and that there is repentance and punishment,'' Hussein said
in the letter which was read on national television.
	   The king said the government had repeatedly failed to take stern
measures against negligent public servants out of fear they would
sue the state, ``and this is an excuse which is worse than the
fault itself.''
	   For example, the government took lenient measures against three
air traffic controllers who left their posts at the Amman airport
tower to perform Muslim prayers in January and almost caused two
planes to collide, he said.
	   In another case, lack of maintenance resulted in a fire at a
solar energy plant in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba in May, he said.
It will cost dlrs 6 million to repair the plant.
	   The king ordered the probe into the pollution on Wednesday after
residents complained that, for the past three weeks, tap water had
an odor and contained worms and larvae.
	   The government had denied the allegations, but experts found the
water contained worms which could be harmful.
	   The king also summoned Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali to his
hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, he is being treated for cancer.
	   On his return to Jordan on Friday, Majali told reporters Hussein
had not asked to him to resign. But he said that ``even if the
prime minister is found responsible, he will be punished.''
	   Majali admitted the government could have been negligent.
	   In the letter, Hussein said his American doctors had given him
permission to leave the hospital for Washington for convalescence.
He said he would return to the hospital on Wednesday for another
round of chemotherapy.
	   He added his morale was high.

China evacuates 330,000 ahead of possible last-ditch measure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos YYG101-103,BEJ104 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Carrying what possessions they could, hundreds of
thousands of Chinese villagers on Friday turned their backs on
homes that will be sacrificed to the raging waters of the Yangtze
River if authorities resort to last-ditch anti-flood measures.
	   With the river at record levels and rising, officials were
preparing to open floodgates and, if that failed, blow up a dike to
divert water from one of the most threatened sections of the
3,900-mile (6270-kilometer) waterway.
	   Local authorities said late Friday they had not received the
order to inundate the Jingjiang flood plain, a 47-mile
(75-kilometer) area dotted by a half-dozen hamlets and a city of
500,000 people. The move would require the approval of China's
State Council, or Cabinet.
	   A fresh surge of water down the river on Friday raised fresh
fears among officials that sodden levees weakened by more than a
month of rain and floods would give way.
	   More than 2,000 people have died in summer floods that began in
June. The death toll continued to rise as new reports come in from
flooded areas.
	   By late Friday, some 250,000 of the 330,000 residents ordered to
vacate the Jingjiang plain had been evacuated to higher ground, the
official Xinhua news agency reported. Those who lost their homes in
the diversion would be compensated by the government, it said.
	   Local authorities declared an around-the-clock curfew over
Gong'an county, which would bear the brunt of a deliberate
flooding.
	   ``The worst moment of the year's flood control efforts is
probably coming,'' the official newspaper China Daily quoted
unidentified local officials as saying.
	   If the order was given, officials first would raise floodgates
to deflect water from the Yangtze's banks and reduce the torrent of
water rushing downstream.
	   If that proved insufficient, a nearly two-mile-long
(3.2-kilometer-long) dike that borders the river would be dynamited
to let the floodwaters through, said Chen Zhichao, director of the
Jingjiang Flood Diversion Management Bureau.
	   Embankments protecting Jiujiang city, down river in southeast
Jiangxi province, partly collapsed Friday, inundating parts of the
city to a depth of nearly seven feet, Xinhua said.
	   Emergency workers sunk three boats to try to plug the 132-foot
(40-meter-wide) gap and struggled to build a second emergency dike
for the city, a petrochemical and textile center on China's main
north-south railway line, it said.
	   Smaller, secondary dikes One method already being employed to
lower the Yangtze was breaking open or deliberately abandoning
smaller, secondary dikes, flooding farmland and taking pressure off
the major embankments that hem in the river.
	   Hubei, one of worst-hit provinces that declared a state of
emergency Thursday, has already destroyed at least 104 levees,
forcing 270,000 people to move and inundating swaths of farmland,
the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Friday.
	   Among the cities protected by these ``selfless'' acts was Wuhan,
the provincial capital with 7 million people, the newspaper said.
	   Hubei officials surrendered another six small levees around
Jingzhou city in Hubei on Thursday and Friday, forcing 100,000
people to evacuate, said a Jingzhou official, who gave his surname,
Li.
	   The last time the Yangtze was this high was in 1954, during
floods that forced officials to divert water three times. More than
30,000 people died in the flooding that year.

Lonely Ukrainian elephant gets German mate

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The years of loneliness are almost over for
Ukraine's most famous elephant, whose future bride arrived from
Germany on Friday.
	   Dirndl, a 30-year-old female from Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo,
sustained a wearying four-day trip to meet Boy, a 28-year-old,
7-ton male who has spent about 10 years alone in the Kiev Zoo.
	   ``It was a tiring journey, but she endured it very well,'' a
smiling Kiev Zoo director Oleksiy Lepeshkov said of Dirndl as she
was walked briskly around, studying her new territory.
	   The wait isn't quite over for Boy, who was unable to greet his
presumed love interest, having been locked up in his quarters.
	   For the time being, while Dirndl will be living in the same
building as Boy, the two will be kept apart. Lepeshkov said it was
premature to say when they could be allowed to meet.
	   He added that an isolated place had been prepared for Dirndl in
case the two don't like each other. Hellabrunn's head keeper,
Robert Mueller, who flew to Kiev a few days before Dirndl's
arrival, will help the elephant adapt to the new environment and
will instruct his Kiev colleagues how to care for her.
	   Dirndl's arrival was not entirely smooth. To get her out of her
traveling container, German keepers spent about 40 minutes dragging
the sedated elephant by her ears and by the chain fastened to her
leg.
	   Before that, Dirndl was banging heavily against the walls of the
container, which rocked in the air as a crane moved it from the
truck onto the enclosed territory for Kiev Zoo elephants.
	   But as soon as Dirndl found herself with her feet on the ground,
she did not seem to object to the new environment, and was seen
most of the time examining the locked entrance to Boy's quarters.
	   The Kiev Zoo started looking for a bride for Boy long ago, but
the 1991 Soviet collapse left it strapped for cash, hampering the
search.
	   Boy's last mate, Bama, died four years after giving birth to
their offspring, Key, who moved to Tbilisi Zoo in Georgia at the
age of 18 months.
	   Since then, the elephant, said to be the largest in European
zoos, has had to spend his time alone.
	   The Munich and Kiev zoos hope to share the offspring of Boy and
Dirndl, who is still in her prime mating age. ``I'm sure they will
have babies,'' Lepeshkov said.

Azerbaijan president ends censorship in advance of elections
</HEADLINE>

reax from opposition editors. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ With presidential elections planned for
October, authoritarian President Geidar Aliev issued a decree
Friday abolishing most forms of censorship in the former Soviet
republic.
	   Aliev, who also led Azerbaijan during Soviet times, disbanded
the Department for Protection of State Secrets in the Mass Media,
which handles most censorship work. It will be replaced with a body
that only checks for the publication of military secrets, the
decree said.
	   Aliev also called on his cabinet ministers to draft a program
that would protect the freedom of speech and information in
Azerbaijan, an oil-rich nation of 7 million on the Caspian Sea.
	   The official Turan news agency quoted the editors of several
opposition newspapers as hailing the decree, although noting that
it was ``belated.''
	   ``Censorship is a real obstacle on the way to progress,'' said
Hikmet Sabirogly, assistant editor of the Azadlig newspaper.
	   Up to now, even papers considered part of the political
opposition have rarely, if ever, criticized Aliev's government.
	   Human rights groups have frequently denounced Aliev's government
for alleged human rights abuses and harassment of the press.
Western governments, eager to see the development of Azerbaijan's
oil industry, have been restrained in their criticism, but have
also urged Aliev to make Azerbaijan more open and democratic.
	   Aliev, who returned to power in a 1993 coup, has been trying to
improve his democratic credentials in advance of the October
election.
	   A member of Aliev's administration, Ali Hasanov, told the Turan
news agency that the decree was drafted in preparation for upcoming
October elections. He said the move would help in the ``development
of Azerbaijan as a democratic state,'' the news agency reported.

Campbell fights wind to take two-stroke lead at German Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Campbell's total to 7-under 137 in graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ New Zealand's Michael Campbell took a
two-stroke lead Friday after the German Open's second round by
firing a 70 on a windy day.
	   Campbell strung together four birdies in five holes midway
through his round as he climbed to the top of the leaderboard at
the drls 1.15 million event with a 5-under 137.
	   Scotland's Scott Henderson, the European tour's
rookie-of-the-year last season, was at 139 along with Spain's
Ignacio Garrido and England's Van Phillips.
	   Campbell, who shook off two early bogies including one in which
he missed two short putts, said he had learned from his experience
at leading the 1995 British Open.
	   The New Zealander led the major heading into the final day, then
faded to a joint third.
	   ``I learned a lot in that last round, more than you could pay
any psychologist,'' said Campbell, 29. ``Now I'm just trying to be
nice and calm and see what happens.''
	   France's Olivier Edmond, Japan's Katsuyoshi Tomori and England's
Paul Lawrie were three back at 140 as players again had trouble
solving the Nick Faldo-designed course.
	   Only 27 golfers were under par after the cut at the hilly course
with the deep bunkers at the Sporting Club Berlin, which was used
for the first time for the German Open.
	   ``This is probably the best coure I've played on,'' said
Campbell.
	   Henderson, fighting a flu, fired the day's best round with a
5-under 67. After playing par, he made a late charge by ringing up
five birdies in his last eight holes.
	   ``I can't believe the way I scored, considering the way I
feel,'' said Henderson. ``But I'm getting better. This score
helps.''
	   Garrido, who won the event last year when it was staged at
Stuttgart, settled for a 72 to go along with his first day 67 after
recovering from two early bogies.
	   ``This wind makes scoring tough,'' said Garrido. ``But I've got
no complaints about being 5-under-par at this point.''

Fifth letter bomb found and disarmed in Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Police on Friday defused a letter bomb
allegedly mailed by suspected anarchists to a Communist city
councilman in Milan.
	   It was the fifth letter bomb in one week sent to Italians,
including local politicians, prosecutors and a journalist.
Investigators have suggested the bombs may be the beginning of a
terrorist campaign in Italy.
	   Friday's letter bomb, containing explosives hidden between two
books, was addressed to Umberto Gay, a city councilman from the
Communist Refoundation party.
	   A suspicious party member called police.
	   Police suspect that anarchists may be behind the letter bombs to
avenge the prison suicides of two comrades earlier this year.
	   All the bombs have been spotted and defused by police.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A leading former rebel accused the

envoy dispatched last week was ``a mediator capable of listening to
our deepest concerns.''
	   ``The Lusaka Protocol was corrupted from the beginning by the
U.N.,'' Paulo Lukamba Gato, Secretary-General of Angola's former
rebel movement UNITA said. He was referring to the U.N.-brokered
peace accord that ended Angola's civil war in 1994.
	   Gato was speaking by satellite phone from UNITA's southeast
highland headquarters.
	   ``The U.N. thought lasting peace could be achieved simply with
disarmament and demobilization'', he said, alluding to a clause in
the accord that committed UNITA to disband its 70,000-strong
guerrilla army in return for political guarantees.
	   About 500,000 people died in the two-decade-long civil war
between UNITA and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government
before the 1994 peace deal signed in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Four years on, a return to war appeared imminent with both sides
blaming each other for the crisis.
	   Tension was running so high in the vast southwest African
country that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent in top diplomat
Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Speaking to reporters Friday in Luanda, a week after his
arrival, Brahimi announced ``the climate of war has dissipated.''
	   Exactly what Brahimi had done to clear the air was not revealed.
But Gato said the envoy had listened attentively when he met with
UNITA's emblematic leader Jonas Savimbi and his inner circle at
their headquarters this week.
	   ``We told him that peace did not mean a silencing of the
cannons...It depends on actions and attitudes,'' Gato said.
	   But Gato's suggestion of improved relations with the U.N. will
soon face the acid test of what UNITA intends to do about its four
remaining rural strongholds, located in southeast Angola.
	   UNITA's reluctance to hand over control of the so-called
``sensitive areas'' _ Andulo, Bailundo, Nhaeria and Mungo _ in July
prompted the U.N. to tighten sanctions already imposed on the
former rebels.
	   At the same Luanda press conference where Brahimi announced a
``new dynamic'' for the Angolan peace process, UNITA revealed it
had proposed a new calendar for returning these areas. No further
details were given.
	   Meanwhile, from the group's highland base Gato warned that peace
was still by no means guaranteed. ``If you cannot accept what is
going on, you can always pick up sticks and stones and start
throwing them again,'' he said.

Syria attacks U.S. for slamming Iraq but not Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria criticized the United States on
Friday for strongly opposing Iraq while ``keeping silent'' on
Israel.
	   In a reference to the United States's condemnation of Iraq's
decision to freeze cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, the
official Damascus Radio said America ``keeps silent towards the
obstinate Israeli policy ... while it speaks out if the situation
is not related to Israel.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that unless Iraq
cooperates fully with the inspectors, the United States would
``stop any and all efforts to alter the sanctions regime.''
	   The inspectors are charged with supervising the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a process that must be
completed before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions
imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Damascus Radio said: ``Leaders in the international community,
along with the United States, keep silent ... when Washington is
supposed to lead the denunciation campaign against Israeli
government.''
	   Syria has long blamed the impasse in the peace process on
Israel. Israeli-Syrian peace talks were last held in February 1996.
Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, but Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu insists the plateau is essential to national
security.
	   The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are currently deadlocked
around a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from an additional
13.1 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
plan, but the Israelis have not.

	   Wolf Pup Spotted in the Wild
	    &UR; PHOENIX (AP) _ Biologists who spied a pair of Mexican gray
wolves wandering a remote Arizona national forest got a pleasant
surprise when they took a closer look.
	   ``They saw two wolves emerge from some trees with a puffball
following them,'' said Wendy Brown, a wolf recovery biologist for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
	   The puffball was a pup, apparently the first born to gray wolves
in the wild to survive for any real length of time in nearly 50
years.
	   ``The parents crossed a creek, but the pup stopped and whined,''
Brown said Friday. ``Then the parents coaxed it across.''
	   The pup, which was spotted Wednesday in the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forest, is believed to be nine weeks to 11 weeks old and
about 20 pounds (nine kilos).
	   The news came only two days after backers of the wolf
reintroduction effort said they had given up hope that any of the
pups born this spring had survived.
	   The last Mexican gray wolf seen in the wild was shot to death
near Alpine, Texas, in 1970. They had been all but gone from the
area since about 1950, many killed by ranchers who saw them as a
threat to livestock.
	   A U.S.-Mexican captive breeding program has brought their
numbers to about 175. Eleven adults were released in Arizona on
March 29.
	   The federal agency heralded the pup sighting as evidence that
its controversial reintroduction program is working.
	   The six month-old program has been rocked by several setbacks.
The first batch of offspring all died, and some of the adults have
bounced between the wild and captivity. Another was killed by a
camper.
	   ``Having a pup survive to this point in the first year of the
reintroduction effort is great news,'' said Nancy Kaufman,
Southwest regional director for the service.

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ With the cycling world still reeling
from the Tour de France doping debacle, organizers of the San
Sebastian Classic are hoping for a trouble-free event this weekend.
	   In the first world-class event since the tour finished Sunday,
24 teams, including several affected by the French race's doping
scandal, are scheduled to compete in the 232-kilometer (144-mile)
World Cup event in an around this northern coastal city.
	   The race will be the second appearance for Alex Zulle's Festina
team since it was ejected from the Tour de France at the beginning
of the doping scandal. On Tuesday, it participated in the
Cross-Lausanne event.
	   Also taking part will be the four Spanish teams _ ONCE,
Vitalicio Seguros, Kelme, and Banesto _ that pulled out of the Tour
in protest claiming cyclists and team officials were being harassed
in the doping probe.
	   Topping the entrants' list is American Bobby Julich of Cofidis,
who finished third overall in France.
	   Tour de France champ Marco Pantani of Italy wpulled out of the
San Sebastian race, deciding to take a vacation.
	   And Jan Ullrich of the Deutsche Telekom team, who finished
second in the Tour, was not on his team's list this time round.
Team officials declined to comment.
	   Organizers want to put the Tour de France behind them.
	   ``After what happened in France, we're working to ensure this is
a race free of all difficulties for those participating,'' Jose
Luis Arieta of the organzing committee said.
	   He said the the organizers planned no change from the customary
urine tests for doping checks and didn't think International
Cycling Union officials would press for any other tests ``given the
mess things are in.''
	   The race comes in the wake of the withdrawal of Spanish teams
from the women's Tour de France this month and a decision by
organizers to study a change in the route for next month's Vuelta
de Espana to avoid entering France as a protest against the Tour.
	   Arieta said the San Sebastian Classic, the sixth of the 10 World
Cup events, had not noticed any negative fallout from the French
tour so far.
	   ``Participation and expectations are as high as any year,'' he
said.
	   Besides Julich, heading the field will be Italian Michele
Bartoli, who leads the world standings with 206 points followed by
countryman Franco Ballerini, who has 132.
	   Defending champion Davide Rebellin of Italy also is
participating.

American tries to be first to circle world in a balloon

 &UR; AP Graphic ARG BALLOON of Aug. 2 &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) _ An American adventurer who wants to be
the first man to circle the Earth in a balloon began inflating his
craft Friday for a planned evening launch.
	   Steve Fossett, who has swum the English channel and sailed solo
across the Pacific, has waited weeks for good winds to attempt a
20,000-mile (32,200-kilometer) crossing of the Southern Hemisphere
in his balloon, Solo Spirit.
	   Circling the globe in a balloon is one of aviation's last
unachieved feats. Unbowed by three earlier failures, the
54-year-old Chicago stockbroker has charted a 14-18 day course that
would take him from west to east around the Southern Hemisphere,
mostly over dangerous oceans.
	   ``You have to believe that you are going to succeed with this
flight because a water landing would be very dangerous,'' Fossett
told The Associated Press earlier. ``I'm using the same capsule
I've used for seven balloon flights, and it's seaworthy.''
	   On Friday afternoon, workers spread out Solo Spirit's fabric on
a soccer field in Mendoza, 600 miles (965 kilometers) west of
Buenos Aires, and began inflating its hot air and helium chambers.
	   Fossett's charted course would take him across Argentina amd out
over the South Atlantic. If all goes to plan, he would then attempt
to fly below the tip of South Africa to Australia, then head east
across the Pacific back into South America.
	   A statement from his command center at Washington University in
St. Louis said weather was good for a late Friday launch, but
cautioned: ``As with all balloon flights, the launch date and time
are subject to change up to the point of launch.''
	   Solo Spirit, shaped like a giant silver light bulb, rises half a
football field high. The attached 4-foot-by-6 1/2-foot (1.2 by 2
meter) capsule has a bench to sleep on, communications gear, a
parachute, life raft and enough food to await sea rescue.
	   Teammates also have strapped 40 silver tanks of propane fuel to
the capsule and stowed aboard a laptop computer, telephone and
other gear.
	   Competition is intense to achieve RTW _ ballooning parlance for
``Round the World'' _ and most attempts have been made in the
Northern Hemisphere.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he set
the distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,600-kilometer) , six-day
journey from St. Louis to Sultanpar, India. He landed after running
short of fuel while awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   On Jan. 5, 1998, Fossett landed 5,802 (9,330 kilometers) miles
away from St. Louis, in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern
Russia.
	   Two balloonists from Kansas had planned to travel a southern
route in 1988, also starting in Mendoza. But bad weather kept them
on the ground. John Petrehn and Rowland Smith eventually aborted
their round-the-world plans after dlrs 100,000 worth of helium
leaked from a balloon while it was being inflated.
	   Conditions will be rugged aboard Solo Spirit.
	   Temperatures outside will plunge below freezing as the balloon
and its unpressurized capsule are carried along anywhere from a
crawl to more than 100 mph (160 kilometers), often at altitudes
above 20,000 feet (6096 meters) .
	   Equipped with an oxygen mask, Fossett will be lucky to sleep
four hours each night, awakened by alarms whenever Solo Spirit
loses altitude. He will be wearing a fleece-lined parka and thermal
boots.

Opposition balks at Mexican bank bailout proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Debate over a dlrs 65 billion bank bailout
plan has produced an unusual political battle between Mexico's
government and the opposition-led Congress.
	   A year after Mexico's long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party lost control of Congress, opposition members have flexed
their new political power by demanding a thorough government
accounting of the bailout.
	   The governing party, known as the PRI, has held the presidency
and dominated Congress for most of the last 69 years and did not
require the support of other parties. But now that the opposition
controls the lower house of Congress, the PRI can no longer act
unilaterally.
	   At issue is whether taxpayers should pay off the debt of about
dlrs 65 billion held by the bank savings protection fund known as
Fobaproa, the Mexican equivalent of the U.S. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. The government says the bailout is vital to the
banking system.
	   The opposition wants to know exactly how the debt was
accumulated. Some legislators want to exclude at least some of the
bad loans they say were either fraudulent or the product of insider
trading by wealthy businessmen.
	   After a six hour meeting with congressmen Thursday, aides to
President Ernesto Zedillo promised to release information about the
bailout fund, but refused to release the names of major debtors,
citing bank secrecy laws.
	   Opposition politicians say those laws do not apply.
	   ``It doesn't apply because Fobaproa is not a bank,'' said Mexico
City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
	   ``We will maintain our position that it is necessary for
Congress to have complete and total access to all available
information,'' said PRD Congressman Pablo Gomez.
	   The Fobaproa debt was generated after the December 1994 peso
devaluation. Interest rates surged, debtors couldn't pay off loans
and the banking system was near collapse. Without Congress'
approval, Fobaproa was allowed to issue government-backed notes to
assume the banks' bad debts.
	   The government now wants to consolidate the debt _ the
equivalent of 14 percent of the nation's entire annual economic
activity _ into the national debt.
	   The issue has become a top political battle ahead of the 2000
presidential election.
	   The PRI is eager to win the support of the center-right National
Action Party, which last December broke a deadlock on the budget by
voting with the government. But National Action, known as the PAN,
has been cautious about being seen as too closely allied with the
government.
	   Like the PRD, it demands to know who was responsible for the
debt.
	   ``There is a great possibility that there are criminals there or
individuals who may have engaged in different types of illegal
actions,'' said Francisco Jose Paoli, a PAN congressman.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fujimori accepting resignation in 2nd graf. EDITS
 &UR; Peru's prime minister resigns after clashes with government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra has
resigned, saying it would be ``madness'' for him to stay in power
given his differences with the government of President Alberto
Fujimori.
	   Valle Riestra, a former political opponent who Fujimori named to
the post two months ago, told reporters Friday that the president
had accepted his resignation and will announce his replacement in
the coming days.
	   He said he was resigning because of repeated clashes with hard
liners in Fujimori's government and the armed forces. Had had
announcement his resignation Thursday night.
	   ``I cannot live among these constant disputes. I am a democrat
and here there is a totalitarian spirit,'' he said.
	   Fujimori surprised even his own supporters when he named the
outspoken Valle Riestra, known for his defense of human rights, to
the post. Analysts say it was an attempt to improve his
government's authoritarian image.
	   Since coming to power, Valle Riestra had come under fire from
his own government after saying Fujimori should not run for a third
consecutive term in office and protesting human rights abuses.
	   Valle Riestra had also offered to resign on June 24 after
Fujimori rejected his suggestion that the government free Lori
Berenson, a New York-native serving a life sentence in a Peruvian
prison for treason.
	   Fujimori did not accept his resignation on that occasion.
	   The clash that caused this latest resignation threat was a
statement issued Wednesday by Peru's military courts that attacked
Valle Riestra for claiming jailed Shining Path leader Abimael
Guzman received special privileges.
	   ``There is a conspiracy against me. The president of Congress
attacks me, and the Supreme Court of Military Justice treats me
with disrespect and irreverence,'' he said.
	   In Peru's non-parliamentary system of government, the prime
minister is not elected and serves as chief of the president's
cabinet.

Serbs say Kosovo offensive over, Rugova demands intervention

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran the former
Albanian rebel headquarters in central Kosovo on Friday and
appeared to have driven the secessionists from most of their
remaining strongholds in the strategic region.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said that the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   Later Friday, Serb forces entered the village of Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met last week with commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Under sniper fire, Serb troops moved from house-to-house,
clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the village and
setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into Albania, where the rebels maintain
sanctuaries.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, state television reported that
71 Kosovo Albanian refugees had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours.
	   Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova accused Serbs of molesting
``hundreds'' of Albanians in their prisons that have become ``mass
camps.''
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' Rugova told reporters in the provincial capital
Pristina.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a growing Tutsi rebellion
that appears to be sweeping into Congo's dense jungle interior,
President Laurent Kabila left his troubled capital Friday in search
of support to keep his 14-month-old regime from unravelling.
	   But within hours of his departure, Kabila's troops rampaged
through parts of Kinshasa, looting shops and harrassing ethnic
Tutsis.
	   ``In the army the soldiers are very unhappy,'' said a senior
police commander with the city's intelligence branch. The officer,
who responded to calls to stop the looting, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Kinshasa was tense Friday with armed troops roaming through the
streets, questioning pedestrians and manning checkpoints at key
intersections.
	   Kabila's decision to leave Kinshasa comes just days after
renegade troops waged gun battles in two army barracks on the
city's west side.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations human rights agency condemned the
attacks on Tutsi neighborhoods and urged Kabila to provide better
security in the city.
	   ``I am aware that there have been reports of looting and burning
of shops targeting certain segments of the population in
Kinshasa,'' said United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson.
	   ``There are also indications that ethnically-motivated violence
is taking place in other parts of the country as the armed conflict
spreads.''
	   The apparent revenge attacks on Tutsis reflects a growing
instability in Kinshasa and elsewhere in Congo. The United States
and several European countries have told their citizens to avoid
travelling to Congo.
	   The disintegrating situation in Congo is a dramatic turn for
Kabila, who last year was hailed as a hero.
	   His presidency and government faltering, Kabila travelled to his
former rebel base of Lubumbashi where he hoped to recapture some of
that past glory and sorely needed backing.
	   There, the Congolese president met with South African diplomats,
according to South Africa's public SABC television, although Congo
officials would not allow foreign journalists to witness the
affair. South African officials declined to comment.
	   By Friday evening, Kabila arrived in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe
along with Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, who hours before
threatened his country will ``hit back'' if neighboring Congo
attacked its forces.
	   In all, seven regional heads of state were at the meeting called
to deal with the conflict in the former Zaire, now known as
Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   Kabila says neighboring Rwanda is behind the rebellion, which
mirrors Kabila's own guerrilla war that culminated 14 months ago
with the ouster of longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   The president's allies this time have turned against him and
many of his former foes _ Mobutu's armed forces _ appear to be
backing the one-time rebel leader.
	   In the eastern region of Kivu, Tutsi rebels and Rwandan soldiers
_ Kabila's erstwhile allies _ have been pushing into the interior
from the border with Rwanda.
	   On the other side of the country, rebels appear to be marching
inland toward Kinshasa from Kitona, a small village and military
camp near the Atlantic coast.
	   Rwanda on Friday denied involvement in the uprising, saying
Kabila's accusations were simply an effort to find a scapegoat for
disenchantment with his government.
	   ``We haven't crossed into Congo,'' Rwandan army spokesman Maj.
Emmanuel Ndahiro was quoted as saying by the private Rwandan News
Agency.
	   Congo's government earlier acknowledged the eastern city of
Bukavu fell to the rebel Tutsi and Rwandan allies, and state radio
on Friday said the key city of Kisangani was in government hands.
	   There were unconfirmed reports, however, of continued fighting
in Kisangani on Friday.
	   At the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby Kitona village and
military base, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   Tutsi fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan soldiers,
also Tutsis, who played a key role in Kabila's victory over Mobutu
last year, are leading the fighting.
	   Kabila has called for a people's war against Congo's enemies.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces overran the former
Albanian rebel headquarters in central Kosovo on Friday and
appeared to have driven the secessionists from most of their
remaining strongholds in the strategic region.
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   He said that the remaining reports of fighting are only ``final
mopping-up operations'' against ethnic Albanian militants and their
remaining pockets of resistance.
	   Later Friday, Serb forces entered the village of Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met last week with commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Under sniper fire, Serb troops moved from house-to-house,
clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the village and
setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into Albania, where the rebels maintain
sanctuaries.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, state television reported that

Disarmament before sanctions, Butler says, but U.N. bosses may

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector insisted
Friday that sanctions against Iraq won't end until the country
disarms completely _ but one of his bosses suggested sanctions
could be eased if Iraq shows ``progress.''
	   Richard Butler was busy back at work a day after the 15-member
Security Council _ where he has faced criticism in the past _
unanimously denounced an Iraqi decision to freeze contacts with his
inspectors as ``totally unacceptable.''
	   ``If their interest truly were solely and mainly, if not solely,
the business of lifting sanctions ... they could have turned that
key at any time,'' Butler told The Associated Press in his 31st
floor office at U.N. headquarters in New York.
	   ``The key to getting out of sanctions is to yield the weapons
... but the withholding of the weapons from us, against the law,
actually suggests that they have another interest, which is to
retain some weapons capability.''
	   Butler said he understood the ``frustration and desperation'' of
the Iraqis after eight years of debilitating sanctions. He backed
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's initiative for a ``comprehensive
review'' of the international community's relationship with Iraq.
	   But first the Iraqis must disarm, he said.
	   ``The answer to that frustration lies entirely in their hands,''
he said. ``Maybe (sanctions) can be presented to Iraq in a way that
shows them light at the end of the sanctions tunnel.''
	   The current Security Council president, Danilo Turk, agreed that
sanctions were firmly in place _ for now. But he noted that the
council had eased sanctions in other cases, and could consider it
in Iraq's case as well.
	   ``If Butler reports in let's say a month or two, significant
progress, I wouldn't exclude significant discussion on (alleviating
sanctions),'' said Turk, the Slovene delegate to the council.
	   The Security Council statement was, on the face of it, a show of
unity rare in recent months _ but it failed to name any
consequences for Iraq's refusal to cooperate, which Turk suggested
was the result of an erosion of support for the sanctions.
	   ``Sanctions are not as fashionable as they were,'' he said. ``In
the membership, there is a lot of opposition to the idea of
sanctions in general.''
	   Two of the council's permanent members, France and Russia, have
pending financial interests in Iraq and are anxious for an end to
sanctions. Sanctions were imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait and
prevent Iraq from selling its most valuable commodity - oil - on
the open market.
	   ``We call for a rapid resumption of the dialogue between the
Iraqi authorities and UNSCOM,'' said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret at the daily briefing Friday.
	   Iraq sought to put a positive spin on the dispute. Two Iraqi
newspapers _ the only ones printed Friday, the Muslim sabbath _ did
not even report the Security Council statement, instead focusing on
Annan's calls to ``engage'' the Iraqis more closely.
	   Talks with Iraq broke down Monday, when Butler refused to
certify that Iraq has destroyed all of its weapons of mass
destruction _ chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Iraq told weapons inspectors Thursday that they cannot check new
sites.
	   Iraq says that the inspectors' questions have become ``trivial''
and are a ploy to extend the sanctions, at the behest of the United
States.
	   Butler said that was ``thoroughly dishonest.''
	   ``... those questions were our attempt to try and prove (Iraqi
claims) true _ actually we were trying to be helpful,'' the former
Australian U.N. envoy said in his office, where he keeps a
dismantled Iraqi scud missile guidance system on a mantle.
	   Iraq also banned surprise inspections by the U.N. agency that
conducts nuclear inspections, the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency.
	   David Kyd, a spokesman for the IAEA, said Iraq's new
restrictions will make it difficult if not impossible for nuclear
experts to determine whether Iraq has revived its secret program to
build nuclear weapons, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.

Former rebels in Angola wary of U.N., but warm to special envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Angola-U.N. Envoy
 &UR; By CRISTIANA PEREIRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A former Angolan UNITA rebel accused the
United Nations of bias in Angola on Friday, but said a special U.N.
envoy dispatched last week was ``a mediator capable of listening to
our deepest concerns.''
	   ``The Lusaka Protocol was corrupted from the beginning by the
U.N.,'' said Paulo Lukamba Gato, Secretary-General of Angola's
former rebel movement UNITA. He was referring to the U.N.-brokered
peace accord that ended Angola's civil war in 1994.
	   Gato was speaking by satellite phone from UNITA's southeast
highland headquarters.
	   ``The U.N. thought lasting peace could be achieved simply with
disarmament and demobilization'', he said, alluding to a clause in
the accord that committed UNITA to disband its 70,000-strong
guerrilla army in return for political guarantees.
	   About 500,000 people died in the two-decade-long civil war
between UNITA and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government
before the 1994 peace deal signed in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Four years on, a return to war appeared imminent with both sides
blaming each other for the crisis.
	   Tension was running so high in the vast southwest African
country that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent in top diplomat
Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Speaking to reporters Friday in Luanda, a week after his
arrival, Brahimi announced ``the climate of war has dissipated.''
	   Exactly what Brahimi had done to clear the air was not revealed.
But Gato said the envoy had listened attentively when he met with
UNITA's emblematic leader Jonas Savimbi and his inner circle at
their headquarters this week.
	   ``We told him that peace did not mean a silencing of the
cannons...It depends on actions and attitudes,'' Gato said.
	   But Gato's suggestion of improved relations with the U.N. will
soon face the acid test of what UNITA intends to do about its four
remaining rural strongholds, located in southeast Angola.
	   UNITA's reluctance to hand over control of the so-called
``sensitive areas'' _ Andulo, Bailundo, Nhaeria and Mungo _ in July
prompted the U.N. to tighten sanctions already imposed on the
former rebels.
	   At the same Luanda press conference where Brahimi announced a
``new dynamic'' for the Angolan peace process, UNITA revealed it
had proposed a new calendar for returning these areas. No further
details were given.
	   Meanwhile, from the group's highland base Gato warned that peace
was still by no means guaranteed. ``If you cannot accept what is
going on, you can always pick up sticks and stones and start
throwing them again,'' he said.

	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ The Buffalo Sabres of the North
American National Hockey League avoided arbitration Friday when
they signed center Brian Holzinger to a two-year deal.
	   Holzinger will make dlrs 850,000 this season and dlrs 1 million
in 1999-2000, up from the dlrs 345,000 he made last year when he
had 14 goals and 21 assists in 69 games.
	   ``We view Brian as one of our core players, and it's good to
know that he will remain a part of this franchise as we strive to
move forward,'' Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier said in a
statement.
	   Holzinger, 25, was a restricted free agent.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The heavens took pity on Bahrain on
Friday.
	   A day after 13 men reportedly fainted from sunstroke, clouds
drifted across this Gulf island and let loose a shower of rain.
	   It was the first summer rainfall in 30 years, a spokesman for
the Bahrain Meteorological Department said.
	   Despite the thunder and lightning, dozens of people were not
convinced it was rain and phoned the department.
	   ``People couldn't believe their eyes,'' the spokesman said.
``This is very unusual for this time of the year.''
	   The spokesman, who declined to be named, said the clouds had
come from eastern Saudi Arabia, which also received some rain.
	   On Thursday, 13 workers were treated for dehydration in hospital
after they collapsed in temperatures exceeding 50 Celsius (122
Fahrenheit), the Gulf Daily News reported Friday.
	   None of the men suffered seriously and all were discharged, the
newspaper said.
	   No deaths have been reported so far from the heat wave, which
has sent the mercury soaring to 54 Celsius (129 Fahrenheit).
Humidity has hit a record-breaking 90 percent.
	   Newspapers have urged readers to avoiding direct exposure to the
sun.
	   Last month in the neighboring state of Qatar, five workers died
while working at a construction site and more than 150 people were
treated for sunstroke, exhaustion and dehydration as temperatures
exceeded 50 C (122 F).
	   Summer temperatures in the Gulf usually hover around 45 C (113
F), although 50 C (122 F) temperatures are not uncommon.

Smelter closed after 11 cases of lead poisoning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The government has closed down an
unlicensed lead smelting operation after finding 11 cases of lead
poisoning, including a 5-year-old boy who fell into a coma.
	   Dr. Merceline Dahl-Regis, chief medical officer at the Princess
Margaret Hospital, said Friday that the boy was recovering and
could be released from the hospital within two weeks.
	   The boy was hospitalized in June but the lead poisoning was not
diagnosed until last month. The Department of Environmental Health
then tested other residents of the same low-income neighborhood and
found nine more children and one adult with high levels of lead in
their blood, including the boy's sister.
	   The boy, who was not identified, had a level of 135 micrograms
of lead per deciliter of blood, while any level above 25 micrograms
is considered elevated, said Dahl-Regis.

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru's Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra has
resigned, saying it would be ``madness'' for him to stay in power
given his differences with the government of President Alberto
Fujimori.
	   Valle Riestra, a former political opponent whom Fujimori named
to the post two months ago, told reporters Friday that the
president had accepted his resignation and will announce his
replacement in the coming days.
	   He said he was resigning because of repeated clashes with hard
liners in Fujimori's government and the armed forces. He had
announced his resignation Thursday night.

Monaco defeats Lorient 2-1, Metz and Le Havre play to 0-0 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Monaco defeated Lorient 2-1 on Friday to take the
early lead in the French First Division on the first day of play.
Le Havre and Metz played to a 0-0 draw.
	   Monaco and Lorient appeared headed for a 1-1 draw, when Monaco
scored on a penalty kick three minutes before the final whistle to
clinch a victory.
	   In the first half, Lorient had something to cheer about when Ali
Bouafia scored the first goal of the game, putting the ball past
Fabien Barthez, the hero goalkeeper of the victorious French World
Cup team.
	   But Monaco came back five minutes later with a goal by Thierry
Henry, another member of the French World Cup team.
	   The second half was scoreless almost to the end, when the
referee whistled a foul and Monaco scored on a penalty kick with
just three minutes to go.
	   Meanwhile, neither Le Havre nor Metz could gain the advantage
and neither team was able to set up many real goal scoring
possibilities.
	   Bruno Rodriguez came closest to scoring for Metz, when one of
his scoring attempts just missed the net in the 79th minute.
	   Le Havre didn't fare much better, with Milinko Pantic failing to
capitalize on two scoring possibilities.

Bomb blows up Iranian dissidents' car in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A bomb blew up the car of an Iranian
opposition group in Baghdad on Friday, causing several casualties,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Eyewitness told the agency in the Iraqi capital that a bomb
planted next to a tree exploded as a car of the Mujahedeen Khalq
was passing in al-Saadoun Street in the city center.
	   The mujahedeen, Iran's main opposition group, has its
headquarters in Baghdad. Its properties have frequently been
attacked in the city. The group usually accuses Iran of
responsibility.
	   The official news agency did not give a figure for the
causalities nor say if some victims had been killed. It did say
that some people were wounded in a nearby restaurant.
	   Iraqi security authorities are investigating the attack, the
agency reported.
	   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in which
about 1 million people were killed or wounded. Both countries host
groups opposed to each other's government.

No surprises: Yugoslavia, US, Russia, Greece into semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Greece win. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The four favorites are in the final four
at the World Basketball Championship. But barely.
	   Yugoslavia, Greece and the makeshift U.S. team all narrowly
averted upsets Friday to scrape into the semifinals. Only Russia
had less trouble advancing, though like the other quarterfinal
winners it trailed in the second half.
	   Yugoslavia was down by as many as seven points to Argentina but
the reigning European champions came back to win 70-62 and next
face Greece. The hosts held off Spain 69-62 after leading by just
one point with 2:30 remaining.
	   The U.S. collection of castoffs withstood a 32-point performance
by Carlton Myers and rallied to edge Italy 80-77 to set up a
semifinal meeting with Russia, which beat Lithuania 82-67 behind
Vassily Karassev's 31 points.
	   Russia still relies on the core of the team that lost to a U.S.
Dream Team in the gold medal game at the 1994 worlds.
	   Buoyed by a flag-waving, chanting sellout crowd at the
18,000-seat Olympic arena, Greece built an early lead only to see
it fade early in the second half. Spain went up 46-45 with 14:17
left after Ignacio Rodriguez (team-high 12 points) grabbed a loose
ball and made a layup.
	   The teams traded the lead until, with Greece leading 59-58,
Giorgios Baloyiannis and Frangiskos Alvertis hit back-to-back treys
to give the hosts a 65-58 margin.
	   Nikos Economou led Greece with 21 points. Spain's Alberto
Herreros, who averaged 20.5 points to lead all players in
preliminary play, was held to six.
	   Earlier, Argentina used a 9-0 string to go ahead 49-42 midway
through the second half, but Yugoslavia came right back with a 9-0
run of its own, on the strength of seven straight points from guard
Aleksandar Djordjevic (13 points).
	   Yugoslavia led by only three with 30 seconds left.
	   Dejan Bodiroga led five Yugoslavs in double figures with 14
points and added 8 rebounds.
	   Juan Alberto Espil paced Argentina, which at 3-3 had the worst
round-robin record among the final eight teams, with 18 points, but
had just two after halftime.
	   Michael Hawkins led the United States with 16 points and Wendell
Alexis added 14, including two free throws with 25 seconds left
that put the Americans ahead 79-77.
	   Myers missed a 28-foot 3-point attempt with 7 seconds on the
clock, and Kiwane Garris (11 points) added a free throw at the
other end for the final margin.
	   Italy was held without a field goal for the final 7:22.
	   ``Eventually we wore them down and made the baskets that
counted,'' said Alexis, a star at Syracuse in the 1980s who now
plays in the German League. ``We would have loved to win the game
by 30 points, but now it's down to the medal round and every game
is going to be hard.''
	   The Dream Team probably would have beaten Italy by about 30
points, but USA Basketball dumped the NBA stars in mid-June after
the players threatened to boycott the worlds because of the
league's labor dispute.
	   In their place is a rag-tag mix of players drawn mainly from the
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``A true sign of character is when a team can be in a hole and
they don't fall apart and splinter. We feel fortunate to be where
we are,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   Myers repeatedly found seams in the American defense for slashes
to the basket, often resulting in trips to the line. He made all 15
of his free throws, but shot 7-for-18 (39 percent) from the field.
	   Hawkins and Garris scored several key baskets down the stretch
as the United States clawed back from a 73-66 deficit with 4:57
left.
	   They needed to step forward because Jimmy Oliver, the Purdue
product whose 14.0 scoring average led the United States in
preliminary-round play, had just two points, on a pair of free
throws with 2:45 remaining.
	   Karassev carried Russia, scoring 19 points in the second half.
Sergey Babkov added 10 points and 6 rebounds.
	   ``Today we had some bad moments on offense and somebody had to
take over,'' said Karassev, who made 9-of-14 shots from the field
and 12-of-14 free throws. ``Sometimes you're a hero when you do
that and sometimes you're not.''
	   Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of Arturas Karnisovas
and Saulius Stombergas wasn't a factor in the second half, when
they scored just eight of their combined 31 points.
	   In consolation games, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's 33 points led
Australia past Canada 88-71, while Brazil defeated Puerto Rico
76-64.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
at least 81 people. More than 1,700 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least eight Americans were among the dead in Kenya and six
more were missing, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said. The U.S.
ambassador to Kenya was among dozens of injured Americans.
	   At least 74 were killed in Nairobi, and 1,643 were wounded,
police and ambulance services said. At least seven were killed and
72 hurt in Tanzania, officials said.

	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
Rescuers worked beneath huge spotlights set up outside the embassy
as darkness fell.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment but told state-owned Kenya
Broadcasting Corp. they suspected a van loaded with explosives and
parked behind the embassy caused the blast.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt, according to a report
Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published
in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.''

NAIROBI, Kenya: it takes.''

	   In Nairobi, at least seven American officials and one U.S.
dependent were killed, Barr said. Six others were missing, he said.
	   No Americans were killed in the bombing near the U.S. Embassy in
Tanzania, but five Tanzanians who worked at the embassy were
killed, a state department official said.
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
both Tanzania and Kenya.
	   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhumane,'' Clinton said, interrupting a bill-signing ceremony in
the Rose Garden to comment. ``We will use all the means at our
disposal to bring those responsible to justice no matter what or
how long it takes.''
	   A State Department official confirmed bombs that went off five
minutes apart caused the two explosions.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   Preacher Julius Koiyet told The AP he saw three men throw a tin
container about 30 centimeters long (12 inches) towards the
embassy, but it bounced onto an adjacent building where it
exploded. A fourth man fired a gun randomly, striking Koiyet in the
shoulder.
	   Koiyet said he heard at least two bomb blasts. Police were
unable to confirm the number of explosions.
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal trying to reach trapped people who were crying for help.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Police
helicopters hovered overhead, and helped with evacuations.
	   ``There was a huge blast and everything was flying,'' said
witness Pastor Wachira. ``It was all confusion.''
	   Gesturing at dazed and bloody survivors crumpled on sidewalks
and in the road, Wilberforce Mariaria asked, ``How can someone
think of doing this kind of thing.''
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,643 people injured, and some were taken to
hospitals up to 50 kilometers (30 miles) away.
	   In Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S. Embassy
parking lot, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said. At least seven
people were killed and 72 injured, officials said.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy in Dar es Salaam was destroyed,
witnesses said. The nearby Nigerian Embassy and Algerian diplomatic
residence were damaged. Cranes were hurried to the site to tear
apart wreckage in the search for survivors. Many cars were in
flames.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' witness Jim Owens told CNN. He said one
woman was injured when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her
nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   Officials made an urgent plea for blood donations and medical
help.

Same-name mix-up leaves Spanish woman sterile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A woman who went into a hospital for a
sonogram lost her baby, ovaries and uterus to surgeons who mistook
her for an elderly cancer patient with the same name, news reports
say.
	   The mix-up occurred a year ago in the southern city of Cordoba,
and has ended up in a lawsuit now that talks on an out-of-court
settlement have collapsed.
	   Rafaela Martinez Ruiz, 39, has been under psychiatric care since
she lost her baby and any chance of having another, the local
newspaper Cordoba reported.
	   Martinez Ruiz is suing the Andalusia regional health department,
the Reina Sofia University Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology
department and all the doctors and nurses who operated on her on
August 12 of last year, the paper said.
	   It quoted her lawyer as saying surgeons mistook Martinez Ruiz
for another Rafaela Martinez Ruiz, age 71, who was in the hospital
at the same time and scheduled for a hysterectomy because she had
uterine cancer.
	   The hospital's chief physician, Jose Maria Latre, said the
hospital was carrying out an internal investigation of what he
called ``a possible medical error.''
	   The regional health department was more contrite. It issued a
statement saying ``a regrettable error'' had been committed in the
case of the younger Martinez Ruiz.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Elected president on promises to battle
endemic corruption and negotiate peace with a 34-year-old leftist
insurgency, Andres Pastrana was sworn in on Friday facing massive
challenges.
	   Colombians hope the 44-year-old former television journalist can
restore authority to an office whose clout was eroded under the
scandal-plagued administration of outgoing President Ernesto
Samper.
	   Friday's inauguration of the Conservative Party leader and
former Bogota mayor took place in the capital's central plaza and
was attended by about 5,000 people, including visiting dignitaries
and eight heads of state.
	   Pastrana took the oath of office and recieved the presidential
sash on a platform trimmed with white, pink and red roses in front
of the colonial congress building. A military band stood at
attention and Colombian flags flapped in the breeze.
	   Before the ceremony Pastrana prayed at the grave of his late
father, former president Misael Pastrana, at nearby San Ignacio
church.
	   Congress cleared the outgoing president Samper in 1996 of
charges of knowingly accepting dlrs 6 million in campaign
contributions from cocaine lords in his campaign against Pastrana
four years ago. But under Samper, the president's authority
suffered, Colombia's economy declined and the rebel movement grew.
	   A devastating rebel offensive this week highlights Pastrana's
greatest challenge: making peace with an insurgency that earns
millions of dollars a month off the drug trade in vast rural areas
where it holds sway.
	   By their count, guerrillas killed at least 143 soldiers and
police and captured 133 this week. The rebel force that wiped out
an anti-narcotics base in the southern town of Miraflores had at
least tacit support of local civilians who live off the cocaine
trade, the army says.
	   On Thursday, a rebel commander called the offensive a sendoff
for the ``criminal'' Samper administration. Pastrana said it would
not deter him from pushing for peace.
	   He already put himself at considerable risk when he met in the
jungle last month with Manuel Marulanda, head of the largest rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. With
the rebel movement and the drug trade so closely linked, Pastrana
must balance rebel demands with those of U.S. officials who provide
Colombia financial aid.
	   In meetings Monday with President Bill Clinton and other top
officials in Washington, Pastrana says he proposed a shift in the
approach to battling narcotics. Colombia produces most of the
world's cocaine and a growing share of its heroin.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he wants the estimated 500,000 Colombians dependent on coca-growing
to switch to other crops. That could bring him into a head-on
collision with Washington drug warriors pushing for increased aid
to Colombia's military as part of a more hard-line approach.
	   ``Eradication is the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics
thinking ... that can't be taken off the table,'' White House drug
czar Barry McCaffrey said Friday in Bogota before the inauguration.
	   But the U.S. pressure needs to give Pastrana some room to be
innovative, some analysts say.
	   ``The United States needs to really defer to this new government
that shows a lot of promise and is capable of understanding the
situation,'' said Michael Shifter, senior fellow at Inter-American
Dialogue, a Washington think-tank.
	   ``If the drug strategy continues to focus on eradication as the
main element, that could be at odds with a peace strategy in the
sense that it will play into the guerrillas' hands.''

Bomb blows up Iranian dissidents' car in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A bomb blew up the car of an Iranian
opposition group in Baghdad on Friday, injuring several people,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Eyewitness told the agency in the Iraqi capital that a bomb
planted next to a tree exploded as a car of the Mujahedeen Khalq
was passing in al-Saadoun Street in the city center.
	   The mujahedeen, Iran's main opposition group, has its
headquarters in Baghdad. Its properties have frequently been
attacked in the city. The group usually accuses Iran of
responsibility.
	   The official news agency did not give a figure for the
causalities nor say if some victims had been killed. It did say
that some people were wounded in a nearby restaurant.
	   Iraqi security authorities are investigating the attack, the
agency reported.
	   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in which
about 1 million people were killed or wounded. Both countries host
groups opposed to each other's government.

Nigerian leader names officials to oversee democratic change
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction by opposition politicians, details of
electoral commission; CHANGES dateline and ADDS byline. No pickup.
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military ruler has named a
new electoral commission and 15 new state deputies to help prepare
the sprawling West African country for a democratic transition by
next May.
	   Several allies of the country's notorious late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha were dropped from provincial administrations.
	   Military leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar warned Friday morning
that the newly appointed Council of State, which oversees the
governments of the country's 36 states, should refrain from
meddling in civilian political affairs ahead of democratic
elections early next year.
	   ``We will not tolerate a situation in which you interfere in the
matters of political parties or in the political process,''
Abubakar said. ``As with other public officers, you are prohibited
from participating in partisan politics.''
	   The military council includes 15 new members appointed late
Thursday.
	   Abubakar also appointed a new 14-member National Electoral
Commission, to be led by 71-year-old former appeals court Judge
Ephraim Omukese Akpata, who spent several years of his early
training in Canada.
	   The electoral body, which includes academics and politicians
from each of the country's six major regions, will register the
country's newly formed political parties and oversee democratic
elections early next year.
	   The changes were greeted with cautious optimism by opposition
politicians and activists.
	   Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of the opposition National Democratic
Coalition, described the new electoral commission chief as a ``man
of integrity who cannot be tele-guided.''
	   Another politician, Chief Immanuel Nnnabuife, said he was
impressed by the latest appointments and hoped it was a sign of
further democratic changes yet to come.
	   Since unveiling his plan to hand over the reigns of power to a
civilian government by the end of May next year, Abubakar has drawn
cautious applause from a legion of critics and pro-democracy
activists long accustomed to broken promises by Nigerian military
rulers.
	   Abacha had also pledged to allow democratic change, but instead
engineered himself as sole candidate for presidential elections in
the months before he died of heart failure in early June.
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and one of the world's
largest oil exporters, has been ruled by civilian governments for
only 10 of the 38 years since independence from Britain.
	   At least two new political coalitions have announced they are
ready to register for next year's poll.

Security Council president plans to step up pressure on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Slovenia plans to use its presidency of
the U.N. Security Council this month to press for action on
violence by Serbian forces in Kosovo, the Slovene delegate said
Friday.
	   Serb forces appear to have driven ethnic Albanian secessionists
from most of the strategic central region in the Serbian province,
an offensive that has killed hundreds and made refugees of tens of
thousands.
	   Slovenia, represented by Danilo Turk on the council, pressed for
action two months ago, but failed to get agreement because two
veto-holding permanent members of the council resisted sanctions.
	   Russia traditionally backs the Serbs, and China reflexively
resists any action on internal disputes.
	   The Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's excesses in Kosovo may have
eroded Chinese and Russian resistance to sanctions.
	   ``It's difficult for Russia and China,'' he said. ``There will
be a strong push for the council to do something.''
	   Turk said he backed a Canadian initiative to pressure all 15
members of the council to take some action against Yugoslavia.
	   That initiative appeared to be gaining ground Friday, when
France _ another permanent member of the council _ warned of ``all
possible consequences'' if Milosevic did not back down.
	   ``The pursuit of these military operations signifies that
President Milosevic is ignoring the appeals of the international
community,'' French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret
said.
	   ``President Milosevic should pay attention, subject to the
consequences _ all consequences,'' she said, noting that NATO was
planning exercises in the region later this month.
	   The Clinton administration said this week that NATO has approved
contingency plans to use military action against Serb forces in
Kosovo .
	   The plans, which are centered on an aerial assault, are in the
process of undergoing final refinements, State Department
spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Monday.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   Slovenia was the first republic to break off from
Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia in 1991.

No surprises: Yugoslavia, US, Russia, Greece into semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greek team quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The four favorites are in the final four
at the World Basketball Championship. But barely.
	   Yugoslavia, Greece and the makeshift U.S. team all narrowly
averted upsets Friday to scrape into the semifinals. Only Russia
had less trouble advancing, though like the other quarterfinal
winners it trailed in the second half.
	   Yugoslavia was down by as many as seven points to Argentina but
the reigning European champions came back to win 70-62 and next
face Greece. The hosts held off Spain 69-62 after leading by just
one point with 2:30 remaining.
	   ``This was a life and death game. We were very anxious but we
overcame the pressure,'' said Greek guard Frangiskos Alvertis.
	   The U.S. collection of castoffs withstood a 32-point performance
by Carlton Myers and rallied to edge Italy 80-77 to set up a
semifinal meeting with Russia, which beat Lithuania 82-67 behind
Vassily Karassev's 31 points.
	   Russia still relies on the core of the team that lost to a U.S.
Dream Team in the gold medal game at the 1994 worlds.
	   Buoyed by a flag-waving, chanting sellout crowd at the
18,000-seat Olympic arena, Greece built an early lead only to see
it fade early in the second half. Spain went up 46-45 with 14:17
left after Ignacio Rodriguez (team-high 12 points) grabbed a loose
ball and made a layup.
	   The teams traded the lead until, with Greece leading 59-58,
Giorgios Baloyiannis and Alvertis hit back-to-back treys to give
the hosts a 65-58 margin.
	   Nikos Economou led Greece with 21 points. Spain's Alberto
Herreros, who averaged 20.5 points to lead all players in
preliminary play, was held to six.
	   ``We don't have time to celebrate. We don't want to stop here.
We can do more,'' said point guard Angelos Koronios, who chipped in
with 15 points for Greece. ``I think we have the strength to win
but the four teams in the semifinals are almost equal. Any can
dominate another.''
	   Earlier, Argentina used a 9-0 string to go ahead 49-42 midway
through the second half, but Yugoslavia came right back with a 9-0
run of its own, on the strength of seven straight points from guard
Aleksandar Djordjevic (13 points).
	   Yugoslavia led by only three with 30 seconds left.
	   Dejan Bodiroga led five Yugoslavs in double figures with 14
points and added 8 rebounds.
	   Juan Alberto Espil paced Argentina, which at 3-3 had the worst
round-robin record among the final eight teams, with 18 points, but
had just two after halftime.
	   Michael Hawkins led the United States with 16 points and Wendell
Alexis added 14, including two free throws with 25 seconds left
that put the Americans ahead 79-77.
	   Myers missed a 28-foot 3-point attempt with 7 seconds on the
clock, and Kiwane Garris (11 points) added a free throw at the
other end for the final margin.
	   Italy was held without a field goal for the final 7:22.
	   ``Eventually we wore them down and made the baskets that
counted,'' said Alexis, a star at Syracuse in the 1980s who now
plays in the German League. ``We would have loved to win the game
by 30 points, but now it's down to the medal round and every game
is going to be hard.''
	   The Dream Team probably would have beaten Italy by about 30
points, but USA Basketball dumped the NBA stars in mid-June after
the players threatened to boycott the worlds because of the
league's labor dispute.
	   In their place is a rag-tag mix of players drawn mainly from the
Continental Basketball Association and European leagues.
	   ``A true sign of character is when a team can be in a hole and
they don't fall apart and splinter. We feel fortunate to be where
we are,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   Myers repeatedly found seams in the American defense for slashes
to the basket, often resulting in trips to the line. He made all 15
of his free throws, but shot 7-for-18 (39 percent) from the field.
	   Hawkins and Garris scored several key baskets down the stretch
as the United States clawed back from a 73-66 deficit with 4:57
left.
	   They needed to step forward because Jimmy Oliver, the Purdue
product whose 14.0 scoring average led the United States in
preliminary-round play, had just two points, on a pair of free
throws with 2:45 remaining.
	   Karassev carried Russia, scoring 19 points in the second half.
Sergey Babkov added 10 points and 6 rebounds.
	   ``Today we had some bad moments on offense and somebody had to
take over,'' said Karassev, who made 9-of-14 shots from the field
and 12-of-14 free throws. ``Sometimes you're a hero when you do
that and sometimes you're not.''
	   Lithuania's high-scoring forward tandem of Arturas Karnisovas
and Saulius Stombergas wasn't a factor in the second half, when
they scored just eight of their combined 31 points.
	   In consolation games, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's 33 points led
Australia past Canada 88-71, while Brazil defeated Puerto Rico
76-64.

Same-name mix-up leaves Spanish woman sterile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A woman who went into a hospital for a
sonogram lost her baby, ovaries and uterus to surgeons who mistook
her for an elderly cancer patient with the same name, news reports
say.
	   The mix-up occurred a year ago in the southern city of Cordoba,
and has ended up in a lawsuit now that talks on an out-of-court
settlement have collapsed.
	   Rafaela Martinez Ruiz, 39, has been under psychiatric care since
she lost her baby and any chance of having another, the local
newspaper Cordoba reported.
	   Martinez Ruiz is suing the Andalusia regional health department,
the Reina Sofia University Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology
department and all the doctors and nurses who operated on her on
August 12 of last year, the paper said.
	   It quoted her lawyer as saying surgeons mistook Martinez Ruiz
for another Rafaela Martinez Ruiz, age 71, who was in the hospital
at the same time and scheduled for a hysterectomy because she had
uterine cancer.
	   The hospital's chief physician, Jose Maria Latre, said the
hospital was carrying out an internal investigation of what he
called ``a possible medical error.''
	   The regional health department was more contrite. It issued a
statement saying ``a regrettable error'' had been committed in the
case of the younger Martinez Ruiz.

Nicaraguan authorities crack down on new rebel group, four killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Police backed by troops are cracking
down on a new rebel organization in northern Nicaragua, killing
four of its members this week and arresting 28.
	   A National Police report late Thursday identified the 100-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces as former elements of the leftist
Sandinista movement, which governed Nicaragua in the 1980s.
	   But the new organization _ known by its Spanish initials FAR _
is not linked to the Sandinistas, now an opposition party and
Nicaragua's biggest political group, the report said.
	   Some 1,200 police and soldiers arrested 28 rebels, including a
former Sandinista army major, in a series of raids on FAR hideouts.
They also seized a dozen AK-47 assault rifles, ammunition and
explosives.
	   Police said the rebels were responsible for a number of armed
attacks, robberies and kidnappings in the north in recent months.
	   FAR apparently is intent on overthrowing the elected
conservative government of President Arnoldo Aleman and imposing a
Marxist government. Both police and the Sandinistas have described
them as ``opportunists'' and ``common criminals.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
at least 81 people. More than 1,700 others were injured, officials
said.
	   At least 74 were killed in Nairobi, and 1,643 were wounded,
police and ambulance services said. At least seven were killed and
72 hurt in Tanzania, officials said.
	   In Kenya, at least eight Americans were among the dead and six
more were missing, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said. The U.S.
ambassador to Kenya was among dozens of injured Americans.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   Rescuers worked beneath huge spotlights set up outside both
embassies as darkness fell.
	   After a painstaking hourlong mission, one person as pulled from
the wreckage in Nairobi. Three other people were crying for help
from inside a debris-filled elevator shaft. Sparks flew from
welders' torches cutting through twisted metal.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment but told state-owned Kenya
Broadcasting Corp. they suspected a van loaded with explosives and
parked behind the embassy caused the blast.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt, according to a report
Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published
in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.''
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
both Tanzania and Kenya.
	   A U.S. Marine Corps anti-terrorism unit was en route to Kenya.
The FAST unit _ short for Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams _ is
made up of 44 enlisted Marines and one officer trained to help
protect against terrorist attacks at military installations, units
and ships.
	   ``These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhumane,'' Clinton said, interrupting a bill-signing ceremony to
comment. ``We will use all the means at our disposal to bring those
responsible to justice no matter what or how long it takes.''
	   A State Department official confirmed bombs that went off five
minutes apart caused the two explosions.
	   ``It was definitely a bomb,'' said a U.S. Embassy official in
Nairobi, who refused to identify himself. ``You can see a huge
crater behind the building, and a bomb went off at the embassy in
Tanzania at the same time.''
	   Preacher Julius Koiyet told The AP he saw four men leap from a
yellow van behind the U.S. Embassy. While one man fired a gun
randomly, striking Koiyet in the shoulder, the others heaved a tin
container about 30 centimeters long (12 inches) towards the
embassy. It bounced onto an adjacent building where it exploded,
Koiyet said.
	   The van was destroyed in the blast, but it was not immediately
known if it was loaded with explosives.
	   In Nairobi, the blast at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) toppled the
four-story Ufundi Cooperative building toward the embassy, which
was badly damaged. Cooperative Bank House, with government and
private offices, also was damaged.
	   The blast shook shattered windows as far as a 10 blocks away.
Several people aboard two passing buses were killed by shrapnel,
witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers littered the streets.
Crowds crawled over a mountain of twisted and broken concrete and
metal trying to reach trapped people who were crying for help.
	   Bodies were draped out of windows in a charred bus. Shattered
cars were left smoldering on the street amid the debris. Police
helicopters hovered overhead, and helped with evacuations.
	   ``There was a huge blast and everything was flying,'' said
witness Pastor Wachira. ``It was all confusion.''
	   Gesturing at dazed and bloody survivors crumpled on sidewalks
and in the road, Wilberforce Mariaria asked, ``How can someone
think of doing this kind of thing.''
	   Passers-by helped rescuers, and ferried the injured to hospitals
in cars. More than 1,643 people injured, and some were taken to
hospitals up to 50 kilometers (30 miles) away.
	   In Tanzania, a suspected car bomb exploded in the U.S. Embassy
parking lot, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said. At least seven
people were killed and 72 injured, officials said.
	   Nearly two-thirds of the embassy in Dar es Salaam was destroyed,
witnesses said. The nearby Nigerian Embassy and Algerian diplomatic
residence were damaged. Cranes were hurried to the site to tear
apart wreckage in the search for survivors. Many cars were in
flames.
	   ``Glass was flying ... I found myself about 5 feet (1.5 meters)
from where I was sitting,'' witness Jim Owens told CNN. He said one
woman was injured when a wall collapsed on her, and another had her
nose ripped off.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   Security was immediately tightened at other U.S. embassies,
including in Kampala, in nearby Uganda, where staff members were
evacuated.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference, Barr said.
	   U.S. Marines and African troops patrolled outside both of the
damaged embassies.
	   Officials made an urgent plea for blood donations and medical
help.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Vowing to end graft in government and to
negotiate peace with a 34-year-old leftist insurgency, former
Bogota mayor Andres Pastrana was sworn in Friday as president.
	   ``Peace is the most urgent task on our country's agenda and the
best social contract we can make with the future,'' said Pastrana
in an inaugural address delivered from a rose-trimmed platform in
Bogota's colonial central plaza.
	   Some 5,000 persons, including eight heads of state, were in
attendance.
	   Colombians hope the 44-year-old former television journalist and
Conservative Party leader can restore authority to an office whose
clout was eroded under the scandal-plagued administration of
outgoing President Ernesto Samper.
	   Congress cleared Samper in 1996 of charges of knowingly
accepting dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from cocaine
lords in his campaign against Pastrana four years ago. But
presidential authority suffered, Colombia's economy declined and
the rebel movement grew.
	   ``There will be no room in my administration for corruption. It
will not be tolerated nor pardoned,'' said Pastrana , who just
before the inauguration stopped to pray at the grave of his late
father, former president Misael Pastrana.
	   Pastrana also pledged to tame a spiraling budget deficit, to
implement political reforms and to open ``an era of understanding
and trust'' in Colombia's relations with the United States, which
were badly strained over the Samper drug allegations.
	   A devastating rebel offensive this week highlights Pastrana's
paramount challenge: making peace with an insurgency that earns
millions of dollars a month off the drug trade in vast rural areas
where it holds sway.
	   By their count, guerrillas killed at least 143 soldiers and
police and captured 133 this week. The rebel force that wiped out
an anti-narcotics base in the southern town of Miraflores had at
least tacit support of local civilians who live off the cocaine
trade, the army says.
	   On Thursday, a rebel commander called the offensive a sendoff
for the ``criminal'' Samper administration. Pastrana said it would
not deter him from pushing for peace.
	   He already put himself at considerable risk when he met in the
jungle last month with Manuel Marulanda, head of the largest rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. With
the rebel movement and the drug trade so closely linked, Pastrana
must balance rebel demands with those of U.S. officials who provide
Colombia financial aid.
	   In meetings Monday with President Bill Clinton and other top
officials in Washington, Pastrana says he proposed a shift in the
approach to battling narcotics.Colombia produces the bulk of the
world's cocaine and a growing share of its heroin.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he wants the estimated 500,000 Colombians dependent on coca-growing
to switch to other crops. That could bring him into a head-on
collision with Washington drug warriors pushing for increased aid
to Colombia's military as part of a more hard-line approach.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Monaco defeated Lorient 2-1 on Friday to take the
early lead in the French First Division on the first day of play.
Le Havre and Metz played to a 0-0 draw.
	   Monaco and Lorient appeared headed for a 1-1 draw, when Monaco's
Ludovic Giuly scored on a penalty kick three minutes before the
final whistle to clinch a victory.
	   In the first half, Lorient had something to cheer about when Ali
Bouafia scored the first goal of the game, putting the ball past
Fabien Barthez, the hero goalkeeper of the victorious French World
Cup team.
	   But Monaco came back five minutes later with a goal by Frank
Gava.
	   The second half was scoreless almost to the end, when the
referee whistled a foul and Monaco scored on a penalty kick with
just three minutes to go.
	   Meanwhile, neither Le Havre nor Metz could gain the advantage
and neither team was able to set up many real goal scoring
possibilities.
	   Bruno Rodriguez came closest to scoring for Metz, when one of
his scoring attempts just missed the net in the 79th minute.
	   Le Havre didn't fare much better, with Milinko Pantic failing to
capitalize on two scoring possibilities.

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Hours before a summit including
Congo President Laurent Kabila, Rwanda's leader threatened Friday
that his country will ``hit back'' if neighboring Congo attacked
its forces.
	   Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu arrived in
Zimbabwe for a quickly called meeting of seven regional heads of
state to deal with the conflict in the former Zaire, now known as
the Republic of Congo.
	   Kabila has accused Rwanda of invading Congo and has promised to
take the conflict to Rwanda. Rwanda and Congolese Tutsi fighters,
called Banyamulenge, backed Kabila last year on his way to toppling
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, but have since grown disaffected.
	   The resurgence of conflict in Congo and the prospect of civil
war in neighboring Angola alarmed regional leaders who fear
jeopardizing the spirit of peace that rose after apartheid's end in
South Africa in 1994.
	   Kabila's ouster of the corrupt Mobutu raised hopes for Congo's
future, and after 20 years of civil war, Angola's warring factions
appeared to be ready to carry out a 1994 peace accord.
	   At a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia, on his way to Victoria
Falls, Bizimungu demanded that Kabila justify his allegation that
Rwanda was involved in the fighting.
	   ``I understand that (Kabila) has declared war by arming 10
million people, so if we are provoked of course we will hit back,''
Bizimungu said.
	   He said the leaders at the Victoria Falls summit would ask
Kabila to explain the current situation in his country and how the
region could help.
	   Earlier Friday, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe ruled out
military confrontation as a solution to the conflict in Congo,
state-run radio reported.
	   Speaking to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. on arrival at
Victoria Falls, Mugabe said he ``hopes the conflict does not
escalate and cause political turmoil to the whole of the Southern
African region and scare away investors.''
	   Mugabe said he was confident the conflict would be resolved by
the leaders who planned to meet all day Saturday.
	   Wearing a trademark khaki safari suit, a smiling Kabila arrived
just as the sun was setting.
	   Presidents Ben Mkapa of Tanzania, Sam Nujoma of Namibia,
Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni
arrived Friday.
	   Noticably absent was South African President Nelson Mandela. It
was unclear whether he had been invited.

must balance rebel demands with those of U.S. officials who provide
Colombia financial aid.
	   In meetings Monday with President Bill Clinton and other top
officials in Washington, Pastrana says he proposed a shift in the
approach to battling narcotics.Colombia produces the bulk of the
world's cocaine and a growing share of its heroin.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he wants the estimated 500,000 Colombians dependent on coca-growing
to switch to other crops. That could bring him into a head-on
collision with Washington drug warriors pushing for increased aid
to Colombia's military as part of a more hard-line approach.
	   ``Eradication is the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics
thinking ... that can't be taken off the table,'' White House drug
czar Barry McCaffrey said Friday in Bogota before the inauguration.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A bomb killed three people when it exploded
next to a passing car here late Friday, witnesses and hospital
officials said.
	   The bomb, planted near a tree, blew up as a car of an Iranian
dissident group was driving down al-Saadoun Street in the city
center, Farid Suleymani, a spokesman for the group, the Mujahedeen
Khalq, told Associated Press Television.
	   Witnesses said the explosion killed a street vendor and his
teenage son. A doctor at the Al-Jarah hospital said an Iraqi girl
died of her wounds later.
	   The three passengers in the car and another pedestrian are being
treated at the Ibn al-Nafees hospital in Baghdad, hospital
officials told The AP.
	   The mujahedeen, Iran's main opposition group, has its
headquarters in Baghdad. Its properties have frequently been
attacked in the city.
	   Suleymani said the attack ``falls into a pattern of terrorist
attacks organized and carried out by the Iranian regime.''
	   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in which
about 1 million people were killed or wounded. Both countries host
groups opposed to each other's government.

 &UR; Sampras sluggish in victory &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Top-seeded Pete Sampras was pushed to a first-set
tiebreaker before cruising to a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory Friday over
Germany's Tommy Haas to reach the quarterfinals of the rain-plagued
du Maurier Open tennis tournament.
	   Sampras, who needs to win this event to maintain his No. 1 world
ranking, appeared sluggish, tired and frustrated against Haas after
a three-hour rain delay.
	   Sampras was to play eighth-seeded Andre Agassi in quarterfinal
action later Friday night. Rain Thursday forced tournament
organizers to pack Friday's schedule.
	   Agassi, who has won this tournament three times, advanced with a
2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over 10th-seeded Croatian Goran Ivanisevic,
who lost the match when he double-faulted on match point.
	   After commiting numerous unforced errors in the first set,
Sampras took control of the match with an early break in the second
set.
	   ``It's just a few points that cost me the first set,'' Haas
said. ``In the second he had the momentum going, and it's tough to
come back against an opponent like Pete.''
	   Haas, ranked 41st in the world, attacked Sampras with passing
shots that left the American standing at the net.
	   Sampras came up with big shots at the right time. He served 11
aces and had 34 winners to 18 for Haas, but made 21 unforced errors
to the German's 19.
	   In other matches, third-seeded Patrick Rafter beat fellow
Australian Mark Philippoussis, the 14th seed, 6-3, 6-3 to set up a
quarterfinal match with fifth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden.
Britain's Tim Henman, the seventh seed, met Daniel Vacek of the
Czech Republic and Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov took on Richard
Krajicek of the Netherlands in other quarterfinal matches.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Vowing to end graft in government and to
negotiate peace with a 34-year-old leftist insurgency, former
Bogota mayor Andres Pastrana was sworn in Friday as president.
	   ``Peace is the most urgent task on our country's agenda and the
best social contract we can make with the future,'' said Pastrana
in an inaugural address delivered from a rose-trimmed platform in
Bogota's colonial central plaza.
	   Some 5,000 persons, including eight heads of state, were in
attendance.
	   Colombians hope the 44-year-old former television journalist and
Conservative Party leader can restore authority to an office whose
clout was eroded under the scandal-plagued administration of
outgoing President Ernesto Samper.
	   Congress cleared Samper in 1996 of charges of knowingly
accepting dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from cocaine
lords in his campaign against Pastrana four years ago. But
presidential authority suffered, Colombia's economy declined and
the rebel movement grew.
	   ``There will be no room in my administration for corruption. It
will not be tolerated nor pardoned,'' said Pastrana , who just
before the inauguration stopped to pray at the grave of his late
father, former president Misael Pastrana.
	   Pastrana also pledged to tame a spiraling budget deficit, to
implement political reforms and to open ``an era of understanding
and trust'' in Colombia's relations with the United States, which
were badly strained over the Samper drug allegations.
	   A devastating rebel offensive this week highlights Pastrana's
paramount challenge: making peace with an insurgency that earns
millions of dollars a month off the drug trade in vast rural areas
where it holds sway.
	   By their count, guerrillas killed at least 143 soldiers and
police and captured 133 this week. The rebel force that wiped out
an anti-narcotics base in the southern town of Miraflores had at
least tacit support of local civilians who live off the cocaine
trade, the army says.
	   On Thursday, a rebel commander called the offensive a sendoff
for the ``criminal'' Samper administration. Pastrana said it would
not deter him from pushing for peace.
	   He already put himself at considerable risk when he met in the
jungle last month with Manuel Marulanda, head of the largest rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. With
the rebel movement and the drug trade so closely linked, Pastrana
must balance rebel demands with those of U.S. officials who provide
Colombia financial aid.
	   In meetings Monday with President Bill Clinton and other top
officials in Washington, Pastrana says he proposed a shift in the
approach to battling narcotics.Colombia produces the bulk of the
world's cocaine and a growing share of its heroin.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he wants the estimated 500,000 Colombians dependent on coca-growing
to switch to other crops. That could bring him into a head-on
collision with Washington drug warriors pushing for increased aid
to Colombia's military as part of a more hard-line approach.
	   ``Eradication is the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics
thinking ... that can't be taken off the table,'' White House drug
czar Barry McCaffrey said Friday in Bogota before the inauguration.

Feerick sets hearing for grievance on guaranteed contracts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Barring an unforeseen resumption of talks, the
next big event in the North American National Basketball
Association lockout will come late this month when arbitrator John
Feerick holds a hearing on whether players with guaranteed
contracts should be paid during the lockout.
	   Feerick met Friday with lawyers from the league and the union
and set Aug. 24-25 as the dates for the hearing.
	   If the players were to win, the owners would be obligated to pay
about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries during the 1998-99
season. First, however, owners would undoubtedly ask that any award
be delayed until the issue of Feerick's jurisdiction was settled in
federal court.
	   Formal talks between the sides broke off Thursday afternoon when
commissioner David Stern and six owners walked out of a bargaining
session after hearing the players' new proposal.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the union's
strategy appeared to be geared toward trying to defeat the owners
in two matters of litigation before Feerick and the National Labor
Relations Board.
	   The union filed the grievance with Feerick on June 30, just a
few hours before the lockout commenced, claiming the owners
committed an ``anticipatory breach of contract'' when they
announced June 29 that they would not pay players with guaranteed
contracts during the lockout.
	   Most players aren't scheduled to receive their first paychecks
until Nov. 15, but a few dozen were supposed to be paid this
summer.
	   Feerick held a hearing last week and determined that he has
jurisdiction to hear the grievance. League lawyers did not attend
that hearing after going to court earlier that day and failing to
convince a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order
halting it. The league is thought to be weary of Feerick, who was
publicly castigated by Stern after his ruling last March in the
Latrell Sprewell case.
	   Stern's lawyers were supposed to attend a scheduling session
with Feerick on Thursday afternoon, but refused to show up after
the talks broke down.
	   By Friday morning, they had relented.
	   The next date to watch in the NLRB case is Aug. 10, when
regional director Daniel Silverman will determine whether the
players' complaint has merit. The union filed an unfair labor
practice charge with the NLRB, claiming the league unlawfully
altered the terms of the expired agreement before an impasse in
negotiations had been reached.

Latvia says Russian radar has to close
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvia is determined to close the major
Russian radar base at Skrunda this month, the government said
Friday, despite concerns that Russia will punish its small neighbor
economically.
	   The Skrunda base, 150 kilometers (90 miles) west of Riga, is the
last Russian military presence in the former Soviet Baltic states.
Other Russian troop witdrawals were completed in 1994, three years
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Under the withdrawal agreements, Russia was allowed to keep the
Skrunda base until Aug. 31.
	   The Baltic News Service on Friday quoted Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Valeri Nesterushkin as saying Moscow could
cancel Latvia's most-favored-nation trade status if it did not
allow Russian operation of the Skrunda base to continue.
	   A Latvian Foreign Ministry statement later Friday said ``talk of
continuing the operation of the radar station or of halting the
dismantlement of the station are empty.''
	   Loss of the Skrunda base could leave a severe hole in Russia's
capacity to monitor western skies for incoming missiles.
	   The closing date comes amid tensions between the Kremlin and
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia over the three Baltic countries'
determination to join NATO.
	   Relations between Latvia and its giant eastern neighbor have
been aggravated since spring over Latvia's treatment of its large
ethnic Russian community, hundreds of thousands of whom did not get
Latvian citizenship after the Soviet collapse.
	   The Latvian parliament this summer passed liberalizing
amandments to its naturalization law. But Latvian officials
recently have complained that Russia is taking apparently punitive
economic measures such as limiting transit permits for
cargo-haulers.

Ambience meets ambulance in this ad campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Here's an advertising strategy that
really deivers _ right to the emergency room: a Danish hospital
wants to sell ad space on its ambulance.
	   The Fuen County Hospital wants to buy a new ambulance, but
doesn't have the 1.3 million kroner (dlrs 190,000) it needs, so it
is negotiating with an insurance company to place ads on the
vehicle.
	   Pernille Weiss-Pedersen, vice-chairman of Fuen County's Health
Department, was quoted by the newspaper Politiken on Friday that
she isn't bothered by the irony of an insurance ad on an ambulance.
	   But ``there of course must be certain restrictions concerning
seriousness,'' she said, according to the paper.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A bomb killed three people when it exploded
next to a passing car here late Friday, witnesses and hospital
officials said.
	   The bomb, planted near a tree, blew up as a car of an Iranian
dissident group was driving down al-Saadoun Street in the city
center, Farid Suleymani, a spokesman for the group, the Mujahedeen
Khalq, told Associated Press Television.
	   Witnesses said the explosion killed a street vendor and his
teenage son. A doctor at Al-Jarah Hospital said a five-year old
Iraqi girl died of her wounds later.
	   Officials at the Al-Jarah and Ibn al-Nafees hospitals said they
were treating 14 people for injuries.
	   Among the wounded were the three passengers in the car, which
Iraqi police confirmed as belonging to the Mujahedeen.
	   The blast, apparently triggered by remote control, occurred at
about 9.35 p.m. local time (1735 GMT), a witness told The AP.
	   It toppled a tall tree on top of a parked car. Police summoned a
crane to remove the tree.
	   Police investigators said they could not say who was
responsible.
	   The mujahedeen, Iran's main opposition group, has its
headquarters in Baghdad. Its properties have frequently been
attacked in the city.
	   Suleymani said the attack ``falls into a pattern of terrorist
attacks organized and carried out by the Iranian regime.''
	   Iranian officials could not be reached for comment Friday night.
	   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in which

Pepper takes one-stroke lead in Star Bank LPGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMES HANNAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) _ Dottie Pepper shot a scorching
9-under-par 63 to take a one-stroke lead Friday in the opening
round of the Star Bank LPGA Classic.
	   Pepper combined arrow-straight tee shots with precision putting
to collect nine birdies on the 6,302-yard (5,760 meters), par-72
Country Club of the North course.
	   ``All I tried to keep doing all day was just get further and
further under par,'' Pepper, 32, said. ``Everything felt good.''
	   Pepper's career-best 63 was a record for the tournament. Donna
Andrews shot a 65 in 1996.
	   Breathing down Pepper's neck was Meg Mallon at 64, South Korean
native Pearl Sinn at 65 and tour veterans Beth Daniel and Judy
Dickinson, both at 66. Brandie Burton, who captured last week's du
Maurier Classic in Canada, shot a 68.
	   The players had to weather 90-degree heat and high humidity on
the Jack Nicklaus-designed course in this Dayton suburb. However,
overnight rain softened the greens and the course earned high marks
from the players.
	   Four of the 14 tournaments Pepper has won since joining the tour
in 1987 came in 1996. But she hasn't won since.
	   Pepper birdied five of the first six holes on the back nine,
dropping putts of between 12 (3.7 meters) and 15 feet (4.6 meters).
She hit every fairway.
	   Her only bogey came on the par-3, 187-yard (171 meters) seventh
hole, when she three-putted.
	   Mallon relied on her chip shots to move into second place,
including a shot from the woods on the par-4, 464-yard (424 meters)
fourth hole that rolled to within 12 feet (3.7 meters) of the hole.
She sank the putt for a birdie.
	   ``That was nice,'' said Mallon, 35. ``That kind of kept my
momentum going.''
	   Sinn, who hasn't won a tournament since joining the tour in
1990, combined accurate tee shots with strong putting for eight
birdies.
	   ``I've been spending a lot of time out there on the green,
practicing,'' Sinn said. ``It seems like that's helping a lot. I'm
making a lot of good putts. I'm not making too many mistakes out
there.''
	   Sinn, 31, who lives in Long Beach, Calif., collected birdies on
four of the first six holes on the back nine. She sank a 25-foot
putt (7.6 meters) on 14 and dropped a 12-foot (3.7 meters) putt on
15.
	   The front nine was only a bit less kind.
	   ``I started to skid a little bit,'' Sinn said. ``I pulled my
6-iron on No. 2, went left and over the green, and really didn't
have any shot at it. So I just made my bogey.''
	   The 41-year-old Daniel, who has won 32 tournaments and is the
LPGA's fourth-highest money-winner, birdied three straight holes on
the back nine and was able to two-putt on two holes from 50 or so
feet (15 meters) away.
	   ``You need to hit a lot of greens, and I hit it close,'' Daniel
said. ``I had a lot of opportunities today and was able to
capitalize on quite a few of them.''
	   Right with Daniel was Dickinson, who used deadly approach shots
that left her with short putts.
	   The 48-year-old Akron, Ohio, native whose husband, Gardner
Dickinson, died in April after a long illness, said getting back
into the swing of things has been difficult. She said a friend just
sent her a cassette tape of her late husband reading to a friend
who was suffering from multiple sclerosis.
	   ``The kids and I were listening to it on the way out to the golf
course,'' Dickinson said. ``It was just really great to hear his
voice again. It kind of inspired me a little bit today.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
at least 81 people and injuring more than 1,700 others, officials
said.
	   At least 74 were killed in Nairobi, and 1,643 were wounded,
police and ambulance services said. At least seven were killed and
72 hurt in Tanzania, officials said.
	   In Kenya, at least eight Americans including a child were among
the dead, and five more were missing, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill
Barr said after one U.S. citizen was found at a hospital.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya was among dozens of injured
Americans.
	   ``We fear the worst. By the time the rubble is cleared, we
expect to find more dead,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   Rescuers worked beneath huge spotlights set up outside both
embassies as darkness fell.
	   After a painstaking hourlong mission, one person as pulled from
the wreckage in Nairobi. Three people were crying for help from
inside a debris-filled elevator shaft, and two others were wedged
between concrete slabs.
	   Sparks flew from welders' blow torches cutting through twisted
metal.
	   An Arabic-speaking man was taken into custody in Nairobi by
Kenyan police in connection with the bombing, said an Associated
Press photographer who witnessed the incident.
	   Police made no immediate comment but told state-owned Kenya
Broadcasting Corp. they suspected a van loaded with explosives and
parked behind the embassy caused the blast.
	   There was no claim of responsibility. However, the Islamic Jihad
vowed to strike American interests because some of its members were
arrested in Albania and handed over to Egypt, according to a report
Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily Arabic language newspaper published
in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to the groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks and
said the United States would bring the terrorists to justice ``no
matter what or how long it takes.''
	   A C-141 transport plane left Ramstein Air Base in Germany for
Kenya with medical equipment, containers of blood and stretchers,
plus a 47-person medical team and 26 security troops.
	   FBI investigators also were traveling to both countries.

Herta has provisional pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM PUET &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ Bryan Herta, driving on his home track,
broke his own track record in Friday's first day of qualifying for
Sunday's Miller Lite 200 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.
	   Herta, last year's polesitter in the race, drove his Team Rahal
Reynard-Ford Cosworth to a fast lap of 66.1 seconds on the
2.25-mile (3.62 kilometers), 13-turn road course in the hills of
north-central Ohio.
	   If Herta remains the fastest driver when qualifying ends
Saturday, it would be his third pole of the year and sixth of his
career. He also had the best qualifying lap at Long Beach and
Portland earlier this year. He still is looking for his first
victory.
	   Herta's performance beat the record of he set last year, also on
the first day of qualifying. He doesn't expect his lastest mark to
last long.
	   ``All I'm thinking about is improving the car for tomorrow,'' he
said. ``It's going to get a lot faster because it was faster here
earlier this year in testing. ... We won't sit on anything and just
say `OK, we're there.'''
	   Herta's boss, Bobby Rahal, plans to retire at the end of this
season and is making his farewell appearance as a driver at the
track. Rahal, the only owner-driver in CART, was 19th Friday. Rahal
and Herta's racing operations are based in the Columbus suburb of
Hilliard, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the track.
	   ``Winning this race would be special, but then any victory would
be special,'' Herta said. ``I don't know if there can be any
greater incentive than to win your first race.''
	   Rahal was disappointed with his car's performance.
	   ``The car's rear end wanted to slide too much,'' he said. ``It
seems that the track conditions have everybody sliding around a
lot. ... Right at the end of the session, I felt the car was on a
good lap, but the red flag came out'' to end qualifying.
	   The second-fastest lap was by Mark Blundell at 66.372 seconds in
a pacWest Reynard-Mercedes. The British driver hasn't qualified
higher than sixth this year and is looking for his fourth victory
in three CART seasons.
	   ``We've been getting stronger in the last few races,'' he said.
``I just want to continue this through tomorrow and hopefully we
can stay in the position we're in now, if not better.''
	   Third at 66.39 seconds was Dario Franchitti, driving a
Reynard-Honda for Team Green. The second-year driver from Scotland
also is winless, but has won three poles this season and is going
for his fourth front-row spot in the last five races.
	   ``The time Bryan did was very reachable,'' Franchitti said. ``He
could go faster as well. It's going to be a very interesting
qualifying session tomorrow afternoon.''
	   Alex Zanardi, the two-time defending champion of the race and
the runaway leader in the driver point standings, was 21st among
the 28 drivers, but his lap time was less than one second slower
than Herta.
	   Fourth through 10th, respectively, were Patrick Carpentier,
Scott Pruett, Greg Moore, Richie Hearn, Al Unser Jr., Gil de
Ferran, and Jimmy Vasser.
	   The winner of the pole position will get a record dlrs 410,000
prize if he wins Sunday's race.
	   The race winner receives dlrs 100,000 and the pole winner gets
dlrs 10,000, plus an additional dlrs 15,000 should he win the race.
That dlrs 15,000 bonus rolls over until a victory from the pole is
recorded.
	   The last winner from the pole was Zanardi at Cleveland in July
1997. This is the 20th race since then, so if the polesitter wins
Sunday, he will get dlrs 125,000, plus the dlrs 285,000 accumulated
from the previous 19 races. The former record pole purse for the
series was dlrs 160,000, won by Unser in 1994.
	   Half the previous sixteen CART races at Mid-Ohio have been won
by the driver who qualified first.
	   The race winner generally has been among the first four
qualifiers because it is a track with tight turns and few spots for
passing. No one has won a CART event at Mid-Ohio from farther back
than eighth.

Eagle leaves Chamblee with Buick Open lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BLANC, Michigan (AP) _ Brandel Chamblee came to Michigan
because he figured it was too hot to hang around home in Arizona.
It might be the best move he's ever made.
	   Chamblee, seeking his first win on the PGA Tour, used an eagle
on the seventh hole _ his 16th _ Friday to shoot a 4-under-par 68
that left him at 11-under 133 and a stroke ahead of rookie Kent
Jones, who shot 67.
	   Dudley Hart (69) and Phil Blackmar (68) were at 135. Defending
champion Vijay Singh (70) was tied with Steve Stricker (67) at 136.
	   Tiger Woods, starting the day at 1-under 71, eagled No. 1 _ his
10th hole _ birdied the third and seemed to be making a run after
getting to 7-under. But Woods, using Warwick Hills Golf and Country
Club as a tune-up for the PGA Championship next week at Redmond,
Washington, couldn't keep it going.
	   He was up and down with two bogeys and a birdie over his final
six holes, shooting 68 for 138.
	   The start of each round has been delayed 30 minutes because of
overnight thunderstorms that left the course almost flooded in some
areas. Workers used squeegees to push water off the greens early
Friday, but some standing water remained in spots around the
7,105-yard (6494 meters) course.
	   Because of the softened conditions, players were allowed to
lift, clean and replace shots in the fairways. Usually that would
guarantee massive red numbers on this course on which the
tournament record is 26-under.
	   But moist conditions work the other way, too. Approach shots
tend to spin back more than usual on wet greens, and that left many
players farther from pins than they expected to be. As a result,
the birdie barrage was fairly mild.
	   Chamblee, who shared the first-round lead with J.L. Lewis, used
a driver and 3-wood to get within 82 yards (75 meters) of the pin
at the par-5 seventh, a 584-yard (534 meters) hole.
	   ``I had 82 yards to the pin, which was perfect because I hit my
60-degree wedge 84 yards,'' said Chamblee, who has failed to make a
penny in three previous tries at Warwick Hills. ``I figured I'd hit
it two yards past the hole and back it up. That's exactly what it
did, and it spun right back into the hole.
	   ``It was pretty exciting, actually.''
	   Jones, who has missed the cut in three of his last four
tournaments, rolled in birdie putts of 20 (6.10 meters) and 30
(9.14 meters) feet. He also hit a wedge to within 18 inches (46
centimeters) of the cup, resulting in birdie at the par-5 16th.
	   ``It's been a tough season,'' Jones said. ``There have been a
lot of frustrations the last couple of months. It's been a learning
experience, this being my first year.''
	   Hart hasn't made a bogey through two rounds, but his three
birdies in the second round were only half as many as he made in
the first round.
	   ``It's real wet,'' said Hart, who could use a hefty check to pay
for the wedding gifts he gave his bride, Suzanne, two weeks ago.
``There's a lot more standing water than yesterday.
	   ``The greens are very soft, but they are still rolling well. I'm
surprised how good they are.''
	   Lewis, starting on No. 10, bogeyed three of the last four holes
on the homeward nine and struggled to a 4-over 76 for 141.
	   Justin Leonard and John Huston both had 70s for 143, the same as
Brian Watts (72). All three missed the cut by one stroke. Tevor
Dodds (74) and Brad Faxon (72) also missed the cut at 145.
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  In 1967, Julius Boros shot 72-72 in the first two
rounds on his way to winning the Buick Open. This year his son,
Guy, had identical scores and missed the cut by two strokes. ...
First-round co-leader J.L. Lewis is from Texas, where he once was
the pro at the nine-hole course owned by country singer Willie
Nelson. The initials, by the way, stand for John Lee. ... Skip
Kendall had 18 pars in the second round for 2-under 142. ... Frank
Lickliter, who opened with a 73, was disqualified for turning in an
incorrect card after the second round.

<TEXT>
	   MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) _ An American adventurer lifted off
Friday on a daredevil quest to be the first man to circle Earth in
a balloon, his silvery Solo Spirit soaring away beneath a full
moon.
	   Steve Fossett, who has swum the English channel and sailed solo
across the Pacific, was embarking on an attempted 20,000-mile
(32,200-kilometer) crossing of the globe _ one of aviation's last
last unachieved adventures.
	   Unbowed by three earlier failures, the 54-year-old Chicago
stockbroker climbed into his yellow capsule and waved to hundreds
of cheering spectators who had gathered at the launch site _ an
open-air soccer stadium in Mendoza, 600 miles (965 kilometers) west
of Buenos Aires.
	   Circling the globe in a balloon is one of aviation's last
unachieved feats. Fossett has charted a 14-18 day course that would
take him from west to east around the Southern Hemisphere, mostly
over dangerous oceans.
	   ``You have to believe that you are going to succeed with this
flight because a water landing would be very dangerous,'' Fossett
told The Associated Press earlier. ``I'm using the same capsule
I've used for seven balloon flights, and it's seaworthy.''
	   On Friday afternoon, workers spread out Solo Spirit's fabric on
a soccer field in Mendoza, 600 miles (965 kilometers) west of
Buenos Aires, and began inflating its hot air and helium chambers.
	   Fossett's charted course would take him across Argentina amd out
over the South Atlantic. If all goes to plan, he would then attempt
to fly below the tip of South Africa to Australia, then head east
across the Pacific back into South America.
	   A statement from his command center at Washington University in
St. Louis said weather was good for a late Friday launch, but
cautioned: ``As with all balloon flights, the launch date and time
are subject to change up to the point of launch.''
	   Solo Spirit, shaped like a giant silver light bulb, rises half a
football field high. The attached 4-foot-by-6 1/2-foot (1.2 by 2
meter) capsule has a bench to sleep on, communications gear, a
parachute, life raft and enough food to await sea rescue.
	   Teammates also have strapped 40 silver tanks of propane fuel to
the capsule and stowed aboard a laptop computer, telephone and
other gear.
	   Competition is intense to achieve RTW _ ballooning parlance for
``Round the World'' _ and most attempts have been made in the
Northern Hemisphere.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms. A year later, he set
the distance record: a 10,361-mile (16,600-kilometer) , six-day
journey from St. Louis to Sultanpar, India. He landed after running
short of fuel while awaiting Libyan clearance.
	   On Jan. 5, 1998, Fossett landed 5,802 (9,330 kilometers) miles
away from St. Louis, in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern
Russia.

Bomb blows up Iranian dissidents' car in Baghdad, kills 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new wounded toll, more details grafs 3-8 and 11;
no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A bomb killed three people when it exploded
next to a passing car here late Friday, witnesses and hospital
officials said.
	   The bomb, planted near a tree, blew up as a car carrying three
people_at least two of them Iranian dissidents_ was driving down
al-Saadoun Street in the city center, Farid Suleymani, a spokesman
for the group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, told Associated Press
Television.
	   Witnesses said the explosion killed a street vendor and his
teenage son. A doctor at Al-Jarah Hospital said a five-year old
Iraqi girl died of her wounds later.
	   Officials at the Al-Jarah and Ibn al-Nafees hospitals said they
were treating 14 people for injuries.
	   Among the wounded were the three passengers in the car, which
Iraqi police confirmed as belonging to the Mujahedeen.
	   The blast, apparently triggered by remote control, occurred at
about 9.35 p.m. local time (1735 GMT), a witness told The AP.
	   It toppled a tall tree on top of a parked car. Police summoned a
crane to remove the tree.
	   Police investigators said they could not say who was
responsible.
	   The mujahedeen, Iran's main opposition group, has its
headquarters in Baghdad. Its properties have frequently been
attacked in the city.
	   Suleymani said the attack ``falls into a pattern of terrorist
attacks organized and carried out by the Iranian regime.''
	   Iranian officials could not be reached for comment Friday night.
	   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in which
about 1 million people were killed or wounded. Both countries host
groups opposed to each other's government.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks extended a modest rebound from Tuesday's
selloff, but a sharper rally faltered Friday as Japan's new leader
failed to impress investors with his plans to stimulate that
nation's sagging economy. The Dow Jones industrial average finished
20.34 points _ or 0.2 percent _ higher at 8,598.02 after retreating
from a midday gain of 132 points, closing the week about 740 points
below the record of 9,337.97 set three weeks ago on July 17.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. unemployment rate held steady at 4.5
percent in July, withstanding the sharp but temporary impact of the
General Motor strikes, which produced the worst factory job losses
in 16 years. It matched June's seasonally adjusted rate and was
only slightly higher than the 28-year low of 4.3 percent, reached
in May, the Labor Department said Friday. However, U.S. employers
reported a net gain in jobs of only 66,000, the weakest month in
two and a half years. Job growth was held back by a drop of 176,000
in manufacturing, the largest since October 1982. The department
attributed 146,600 of the loss to the direct or indirect impact of
the GM strikes, which began June 5 with a shutdown at a metal
stamping plant in Flint, Michigan, and were settled last week.
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said excluding the strike, the report
portrayed a ``steady and solid'' job market that ``is working for
working families and can weather any storm.'' (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new tax chief threatened tough action
against the country's tax deadbeats on Friday, saying the
government is prepared to take ``every measure,'' including
freezing their bank accounts and seizing their property. Boris
Fyodorov also said revenues are rising steadily, indicating
progress in a struggle that has targeted some of the country's
biggest tax-dodgers _ powerful oil and gas companies. Russia's tax
collection figures have improved in recent months, though not as
much as hoped. Tax receipts for August are expected to total dlrs 2
billion, up marginally from dlrs 1.9 billion in July, which was
higher than in June. Also Friday, the Finance Ministry and the
International Monetary Fund said Russia is committed to raising
dlrs 3 billion through privatization by the end of the year.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Despite rising sales, Swedish automaker
Saab on Friday reported a loss for the first half of the year of
978 million kronor (dlrs 122 million). The loss was more than 50
percent bigger than the 600 million kronor reported a year ago. The
company, jointly owned by General Motors and Sweden's Investor,
said sales for the period increased 18 percent to 12.97 billion
kronor (dlrs 1.62 billion) while the number of sold cars rose 14
percent to 58,077. The cost of launching the new 9-3 and 9-5 models
generated large costs, said chief executive Robert W. Hendry.
(SWEDEN-EARNS-SAAB)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican peso weakened to a record low
against the dollar Friday, pressured by a sliding yen, sharp stock
losses and a warning by Moody's that Mexico remains vulnerable on a
number of fronts. In Mexico City on 48-hour spot dollar markets,
banking leader Banamex quoted the peso closing at a midrate of
9.064 per dollar, weaker from its open of 9.022 per dollar and
weaker from Thursday's close of 9.021. Asian economic turmoil
continued to batter the peso. (MEXICO-PESO)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Fighting back against possible competition from a
New York exchange in the lucrative business of trading in U.S.
Treasury bonds, the giant Chicago Board of Trade is setting its
sights on New York's contracts for trading cotton, orange juice,
coffee, sugar and cocoa. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's
largest futures exchange, on Friday announced plans to launch
daytime online trading of futures and options contracts for the
commodities that are a mainstay of the Board of Trade of the City
of New York. Chicago's electronic-trading contracts will mirror
that of the New York exchange's subsidiaries, according to the
Chicago Board of Trade. But it did not provide specific details of
the contracts or announce when they would begin trading.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombs exploded minutes apart
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, killing
at least 81 people. More than 1,700 others were injured, officials
said. At least 74 were killed in Nairobi, and 1,643 were wounded,
police and ambulance services said. At least seven were killed and
72 hurt in Tanzania, officials said. In Kenya, at least eight
Americans were among the dead and six more were missing, U.S.
Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said. The U.S. ambassador to Kenya was
among dozens of injured Americans. (KENYA-EXPLOSION).
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a move that threatens to undermine the
credibility of the investigation into President Bill Clintons
relationship with a White House intern, a federal judge has found
that special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's staff probably have
violated grand jury secrecy laws. Lawyers for Clinton and White
House aides ``have established prima facie violations'' of the
secrecy rule that prohibits disclosure of any grand jury material,
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled according to court
documents released Friday. Johnson ruled that even one news article
with leaked information could establish a violation. ``The court
finds that several articles establish prima facie violations,'' she
said. Starr now needs to show that neither he nor his office were
behind the leaks. (CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Carrying what possessions they could, hundreds of
thousands of Chinese villagers on Friday turned their backs on
homes that will be sacrificed to the raging waters of the Yangtze
River if authorities resort to last-ditch anti-flood measures. With
the river at record levels and rising, officials were preparing to
open floodgates and, if that failed, blow up a dike to divert water
from one of the most threatened sections of the 3,900-mile
(6,270-kilometer) waterway. Local authorities said late Friday they
had not received the order to inundate the Jingjiang flood plain, a
47-mile (75-kilometer) area dotted by a half-dozen hamlets and a
city of 500,000 people. The move would require the approval of
China's State Council, or Cabinet. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector insisted
Friday that sanctions against Iraq won't end until the country
disarms completely _ but one of his bosses suggested sanctions
could be eased if Iraq shows ``progress.'' Richard Butler was busy
back at work a day after the 15-member Security Council _ where he
has faced criticism in the past _ unanimously denounced an Iraqi
decision to freeze contacts with his inspectors as ``totally
unacceptable.'' The current Security Council president, Danilo
Turk, agreed that sanctions were firmly in place _ for now. But he
noted that the council had eased sanctions in other cases, and
could consider it in Iraq's case as well. (UN-IRAQ)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a growing Tutsi rebellion
that appears to be sweeping into Congo's dense jungle interior,
President Laurent Kabila left his troubled capital Friday in search
of support to keep his 14-month-old regime from unravelling. But
within hours of his departure, Kabila's troops rampaged through
parts of Kinshasa, looting shops and harrassing ethnic Tutsis. ``In
the army the soldiers are very unhappy,'' said a senior police
commander with the city's intelligence branch. The officer, who
responded to calls to stop the looting, spoke on condition of
anonymity. Kinshasa was tense Friday with armed troops roaming
through the streets, questioning pedestrians and manning
checkpoints at key intersections. (CONGO)

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Its empire is long gone, shrunk to a
small nation of largely skiing and hiking fanatics. But thanks to a
few hundred stallions, a bit of Austria's past glory lives on.
	   ``Austria _ oh, I know,'' the taxi driver in Las Vegas mused to
his Viennese passenger recently. ``The Lipizzaners _ the white
horses _ and Arnold Schwarzenegger.''
	   Leaving aside the Terminator, along with wiener schnitzel,
oompah bands and ``The Sound of Music,'' the Lipizzaners have
reigned as Austria's symbol of imperial might for more than four
centuries.
	   Once part of the Austrian war machine, today the Lipizzaners are
all about the nobility of art and breeding _ and a lucrative source
of schillings for the nation's tourist industry.
	   About half a million people every year watch the horses perform
at the government-owned Spanish Riding School in Vienna, on
international tour or kicking back at their summer home at the
Piber stud farm in southern Austria.
	   ``There are only a few institutions in the world that have
survived 430 years,'' boasts the school's director, Jaromir
Oulehla, who related the tale of the world-wise Vegas cabbie.
	   From the moment visitors enter the Spanish Riding School, a
white, crystal-chandeliered building in an 18th-century building of
the Hofburg palace complex, it's clear they are in the presence of
royalty _ albeit the equine version.
	   In an elegant hall that looks suited for an opera or an
emperor's ball, except for the dirt floor, the Lipizzaners perform
a show of maneuvers that are essentially unchanged since the 1500s.
	   Even the director concedes they could be viewed as an
anachronism. But admirers wax poetic about the artistry, the
tradition.
	   ``These peerless Lippizaners which come before the public full
of proud, prancing, pristine movement with their quiet, discreet
and disciplined riders, centaurlike in the saddle, are testimony to
art,'' raved Sylvia Loch, founder of England's Classical Riding
Club.
	   The same stylishness and power caught the eye of the imperial
courts of Europe in the days when a kingdom was only as good as its
horses.
	   Spanish stallions were widely admired as the strongest and most
talented horses of the Middle Ages. Austria's ruling Habsburgs, who
went to Spain to buy horses for an empire that stretched across
much of Europe, decided to found a stud farm with them in the
village of Lipica _ or Lipizza in the Italian spelling _ in what is
now Slovenia.
	   Today, their meticulously trained descendants strut before
audiences under poker-faced riders in two-cornered hats,
performing, in the absence of war, to Chopin and Strauss.
	   Even if you don't know much about horses, you can admire their
pirouettes, piaffes and passages. But any inside knowledge will
help enhance your appreciation.
	   ``You need to be pretty keen on horses to be happy about paying
such prices'' _ from about 250-900 Austrian schillings (dlrs 20 to
dlrs 72), or about 200 schillings (dlrs 16) for standing room _
gripes one skeptical travel writer from Lonely Planet.
	   In one riveting demonstration, the Lipizzaners perform an
intricately choregraphed pas de deux to Mozart, only their
occasional snorts and foaming hinting at the difficulty.
	   In another, one horse after another bounds along on its back
legs _ ``like a demented kangaroo,'' in the words of the grudgingly
appreciative Lonely Planet.
	   The crowning move is the capriole, in which the horse leaps into
the air and flings its hind legs out vigorously, an exercise
requiring special strength and courage. Some in ther audience,
momentarily forgetting their regal environs, whoop in delight.
	   No one could doubt these magnificent beasts are the sole
authentic claimants to be pure Lipizzaners, the same Lipizzaners
that powered the Iberian war machine. Or could they?
	   When Austria staked its claim with the European Union in 1996 as
the original country of the Lipizzaner horses, none of the other
countries where some of the world's 3,000 Lipizzaners live disputed
it _ until last year. Then Italy, which got some horses from
Austria at the end of World War I, put in a belated claim for the
same title.
	   The Austrians were as amused as they were disgusted. It was as
as if Austria claimed to be the home of pasta.
	   Now the weighty matter will be argued before _ and decided by _
EU commissioners in Brussels. Oulehla of the Vienna Riding School
can't wait to show them the ancient breeding documents he says will
prove Austria's case.
	   ``It is more than ridiculous,'' Oulehla said.
	   The brouhaha has made headlines in Europe, but for Oulehla there
is one consolation.
	   ``The whole world,'' he says, ``now knows where the good
Lipizzaners live and are bred.''

Showcasing 150 years of artistic exchange

<TEXT>
	   BLERANCOURT, France (AP) _ It was a crumbling, 17th-century
chateau when an American heiress threw it open to shelter French
civilians fleeing their homes and fields devastated by the Great
War.
	   Today, the legacy of Ann Morgan is an airy museum showcasing the
diversity of 150 years of French-American artistic exchange.
	   Paintings, sculpture, wartime posters and photographs _ even a
model-T Ford ambulance driven by American volunteers _ attest to
the fascination France and the United States long have felt for
each other.
	   Set in this small village adjacent to World War I battlefields
about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Paris, the National Museum
for Franco-American Cooperation recently has undergone major
renovations.
	   Opened as a museum in 1989, the new layout paints a more
complete portrait of ``Miss Morgan,'' as she was known to the
locals, according to curator Anne Dopffer.
	   The daughter of John Pierpont Morgan shunned the life of a
millionaire heiress and moved to France to live with her companion,
Ann Murray Dike. She was 44.
	   The couple devoted their time to charitable work, mainly helping
wounded French civilians and soldiers brought in from the
battlefields nearby.
	   ``We've left one part of the facade as it was, terribly damaged
by artillery fire, to show how close the chateau was to the
front,'' Dopffer says.
	   After the war, Morgan and Dike aided locals trying to put their
lives back together, establishing schools, factories and a library
on wheels.
	   The four-year conflict left 1.4 million French dead, thousands
widowed, and rich farmland carved up by trenches, craters and bombs
still waiting to explode.
	   The couple opened schools to teach homemaking to girls and
trades to boys. On display are models used for instruction in baby
care, hygiene, physical fitness, and literacy.
	   The collection's most spectacular piece: an American Field
Service ambulance, the kind driven by volunteers such as John Dos
Passos and Ernest Hemingway, that could hold up to six soldiers at
a time.
	   ``Everybody laughed when the American volunteers arrived, but
they turned out to be very effective with those big cars, getting
the wounded out quickly,'' Dopffer says.
	   Many works were hauled out of storage and restored. Simeon
Fort's ``Fort de Yorktown'' was previously in the reserves of the
Chateau de Versailles.
	   Other notable paintings include portraits of George Washington
and Benjamin Franklin, Fernand Leger's surrealist view of the
Manhattan skyline, and Georges Catlin's 19th century ``Jeu de Balle
Indien,'' which portrays native American Indians playing a game
that scholars believe is an early form of field hockey.
	   Visitors to Blerancout interested in World War I history may
also tour ``Les Carrieres de Confrecourt'' _ nearby stone quarries
flanking the potato fields where the fighting raged, now classified
historical sites.
	   The soldiers would spend three days in the dark, damp tunnels
recouping before climbing back into the trenches above them. The
narrow, stone stairs that led so many to their deaths are still
visible.
	   The walls, dank and peeling, are chiseled with tributes to the
soldiers' native cities, fallen comrades and loved ones.
	   But the most compelling frescoes are the ones left unfinished.
	   ``To my beloved Berthe'' reads one inscription. The oval
medallion is blank, except for two holes that would have been her
eyes.

Whiling away summer days at the Delaware Water Gap

 &UR; By SARAH E. RICHARDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DELAWARE WATER GAP, Pennsylvania (AP) _ After the lukewarm
weather of early summer, it had turned hot and sticky in New York
City. I wanted out.
	   I had heard about the sweeping views and sylvan refuge of the
Delaware Water Gap at the edge of the Pocono plateau _ where we
could lose ourselves in the languor of the Delaware River. Where we
could hide in cool hemlock forests exploding with white and pale
pink rhododendron blossoms.
	   So my fiance and I went west.
	   After an hour-long sprint down I-80 to get into Dingmans
campground before the gates closed at 11 p.m., we arrived at what
looked like the outdoors section of a sporting goods store.
	   Blinding fluorescent lights bounced off vehicles flanked by
tents, dining canopies and antennae.
	   The humid night was pierced with the buzz of our neighbor's bug
zapper and the squeals of children at play.
	   In the morning, we realized we were next to the playground.
	   We met ranger Bill Halainen for a sneak preview of the
just-reopened, quarter-mile (a half-kilometer) trail to the
130-foot-high (40-meter-high) Dingmans Falls and its little sister
_ Silver Thread Falls.
	   The wheelchair-accessible boardwalk took us into a lush
microclime of somber hemlocks and verdant ferns, mosses and maples.
	   Halainen suggests coming the day after a heavy rain _ and before
the area becomes another Central Park ``with all the people moving
out here.''
	   We even found a measure of solitude at the popular Milford
Beach, where the major activity is gazing upon the canoes and
inflatable crafts that float down the lazy river.
	   When we got too hot, we'd cool ourselves in the green water
framed by sandstone ridges and more thick groves.
	   Despite the earlier irritations, we had discovered the magic of
the river. We mellowed.
	   Almost imperceptibly, afternoon became evening, and we decided
to try a hike. The Pocono and Walpack Valley environmental
education centers offered maps of trails in the area. But we
thought if we were going to expend some energy, we'd make a big
deal of it and head up to High Point State Park on the Kittatinny
Ridge just a short jaunt north.
	   Run by the National Park Service, the Delaware Water Gap
National Recreation Area straddles 40 miles (64 kilometers) of the
Delaware River in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
	   The area was almost transformed in 1960 by Army Corps of
Engineer plans to build a dam at Tocks Island just north of the Gap
for a 37-mile (60-kilometer) lake.
	   In 1978, the project was scrapped, and today the 70,000-acre
(28,328-hectare) park draws about four million visitors annually
but still offers enough seclusion sometimes not found in other
national parks.
	   Wildlife, including black bears, whitetail deer, osprey and
beaver, flourish, and bald eagles spend the winter here. It's also
a good place to see raptors and hawks during their migrations.
	   At 1,803 feet (550 meters), Kittatinny Ridge is the highest
point in New Jersey. Here there are rare white cedar bogs,
scattered wildflowers, stunning views of the upper Delaware Valley
and, of course, the Gap.
	   That night, we slept 11 hours.
	   Heading south, we passed swaying stalks of corn, red barns, and
gravelly backroads, including one of America's oldest commercial
roads _ Old Mine Road.
	   Along the way, I suggested a stop at Peters Valley Craft Center.
My companion, hesitant at first, actually enjoyed it. It was
refreshing that the store did not sell one piece of merchandise
that had been chiseled, carved, emblazoned, engraved or embroidered
with the words, ``Delaware Water Gap.''
	   Instead, we found a showcase for local talent and innovative
affordable art.
	   The other hard sell was Millbrook Village, which promised a
living history tour of a late 19th-century rural community.
	   Except for a lovely trio of elderly women who insisted on
explaining the finer points of rag rug-making, this free and
worthwhile stop was ours to explore.
	   We sat in the same uncomfortable church pews and listened to the
same awful organ music that the 19 families who lived there did. We
also wondered if the tonics advertised on the antique bottles in
the general store really worked.
	   And we thumbed through the old Sear's catalogue to see if we
needed anything.
	   Soon, it was late afternoon, and we hadn't even seen the star
attraction _ The Gap. But we finally got there, after a stop at
Kittatinny Visitor Center for a trail map and a detour in the quiet
borough of Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania, for an apple pie a la
mode at the local bakery/ice cream shop.
	   ``Where is it?'' I kept asking, knowing it was somewhere among
the hillsides that hover over I-80 snaking through the Gap's
celebrated ``S'' curve.
	   It took a hike up a rocky section of the Appalachian Trail to
see how the river plain lifted and folded and created a nice place
for us to mountain bike.
	   John McPhee describes the Gap from a lookout near Allamuchy, New
Jersey, in ``In Suspect Terrain'':
	   ``The eye was drawn eighteen miles (30 kilometers) west across a
gulf of air to the forested wall of Kittatinny Mountain, filling
the skyline of two states, its apparently endless flat ridgeline
broken only by one deep notch, which centered and arrested the view
and was as sharply defined as a notch in a gunsight: the Delaware
Water Gap, where the big river comes obliquely through the
mountain, like a thief through a gap in a fence.''
	   The traffic was less than tranquil, but the noise faded as we
made our way up the rhododendron-lined walkway. And there were
great lookout points to view the 1,200-foot (366-meter) rock faces
of Mount Minsi and Tammany, illuminated by the sunset.

Jackson gets big-ticket cultural exhibits

	   JACKSON, Mississippi (AP) _ Southern charm and Civil War history
were once the biggest draws of Jackson's tourist trade. Today, this
once laid-back Dixie city is turning heads with big-ticket cultural
attractions.
	   More than 200,000 people from around the world have visited the
city's major drawing card, the Splendors of Versailles exhibit,
since it opened in April.
	   Splendors recreates the opulence of the Palace of Versailles and
features royal treasures from the reigns of French kings Louis XIV
through Louis XVI. It's the only exhibit of its kind in the United
States.
	   The exhibit, which cost dlrs 10.7 million to stage in the
Mississippi Arts Pavilion in downtown Jackson, will run through
August.
	   Two years ago, Jackson was the lone city to offer ``Palaces of
St. Petersburg: Russian Imperial Style Exhibition,'' another large
exhibit in the line of the Splendors series. It drew more than
500,000 visitors from March to August in 1996.
	   The city also was host to the International Ballet Competition
from June 13-28, one of the top dance events in the world. More
than 80 dancers from 29 countries competed in the two-week long,
Olympic-style event.
	   The Museum of Southern Jewish Experience has also staged an
exhibit in Jackson called ``Alsace to America: Discovering the
Southern Jewish Heritage.'' The event, which opened in June and
runs through the end of August, is expected to draw more than
30,000 visitors. In addition, the Old Capitol Museum in Jackson
routinely features colorful exhibits of the region's history.
	   The state legislature appropriated dlrs 2 million to help bring
the Versailles exhibit to Jackson. Another dlrs 2 million was
raised by private donations and the Metro Jackson Convention and
Visitors Bureau kicked in dlrs 1 million. The remaining dlrs 5.7
million is expected to be raised by ticket sales and concessions.
	   Ticket prices are dlrs 15 for adults, dlrs 14 for senior
citizens and dlrs 5 for students.
	   Some are baffled as to why Jackson, and not more traditional
cultural centers such as Los Angeles and New York, managed to land
events that attract tourists by the bus load.
	   Wanda Wilson, marketing director for the convention and visitors
bureau, says tourists looking for cultural refinement at
less-than-budget-busting prices won't find a better bargain than
Jackson.
	   ``Jackson is a city rich in culture,'' she says. ``Hotels are
affordable, the location is accessible, and tours are interested in
going to cities where they can take advantage of more than one
thing. They can park their bus or car and walk to four exhibits
within blocks of each other.''
	   Location is also a factor. The city is at the crossroads of two
major interstate highways and is about equally distant from Atlanta
and Dallas. The city also is the midpoint between the gaming center
of Tunica in North Mississippi and the bustling casinos along the
Gulf Coast.
	   But Jack Kyle, executive director of the Mississippi Commission
for International Exchange, a nonprofit education and cultural
organization that is hosting the Versailles event, says Jackson
still has a way to go before taking on the title of cultural mecca.
	   ``I don't see Jackson on a competitive scale with other
cities,'' Kyle says. ``We don't have a world-class opera, we don't
have a world-class museum or a world-class orchestra.''
	   But Jackson's ``coup'' of the Versailles exhibit, he says, has
raised eyebrows worldwide.
	   ``In my travels, it has been something impressive,'' he says.
``Everyone is asking how a state as small as Mississippi has
endeavored to take on an exhibit like this.''
	   Complete with French impressionist paintings, sculptures and
replicas of the palace's rooms, the ``Splendors of Versailles'' has
earned the distinction as the American Bus Association's ``1998 Top
Event in the United States.''
	   ``The collection of items are phenomenal,'' says Ginger Croce,
director of marketing and membership at the ABA. ``Very few people
will have the opportunity to see so much in one place. The way it
is presented is basically a knockout.''
	   Two of the most eye-catching displays are a 12-foot (3.7-meter),
10-ton replica of an equestrian sculpture by Bernini and a
reproduction of the Hall of Mirrors, a room replete with gold
emblazoned glass and bronze sculptures.
	   There are even jewels designed by Louis XVI's unfortunate queen,
Marie Antoinette, who along with her husband was beheaded during
the French Revolution.
	   Kyle says the success of the Russian exhibit and the historical
connection between Mississippi and France _ the French were the
first Europeans to settle in the state _ helped Jackson secure the
rights to hold the ``Splendors'' series.

Toronto gears up for film festival and auto show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An international film festival and a touring
exhibit billed as the finest cars of the 20th century are coming to
Toronto.
	   Visitors to the auto show at the Canadian National Exhibition
Aug. 21-Sept. 7 can vote for their favorite ``Car of the Century''
from the 100 on exhibit.
	   The cars, ranging from the De Dion Quadricycle to the Audi A8,
were chosen by 135 professional automotive journalists and experts.
	   A preview of the collection is at the CNE Web site:
www.TheEx.com.
	   The Toronto International Film Festival, said by sponsors to be
one of the world's top four _ along with those in Venice, Cannes
and Berlin _ is scheduled for Sept. 10-19. About 300 films will be
shown on 19 screens in downtown Toronto.
	   The Canadian festival is ``audience friendly,'' sponsors say, in
contrast to the celebrity-studded Cannes extravaganza.
	   The festival's Web site is: www.bell.ca/filmfest. The box-office
phone number is (416) 968-3456.

 &UR; Showgirls must show less at Mississippi casinos
	   GULFPORT, Mississippi (AP) _ Showgirls dancing at two casinos on
the Mississippi Gulf Coast have been ordered to show less skin.
	   State Alcohol Beverage Control agents called for more modesty
after taking a peek at some of the Las Vegas-style shows.
	   Costumes were altered to add fabric to thongs at Biloxi's Grand
Theatre and the Grand Showroom in Gulfport, according to Jean
Herbert-Wiesenburg, spokeswoman for Grand Casino.
	   ``We will comply, but the regulations do not allow any latitude
and we will work vigorously to change these regulations,'' she
said.
	   ABC agent Mark Ford said his office suggested changes to some
costumes but did not file formal charges.
	   The agents were dispatched to the shows, he said, after patrons
complained.

 &UR; Bardstown bracing for seventh Kentucky Bourbon Festival
	   BARDSTOWN, Kentucky (AP) _ Learning how to spice up your food is
just one of the tempting offerings at the seventh annual Kentucky
Bourbon Festival.
	   There will be classes on cooking with bourbon, dining on such
foods aboard My Old Kentucky Home Dinner Train, bidding on premium
bottles of bourbon, and watching the World Championship Bourbon
Barrel Relay Races.
	   To top off the Sept. 17-20 festivities, a black-tie gala will
feature a bourbon-tasting tent at cocktail hour.
	   If you can still focus after all that, you can explore the area,
which includes four of the state's nine distilleries and the quaint
courthouse town of Bardstown, called ``The Bourbon Capital of the
World.''
	   For more information, call the Bardstown-Nelson County Tourist
and Convention Commission at (800) 638-4877.

 &UR; Restrictions proposed for Oregon's Hells Canyon
 &UR; Eds: Pitsburg in 4th graf is cq
	   BAKER CITY, Oregon (AP) _ Hells Canyon will be even more
primitive if a group of environmentalists and American Indians get
their way.
	   A plan submitted to the National Forest Service would close
about 75 percent of the roads in Hells Canyon National Recreation
Area and further reduce jet-boat use.
	   Called the Native Ecosystem Alternative, it also would limit
snowmobiles and allow some wildfires to burn themselves out. In
addition, sightseeing aircraft could fly no lower than 2,000 feet
over the canyon rim.
	   Recent restrictions closed parts of the Snake River to motorized
boats three days a week. The new proposal, drafted by the Hells
Canyon Comprehensive Plan Tracking Group, would allow only
non-motorized boats in the wild sections of the river from Hells
Canyon Dam to Pitsburg Landing.
	   The Forest Service will accept public comment on the plan until
Aug. 10.

	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The leader of Londonderry's
main Protestant brotherhood has appealed for a peaceful parade
through this mostly Catholic city Saturday.
	   The annual march of the 15,000-strong Apprentice Boys
organization, commemorating the city's successful defense from a
besieging Catholic army in 1689, normally fuels sectarian tensions
with Catholics or street clashes with police.
	   But in a hopeful sign for the future of British-ruled Northern
Ireland, the stubborn Protestant group agreed to impose
restrictions on this year's parade after indirect negotiations with
hard-line Catholics, who in turn canceled their plans to block the
parade.
	   Apprentice Boys leader Alistair Simpson urged would-be
Protestant rioters to stay out of Londonderry, warning that ``this
city will not accommodate or tolerate the use of violence or
intimidation to further or underscore any cause.''
	   As has always been the case since the Apprentice Boys began
marching here in the 1820s, the march will avoid directly entering
the predominantly Catholic neighborhoods to the west of the city
center's 17th-century stone walls.
	   But the Apprentice Boys agreed this time to restrict their march
in the two sections most objectionable to Catholics: when members
in the morning walk atop the walls within earshot of the nearest
Catholic homes below, and when marchers and fife-and-drum bands
circle the central square, called the Diamond, for lengthy periods
in the afternoon.
	   This time the Apprentice Boys agreed that no more than 1,000
members would march on the walls, and would be accompanied by only
one band, which would play no music on the western side of the
medieval battlements.
	   The group also agreed that only 13 senior members _ and not a
single bandsman _ would walk to the Diamond to lay wreaths at the
monument in its center to the local dead from World Wars I and II.
	   Last year violence flared when members of one Belfast band
kicked and punched a few Catholic men watching the parade in the
Diamond. Several hundred drunken Protestants then waged running
street battles with riot police between the Diamond and the
Fountain, the only Protestant enclave on Londonderry's west side.
	   As in past years, the parade will travel from the city's
Anglican cathedral inside the city walls across the broad River
Foyle to the predominantly Protestant east side of Londonderry.
	   The Apprentice Boys take their name from the 13 teen-age
apprentice workers who bolted the city gates as the approaching
army of Catholic King James II, the deposed king of Britain, sought
to take command of Londonderry's garrison.
	   The ensuing siege lasted 105 days, bringing the city's
Protestants to the brink of starvation before three English supply
ships arrived that August. The image of the lead vessel, the
Mountjoy, smashing through James' boom blocking the Foyle is
reproduced on many Apprentice Boys banners along with their
favorite slogan: ``No surrender!''

Anglican conference which pitted conservative against liberal

bishops closes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Three weeks of debate which has
pitted conservative against liberal bishops arguing over the course
of the Anglican Communion ends Saturday.
	   Although debates at the Lambeth Conference _ held every 10 years
_ ranged over issues such as homosexuality, Third World debt and
euthanasia, bishops often returned to a fundamental point: How to
interpret the Bible?
	   ``The wider our family becomes, the more you want to have
something in common,'' the Rt. Rev. Alexis Bilindabagabo, bishop of
Gahini, Rwanda, said during a debate in the conference's closing
week.
	   The complaint of Bilindabagabo and other bishops from the Third
World was that some Anglicans, particularly in the industrial
world, did not share his understanding of Scripture.
	   ``When you talk about sin in certain places, it has ceased to
exist,'' he said. ``When you talk about repentance in certain
places, it has ceased to exist.''
	   Interpreting the Scripture was at the center of debate over
ordaining practicing homosexuals and blessing same-sex unions.
Conservative bishops, pointing to condemnations of homosexuality in
the Bible, easily won the vote Wednesday to denounce homosexuality
as a sin.
	   Disputes between bishops are inevitable in an Anglican Communion
that is made up of fiercely independent churches extending around
the world and embracing disparate cultures and languages.
	   Although Anglicanism is rooted in the faith of the Church of
England, the Anglican Communion is now mainly an African church:
17.5 million members in Nigeria and 8 million in Uganda dwarf the
Church of England's 2 million active members _ roughly the size of
Anglican churches in Kenya, South Africa and southern India.
	   A common understanding of Scripture eluded the more than 700
bishops, but before Saturday's end of the conference they took some
small steps to promote cohesion.
	   Bishops voted to extend the powers of the primates of the
national churches, who meet every two years. They would be
permitted to intervene in exceptional cases and give guidelines
``on the limits of Anglican diversity.''
	   The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, serves as president
of the primates conference, but has no special powers comparable to
a Roman Catholic pope.
	   Anglican churches still have no common policy on ordaining women
priests, the big issue at Lambeth 10 years ago. But they all seem
to be learning to live with it, and the presence of 11 women
bishops from the United States, Canada and New Zealand provoked no
large protest.
	   The bishops did rebuke the Episcopal Church in the United
States, however, for setting a deadline for four reluctant bishops
to accept women priests in their dioceses, and said no bishops
should be forced to act against their consciences.
	   On Friday, the bishops adopted a resolution opposing euthanasia
but allowing one exception: that it might be permissible to
withdraw nourishment from someone in a permanent vegetative state.
	   The big issue this time, especially for the African bishops, was
Third World debt. The conference adopted a resolution calling for
debt payments to be sharply reduced so that payments are not made
``at great cost to human lives.''
	   Bishops also had an opportunity to personally lobby British
Prime Minister Tony Blair at a reception at Lambeth Palace, Carey's
official residence in London, and there was talk about organizing
protests to put the issue on the agenda on the Group of Eight
summit in Germany next year.
	   On Friday, Carey said debt would be a continuing concern. ``It
is a challenge not only to politicians and economists, but to the
churches as well,'' he said.
	   ``We are all affected by the problems which come with abject
poverty, international debt, persecution, with secularization and
technological change,'' Carey said.
	   The church doesn't have all the answers, he added, ``but we are
inviting others to hear us, and to join us in our continued
thinking.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Former Bogota mayor Andres Pastrana has
begun his presidency with a vow to end graft in government and
negotiate peace with a 34-year-old leftist insurgency.
	   ``Peace is the most urgent task on our country's agenda and the
best social contract we can make with the future,'' said Pastrana
in an inaugural address Friday from a rose-trimmed platform on the
steps of congress in Bogota's colonial central plaza.
	   Some 5,000 people, including seven heads of state, attended.
	   Colombians hope the 44-year-old former television journalist and
Conservative Party leader can restore authority to an office whose
clout was eroded under the scandal-plagued administration of
outgoing President Ernesto Samper.
	   Congress cleared Samper in 1996 of charges of knowingly
accepting dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions from cocaine
lords in his campaign against Pastrana four years ago. But
presidential authority suffered, Colombia's economy declined and
the rebel movement grew.
	   ``There will be no room in my administration for corruption. It
will not be tolerated nor pardoned,'' said Pastrana , who just
before the inauguration stopped to pray at the grave of his late
father, former president Misael Pastrana.
	   Pastrana also pledged to tame a spiraling budget deficit, to
make education more accessible to the poor, to make the political
system more democratic and to open ``an era of understanding and
trust'' in Colombia's relations with the United States, which were
badly strained over the Samper drug allegations.
	   A devastating rebel offensive this week highlights Pastrana's
paramount challenge as Colombia's new leader: making peace with an
insurgency that earns millions of dollars a month from the drug
trade in vast rural areas where it holds sway.
	   By their count, guerrillas killed at least 143 soldiers and
police and captured 133 others this week. The rebel force that
wiped out an anti-narcotics base in the southern town of Miraflores
had at least tacit support of local civilians who live off the
cocaine trade, the army says.
	   On Thursday, a rebel commander called the offensive a sendoff
for the ``criminal'' Samper administration. Pastrana said it would
not deter him from pushing for peace.
	   He already put himself at considerable risk when he met in the
jungle last month with Manuel Marulanda, head of the largest rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. With
the rebel movement and the drug trade so closely linked, Pastrana
must balance rebel demands with those of U.S. officials who provide
Colombia financial aid.
	   In meetings Monday with President Clinton and other top
officials in Washington, Pastrana says he proposed a shift in the
approach to battling narcotics. Colombia produces the bulk of the
world's cocaine and a growing share of its heroin.
	   Rather than relying solely on aerial eradication, Pastrana said
he wants the estimated 500,000 Colombians dependent on coca-growing
to switch to other crops. That could bring him into a head-on
collision with Washington drug warriors pushing for increased aid
to Colombia's military as part of a more hard-line approach.
	   ``Eradication is the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics
thinking. ... That can't be taken off the table,'' White House drug
czar Barry McCaffrey said Friday in Bogota before the inauguration.

	   SYDNEY, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The body of a German tourist visiting
Cape Breton was found Friday on a beach more than 65 kilometers (40
miles) southwest of this city.
	   The body of a male, approximately 40 years of age, was
discovered on the beach by a resident, said Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Constable Barry Mayo.
	   RCMP released few details about the incident, but said they are
regarding the death as suspicious.
	   The man, whose name was not released, was visiting the area with
another man and a woman. All were from Germany, Mayo said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Trapped survivors cried out for help, and
rescuers responded with calming phrases. Tall cranes wrestled with
massive chunks of concrete, their delicate work lit by powerful
search lights. Sparks flew from blow torches cutting twisted steel
rods.
	   Knowing at least some people were still alive gave a real
urgency to rescue efforts at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, where a
terrorist bomb exploded Friday.
	   ``It is really a dicey operation trying to make sure nothing
collapses on these people,'' said Surinder Bharaj, 40, an airport
worker who volunteered in the rescue.
	   After an hourlong effort, one person was pulled alive from the
wreckage. Rescuers could hear at least three other people calling
out from inside a debris-choked elevator shaft.
	   ``We are constantly in touch with them, they are not
panicking,'' Bharat said.
	   Within minutes of the Kenyan blast, a car bomb in the U.S.
Embassy's parking lot in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, produced similar
scenes.
	   Two-thirds of the embassy building was destroyed in the
explosion. The blast also started several fires that sent black
smoke into the sky where police helicopters patrolled.
	   ``The Fire Brigade arrived a half hour after the explosion. Some
people (from the embassy) were screaming. Some cried and most hid
behind the building in shock,'' said Abdalla Riyami, a Tanzanian
journalist.
	   In Dar es Salaam, seven people were killed, including five
Tanzanians who worked at the embassy, and 72 people were injured.
In Nairobi, at least 74 people, including eight Americans, were
killed and 1,643 injured.
	   After the Nairobi explosion, survivors wandered amid burning
cars and broken concrete.
	   ``People were running everywhere,'' said Paul Muhoho, a
journalist who had just left a news conference in one of the
stricken buildings.
	   The Nairobi explosion toppled the four-story Ufundi Cooperative
Building, which fell over onto part of the embassy. Hundreds of
rescue workers and residents scrambled through the wreckage,
listening for the crying of trapped victims.
	   Cheers greeted survivors, and rescuers cried out loudly when a
dead body was uncovered.
	   The streets were littered with paper, shoes and clothing, along
with the glass of shattered windows. The blast could be heard miles
(kilometers) away and blew out windows within 10 blocks of the
explosion.
	   Nearby vehicles, including a passing public bus, caught fire. A
Kenya Red Cross worker said at least eight bus passengers died in
the inferno.
	   Police helicopters flew overhead as shouting rescue workers did
what they could in the confusion immediately after the blast.
Thousands of spectators often blocked ambulances.
	   Later in the day, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi toured the
bombed area and assured Kenyans and foreigners of his government's
determination to find those responsible.

Britain seized assets in pre-state Israel, politician claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain seized assets from Jews in pre-state
Israel during World War II which would now be worth an estimated
400 million pounds (dlrs 600 million), a newspaper has reported.
	   Before and during the Holocaust, many European Jews
``transferred money to Palestinian banks prior to what they thought
would be their emigration,'' Yona Yahav, chairman of the Israeli
Knesset's banking subcommittee, was quoted as saying by the
London-based Jewish Chronicle on Friday.
	   The newspaper reported that Britain seized the funds under its
1939 Trading with the Enemy Act because many Jews who transferred
assets to Palestine banks were citizens of nations such as Germany
and Italy which were at war with Britain.
	   Yahav was quoted by the newspaper as saying that ``my estimate
is that this money was 20 million pounds at 1939 prices which would
correlate to about 400 million pounds (dlrs 600 million) today.''
	   In 1950, the newspaper quoted Yahav as saying, Israel's finance
minister signed an agreement with the British government which
allowed Britain to keep some of the confiscated funds in exchange
for lifting a ban on supplying gas, oil and arms to the new Israeli
state.
	   Yahav, the newspaper reported, said he was unclear what happened
to the remainder of the money, and suggested that the assets were
initially transferred to banks in Britain between 1940 and 1942.
	   Yahav was quoted as saying that he had raised the matter with
Lord Archer, who has been asked by the British government to design
a mechanism for compensating claimants of wartime assets taken by
the British.
	   ``Britain is not a poor country, it should shoulder this
burden,'' the newspaper quoted Yahav as saying.

Penske's Problems Continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM PUET &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ The Roger Penske team continued to
struggle in qualifying Friday at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car course for
the Miller Lite 200.
	   Al Unser Jr. was eighth fastest and Andre Ribeiro was 15th after
the first round of qualifications, which continue Saturday.
	   ``I spun off into the gravel pit but fortunately did not damage
(the car),'' Ribeiro said. ``There were a lot of stones in the car
and my crew did a great job of cleaning it up and getting me back
out on my second set of tires.''
	   Unser was more optimistic.
	   ``Being in the top eight after the first day of qualifying is
pretty good for me at Mid-Ohio. I'm looking forward to a good race
on Sunday, '' said Unser, the Mid-Ohio winner in 1994 and 1995.
	   Team Penske is by far the most successful in CART history with
99 victories and nine season championships since 1968. However, it
has been stuck on that figure for more than a year in its quest for
100.
	   The last Penske victory came on May 24, 1997, at Gateway
International Raceway near St. Louis, with Paul Tracy, who no
longer is with the team, driving.
	   The team's best finish this year was a second place by Unser in
Japan in March.
	   Penske cars have won 99 times in 401 starts, a 24.6 percentage
mark.
	   The Newman-Haas team is second with 53 victories, followed by
Patrick Racing with 38.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NEWMAN-HAAS MILESTONE: &LR;  This weekend's race is the 250th CART
event for Newman-Haas racing since its formation in 1983. The
team's lone victory this year came when Michael Andretti finished
first in the season opener at Homestead, Florida.
	   Newman-Haas has won three season championships, with Mario
Andretti taking the title in 1984, his son Michael in 1991, and
Nigel Mansell in 1993.
	   Assistant team manager John Tzouanakis is the only employee to
have been with the team, owned by actor Paul Newman and businessman
Carl Haas, from the beginning.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EAGLE DEBUT: &LR;  Dan Gurney's new Eagle chassis is making its
debut this weekend with rookie Alex Barron driving. It's been
tested at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, and at a small
oval in Putnamville, Indiana.
	   Barron was 25th of 28 drivers in Friday's qualifying.
	   ``Our first tests were very encouraging,'' Gurney said. ``We
feel that our best bet right now, ready or not, is to run it at
Mid-Ohio and see how it compares in combat.''
	   The car has been newly painted with red, white and blue feathers
reflecting its American heritage.
	   PJ Jones will be driving the Gurney Team's other car, a Reynard.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania blew apart buildings and buses Friday, trapping
people under slabs of concrete and twisted steel that rescuers
cleared with cranes, blow torches and bare hands.
	   At least 81 were killed and more than 1,700 injured, officials
said.
	   The suspected car bombings occurred 700 kilometers (450 miles)
from each other but just minutes apart, turning busy streets in two
African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel.
	   ``This appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very
well-planned attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs,'' National
Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington. No one
has claimed responsibility.
	   At least eight Americans died in Kenya, U.S. Embassy spokesman
Bill Barr said. The State Department said a child was among those
killed and five other Americans were missing.
	   The blast in Nairobi occurred at about 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT)
Friday, toppling a crowded building toward the embassy and a street
packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least 74 people were killed
and 1,643 wounded there, Red Cross and ambulance officials said.
	   Almost simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian capital
of Dar es Salaam was shattered by an explosion in an adjacent
parking lot. At least seven people were killed and 72 hurt,
officials said. It was not clear which bombing occurred first.
	   Car bombs were believed to have caused both blasts, Kenyan and
Tanzanian officials said. In Nairobi, the explosion left a large
blackened crater in a parking lot behind the embassy.
	   ``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under
the rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said as night fell. ``The longer
they're trapped, the less their chances for survival.''
	   Working into the night beneath floodlights, rescuers in both
capitals used pick axes, shovels and ropes to clear rubble.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the United States would
bring the terrorists to justice ``no matter what or how long it
takes.''
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
both countries as governments throughout the world condemned the
bombings and offered help.
	   The bombings were the first major international terror attacks
against the United States since a June 25, 1996, truck bomb outside
a housing complex in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans. More than
500 people were injured.
	   No Americans were believed killed in the bombing in Dar es
Salaam.
	   Friday's blast in Kenya toppled the four-story Ufundi
Cooperative building toward the embassy. Both the embassy, and the
Cooperative Bank House, which houses government and private
offices, was damaged.
	   The blast damaged at least 53 buildings, severed phone and power
lines, shattered windows as far as 10 blocks away, and sent black
smoke into the sky. Several people aboard two passing buses were
killed by shrapnel, witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers
lay scattered around.
	   Rescuers picked their way over a heap of twisted concrete and
metal trying to reach victims.
	   ``It is shocking. It is inhuman. I have never seen anything like
this,'' said Gideon Mutiso of St. John Ambulance.
	   British Maj. Jim Bain said his team of 25 British soldiers was
helping. ``It is a traumatic thing, even for trained soldiers,'' he
said.
	   Bodies hung out of windows in a charred bus as crumpled cars
smoldered nearby. Police helicopters hovered, some evacuating the
seriously injured.
	   ``There was a huge blast and everything was flying,'' said
witness Pastor Wachira. ``It was all confusion.''
	   Gesturing at dazed and bloody survivors crumpled on sidewalks
and in the road, witness Wilberforce Mariaria asked, ``How can
someone think of doing this kind of thing.''
	   Passersby helped rescuers, and drove the injured to four Nairobi
hospitals.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a car bomb exploded in the U.S. Embassy
parking lot, destroying nearly two-thirds of the embassy. At least
seven people were killed and 72 injured, officials said.
	   Five Tanzanians who worked at the embassy were among those
killed, a State Department official said.
	   Cranes gingerly peeled away layers of wreckage searching for
survivors.
	   Officials in the United States, Kenya and Tanzania refused to
speculate on who was responsible.
	   ``All we can say is if any of our people or embassies are being
targeted, we are not going to tolerate it,'' Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN.
	   The Islamic Jihad vowed last week to strike American interests
because some of its members were arrested in Albania and handed
over to Egypt, according to a report Thursday in Al-Hayat, a daily
Arabic language newspaper published in London.
	   Several groups around the world use the name Islamic Jihad. This
one is considered the successor to groups that assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
	   A man was seen being taken into custody at the Nairobi scene by
Kenyan police. Witnesses said he spoke Arabic, but police would not
comment and his connection, if any, to the case was not known.
	   Security was tightened at other U.S. embassies worldwide.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, was cut on the
lip and helped from the Cooperative Bank House, where she had just
given a news conference.
	   The newly confirmed ambassador to Tanzania, Charles Stith, had
not yet arrived in the country.
	   Neither country has a history of international terrorist
attacks. Both embassies were considered low risk, perhaps making
them attractive targets.
	   Compared with other African countries, foreigners can enter and
leave Kenya and Tanzania with relative ease, possibly making it
easier for terrorists to attack.

	   MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) _ American Steven Fossett lifted off
Friday on a daredevil bid to circle Earth in a balloon, his Solo
Spirit gleaming under a full moon as he embarked on one of
aviation's last great quests.
	   Fossett, who has swum the English channel and sailed solo across
the Pacific, was attempting a 20,000-mile (32,200-kilometer)
circling of the globe _ only the second known attempt from the
Southern Hemisphere.
	   Unbowed by three earlier failures, the 54-year-old Chicago
stockbroker clambered into his tiny yellow capsule and waved to
hundreds of cheering spectators at the launch site _ an open-air
soccer stadium in Mendoza, 600 miles (965 kilometers) west of
Buenos Aires.
	   Wearing a fleece-lined jacket, he turned propane burners to a
flashing roar and the 150-foot-tall (240-kilometer-tall) Solo
Spirit shot into the night sky.
	   His ground crew uncorked champagne bottles and cheered as the
ballon vanished beyond the foothills of the Andes.
	   With help of meteorologists in St. Louis, Fossett has charted a
course from west to east around the Southern Hemisphere in 14 to 18
days, mostly over oceans.
	   ``You have to believe that you are going to succeed with this
flight because a water landing would be very dangerous,'' Fossett
told The Associated Press. ``I'm using the same capsule I've used
for seven balloon flights, and it's seaworthy.''
	   Hundreds of people gaped as the silver-and-white balloon carry
Fossett aloft with two American flags fluttering. Only moments
before, Fossett had given the crowd a thumbs-up before ropes were
yanked away.
	   ``It's incredible! It's the biggest thing I've seen in my
life,'' exclaimed Andre Tricaza, a 12-year-old Argentine boy. ``One
day I would like to do something like this.''
	   Controllers said the balloon was expected to head east-southeast
from Mendoza, leveling off at approximately 21,000 feet (6,400
meters) as it crossed Argentina's famed pampas grasslands en route
to the South Atlantic.
	   From there he will attempt to fly across the South Atlantic,
brushing below the tip of South Africa en route to Australia,
before heading to South America.
	   Shaped like a giant light bulb, Solo Spirit stands 150 feet tall
and 80 feet wide with separate chambers for hot air and helium.
	   The attached 4-foot-by-7-foot (1.2 by 2 meter) capsule is made
of kevlar and carbon and has a bench to sleep on, communications
gear, a parachute, life raft and enough food to await sea rescue.
	   Teammates strapped forty 200-liter (52-US-gallons) tanks of
propane-ethane fuel aboard enough to last 28 days. They added a
laptop computer, rescue beacon and a satellite telephone.
	   ``This will be the most dangerous thing I've ever done,''
Fossett said before takeoff, noting his course would be 90 percent
over water.
	   Fossett's first attempt to circle Earth lasted just 36 hours,
cut short in January 1996 by winter storms.
	   A year later, he set the distance record: a 10,361-mile
(16,600-kilometer) six-day journey from St. Louis to Sultanpar,
India. He landed after running short of fuel while awaiting Libyan
clearance.
	   On Jan. 5, 1998, Fossett landed 5,802 (9,330 kilometers) miles
away from St. Louis, in a wheat field near Krasnodar, southern
Russia.
	   Two balloonists from Kansas had planned to travel a southern
route in 1988, also starting in Mendoza. But bad weather kept them
on the ground. John Petrehn and Rowland Smith eventually aborted
their round-the-world plans.
	   Temperatures outside will plunge below freezing as the balloon
and its unpressurized capsule are carried along anywhere from a
crawl to more than 100 mph (160 kilometers), often at altitudes
above 20,000 feet (6096 meters) .
	   Equipped with an oxygen mask, Fossett will be lucky to sleep
four hours each night, awakened by an alarm whenever he loses
altitude.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ If Iraq shows progress in cooperating with
U.N. weapons inspectors, the Security Council may consider
alleviating some sanctions, its president says _ even though the
top inspector wants a full accounting first.
	   Danilo Turk, the Council's president, said Friday that sanctions
were firmly in place _ for now. But he noted that the Council had
eased sanctions in other cases, and could consider doing so in
Iraq's case as well.
	   ``So far we didn't have enough progress which will justify any
alleviation of sanctions, but that does not mean that the situation
will remain the same forever,'' said Turk, the Slovene delegate to
the council. ``I mean, future progress could mean that.''
	   He said that there had been precedents when the Council had
lifted some sanctions when a subject complied with some demands.
	   Butler still insists that sanctions can only go once Iraq fully
complies with weapons inspectors.
	   ``It's their choice, they can give them to us and finish this
job or they can withhold them and make it slower,'' he told The
Associated Press at his office in U.N. headquarters in New York,
where he keeps a dismantled Iraqi scud missile guiding system on a
mantle.
	   ``...The withholding of the weapons from us, against the law,
actually suggests that they have another interest, which is to
retain some weapons capability,'' he said.
	   Butler said he understands the frustration and desperation of
the Iraqis after eight years of debilitating trade sanctions. He
said he backs Secretary-General Kofi Annan's initiative for a
``comprehensive review'' of the international community's
relationship with Iraq.
	   Butler's comments came a day after the 15-member Security
Council _ where he has faced criticism in the past _ unanimously
denounced an Iraqi decision freezing contacts with his inspectors
as ``totally unacceptable.''
	   The Council statement was a show of unity rare in recent months
_ but it failed to name any consequences, which Turk suggested was
the result of an erosion of support for the sanctions.
	   ``Sanctions are not as fashionable as they were,'' he said. ``In
the membership, there is a lot of opposition to the idea of
sanctions in general.''
	   Two of the council's permanent members, France and Russia, have
pending financial interests in Iraq and are anxious for an end to
sanctions.
	   Talks with Iraq broke down Monday, when Butler refused to
certify that Iraq has destroyed all of its weapons of mass
destruction. Butler is the head of the U.N. Special Commission,
which monitors chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   On Thursday, Iraq told weapons inspectors that they cannot check
new sites. The weapons inspectors have yet to test the ban.

Americans biggest surprise in final four of worlds

 &UR; Eds: First semifinal U.S. vs. Russia begins at 1545 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yugoslavia, Russia, Greece and the United
States are in the semifinals of the World Basketball Championship _
and nobody is more relieved to survive than the anonymous
Americans.
	   European champion Yugoslavia, which plays the best basketball
outside of the NBA and got silver to the Dream Team in the '96
Olympics, was supposed to make it. They did, 70-62 winners Friday
over Argentina.
	   Russia, silver medalists in the '94 worlds, was almost as good a
bet as the most experienced, physical team in the tournament. They
beat neighboring Lithuania 82-67.
	   Greece, the home team trying to match its last major basketball
medal _ a gold 11 years ago in the European championship _ was
rooted to a 69-62 victory over Spain by a boisterous 18,000 sellout
at Olympic arena.
	   The Americans? The no-name composite drafted when the NBA
players were locked out, won 80-77 when Italy's Carlton Myers
missed a 3-pointer with seven seconds left. The English-born
Italian finished with a tournament-high 32.
	   Russia was to face the United States Saturday with Greece
playing bitter Balkan rival Yugoslavia looking for its first win
against them since 1987.
	   ``There's all the expectation on us since we got here,'' said
center Gerard King, who had nine points. ``Some people said we
wouldn't get there. It's a sigh of relief, but we're not quite
there yet.''
	   Michael Hawkins topped the U.S. with 16 with 14 from Wendell
Alexis and 11 from Kiwane Garris.
	   ``There's a kind of sense of relief,'' said Garris. ``Back home
people are talking that we're not going to do this, not going to do
that. Now we've got to take advantage and go for the gold and not
just settle for a medal.''
	   The Americans trailed by seven with just under five minutes to
play and looked like they'd become the first U.S. team to finish
without a medal in the worlds since 1978. But Garris hit a
3-pointer, a closer shot from the wing and knocked down three key
free throws to help secure the victory.
	   ``A lot of teams get down like we were and it's like a dam
breaking,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But these guys stuck with it
against a very tough opponent. They (Italy) probably deserved to
win it. There's something special about this group of guys.''
	   Yugoslavia, without more top-line talent than anyone but the
U.S., is still the favorite to win it all Sunday and match its 1990
world title. The all-purpose 2.06 (6.9) Dejan Bodiroga had 14, one
of five in double figures. Juan Alberto Espil led Argentina with
18.
	   ``There are no easy opponents any longer,'' said coach Zeljko
Obradovic. ``Whoever thought this would be an easy game was proven
wrong.''
	   Russia's main man was 1.93 (6-4) guard Vassiliy Karassev who hit
31 and is rated by many as the best point in the tournament.
	   ``Today we had some bad moments on offense and somebody had to
take over,'' said Karassev, who made 9-of-14 shots from the field
and 12-of-14 free throws. ``Sometimes you're a hero when you do
that and sometimes you're not.''
	   Turned on by the flag-waving sellout, Greece built an early lead
and then held on in a tight second half.
	   Nikos Economou led Greece with 21 points and Ignacio Rodriguez
has 12 for Spain, which was looking for its first major medal since
a bronze in the '91 Euros. Spain's Alberto Herreros, who averaged
20.5 points to lead all players in preliminary play, had only six.
	   ``All the losses against Yugoslavia will give us extra
motivation,'' said Greek guard Aggelos Koronios. ``I think we have
the strength of win, but the four teams in the semifinals are
almost equal.''
	   In consolation games, former NBAer Andrew Gaze's 33 points led
Australia past Canada 88-71, while Brazil defeated Puerto Rico
76-64.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Finally back home, the New York Yankees resumed
their race toward history with an 8-2 win over the Kansas City
Royals on Friday in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.
	   David Cone (16-4) became the majors' first 16-game winner,
allowing two runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings, and Darryl
Strawberry hit his 21st homer, his ninth 30 at-bats. Tino Martinez
drove in three runs for the Yankees.
	   Pat Rapp (9-11) was tagged for eight runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3
innings as Kansas City lost its seventh straight against New York.
	   In Detroit, Raul Ibanez, recalled from the minors earlier in the
day, hit a tie-breaking two-run double in the eighth in the opener
of a twinight doubleheader.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez hit RBI doubles for the
Mariners, who have won three of four. Griffey, who has a
league-leading 41 homers, was 1-for-3 with two walks in his sixth
straight homerless game.
	   Heathcliff Slocumb (2-4) pitched 1 2-3 shutout innings, and Mike
Timlin got three outs for his eighth save. Dean Crow (1-1) was the
loser.

Rain, lightning wash out opening round of Burnet Senior Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COON RAPIDS, Minnesota (AP) _ A one-two punch of rain and
lightning washed out the opening round of the Coldwell Banker
Burnet Senior Classic on Friday.
	   Tournament officials said the 54-hole Senior PGA Tour event
would be shortened to 36 holes and would conclude as planned with
18 holes Saturday and Sunday.
	   For Friday's round to have counted, officials said at least half
of the field of 78 golfers had to finish. Just 27 golfers were in,
with 51 still on the course, when the day's second suspension of
play was called at 4:57 p.m.
	   With lightning and thunder still rumbling, officials made the
decision at 6:30 p.m. to terminate the round.
	   The weather-plagued opening day was marred by a 2 1/2-hour rain
delay just after noon. Tournament officials said 2.38 inches (6
centimeters) of rain fell in just 45 minutes on the Bunker Hills
Course. Play resumed at 2:45 p.m., but was suspended against at
4:47 p.m. due to lightning and more threatening conditions.
	   The rain didn't hurt the scoring, and the course record of 64
appeared to be in jeopardy before play was halted. George Archer
was in the clubhouse with a 6-under-par 66 and three others were at
6-under in their rounds, Isao Aoki and David Graham through 13
holes and Vicente Fernandez through 12.
	   Archer bogeyed his first hole, then rebounded with seven
birdies, including three on his last four holes. It was his lowest
round on tour this season.
	   John Mahaffey was in the clubhouse at 5-under 67. The top two
players on the senior tour money list this year, defending champion
Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan, were both at 5-under through 11 holes
when play was halted.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs appear to have driven the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army from most of their remaining
strongholds in the strategic central region of the embattled
Serbian province.
	   On Friday, serb force entered the village of Likovac, the former
rebel headquarters in the region, where U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
met last week with KLA commanders
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   This time his words appeared to be borne out by events on the
ground.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into Albania, where the rebels maintain
sanctuaries.
	   The Serb police official said that the remaining reports of
fighting are only ``final mopping-up operations'' against ethnic
Albanian militants and their remaining pockets of resistance.
	   In Likovac, Serb troops moved from house to house under
sniperfire, clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the
village and setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, state television reported that
71 Kosovo Albanian refugees had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours.
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Rugova's aides said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who expressed support for his ``peaceful
policy'' in resolving the crisis. The statement made no mention of
any promise of U.S. military intervention.
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates roughly 200,000 people have
fled to Kosovo's woods and hills, and many of them lack food, water
and other essentials. Officials worry that searing summer
temperatures and a lack of hygiene could cause disease to set in.
	   NATO military exercises involving also troops from non-member
countries in eastern Europe are scheduledto start in Albania on
Aug. 17.
	   A NATO spokesman at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
Friday in Brussels said plans for possible military intervention in
Kosovo were nearly complete.
	   But with the KLA clearly on the run, it appeared likely that
fighting could die simply because the Serbs have gained the upper
hand.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.

Blind young pianist says he understands Beethoven _ but prefers
</HEADLINE>
Bach
 &UR; By LEE CHUAN-HSIEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) _ The winner of Taiwan's youth piano
competition thinks he understands Beethoven pretty well. But he
prefers Bach.
	   Hsieh Yun-lun was born blind and feels that gives him a clue to
the turmoil Beethoven felt _ and expressed in his music _ as he
lost his hearing.
	   However, in order to win this year's national youth piano
contest, Yun-lun chose the more measured tones of Bach's Italian
Concerto.
	   The choice was fitting for a calm and happy boy living with his
family in a cramped middle-class apartment in this southern
Taiwanese city. He said he thinks of himself as a normal
12-year-old _ whose sense of sound just happens to be sharp enough
to learn piano by listening to tapes and to win the occasional
video game from his brother.
	   He wishes others would regard him as a normal kid, too.
	   Taiwan has found that a bit hard to do. Business support for
musicians _ even the best professionals _ is rare here, and the
system of care for the handicapped lags behind the island's
economic development. But Yun-lun caused a sensation when he won
the annual piano competition for 8-12 year-olds.
	   Smiling, Yun-lun said he considers himself fortunate because he
didn't go through the trauma of losing his eyesight.
	   Surgery when he was 4 months old failed to cure a retina
problem. His parents still hope that medical advances may one day
give him his sight.
	   He's grateful to his parents, who started paying for piano
lessons when he was 5 years old because of the interest he showed
in his brother's lessons.
	   ``Beethoven lost his hearing after he was 30, and his music is
so fretful,'' Yun-lun said. ``I didn't go through the unhappy
moments of losing my eyesight. So far, I feel I'm no different than
others.''
	   Therefore, he said, he prefers Bach's music, which he said is
``not too tempestuous and not too romantic _ just about right.''
	   Twice a week, Yun-lun's parents take turns making the 15-minute
drive on a motorbike to his piano teacher's home, where the boy
tapes his lesson. During the week, he listens to it repeatedly and
memorizes it. He spends eight hours a day listening and playing the
piano. In between, Yun-lun is taking lessons in composition and
violin.
	   Juanelva Rose, an American piano professor who has given the boy
lessons, said Yun-lun hasn't reached the top level yet for his age.
However, there is room yet for improvement because he has a good
musical sense, she said.
	   Besides music, Yun-lun is learning to deal with daily life.
	   He does dishes and sweeps the floor in the flat, where the many
trophies he won from music contests are scattered over TV and CD
racks.
	   He learns the shapes of articles by touching them and recreating
them with clay. He likes math and science. Relying on his sharp
ears, he even plays basketball and video games with his brother.
	   Because his parents want him to grow up just like any other boy,
he will enter a regular junior high school this fall.
	   Yun-lun said he has been upset in the past by people picking on
him in parks or at school because of his handicap.
	   ``I tried to let them know I am no different from them, and
slowly they accepted me,'' he said.
	   His mother, Hsiao Fu-ying, an elementary school teacher, said
Yun-lun will be sent abroad to study music when he gets a little
older and can better take care of himself.
	   ``We won't expect him to become a top musician,'' she said. ``We
just want to guide him out of his small world with music.''

Center of Mexico's No. 2 city evacuated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Some 15,000 people fled or were
evacuated from downtown on Friday after diesel oil escaped from a
train into the city drains, creating a fear of explosion that
panicked many.
	   As alarm sirens screamed, police and civil defense workers
ordered four blocks evacuated. But people in many surrounding areas
also fled, leaving some 6,000 stores and venders' stalls closed.
	   Much of the city center, including the Plaza de los Mariachis
and the busy San Juan de Dios market, was almost emptied.
	   ``Since the explosion of April 22, 1992, occurred, we are afraid
of everything,'' said businessman Salvador Sanchez, one of those
who went running from his stall at news of the diesel leak.
	   The 1992 blast, blamed on gasoline leaking from a refinery into
the sewers, killed more than 200 people, drove more than 15,000
from their homes and left a line of destruction for about 20 blocks
through this city of 1.6 million.
	   Officials said a locomotive at the train station suffered an
accident at 10:45 a.m., (1445 GMT) spilling more than 1,000 gallons
(3,785 liters) of diesel into the city drains.
	   The locomotive's owners, Ferromex, did not inform city officials
until about 2 p.m., (1800 GMT) when residents had already begun
calling emergency numbers to report a strong odor from the sewers.
	   Many of the city's famed mariachis remained in the plaza named
for them awaiting customers, but few passed.
	   ``We did not leave here because they have not asked us to, but
what happened is hurting us because now there are no tourists,''
said musician Juan Perez.
	   Fire Chief Trinidad Lopez Rivas said there was never an imminent
danger of explosion.
	   Many of his firefighters spent five hours pumping the diesel
from the drains. They were declared clear at 8 p.m (2400 GMT).

<TEXT>
	   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) _ The winner of Taiwan's youth piano
competition thinks he understands Beethoven pretty well. But he
prefers Bach.
	   Hsieh Yun-lun was born blind and feels that gives him a clue to
the turmoil Beethoven felt _ and expressed in his music _ as he
lost his hearing.
	   However, in order to win this year's national youth piano
contest, Yun-lun chose the more measured tones of Bach's Italian
Concerto.
	   The choice was fitting for a calm and happy boy living with his
family in a cramped middle-class apartment in this southern
Taiwanese city. He said he thinks of himself as a normal
12-year-old _ whose sense of sound just happens to be sharp enough
to learn piano by listening to tapes and to win the occasional
video game from his brother.
	   He wishes others would regard him as a normal kid, too.
	   Taiwan has found that a bit hard to do. Business support for
musicians _ even the best professionals _ is rare here, and the
system of care for the handicapped lags behind the island's
economic development. But Yun-lun caused a sensation when he won
the annual piano competition for 8-12 year-olds.
	   Smiling, Yun-lun said he considers himself fortunate because he
didn't go through the trauma of losing his eyesight.
	   Surgery when he was 4 months old failed to cure a retina
problem. His parents still hope that medical advances may one day
give him his sight.
	   He's grateful to his parents, who started paying for piano
lessons when he was 5 years old because of the interest he showed
in his brother's lessons.
	   ``Beethoven lost his hearing after he was 30, and his music is
so fretful,'' Yun-lun said. ``I didn't go through the unhappy
moments of losing my eyesight. So far, I feel I'm no different than
others.''
	   Therefore, he said, he prefers Bach's music, which he said is
``not too tempestuous and not too romantic _ just about right.''
	   Twice a week, Yun-lun's parents take turns making the 15-minute
drive on a motorbike to his piano teacher's home, where the boy
tapes his lesson. During the week, he listens to it repeatedly and
memorizes it. He spends eight hours a day listening and playing the
piano. In between, Yun-lun is taking lessons in composition and
violin.
	   Juanelva Rose, an American piano professor who has given the boy
lessons, said Yun-lun hasn't reached the top level yet for his age.
However, there is room yet for improvement because he has a good
musical sense, she said.
	   Besides music, Yun-lun is learning to deal with daily life.
	   He does dishes and sweeps the floor in the flat, where the many
trophies he won from music contests are scattered over TV and CD
racks.
	   He learns the shapes of articles by touching them and recreating
them with clay. He likes math and science. Relying on his sharp
ears, he even plays basketball and video games with his brother.
	   Because his parents want him to grow up just like any other boy,
he will enter a regular junior high school this fall.
	   Yun-lun said he has been upset in the past by people picking on
him in parks or at school because of his handicap.
	   ``I tried to let them know I am no different from them, and
slowly they accepted me,'' he said.
	   His mother, Hsiao Fu-ying, an elementary school teacher, said
Yun-lun will be sent abroad to study music when he gets a little
older and can better take care of himself.
	   ``We won't expect him to become a top musician,'' she said. ``We
just want to guide him out of his small world with music.''

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Top-seeded Pete Sampras was pushed to a first-set
tiebreaker before cruising to a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory Friday over
Germany's Tommy Haas to reach the quarterfinals of the rain-plagued
du Maurier Open tennis tournament.
	   Sampras, who needs to win this event to maintain his No. 1 world
ranking, appeared sluggish, tired and frustrated against Haas after
a three-hour rain delay.
	   Sampras was to play eighth-seeded Andre Agassi in a quarterfinal
Friday night. Rain Thursday forced tournament organizers to pack
Friday's schedule.
	   Agassi, who has won this tournament three times, advanced with a
2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over 10th-seeded Croatian Goran Ivanisevic,
who lost the match when he double-faulted on match point.
	   Third-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia and No. 7 Tim Henman of
England advanced to Saturday's semifinals.
	   Rafter defeated No. 5 Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2 Friday
night, while Henman beat unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
	   Earlier Friday, Rafter beat fellow Australian Mark
Philippoussis, the 14th seed, 6-3, 6-3.
	   After committing numerous unforced errors in the first set
against Haas, Sampras took control of the match with an early break
in the second set.
	   ``It's just a few points that cost me the first set,'' Haas
said. ``In the second he had the momentum going, and it's tough to
come back against an opponent like Pete.''
	   Haas, ranked 41st in the world, attacked Sampras with passing
shots that left the American standing at the net.
	   Sampras came up with big shots at the right time. He served 11
aces and had 34 winners to 18 for Haas, but made 21 unforced error
to the German's 19.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has the world's second highest level
of cultural plurality, with 62 ethnic groups that each speak their
own language, according to a Mexico City ethnologist.
	   Some 10 million people make up the variety of indigenous groups
spread across 20 of Mexico's 32 states, Jose Iturriaga, director of
the Popular Cultures institute, told the government news agency
Notimex.
	   The number of living languages is second only to India, which
has 72, Notimex reported Thursday. Mexico ranks ahead of China,
which has 52 living languages.
	   Iturriaga said the institute is working to keep several of
Mexico's languages from dying out, such as the Quiligua language
which is spoken by only a half-dozen people in Baja California
state.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Federal officials staged raids in 23 cities,
seizing more than 200,000 counterfeit tapes, trousers, watches and
other goods, the attorney general's office announced Friday.
	   ``These actions give continuity to the permanent program against
piracy,'' the agency said in a news release.
	   It said 56 people were arrested in the raids, which ranged from
the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez to the southern cities of
Oaxaca, Villahermosa and Merida.
	   Goods seized included 172,680 audiocassettes, 1,770 video
cassettes, 20,558 items of clothing, 350 watches and 428 electrical
goods.

	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Police and family members are searching
for a second grade school teacher from Virginia last seen in Nassau
three weeks ago.
	   Lori Fogleman, 32, of Richmond, Virginia, was vacationing in
Nassau when she went missing on July 20, according to her husband,
A.J. Winstead. She was visiting a friend working at the Atlantis,
Paradise Island construction site where a resort is being built.
	   Police are also searching for the silver Nissan Sentra rental
car she was driving when last seen.
	   Winstead said her luggage and personal belongings were left in
her room at the Holiday Inn on Paradise Island, and a purse,
believed to belong to Fogleman, was found near the exclusive Ocean
Club Resort, also on Paradise Island.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of the
Catholic faithful gathered Friday at the church of St. Cayetano,
the patron saint of work, to pray for jobs.
	   Throngs came from all over the country and many queued for days
to file past the statue of the saint, offering a brief prayer and
attending Masses, according to local media reports.
	   Instead of flowers and candles for the saint, people brought
donations of clothing and food to be distributed among the poorest.
	   Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio celebrated Mass and asked ``each one to
be a St. Cayetano for the others, sharing work and bread.''
	   Massive annual processions to the church of St. Cayetano in the
Liniers district on the western edge of the capital began some four
years ago, as unemployment soared.
	   Nearly 3.4 million people out of a population of 36 million are
unemployed or underemployed, according to recent government
figures.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Police shot and killed three men
who were allegedly attempted to break into a police station and
free five prisoners, police said Friday.
	   Officers opened fire on eight people who were raiding the police
station in Curitiba, 420 miles (680 kms) south west of Rio late on
Thursday, said police investigator Sergio Peres by phone.
	   Three of the eight were killed and the others fled.
	   The prisoners, who did not escape, are accused of carrying out a
bank raid four days ago, Peres said.
	   They are suspected of being part of a crime ring which has
staged raids across Brazil, he added.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a growing Tutsi rebellion
that appears to be sweeping into Congo's dense jungle interior,
President Laurent Kabila traveled to Zimbabwe in search of support
to keep his 14-month-old regime from unraveling.
	   But within hours of his departure on Friday, Kabila's troops
rampaged through parts of Kinshasa, looting shops and harassing
ethnic Tutsis.
	   ``In the army the soldiers are very unhappy,'' said a senior
police commander with the city's intelligence branch. The officer,
who responded to calls to stop the looting, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Kinshasa was tense on Friday with troops roaming through the
streets, questioning pedestrians and manning checkpoints at
intersections.
	   Kabila's decision to leave Kinshasa comes just days after
renegade troops waged gun battles in two army barracks on the
city's west side.
	   In Zimbabwe, Congo President Laurent Kabila threatened Friday
that his country will ``hit back'' if neighboring Congo attacked
its forces.
	   Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu arrived in
Zimbabwe for a quickly called meeting of seven regional heads of
state to deal with the conflict in the former Zaire, now known as
Congo.

Vatican criticism of Israel on Jerusalem sign of growing tension
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING with AP bug &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A decision by Israel to broaden
Jerusalem's jurisdiction ``is causing great disquiet,'' the Holy
See said this week, a sign of escalating tensions between Benjamin
Netanyahu's government and the Vatican.
	   The single-page ``Non-Paper on Jerusalem'' was published
Thursday by the Holy See's observer mission to the United Nations,
and expressed its support for a decision last month by the Security
Council to criticize Israel for plans to expand its jurisdiction.
	   The expansion, announced in June, extends municipal services to
several West Bank settlements and incorporates some Israeli towns
within the Jerusalem municipality _ partly to maintain the Jewish
majority.
	   That move ``is causing great disquiet,'' the Holy See statement
said. ``It certainly does not favor a dialogue aimed at a solution
of the problem of the Holy City.''
	   The statement was distributed to other U.N. missions on July 20,
but not published until Thursday, when it was handed to reporters.
The Vatican mission at the United Nations rarely liaises with the
press.
	   The mission spokesman, Monsignor George Panikulam, refused on
Friday to say why the statement was handed to the press now, but it
appeared linked to Vatican anger at Israel for interfering in its
bishop selection process.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged this week
that he had tried to block the appointment of a Palestinian refugee
as the archbishop of Galilee.
	   ``I discussed the nomination with the Vatican's representative
in Israel, and expressed my concern regarding the politicization of
nominations of the church,'' Netanyahu said.
	   That led the Vatican to sharply remind Israel on Friday that it
has the right to name bishops without outside interference.
	   It said the appointment of Butros Mualem, a Palestinian refugee
now serving as a bishop in Brazil, had been blessed by Pope John
Paul II and that Greek Catholic bishops had nominated him without
any outside interference.
	   The Israeli paper Maariv said the prime minister had made it
clear to leaders of both the Greek Catholic church and the Vatican
that he wanted Emil Shufani, a bishop considered friendly to the
Israeli government, for the post.
	   Security officials said there were fears Mualem might incite the
Catholic community. The Greek Catholic coMTt was ``almost unheard of'' and could jeopardize Israel's
relations with the Vatican.
	   After years of cool relations, Israel and the Vatican forged
diplomatic ties in 1993, during the regime of the late Yitzhak
Rabin.
	   At the time, the peace process was flowering and the Vatican
could finally relax its concerns about how warming relations with
Israel would affect Christian minorities in the Arab world.
	   The near-collapse of the peace process has raised Vatican
concerns. In addition, attempted Jewish settler appropriations of
properties in Jerusalem _ some owned by Christians _ have also
exacerbated relations.
	   Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital; the Palestinians
would like to set up the capital to a planned state in eastern
Jerusalem. Most of the world _ including the United States and the
Vatican _ does not recognize Israel's sovereignty throughout all of
Jerusalem.

	   Houston wins 9-0 over Phillies
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Randy Johnson shut down Philadelphia with a
five-hitter for his first NL shutout and drew a record crowd for a
regular-season game in the Astrodome, leading Houston to a 9-0
victory over the Phillies on Friday night.
	   Johnson (2-0) helped attract 52,071 fans, getting thunderous
cheers when he was introduced with the starting lineup. He was
obtained July 31 and pitched seven innings against Pittsburgh last
Sunday in his first NL game since 1989.
	   Johnson, making just his 12th NL start, struck out eight and
walked one, getting his third shutout of the season and 20th of his
career.
	   Jeff Bagwell homered twice to raise his season total to 25. Mike
Welch (0-2) was the loser.
	   In Cincinnati, Reggie Sanders, Sean Casey and Aaron Boone hit
bases-loaded doubles in a 12-run sixth. It was the largest shutout
win in the majors since Florida won 17-0 at Colorado on Sept. 17,
1995.
	   Cincinnati sent 16 batters to the plate against Brad Woodall
(5-6) and two relievers. The Reds got four at-bats with the bases
loaded and produced a walk and three doubles as they pushed the
lead to 14-0.
	   It was Cincinnati's biggest inning since it scored 14 times in
the first against Houston on Aug. 3, 1989.
	   Barry Larkin started the big inning with a solo homer. Sanders
and Eddie Taubensee hit solo homers in the third.
	   Pete Harnisch (8-5) got his first victory since June 26.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 6, Expos 4 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Jay Bell hit his 15th homer, and Andy Fox had a
two-run double as Arizona won for the seventh time in 10 games.
	   Brian Anderson (8-10) allowed four runs and eight hits in 7 1-3
innings, and Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for his 21st save.
	   Shane Andrews homered for Montreal. Javier Vazquez (3-11) took
the loss.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs appear to have driven the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army from most of their remaining
strongholds in the strategic central region of the embattled
Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   On Friday, serb force entered the village of Likovac, the former
rebel headquarters in the region, where U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
met last week with KLA commanders
	   A top Serb police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offensive in Kosovo, which had uprooted nearly 200,000
people and left hundreds dead, was ``nearly over.''
	   This time his words appeared to be borne out by events on the
ground.
	   Elsewhere in the region, KLA troops were fleeing from advancing
Serb forces. Serb sources said most of the fighting was now
centered on escape routes into Albania, where the rebels maintain
sanctuaries.
	   The Serb police official said that the remaining reports of
fighting are only ``final mopping-up operations'' against ethnic
Albanian militants and their remaining pockets of resistance.
	   In Likovac, Serb troops moved from house to house under
sniperfire, clearing out the last pockets of resistance in the
village and setting fire to Albanian houses and haystacks.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, state television reported that
71 Kosovo Albanian refugees had crossed into Albania in the last 24
hours.
	   ``We are demanding international protection and we would
appreciate any international intervention to stop the Serb war
machinery,'' ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   Rugova's aides said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who expressed support for his ``peaceful
policy'' in resolving the crisis. The statement made no mention of
any promise of U.S. military intervention.
	   The U.N. refugee agency estimates roughly 200,000 people have
fled to Kosovo's woods and hills, and many of them lack food, water
and other essentials. Officials worry that searing summer
temperatures and a lack of hygiene could cause disease to set in.
	   NATO military exercises involving also troops from non-member
countries in eastern Europe are scheduledto start in Albania on
Aug. 17.
	   A NATO spokesman at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
Friday in Brussels said plans for possible military intervention in
Kosovo were nearly complete.
	   But with the KLA clearly on the run, it appeared likely that
fighting could die simply because the Serbs have gained the upper
hand.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   On another front, Slovenia's delegate to the United Nations said
Friday he would use the country's presidency of the Security
Council this month to press for action on violence by Serbian
forces in Kosovo.
	   A Western diplomat in New York said support for Yugoslavia had
eroded because of Serbian excesses, a situation that might break
the impasse on sanctions when the Security Council considers Kosovo
next week.

700 evacuated as bad weather continues to hit Australia's southeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ More than 700 people were evacuated
from their homes in southeastern Australia Saturday as the worst
floods in history threatened to swamp the region.
	   The Macquarie River was expected to peak at just inches lower
than the record flood of 1823, a State Emergency Service spokesman
said. The State Emergency Service was using more than 30,000
sandbags to stem the flow.
	   The rising levels forced residents from their homes in the town
of Bathurst, in central state of New South Wales.
	   Metropolitan Sydney, Illawarra and the Hunter Valley were also
severely affected, with some residents in low-lying regions of the
Hunter also forced to evacuate their homes.
	   A spokesman said work was continuing to restore power to about
5,000 households still affected in Sydney's west, the southern
highlands and south coast regions.
	   On Friday in Sydney, a low pressure system centered east of the
city dumped more than eight inches (214 millimeters) of rain in 24
hours.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Terrorist bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania blew apart buildings and buses Friday, trapping
people under slabs of concrete and twisted steel that rescuers
cleared with cranes, blow torches and bare hands.
	   At least 82 were killed and more than 1,700 injured, officials
said as dawn broke Saturday. Dozens of people were still missing,
however, and the death toll was expected to rise, they said.
	   The suspected car bombings occurred 700 kilometers (450 miles)
from each other but just minutes apart, turning busy streets in two
African capitals into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel.
	   ``This appears to have been a very well-coordinated, very
well-planned attack _ clearly not the work of amateurs,'' National
Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington. No one
has claimed responsibility.
	   At least eight Americans died in Kenya, U.S. Embassy spokesman
Bill Barr said. The State Department said a child was among those
killed and five other Americans were missing.
	   The blast in Nairobi occurred at about 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT)
Friday, toppling a crowded building toward the embassy and a street
packed with cars, trucks and buses. At least 74 people were killed
and 1,643 wounded there, Red Cross and ambulance officials said.
	   Almost simultaneously, the U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian capital
of Dar es Salaam was shattered by an explosion in an adjacent
parking lot. At least seven people were killed and 72 hurt,
officials said. It was not clear which bombing occurred first.
	   Car bombs were believed to have caused both blasts, Kenyan and
Tanzanian officials said. In Nairobi, the explosion left a large
blackened crater in a parking lot behind the embassy.
	   ``It is horrific to hear moaning, sighs and whimpers from under
the rubble when we can do so little to reach victims quickly,'' Red
Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe said as night fell. ``The longer
they're trapped, the less their chances for survival.''
	   Working into the night beneath floodlights, rescuers in both
capitals used pick axes, shovels and ropes to clear rubble.
	   After an hourlong effort, one person was pulled alive from the
wreckage to cheers from the gathered crowd.
	   Another rescue attempt ended tragically.
	   Kenyan Sgt. David Kambi, an army engineer, said he struggled for
four hours to free a 40-year-old man named Gitau whose chest was
weighed down by a slab of concrete.
	   ``I told him, `Gitau we're going to help you,''' Kambi said.
``But as we were getting close to him, he said, `Help me, help me.
I have gone now.' Then he died.''
	   Rescuers could hear at least three other people calling out from
inside a debris-choked elevator shaft, plus one other nearby.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the United States would
bring the terrorists to justice ``no matter what or how long it
takes.''
	   The United States rushed medical supplies and investigators to
both countries as governments throughout the world condemned the
bombings and offered help.
	   The bombings were the first major international terror attacks
against the United States since a June 25, 1996, truck bomb outside
a housing complex in Saudi Arabia killed 19 Americans. More than
500 people were injured.
	   No Americans were believed killed in the bombing in Dar es
Salaam.
	   Friday's blast in Kenya toppled the four-story Ufundi
Cooperative building toward the embassy. The heavily fortified
embassy and the Cooperative Bank House, which houses government and
private offices, also were damaged.
	   The blast damaged at least 53 buildings, severed phone and power
lines, shattered windows as far as 10 blocks away, and sent black
smoke into the sky. Several people aboard two passing buses were
killed by shrapnel, witnesses said. Bloodied clothing and papers
lay scattered around.
	   Rescuers picked their way over a heap of twisted concrete and
metal trying to reach victims, while security officials stretched
out coils of barbed wire to keep spectators at bay.
