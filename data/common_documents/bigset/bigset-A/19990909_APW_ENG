<HEADLINE> House GOP Introduces HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of House Republicans introduced their  
version of HMO legislation Thursday, expressing frustration with 
GOP leaders who have not endorsed their bill or offered a patient 
rights alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to happen whether the leadership decides they like  
this bill or not,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., whose bill 
allows new lawsuits against HMOs but only under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP lawmakers suggested they would sign on with Democrats to  
force the issue to the floor if Republican leaders do not agree to 
support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that can hurt us politically,'' said Rep.  
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``I hope our leadership got the message. Do 
the math. They're losing control of this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, with a slim majority in the House, are struggling  
to develop a strategy for addressing patient rights in the era of 
restrictive health maintenance organizations and other managed care 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP hold 222 seats in the 435-member House, with 211  
Democrats and an independent who usually votes with the Democrats; 
there is one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, 20 Republicans have signed onto legislation  
co-sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Charles Norwood, 
R-Ga. That bill is backed by Democratic leaders and President 
Clinton, and appears to have more than enough support to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for an alternative, House Speaker Dennis Hastert asked  
Coburn and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., to write a Republican bill. 
Hastert, R-Ill., promised to bring it to the House floor in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair expected Hastert to endorse that bill, which they  
introduced Thursday. He has not done so and has not articulated his 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg planned to meet Friday with Hastert and other  
GOP leaders. Still, there was clear frustration Thursday that after 
a month's recess, Hastert was not with them at their news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn said he planned to use Friday's meeting to explain the  
``political realities'' to the party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, responded that the speaker is  
``still committed to working on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker has been working on this issue for many years,''  
he said. ``It's a difficult issue that requires a delicate 
balancing act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Coburn and Shadegg tries to offer something for  
those wanting to allow patients to sue HMOs who deny them care and 
those concerned that more lawsuits will drive up the cost of health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow lawsuits, but only in federal court and  
only if a patient first has gone through the health plan's review 
process. Patients also would have to take their cases to more 
doctors who would assess a patient's injury and determine if any 
decision by the plan had caused that injury. The bill also would 
cap the damages patients could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a variety of provisions in virtually every HMO  
bill: allowing easier access to emergency rooms and specialists, 
and giving patients access to more information about how their 
plans work.

<HEADLINE> Couple Charged in Kids' Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A Tennessee couple is suspected of  
driving several miles into Arkansas to abandon their 18-month-old 
son in a ravine. Three days later, authorities believe, they tossed 
his brother in a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Ware, 33, and Chantilly Harrell, 21, of Memphis, Tenn.,  
were charged Wednesday with murder in the death of Alexander Ware, 
whose skeletal remains were found Friday near the St. Francis 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware and Ms. Harrell appeared in court without lawyers Wednesday  
and did not enter pleas. The couple were jailed on $250,000 bail 
and a hearing was set for Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Fletcher Long Jr. also was weighing whether to charge  
the couple in the death of Alexander's 2 1/2-year-old brother, K-Von. 
Police said Ware told them he threw K-Von into a murky, stagnant 
part of Blackfish Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to comprehend a person's state of mind that they  
could dehumanize the children,'' Memphis police Lt. Sharon Cox 
said. ``All of us are very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Memphis police, the boys' father told them that he  
and the boy's mother abandoned Alexander a few miles from Forrest 
City on June 16 and threw K-Von into a lake about 12 miles away 
three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis police Lt. Brenda Maples said Ware confessed to the  
crimes, and sheriff's investigator Glenn Ramsey said the father 
showed investigators where he and Ms. Harrell left the children. 
</P>
<P>
	K-Von's remains have not been found, despite a five-day search  
through waist-deep mud and the draining of the lake. The boy 
probably drowned, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of his brother's death remains unknown. Alexander  
likely sat alone in the desolate ravine amid the farmland of 
eastern Arkansas, until heat and dehydration overcame him, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very cruel. The chances of anyone discovering the child  
would have been nil,'' Sheriff Dave Parkman said Wednesday. ``It 
was very hot, and animals could be a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children initially had been reported by their mother as  
kidnapped. The Commercial Appeal newspaper of Memphis reported 
Wednesday that Ms. Harrell told police she left Ware in June 
because of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harrell's mother, Venita Harrell of Memphis, said at court  
Wednesday that her daughter was innocent and blamed Ware for 
abandoning the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there was no known motive.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's only conjecture at this point,'' Long said. ``They  
wanted rid of two children.''

<HEADLINE> Emmy Looks to This Writer for Wit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bruce Vilanch is the man of a million punch  
lines, the wisenheimer of the Emmys and Oscars, the gag writer who 
delivers wit on demand like a Pez dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer on this weekend's Emmy broadcast, Vilanch has had a  
hand in crafting memorably funny moments on countless awards and 
variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the guy who gave Billy Crystal this line during the  
Oscars: ``A billion people are watching us tonight, except Linda 
Tripp, who's taping it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Whoopi Goldberg said this about Los Angeles -- ``L.A. If you  
can't be a star, at least you can be a star witness'' -- that was 
Vilanch's line. 
</P>
<P>
	He supplied Roseanne with this wisecrack on true-to-life Barbie  
dolls: ``I'm waiting for Trailer Court Barbie and Eating Disorder 
Barbie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilanch and Crystal also created the musical number for a Oscar  
broadcast in which Crystal sang: ``Those eyes, those thighs, 
surprise! It's `The Crying Game.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Vilanch has gotten screen time as a regular on  
``Hollywood Squares,'' for which he is head writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week comes ``Get Bruce!'', a documentary about Vilanch's  
role as hired hip man for the stars. The film opens Sept. 17 in Los 
Angeles, New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie follows his career as an entertainment reporter for  
the Chicago Tribune in the early 1970s, a humorist for TV programs 
such as ``The Brady Bunch Variety Hour'' in the late '70s and 
writer for almost every awards show in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	His credits include the Grammys, the Tonys, the Daytime Emmys  
and the People's Choice, American Comedy and World Music awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm down to the American Bulimia Awards,'' Vilanch, a tubby  
figure with shaggy blond hair and beard, said in an interview. 
``There's nothing else left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Sunday's Emmys, he is writing for hosts David Hyde Pierce  
and Jenna Elfman and preparing lines for nominees who want 
something funny to say in case they win. 
</P>
<P>
	When the idea for the documentary arose, ``I was kind of  
amazed,'' Vilanch said. ``How many people get a documentary made 
about them? It's me, and Hitler and Gandhi and R. Crumb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Get Bruce!'' showcases his work preparing Crystal and Ms.  
Goldberg to emcee the Oscars, including material that wound up on 
the cutting-room floor. 
</P>
<P>
	To spoof Oliver Stone's ``JFK,'' Vilanch and Crystal pondered a  
number to the ``Fiddler on the Roof'' tune ``Tradition'': ``A 
gunman on the knoll? Sounds crazy, I know. But Oliver Stone might 
say every one of us is a suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie features stars Vilanch has worked with, including Lily  
Tomlin, Nathan Lane, Robin Williams, Raquel Welch and Steven 
Seagal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give great mind,'' Williams tells Vilanch.  
</P>
<P>
	Lane says of Vilanch: ``He's given more great lines to  
celebrities than a Hollywood coke dealer.''

	Danforth To Head Waco Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- former Republican Sen. John Danforth was named  
today to investigate the FBI's 1993 Branch Davidian standoff. 
Attorney General Janet Reno made the appointment amid calls for her 
resignation. Danforth spent most of the afternoon yesterday at the 
Justice Department meeting with various officials, including Reno, 
about the scope of the investigation and how much authority he 
would have, according to government officials familiar with the 
discussions.

	Schools Finally Open in Detroit  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Teachers welcomed 180,000 students to their first  
day of classes today after testing the reform-minded school board 
and their own union leaders by staying off the job for more than a 
week. The teachers approved a temporary extension of their contract 
yesterday. The youngsters have a half-day of classes today, 
followed tomorrow by a full day.

	U.N. To Pull East Timor Staff  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations prepared today to  
evacuate all but a skeleton staff from East Timor. U.N. officials 
said about 40 to 50 U.N. staff, including police and military 
liaison officers, will stay behind when another 150 U.N. 
international workers and 167 local staff members are to be 
evacuated tomorrow by the Australian air force. Meanwhile, the 
Roman Catholic Church said today that militiamen opposed to 
independence for East Timor have massacred nuns, priests and 
civilians. 

</P>
<P>
	China Religious Persecution Studied  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new State Department report says Chinese  
citizens can face harassment or prolonged detention in labor camps 
if they practice religion outside officially sponsored churches. 
The report also cites credible reports of incidents of abuse 
against Buddhist monks and nuns in China, including Tibet. China is 
one of 194 countries or territories examined in the report -- the 
first of what will be an annual series on religious freedom around 
the world. The study was made available yesterday to members of 
Congress and was being released to news organizations today. Brief 
excerpts from the report were made available yesterday to The 
Associated Press by a government official.

	Egyptian Security Chiefs To Be Tried

<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Three top Egyptian police officials in the  
northern city of Port Said will go before a disciplinary board on 
charges of dereliction of duty during a visit by President Hosni 
Mubarak, a police official says. Mubarak was attacked and slightly 
injured by a knife-wielding man during the visit. The three 
officers, including the Port Said Security Chief Lt. Gen. Hassan 
Gibril, have been transferred. Their new posts were not announced.

	Palestinian Prisoners Released in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	BEITUNIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel released 199 Palestinian  
prisoners today under the peace process that is back on track after 
nearly a year of deadlock. The inmates, raising cuffed hands in 
triumph and flashing victory signs, chanted ``God is great'' as 
buses carrying them to freedom were greeted by cheering relatives 
and bagpipe bands at army checkpoints in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 

</P>

	Gore Announcement Irks Fishermen  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's announcement last week of  
$5 million in emergency funds for New England fishermen gave some 
observers a sense of deja vu. That's because the aid had been 
announced last fall by congressional representatives who spent much 
of the year putting the aid package together. Now Gore's 
announcement of the aid -- which initially drew praise during his 
recent stop in Boston -- is attracting criticism from fishermen who 
mistakenly thought Gore was offering new aid. ``It really stinks of 
cheap, election-year politics,'' Paul Cohane, head of the Gulf of 
Maine Fisherman's Association, told The Boston Globe.

causing bodily harm through the drugs in cases involving 142 female 
athletes.

<HEADLINE> Browns To Fight Emotions, Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- ``Cleveland Rocks'' is more than the catchy  
rock 'n' roll anthem Drew Carey used as the theme song for his TV 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the truth, and Cleveland never rocks harder than when the  
Browns are playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, when Cleveland returns to the NFL for the first  
time since 1995, Browns fans will experience a range of emotions 
that have been building up for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	As their beloved Browns come running through the tunnel, 73,200  
screaming fans will christen the new Cleveland Browns Stadium with 
a sound that's bound to shake the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a few 
hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody will be hyped up,'' Browns cornerback Antonio  
Langham said. ``We'll be geeked to go. We'll be geeked to line 'em 
up and go toe to toe and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Browns can fight the Pittsburgh Steelers, they'll  
have to fight their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland coach Chris Palmer has talked all week of the danger  
of his team being sky-high for the game. With so much attention 
being given to the Browns' rebirth in the NFL, Palmer doesn't want 
his players to get so caught up in the emotion of the night that 
they forget their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to try and stay focused,'' Palmer said.  
``Everything we have done this season has been a first time. 
Eventually, we'll get to where we have a regular week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns haven't had that luxury this week. Not only  
is their first game against the rival Steelers, but it will be on 
prime time national TV as the final game of the NFL's opening 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langham, one of three Browns who played in the last game in the  
old Cleveland Stadium, said Cleveland's first two exhibition games 
gave him a sense of how electric the opener will be. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be impossible to remain calm, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know early on I'll be hyped,'' he said. ``I'll be running  
around and jumping around. But at some point you have to calm down. 
If you don't that's when trouble starts. You have to calm down 
sooner of later. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to get that emotion out of you early and calm down.  
Because when you get too emotionally involved in the game, you make 
too many mistakes. You want the game to come to you. If you let it, 
good things start to happen, you make plays. When you start 
pressing, and trying to force things, you get out of position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Ty Detmer may be under more pressure than any of the  
new Browns to perform well in the home debut. That's always the 
case for starting QBs, but especially in Detmer's case since his 
backup is Tim Couch, the team's No. 1 draft pick in April and 
franchise player of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer said he goes through some mental checks to keep his  
emotions reined in. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep reminding yourself, `Hey, it's just what  
you've been doing all week in practice. Don't do anything special, 
drop back, throw the ball and make your reads,''' Detmer said. 
``There's always going to be adrenaline and that rush, and 
sometimes your mind gets ahead of your feet and your arm. But if 
you settle in and keep reminding yourself of those things, you can 
handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's easier for a veteran to control his emotions. For a rookie,  
like middle linebacker Wali Rainer, it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his first start in the NFL, so it will be hard,''  
defensive end Derrick Alexander said of Rainer, who is replacing 
Chris Spielman. ``The first couple of plays I wouldn't be surprised 
to see him pretty winded.''

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Eyes Long Distance OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell Atlantic's chief executive said Thursday  
his company plans to file an application with federal regulators in 
the next few days to enter the New York long-distance telephone 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	With favorable action from the Federal Communications  
Commission, Bell Atlantic would become the first regional telephone 
company to receive such approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very confident about the application,'' Bell Atlantic  
CEO Ivan Seidenberg told reporters after unveiling his company's 
plans while appearing at a Capitol Hill summit with other chief 
executives in the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Public Service Commission already has held public  
hearings on whether Bell Atlantic is complying with a 1996 federal 
telecommunications law. The law requires local and regional phone 
companies to show they have given potential rivals sufficient 
access to their lines to create local phone competition as a 
condition for offering long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Service Commission can then inform the FCC on  
the state of competition in New York once Bell Atlantic files its 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regional Bell companies eyeing a move into long-distance  
markets include U S West. U S West CEO Sol Trujillo said Thursday 
his company is working aggressively to show regulators it now meets 
the criteria in the 1996 law to provide long-distance services 
states where it provides local service.

<HEADLINE>  Danforth To Head Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth today  
took the reins of an independent inquiry into the fiery end of the 
1993 Branch Davidian siege, pledging to answer the ``dark 
questions: Was there a cover-up and did the government kill 
people?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country can survive bad judgment. But the thing that  
really undermines the integrity of government is whether there were 
bad acts -- whether the government killed people,'' the ex-Missouri 
lawmaker said in a news conference convened by Attorney General 
Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has been under attack since the revelations that the FBI,  
contradicting a position it took for six years, had used some 
incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff, which 
ended in a fire and the deaths of cult leader David Koresh and some 
80 followers. Both Reno and the FBI maintain that the devices did 
not cause the deadly fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth will hold the title special counsel and is empowered to  
use a federal grand jury for his investigation.

<HEADLINE> Hearing Nerves Adjust to Implants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study using deaf kittens showed that devices  
called cochlear implants can stimulate growth and change in the 
nerves of the hearing system among the very young. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Physiologisches Institut of Frankfurt,  
Germany, tested the effects of the cochlear implants by putting 
them into the brains of kittens that were deaf at birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists report Friday in the journal Science that as the  
cats got older, they began to respond to sounds in the same way as 
cats that were born with normal hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, led by Rainer Klinke, found in congenitally  
deaf cats that the unstimulated auditory nervous system did not 
develop in the same way as for normal cats. They found that when 
the deaf cats were outfitted with the cochlear implants at three to 
four months after birth, parts of their brains changed so that 
sounds were processed and the animals responded to commands and 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Such changes did not occur in congenitally deaf cats without the  
devices, the researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Josef P. Rauschecker of the Georgetown University Medical  
Center said in Science the study shows that the young brain is 
adaptable to stimulation from the implant and offers some 
explanation for the medical experience with the device in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the use of cochlear implants is controversial among the  
deaf, Rauschecker implants early in life of children born deaf 
``have proven quite successful.'' However, among adults who have 
been deaf since childhood, the history of cochlear implants 
``abounds with examples of failure.''

<HEADLINE> Delta, Pilots Union Open Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After seeing Delta Air Lines' profits surpass $1  
billion for two straight years, the carrier's pilots are lining up 
for a bigger slice of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta and its 9,200 pilots opened contract talks Wednesday by  
exchanging proposals six months before the current contract's 
``amendable date'' of May 2000. Neither side disclosed specific 
salary wishes, which are expected to dominate the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	To help push the nation's third-largest carrier back to  
profitability, pilots offered Delta substantial wage concessions 
during the last contract negotiations in 1996 and are seeking to 
recoup them in the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta posted a record $1 billion profit in 1998  
for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta contract talks come at a time of increased airline  
industry profitability -- and labor strife. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Northwest pilots went on a 15-day strike before  
reaching a contract with the airline. And American Airlines pilots 
staged an illegal job action in February over the integration of 
Reno Airlines into the airline's operations, disrupting hundreds of 
thousands of flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks won't be easy or short, said Julius Maldutis, an  
analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	``After six consecutive years of profit, it's not surprising  
that (airline) labor in general has grown much more militant,'' 
said Maldutis, who predicted the Delta talks will lead to federal 
mediation. ``The pilots are saying, 'We want it back, plus some.' 
'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Chuck Giambusso, chairman of the Delta pilots' union,  
called the pilots' proposal ``ambitious, but fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to our company and to achieving a timely and  
superior agreement,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides salary raises, the pilots are seeking better training  
pay, codification of rest rules, reduction in the amount of 
regional jet flying performed by Delta subsidiaries, growth in the 
number of pilot jobs and better vacation and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots also want a voting member on Delta's board of  
directors, instead of the nonvoting seat they now hold, and 
elimination of a lower pay scale for pilots who fly for Delta 
Express, Delta's low-cost unit based in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta was pleased by the pilots' invitation to begin the  
negotiations early, Delta spokesman John Kennedy said Wednesday. 
Under federal law, pilot contracts do not expire, but have dates at 
which they can be altered. 
</P>
<P>
	We recognize there are significant issues to address and are  
looking forward to working with ALPA on these,'' Kennedy said. 
``We're happy that it's started early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Andy Deane, a 727 pilot and union spokesman, described the  
proposals as ``wish lists'' that will be studied by the opposing 
side for several weeks. Direct negotiations are scheduled to begin 
next month.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Shocked With Belt Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A man who was jolted with an electric  
stun belt because of his repeated courtroom outbursts has been 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison on a third-strike theft 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights groups were outraged in June 1998 when a judge  
ordered bailiffs to activate the stun belt Ronnie Hawkins was 
wearing because he repeatedly interrupted her during his sentencing 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, 49, received a 50,000-volt shock for eight seconds. It  
was believed to be first such use of a stun belt in Los Angeles 
County courts. 
</P>
<P>
	He has filed a $50 million civil rights lawsuit against the  
county, the Sheriff's Department and the judge, Joan 
Comparet-Cassani. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction 
against the use of stun belts in county courts until the suit is 
resolved. That ruling is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparet-Cassani recused herself from Hawkins' case without  
sentencing him. He was retried and convicted again in August on 
charges of stealing $250 worth of aspirin from a market. 
</P>
<P>
	His sentencing Wednesday was based on California's ``three  
strikes'' law because he had been convicted of robbery in 1970 and 
attempted robbery in 1986.

<HEADLINE>  Korn, Lauryn Hill Win MTV Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Five-time Grammy winner Lauryn Hill continued  
her winning streak Thursday when her slinky video for ``Doo Wop 
(That Thing)'' earned four video awards during MTV's invasion of 
the Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	Puff Daddy replaced Pagliacci and the Backstreet Boys elbowed  
out ``La Boheme'' as the raunchy awards show took over opera's 
epicenter. Instead of ``Faust,'' the audience was treated to Kid 
Rock in a white fur coat and a dozen male Madonna impersonators. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill won the night's big award, video of the year, and also won  
for best female video, best rhythm 'n' blues video and art 
direction. The video shows her simultaneously dressed in '60s and 
'90s outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	Acceptance speeches are getting redundant for the rap-soul diva,  
who only seven months ago dominated the Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Dance artist Fatboy Slim won three awards for ``Praise You.''  
Ricky Martin's video of dancers undulating to ``Livin' La Vida 
Loca'' and Korn's arresting ``Freak on a Leash'' video featuring a 
slow-motion animated bullet each won two awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedian Chris Rock, dressed as Rigoletto from the Verdi opera  
in a huge poster in the lobby but all in white on stage, was the 
host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be the first black man in history to take the stage of  
the Met without a mop,'' Rock quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna, somewhat flustered by an over-enthusiastic fan in the  
audience, won an award for her salaciously comic dance with Mike 
Myers in ``Beautiful Stranger.'' Later, she was ushered out for an 
appearance by male impersonators dressed in a series of outfits 
from her videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I have to say,'' she said, ``is it takes a real man to  
fill my shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the award ceremony's usual home, Radio City Music Hall,  
under renovation, MTV went uptown for a new venue this year. The 
clash between high and low culture gave producers a rich vein of 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	In the venerable hall's lobby, the display cases stuffed with  
opera costumes were cleaned out in favor of moments from MTV's 
past: the hip-hugger pants Madonna wore to the 1995 video awards, 
Busta Rhymes' red crushed velvet ensemble from his appearance at 
the podium with Martha Stewart two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, MTV's annual special is the program where awards are  
less remembered than wardrobes or attempts to shock the censor. 
Perhaps intimidated by the surroundings, the rockers and rappers 
were somewhat tame. 
</P>
<P>
	Only rock's fun couple, Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson Lee,  
shaked things up. Lee wore a furry pink hat and her husband a 
trench coat. He flashed her backstage as she talked to reporters, 
causing her to run off the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	One well-dressed stage crasher made it to the stage before the  
Backstreet Boys, obliquely urging the audience to ``wake up at 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight year, a Beastie Boy delivered a  
political lecture. Adam Yauch talked about nonviolence at last 
year's show, and this year Adam Horwitz's topic was sexual assault: 
he urged musicians to talk to promoters about protecting women at 
concerts after the reports of rapes at Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years after winning MTV's first video award for rap music,  
actor Will Smith won best male video for his tropical tribute, 
``Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never killed nobody in none of my records, I never used  
profanity in none of my records, and still I managed to get up 
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock poked fun at white rappers and boy bands, although Kid Rock  
fought back with a raucous collaboration featuring members of 
Aerosmith and Run-DMC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know who will be the real Backstreet Boy, the one  
who gets Britney Spears pregnant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A wrinkled, shaggy-haired David Bowie, looking slightly lost as  
he sauntered onstage to introduce a performance by Hill, was a 
visual reminder of how time passes quickly in MTV's world of pop 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yo,'' he said softly in a British accent.

<HEADLINE> Bulldogs Boast Another Edwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Terrence Edwards has played only one football  
game at wide receiver. There will be many more before he gives up 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a 6-foot-2, 175-pound freshman, was pressed into  
starting duty when No. 12 Georgia opened its season last week 
against Utah State because starting receiver Michael Greer was 
sidelined with a migraine. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an impressive debut, catching 10 passes for 196 yards and  
two touchdowns as the Bulldogs coasted to a 38-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	His old buddies at Washington County High School probably didn't  
know Edwards could catch the ball. During his high school career he 
played quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm a natural receiver,'' Edwards said as the Bulldogs  
prepared for Saturday's Southeastern Conference opener against 
South Carolina. ``It comes natural to me. It helps knowing the 
mindset of a quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards appears primed to become the second member of his family  
to star for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Robert, had a sparkling career that saw him turn  
from the secondary to tailback and become one of the best in the 
nation before being sidelined by a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert's career as a runner was stymied by various injuries, and  
has carried over into his NFL career. He rushed for 1,115 yards as 
a rookie with the New England Patriots last season, then damaged 
his left knee in a pickup flag football game in Hawaii in February. 
The injury threatens to end his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrence was a three-year starter at quarterback in high school,  
passing for 3,180 yards and 34 touchdowns. He completed his high 
school career in 1997, but didn't qualify academically at Georgia 
until the middle of his freshman year. He joined the basketball 
team at that point, then participated in spring football practice, 
making the switch to receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Donnan said before the season started that Edwards  
would be one of his options to play quarterback if sophomore Quincy 
Carter was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	That apparently is no longer the case. Sophomore LaBrone  
Mitchell, also being groomed at wide receiver, has moved into the 
No. 2 spot on the depth chart at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I'm now only a filling at quarterback,'' Edwards  
said. ``Let LaBrone and Quincy have that job. I think my days as a 
quarterback are over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he like that, he replied, ``Yeah.''  
</P>
<P>
	Edwards knows his opening effort caught the eye of the coaching  
staff. He knows he'll get plenty of playing time, but really isn't 
expecting to start when Greer recovers from his headache. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his position,'' Edwards said. ``If I get in 10 plays,  
I'll play hard. If I get in 50 plays, I'll play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No question, he's a special guy,'' Donnan said. ``He's a very  
confident athlete. He expects to do well.''

<HEADLINE> New Internet IPOs Test Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new crop of Internet companies is expected  
to go public during September and October, providing yet another 
test of Wall Street's enthusiasm for high-tech stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 companies are planning to raise money over the next  
six weeks by selling their stock to the public for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they all follow through on those plans will depend at  
least partly on the success of companies that go first, especially 
hot Internet names such as NetZero, a provider of free dial-up 
access to the Web, and E.Piphany, a company that helps businesses 
sell online. 
</P>
<P>
	Success for the newcomers could lure many more Web-based  
companies into the market, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll see some pretty spectacular gains over the next  
two weeks, and then oversupply will kick in again,'' said Ken 
Fleming, an analyst with Renaissance Capital. ``There's clearly 
demand for a select number of hot tech companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by Wall Street's fixation with the Internet, the IPO  
market soared during the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highest-flyers was EToys, the online toy seller, which  
went public with an asking price of $20 per share on Jan. 15 and 
ended the day at $97.50, an increase of 291 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors grew picky as summer drew to a close.  
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat Inc., a North Carolina company that sells a commercial  
version of Linux, an alternative operating system to Microsoft's 
Windows NT, set an initial price of $14 on Aug. 11 and finished the 
day at $52.06, a 271 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Others stumbled out of the starting gate. Online flower seller  
1-800-Flowers.com has even sunk below its IPO asking price of $21. 
</P>
<P>
	Most late summer IPOs, however, have done well. On average,  
August's IPOs are up 58 percent from their first-day close, said 
Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expected to hit the market next week include  
several that were scheduled to launch in August, but postponed 
after the market grew volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Garden.com, an online retailer of gardening  
supplies that is scheduled for Monday. The company got cold feet 
after 1-800-Flowers.com failed to do well, said Corey Ostman of 
Ostman's Alert-IPO, a, company that monitors the IPO market. 
NetZero and E.Piphany are scheduled to debut the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	As a whole, 1999 is shaping up as one of the busiest years ever  
for IPOs, largely because of the eagerness of Internet companies to 
go public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen an IPO market as dominated by one industry  
as this year's has been,'' said Jay Ritter, a University of Florida 
finance professor who researches the IPO market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even 20 years ago, when oil stocks were booming, oil and gas  
did not dominate as much as now, or eight years ago when biotech 
was at its peak,'' he said. ``There are an awful lot of Internet 
companies that have been financed the past two years, and the 
business plan typically is to go public at some point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has created a serious problem for some of the companies  
planning IPOs. Highly regarded names can do well in an overcrowded 
market, but others get lost, said Fleming at Renaissance Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not Internet plays, but two other public offerings  
expected to attraction attention are the subscription television 
service TiVo Inc. and Charter Communications Inc., the cable 
television company controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. 
Charter, based in St. Louis, is scheduled to go public in 
mid-October. TiVo, of Sunnyvale, Calif., is on tape for next week. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first quarter of 1999, there were 81 IPOs, raising an  
average of $125.6 million, according to Hoover's IPO Central. In 
the second quarter, 150 companies entered the market, but the 
average value dropped to $110.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole problem this year has been just too many deals, too  
much supply,'' Fleming said.

<HEADLINE> London Tribunal Rules Vs. United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An employment tribunal in London ruled Thursday  
that United Airlines must pay back wages to flight attendants 
suspended without pay because they were pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling applies only to employees who fly out of London's  
Heathrow Airport. The Association of Flight Attendants argued that 
those workers are covered by a 1996 British employment law. 
</P>
<P>
	That law requires an employer to determine if a job poses health  
risks. If so, employers are required to find employees alternative 
work at an equivalent rate of pay or place them on full paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``United can't thumb its nose at British law. It has to obey the  
law like every other company operating in the UK,'' said Kevin 
Creighan, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. ``The 
judge's decision is a victory for flight attendants and working 
women in the UK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how much the back wages would total.  
</P>
<P>
	United officials say they are studying the tribunal's findings  
and may appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a U.S. company,'' said United spokesman Andy Plews.  
``Our routes fly to the U.S. -- we train in U.S. and will work under 
terms of the U.S. contract and under scope of the contract we 
signed with the AFA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 900 United flight attendants fly out of Heathrow Airport.

<HEADLINE>  Danforth To Head Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth today  
took the reins of an independent inquiry into the fiery end of the 
1993 Branch Davidian siege, pledging to answer the ``dark 
questions: Was there a cover-up and did the government kill 
people?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country can survive bad judgment. But the thing that  
really undermines the integrity of government is whether there were 
bad acts -- whether the government killed people,'' the ex-Missouri 
lawmaker said in a news conference convened by Attorney General 
Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has been under attack since the revelations that the FBI,  
contradicting a position it took for six years, had used some 
incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff, which 
ended in a fire and the deaths of cult leader David Koresh and some 
80 followers. Both Reno and the FBI maintain that the devices did 
not cause the deadly fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth will hold the title special counsel and is empowered to  
use a federal grand jury for his investigation.

<HEADLINE> Biffle Wins Craftsman Truck Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Greg Biffle passed Dennis Setzer for the  
lead with 39 laps to go Thursday night and overcame two late 
cautions to win the rain-shortened Virginia Is For Lovers 200 
Craftsman Truck Series race after 196 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle's eighth triumph in 21 races matched Mike Skinner's  
season record set in 1995 and tied in 1996. It also boosted 
Biffle's lead in the driver standings to 125 over second-place Jack 
Sprague with four races remaining in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like that championship effort's getting closer and  
closer,'' Biffle said after averaging 86.077 mph in a race slowed 
nine times by cautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle said setting the victory record would be a bonus. ``Jack  
Roush told me if I set the record, he'll buy me an excursion,'' 
Biffle said of his team owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle had opened a sizeable lead with 22 laps to go when Joe  
Gaita's Ford had engine trouble on the backstretch of Richmond 
International Raceway, bringing out the eighth caution and giving 
the field one last chance to run down Biffle. 
</P>
<P>
	It took crews five laps to clean up the track, but when it went  
back to green with 15 laps remaining, Biffle easily pulled away 
from Setzer and Ron Hornaday. Biffle had a two-second lead when 
another caution flew with seven laps left. 
</P>
<P>
	This cleanup was still in progress when the skies opened with  
five laps to go, sending fans and crews scurrying for cover and 
bringing out a red flag. The trucks were parked with four laps 
left, and the race was called about 20 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornaday finished second, followed by Setzer, Mike Wallace and  
Sprague.

	``One more stop and I think we could have gotten this thing  
perfect and caught Biffle,'' Hornaday said. ``It was just a little 
tight in the middle. If we can get out of here with a clean truck 
... we're pretty happy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race featured a piece of NASCAR history as Bruce Driver of  
Trenton, N.J., gained a provisional spot in the field and became 
the first black to drive in the 5-year-old series. He started 35th 
and finished 27th, four laps behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Petty also made his first career start in the series. The  
fourth generation driver started 25th in a Dodge and wound up an 
impressive 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle became the fifth winner in as many truck series races at  
Richmond since the series began in 1995, and the second to win a 
rain-shortened event. Skinner won here in 1996 when Hurricane Fran 
ended the race after 124 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	The race featured 17 lead changes among seven drivers and nine  
cautions.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Stresses Independent Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS, Mo. (AP) -- It's a whispered fear among Democratic  
activists, seemingly supported by early polls: Republican 
front-runner George W. Bush could trounce Vice President Al Gore. 
In steps Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator on Thursday emphasized his appeal  
among independents and Republicans, contending that makes him the 
more electable Democrat in a general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference, Bradley also took his most direct shot yet  
at the Clinton administration's ``misdirected and ineffective'' 
U.S.-Russia policy, in which Gore has played a uniquely active 
role. That foreign policy is under increasing scrutiny as 
investigators sort through allegations of money laundering and 
corruption in the American-subsidized Russian government. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States under Clinton-Gore, Bradley said, ``became  
more missionaries for international capitalism than we became the 
undisputed giant of the world, acting out of our own national 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spoke at a press conference in his hometown of Crystal  
City, Mo., before boarding a campaign bus tour up the Mississippi 
River and through Mark Twain's Hannibal hometown, before landing in 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	At the band stand on the main street of Keokuk, a couple of  
hundred greeted Bradley's caravan. ``We're making some progress, 
some real progress. People are coming forward,'' Bradley beamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired teacher Jan Celania called it a good crowd for the city  
in Iowa's southeastern corner, but said Bradley still has work to 
do. ``I don't think there are a lot of people who've jumped on his 
bandwagon yet, because we're just now learning about him,'' Celania 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On this three-day fall kickoff swing, which the campaign hoped  
would raise Bradley's national profile, aides took heart that their 
web site on Wednesday logged seven times the normal daily number of 
hits. They collected $14,000 in Internet donations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the parking lot of St. Louis' Kappa Alpha Psi chapter, a  
black civic and educational fraternity, Ernestine Bradley said her 
husband's team revels in its underdog status. ``It energizes us to 
have to work that much harder,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the candidate fielded a reporter's question about his  
electability. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm out campaigning in restaurants and hotels, in  
airports, people come up to me and say, 'I'm independent. Or, I'm a 
Republican. I will vote for you. I would never vote for him,''' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it to mean that in a general election, it's important  
to get independents and Republicans if you're going to win.'' 
Democratic primary voters next year are going to have to make a 
judgment ``as to who they think would be able to win,'' Bradley 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	His electoral analysis spoke to the anxieties among some  
Democrats that Gore, the party establishment's favorite for the 
nomination, would have a tough fight against Bush, if the Texas 
governor wins the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears are backed up by national polls showing Bush would  
roundly beat Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In a mid-August CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, Bush led Gore among  
independents, 54 percent to 39 percent, when matched against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Bush is matched against Bradley, they divide the  
independent vote almost equally, 48 percent for Bush and 47 percent 
for Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest New Hampshire poll reported by the Boston Globe  
and WBZ-TV last weekend, Gore and Bradley were in a statistical 
tie, largely based on Bradley's appeal among independents who say 
they are likely Democratic primary voters. Bradley led among New 
Hampshire independents, 51 percent to 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradley works out campaign themes that, he hopes, define  
himself to Democrats as the clear and better choice than Gore, he 
also emphasizes honesty and trust. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Thursday's lengthy exchange with reporters under the  
backyard basketball hoop of his boyhood home, Bradley thrice 
declined opportunities to question the integrity of the 
Clinton-Gore administration or whether Gore suffers any deficit in 
public trust because of President Clinton's personal scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was asked if the latest allegations of an administration  
coverup over Waco signaled a crisis of confidence in the 
administration. He replied only that it was ``a good sign'' that 
former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, a Republican, was picked to 
investigate the FBI's involvement in the deadly Branch Davidian 
standoff in Waco, Texas, six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more I choose to say today other than that''  
about the Clinton-Gore administration's integrity, Bradley 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	On issues, he was short of specifics. For the millions of  
Americans without health insurance ``it's gotten worse over the 
last eight years instead of better,'' Bradley said. Details of his 
own plan for universal health coverage are for later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Identifying four nations that would be a priority of his own  
foreign policy because of their ``overriding importance'' to 
American interests, Bradley counted the European continent as a 
single country, along with Japan, China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the only four countries that have the technological  
capability to threaten the United States,'' Bradley said.

<P>
	Reaction to the death Thursday of Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish  
Hunter: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish Hunter was the cornerstone of the Yankees' success  
over the last quarter-century. We were not winning before Catfish 
arrived, and since his arrival in 1975 the Yankees have the best 
record in baseball, as well as four world championships. He 
exemplified class and dignity and he taught us how to win.'' -- New 
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fabulous human being. He was a man of honor. He was a  
man of loyalty.'' -- Reggie Jackson, who played with Hunter on 
championship teams in Oakland and New York. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team played very well on the field together, but there  
were problems. But Catfish got along with everybody. He was a team 
leader. Everybody liked Catfish. If you didn't like Catfish, you 
just didn't like people.'' -- Seattle manager Lou Piniella, a former 
Yankees teammate. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to call him this morning. The line was busy and I was  
going to call him after the game to see how he was doing. It's a 
shock. He was one of my best friends on the club and we stayed in 
touch all these years.'' -- Milwaukee Brewers special assistant Sal 
Bando, a former Athletics teammate. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``That was certainly the wakeup call about how underpaid players  
were. The spring training following this, in every clubhouse, there 
was curiosity and questions like, `Were you surprised at the 
amount?' and `What do you think it means if a lot of players became 
free?''' -- Marvin Miller, head of the players' union when Hunter 
signed a $3.75 million, five-year contract with the Yankees on Dec. 
31, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we saw him was in Florida during spring  
training. It was comforting to see his sense of humor was still 
there. That's what made him special. Catfish was upbeat about 
everything.'' -- Yankees coach and former teammate Chris Chambliss. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very sad day for baseball. He was a consummate pro. A  
great father, husband, a great man.'' -- Cincinnati pitching coach 
Don Gullett, a former Yankees teammate. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish was a very unique guy. If you didn't know that he was  
making that kind of money, you'd never guess it because he was 
humble. And he was very reserved about being a star type player.'' 
-- Piniella. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``All of baseball is saddened by the death of Jim ``Catfish''  
Hunter. He was a great pitcher, a great athlete and a great 
competitor. The latter was particularly evident when I saw him in 
spring training while he was battling Lou Gehrig's disease.'' -- 
commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish Hunter was a man among men. He was a genuine person.  
There was nothing phony about him. I learned a lot from him, both 
on and off the baseball field.'' -- former Oakland pitcher Vida 
Blue. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The bigger the game, the better he pitched.'' -- Hunter's Hall  
of Fame plaque at Cooperstown, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Economist Herbert Stein Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Herbert Stein, an economist who served as  
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon 
administration, has died. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein died Wednesday at Washington Hospital Center after several  
months of illness, said Christopher DeMuth, president of the 
American Enterprise Institute, where Stein was a senior fellow. No 
cause of death was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein was one of the key architects of Richard Nixon's economic  
policies, including efforts to fight inflation with wage and price 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Nixon administration as a member of the Council of  
Economic Advisers in 1969 and was appointed chairman of the council 
by Nixon in January 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stein stepped down as CEA chairman in August 1974 to be  
succeeded by Alan Greenspan, he continued to be an active player in 
economic policy debates in Washington for the rest of his life, 
writing books, testifying before Congress and contributing opinion 
pieces to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a senior fellow of the American Enterprise  
Institute, a conservative think tank, since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein often employed his wry sense of humor to help make dense  
economic issues understandable to the average reader. Among his 
books were ``The Illustrated Guide to the American Economy'' and 
``What I Think; Essays on Economics, Politics and Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein stressed pragmatism above rigid adherence to any one  
doctrine in economics. He once called himself ``a conservative's 
liberal and a liberal's conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Nixon administration, Stein had served for 22  
years with the Committee for Economic Development, which had been 
organized during World War II to study economic issues. During the 
war, Stein had served as head of economic analysis at the War 
Production Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter, Rachel Epstein, and a son, actor  
Ben Stein, who gained fame playing an economics teacher in the 
movie ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' and is currently the host of the 
Comedy Central quiz show ``Win Ben Stein's Money.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Urges Toughness on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, a former Navy pilot seeking  
the Republican presidential nomination, says China needs to realize 
that ``the price of aggression'' against Taiwan would be high. 
</P>
<P>
	With tensions mounting between Beijing and Taiwan, the Arizona  
lawmaker urged President Clinton to be blunt in talks this week 
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd make it clear that the price of aggression would be far  
higher than any short-term gain,'' he said in a wide-ranging 
interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	If he were president, the Arizona Republican said he would tell  
Chinese leaders that the United States was prepared to develop and 
deploy a sea-based missile defense system ``and that we will 
continue our right to move our Navy around in international 
waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Chinese are ``pragmatic people'' who realize that  
peace is in their best interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we also must be prepared to counter acts of aggression if  
they decide to exert hegemony in the region and reverse what has 
been their policy since 1973 -- and that is to welcome U.S. military 
presence as a stabilizing factor in the region,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that meant he would be prepared to go to war to protect  
Taiwan, McCain said: ``It means that we have a variety of options. 
We are the world's superpower and we will examine all those options 
and deploy those that are most effective,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain accused Clinton of engaging in ``feckless photo-op''  
foreign policy, particularly with China. 
</P>
<P>
	He also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Decried decisions by two of his presidential rivals, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and publisher Steve Forbes, to avoid spending limits 
in the 2000 campaign, saying they are setting precedent ``that will 
basically emasculate'' Watergate-era reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Departed from his party leadership by saying Congress' tax-cut  
package caters to special interests more than taxpayers. And he 
said there is no hue and cry among voters for lowering taxes. ``Tax 
cuts certainly don't seem to be anything that's got a great deal of 
steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Said the United States has ``no compelling national interest''  
for sending troops to East Timor as part of a U.N. force. 
Pro-Indonesia militiamen have led a bloody rampage in the aftermath 
of an overwhelming vote to seek independence for the territory. The 
Clinton administration and the United Nations are considering 
whether to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he has not decided whether to compete in the Iowa  
caucuses, though his strategy for now is focused on the New 
Hampshire and South Carolina primaries that follow. ``The argument 
against going (to Iowa) is I don't have enough time and money to 
build the organization which is critical in a caucus state.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Mob Crumbled Over Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- During the glory days of the Philadelphia  
mob in the 1960s and '70s, the wiseguys were kept in line by the 
``Docile Don'' -- Angelo Bruno, who led with quiet authority and 
preferred to keep most violence out of public view. 
</P>
<P>
	But the loyalty and discipline of the Bruno regime are long  
gone. And the Philly mob is on its last, broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno was gunned down in a car in front of his home in 1980, and  
the void was filled by young hotheads. Their power soon faded, 
thanks to their own inexperience, turncoats and tough new 
racketeering laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Mafia's place in Philly's underworld has been taken over  
by Russian mobsters and other crime groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no true Mafia tradition practiced in Philadelphia  
anymore,'' said mob criminologist and historian Celeste Morello. 
``There's just been an influx of younger men with no idea about how 
the traditional Mafia is supposed to be run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the reputed former boss of the Philly mob, Ralph  
Natale, was charged with running a methamphetamine distribution 
ring and agreed to cooperate with federal authorities, according to 
The Philadelphia Inquirer. That would make him the highest-ranking 
American Mafia figure to flip sides. 
</P>
<P>
	He is believed to be providing information on drug dealing,  
murders and political corruption in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. 
Among the men he could implicate is his reputed successor as mob 
boss, Joseph ``Skinny Joey'' Merlino, who is charged with 
conspiring to sell cocaine in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	All this is a marked change from the way the mob worked under  
the courtly Bruno, the owner of a few South Philadelphia grocery 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno stressed ``omerta,'' the Sicilian code of silence, and  
inspired loyalty that helped forge close ties with New York's 
Gambino family. He also built up operations in Atlantic City, N.J., 
raising the prominence of the Philadelphia mob to the level of 
powerful families elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of his reign, which included involvement in gambling  
and extortion, Bruno relied on a ``working relationship'' with the 
police to keep peace in the city, while doing what he could to 
profit from businesses, legitimate and otherwise, Morello said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruno was kind of the glue that held the thing together,''  
said police Capt. Jim Murphy, who heads Philadelphia's Organized 
Crime Unit. ``It sort of fell apart after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruno died without an heir apparent, and his style was missing  
from the leaders who followed, such as Phil ``Chicken Man'' Testa 
and Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo, a swaggering former boxer who 
proudly proclaimed himself a gangster and had a penchant for 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years that followed, dozens of mobsters and associates  
were killed in an internal mob war, including Testa, who was bumped 
off with a bomb placed under his porch in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Tough racketeering laws also went into effect during the 1980s,  
leading to the imprisonment of the mob's next four bosses, 
including Scarfo, who was convicted in 1988 with 16 associates. In 
the last 13 years, nearly a dozen members of the crime family have 
turned into government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say for the last 20 years, post-Bruno, they've been  
paranoid,'' said Fred Martens, a former executive director of the 
now-defunct Pennsylvania Crime Commission. ``They certainly don't 
have the capacity to corrupt the political structure like they once 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story is the same for other cities' mob families, who have  
been devastated by informants such as Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' 
Gravano of New York and Angelo Lonardo of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Gambino crime boss John Gotti was sentenced to life  
in prison in 1992, and his son and reputed successor got nearly 6 1/2 
years behind bars last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston and Providence, R.I., the New England mob has been  
reeling since a 1989 blunder by young boss Raymond J. ``Junior'' 
Patriarca. His induction ceremony for new members was secretly 
recorded by the FBI and used to send several to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mob is probably in the worst shape it's ever been since  
the 1930s,'' said Stephen Fox, author of ``Blood and Power: 
Organized Crime in 20th Century America.'' ``Since the early 1970s, 
they've been cut into by new competition and the feds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new rivals are Russian crime groups. Unlike the  
Italian mob, which is often run like a corporation, Russians might 
hook up for a scam or two then separate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hasn't been anything they haven't been willing to get  
involved in,'' said Sgt. Michael Smith of Philadelphia's Organized 
Crime Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian and Hispanic groups and motorcycle gangs such as the  
Pagans and Hells Angels have also gained power in gambling and drug 
dealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Mafia might not quietly fade away. Last month, Steven  
``Gorilla'' Mondevergine, the Philadelphia leader of the Pagans, 
was critically wounded when he was ambushed and shot in front of 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mob experts said Mafia members may have been sending a message  
to Mondevergine not to encroach on their turf or tell what he knows 
to prosecutors.

<HEADLINE>  Texas Tech's Williams Sprains Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Texas Tech running back Ricky Williams,  
who was fourth in the nation in rushing last season, will miss 
Saturday night's game against Louisiana-Lafayette because of a 
sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was injured Monday night in the second quarter of a  
season-opening loss to Arizona State. He played until the third 
quarter, then left with a career-low 33 yards on 13 carries. He 
also scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed that Williams sprained the anterior cruciate  
ligament in his left knee. He's wearing a leg wrap and walking with 
crutches until being further evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has played every game at Tech the last two seasons. He  
ran for 1,582 yards and 13 touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams bandaged his left after hurting it the first time, then  
returned until he felt it give out, forcing him to be helped off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Shaud Williams ran for 40 yards on five carries in  
place of Ricky Williams and will compete for the job as replacement 
starter along with juniors James Easterling and Rickey Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those kids will step up,'' running backs coach Jack Tayrien  
said. ``I've got a lot of confidence in them, and we'll see how 
they do in practice this week. We might not decide who will start 
until right prior to the game.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Bills Players Unsure About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, Thurman  
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are a part of football's greatest stretch of  
postseason futility -- four straight Super Bowl losses in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	They still resonate with the roar of the crowd, and are studies  
in perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
	Will all three be back next year? Don't count on it.  
</P>
<P>
	``When will I retire?'' said Thomas, starting his 12th season  
with the Buffalo Bills at age 33. ``I don't have a clue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas ranks ninth on the NFL's career rushing list with 11,786  
yards. Odds are he won't catch No. 1 Walter Payton with 16,726 
yards, but Thomas is within 1,000 yards of fourth-ranked Tony 
Dorsett and needs 334 to catch eighth-place Franco Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who rushed for 381 yards in a reduced role last season,  
isn't entirely motivated by his pursuit of other great backs or a 
Super Bowl win. ``Football is still fun,'' said Thomas, whose 
touchdowns dwindle in number as they grow in importance. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas broke three NFL playoff records with a single touchdown  
in his 20th career postseason game, at Miami last season. His 
1-yard run in the second quarter set new marks for points with 126, 
touchdowns (21), and consecutive games scoring a touchdown (9). 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills opted for quality over quantity in their selective use  
of Thomas. Playing as the third-down back last year, Thomas 
averaged 4.1 yards per carry and caught 26 passes for 220 yards. He 
never broke 100 yards rushing in a game, but was always ready to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've carried the ball almost 3,000 times,'' said Thomas, who  
has 2,813 career carries. ``I'm getting a limited amount of plays 
but I'm also fresh at the end of games in the fourth quarter, and I 
think that's where they need me the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo also needs Thomas to show other players, even veterans,  
how excellence is achieved. ``Thurman has helped me a lot just by 
being the leader he is,'' fullback Sam Gash said. ``He doesn't say 
a whole lot but he runs every play as hard as he can, and he works 
out before and after practice. He doesn't have to do that; he's a 
Hall of Famer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Antowain Smith only 95 percent recovered from a groin  
muscle tear and third-rounder Shawn Bryson lost for the season with 
a knee injury, the Bills' running game needs help. 
</P>
<P>
	Some might say that neither Reed nor Bruce Smith would be missed  
now that receiver Eric Moulds is emerging as a superstar, and 
defensive end Marcellus Wiley has proved more than capable of 
stopping the run and pressuring the pass. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite an influx of young talent the players said they  
would be lost without the Super Bowl veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We young guys run around with our heads cut off at times,''  
Wiley said. ``We try hard but we still don't know in which 
direction to point all our energies. Bruce can't pass on his great 
ability but he does pass on what he knows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith smiles at the mention of retirement, then shakes his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you this,'' he said last month. ``If we win the  
Super Bowl, I'll retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has made two recent trips home to Norfolk, Va., to visit  
his ill father, George, plagued by emphysema and heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not doing well; the future doesn't look good for him,''  
Smith said. ``I'm going to go back every time I get a chance. I 
want to make sure I don't neglect my obligations here. I'm going to 
try to stay focused but it's going to be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith still draws double teams at the age of 36, and played in  
his 11th Pro Bowl after boosting his career sack total to 164 with 
10 last year. But the 15-year veteran still has one guy to chase: 
Reggie White, the NFL's career sack leader with 192.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Among active players, Smith and Reed have been teammates since  
September 1985, longer than any pair in major pro sports. The next 
closest are John Stockton and Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz, 
teammates since October 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's 889 receptions leave him just 51 catches shy of Art Monk  
as the second-leading receiver in NFL history. Jerry Rice is first 
with 1,139. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ask me how long I'm going to play,'' said Reed, who  
ended a short holdout when he signed for three years. ``I don't 
know. It's probably going to be more like one or two years.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Dances Topless on Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- It wasn't your standard weekday traffic jam when  
drivers slowed to watch a fire-spitting woman dancing topless atop 
a high-voltage electrical tower beside a freeway bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't meant to be.  
</P>
<P>
	Ara Tripp, 38, of Olympia, told The Seattle Times she planned  
the stunt for weeks to protest discrimination against women and 
laws that allow men to take their shirts off but not women. Tripp 
was a man before undergoing a sex-change operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp climbed the 180-foot tower Wednesday morning, took off her  
shirt and began dancing, occasionally taking swigs from a vodka 
bottle, spitting out the liquor and setting it aflame. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic on a nearby interstate bridge over the Lake Washington  
Ship Canal slowed to a near-standstill during the hour or so Tripp 
remained on the tower. 
</P>
<P>
	She had made a practice climb of the tower several nights  
earlier. Still, it was ``an extremely dangerous, hazardous 
situation,'' said Larry Vogel, spokesman for Seattle City Light. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility cut electricity to 5,000 homes and businesses to  
protect Tripp from being zapped by the 120,000 volts of juice 
flowing through the lines the tower supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp was arrested for investigation of criminal trespass and  
indecent exposure, each carrying a maximum penalty of a year in 
jail and a $5,000 fine, Carmen Best said. She was released after 
posting $690 bail and faces a Sept. 22 court date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll plead guilty,'' she said. ``It's pretty obvious.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tripp has a wife -- whom she married when she was still a man --  
strongly disapproved of the plan but was out of town Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not going to be happy,'' Tripp said. ``I'm going to be  
grounded.''

	Clinton: Indonesia Must Keep Peace  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today insisted that  
Indonesia accept international peacekeepers if it can't quell 
violence in East Timor. ``If Indonesia does not end the violence, 
it must invite -- it MUST invite -- the international community to 
assist in restoring security,'' Clinton said. Speaking to reporters 
on the White House lawn, he said he is reluctant to embrace further 
economic assistance to Indonesia if it continues to resist East 
Timor's ``clear, unambiguous'' vote for independence.

	Catfish Hunter Dies at 53

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, 53,  
died today after battling the muscle disease named after Lou 
Gehrig, a fellow baseball great. Hunter, who died at his home in 
Hertford, N.C., had fallen and hit his head on Aug. 8. He was sent 
home from the hospital on Saturday. In his career (1965-79), Hunter 
earned five World Series rings with the Oakland Athletics and the 
New York Yankees. The righty had five straight 20-victory seasons, 
pitched a perfect game and won a Cy Young Award. He went 224-166 
with a 3.26 ERA.

	Danforth Opens Waco Inquiry  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., opened an  
independent inquiry today into whether the FBI started the deadly 
fire at the Waco siege and later tried to cover its actions. Vowing 
to pursue the ``dark questions,'' Danforth pledged a thorough 
inquiry that could include questioning of Attorney General Janet 
Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh. ``The only thing I would ask is 
that he conduct a thorough and prompt investigation,'' said 
President Clinton.

	CIA Wary on N. Korea, Iran Missiles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the next 15 years, North Korea and Iran  
are likely to develop missiles potentially capable of killing 
millions of Americans, the CIA said today. In an intelligence 
report with major implications for the Pentagon's efforts to 
develop defenses against ballistic missiles, the CIA said Iraq 
posed an additional -- though somewhat more distant -- threat. The 
report is a summary of a classified National Intelligence Estimate, 
the first the CIA has done on ballistic missile threats since 1995.

<P>
	GOP Leaders Won't OK Budget Summit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top congressional Republicans said today they  
will not engage President Clinton in budget summit talks this year 
because he would insist on higher spending in exchange for the 
GOP's cherished tax cuts. ``We're just not prepared to trade with 
the president with the American people's money, a spending buck for 
me, a tax reduction for you,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, said. Armey renewed the GOP's pledge to use Social 
Security surpluses solely to reduce the $5.6 trillion national 
debt. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Offers Gun-Buyback Cash  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today introduced a $15  
million federal plan to buy back guns. The new program will give 
local police departments up to $500,000 to buy guns in and around 
public housing projects for a ``suggested price'' of $50. The guns 
will be destroyed. Clinton said American children under 15 are nine 
times more likely to die by accidental shooting than children in 
the other 25 industrialized nations combined.

<HEADLINE> STDs on Rise for Gay Seattle Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Syphilis and gonorrhea have surged among gay men  
in the Seattle area, suggesting that many of them are letting their 
guard down against AIDS and engaging in risky sex, the government 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said cases of  
syphilis among gay men in King County, which includes Seattle, 
increased from zero in 1996 to 46 during the first half of 1999. 
Gonorrhea went from 180 cases per 100,000 gay men in 1997 to 430 in 
1998 and 420 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the exact reason for the rise in the sexually  
transmitted diseases is unknown, the CDC said it appears to be due 
to an increase in unprotected sex with anonymous partners, 
especially in places like bathhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing in the Seattle population of men having sex with  
men large numbers of persons with large proportions of anonymous 
partners, and this has resulted in extensive transmission of 
syphilis,'' said Lyn Finelli, an epidemiologist with the CDC's 
National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC and other health officials have warned recently about  
growing complacency about AIDS because of the powerful new drug 
cocktails that can subdue the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend in Seattle is alarming because those infected with  
syphilis run a much higher risk of acquiring and transmitting the 
AIDS virus, the CDC said. In Seattle, more than 70 percent of the 
gay men infected with syphilis had the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think if we're not able to reverse these kinds of behavior,  
increased HIV rates will follow,'' said Alonzo Plough, director of 
public health for Seattle and King County. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar syphilis outbreaks in gay men have been reported in San  
Francisco and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Syphilis causes rashes and lesions and, if left untreated, can  
lead to degeneration of bones, heart and nerve tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	After an epidemic in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the number  
of cases of syphilis in King County dropped off dramatically in the 
mid-1990s. The estimated rate of syphilis in the Seattle area is 
projected at 200 per 100,000 gay men for 1999, compared with 90 per 
100,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a call for action, a reinvigorated education effort for  
gay men,'' said George Bakan, senior editor of the Seattle Gay 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's an absolutely dangerous decline in the amount  
of educational programs'' promoting safe sex, he said. ``Maybe 
we've lost that momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I think we always assume that young people just  
assimilate this information, and they don't. Many of these people 
come from homes where sex was just not talked about.''

<HEADLINE> CKE Selling Off 350 Restaurants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- CKE Enterprises plans to sell at least  
350 Hardee's and Carl's Jr. restaurants over the next 12 months to 
raise money for its program to remodel Hardee's outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant company also said Thursday that earnings  
second-quarter fell 54 percent as same store sales dropped for its 
fast-food chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $10.3 million, or 20 cents per share, for the  
quarter ending Aug. 10. That compares with earnings of $22.6 
million, or 42 cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues dropped 2 percent to $9.6 million for the quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Overall same-store sales fell 3.8 percent, although same-store  
sales for 114 Taco Bueno outlets, which operate in Texas and 
Oklahoma, were up 7.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Lead Over Gore Widening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has a commanding lead over Al  
Gore in a new poll about the 2000 presidential race, aided in part 
by a public desire for a change in national leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, governor of Texas and front-runner for the Republican  
nomination, had the support of 56 percent and Gore, vice president 
and Democratic front-runner, had the backing of 37 percent, in an 
ABC News-Washington Post poll out Wednesday. Bush had a similar 
lead in a matchup against the other Democrat in the race, former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who formally announced his candidacy 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has a better than two-to-one lead over Bradley among those  
who lean toward voting Democratic. But incumbency may be proving a 
burden for the vice president when competing with Bush, who has a 
four-to-one edge over his closest competitor, Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of all questioned in the poll, 53 percent, said  
they are tired of President Clinton. And almost that many, 48 
percent, said Gore is too close to Clinton to provide the country a 
fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bush and Gore were given credit for being honest and  
ethical by a majority, but Bush got far more credit for being a 
strong leader -- 70 percent to 38 percent for Gore. And Bush was 
given credit by two-thirds of those polled for having the right 
kind of personality for the job, while half said that about Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven out of 10 said they felt Bush was an interesting  
candidate, while more than half said they found Gore boring. Seven 
out of 10 say they need to know more about Bush, however, while 
just over half said that about Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people who say the country needs to move in a new  
direction has grown to almost half. Six months ago, more than half 
felt the country needed to keep moving in the same direction it has 
been moving under Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's advisers say they don't believe fatigue with the Clinton  
administration will be a major factor. But they have acknowledged 
that Gore's role as vice president may hinder public perception of 
him as a leader on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,526 adults was taken Aug. 30-Sept. 2 and has an  
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for 
subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Day of Nines Sparks Y2K Rehearsal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) -- It comes only once a century, and the  
day that lines up four ``9s'' arrived just in time to test whether 
the nation will have electricity when the millennium adds three 
``0s'' to the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities used the occasion for a nationwide drill, coordinated  
by the North American Electric Reliability Council, to test 
preparedness plans and backup systems for Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson personally supervised a  
test of the computers controlling the national power grid as the 
clock struck midnight for Sept. 9, 1999, or ``9-9-99'' -- an old 
computer command to end a program. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were designed to simulate electric outages in  
different parts of the nation, test communications under those 
circumstances and determine how utilities and agencies would 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of this latest national Y2K readiness test of the  
power grid came up with another pair of ``9s'' -- as in 99 percent 
ready for the millennium, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's still that 1 percent,'' Richardson said from the  
Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that transmits 
power throughout the Northwest. ``And that 1 percent covers a lot 
of consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he was concerned that eight major utilities and  
16 smaller municipal utilities or power cooperatives were not fully 
Y2K ready. There are about 3,000 utilities in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are close, but close is not good enough,'' he said. ``I  
won't rest until all consumers can be assured that utilities have 
adequately prepared for a smooth rollover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fear has been that any problems on Sept. 9 would be a  
precursor of the so-called Y2K or millennium bug -- when computers 
could malfunction as they misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Early computer programmers often used the numerical notation for  
Sept. 9, 1999, as the date representing infinity. They were sure 
the databases or programs would be replaced long before today 
rolled around. 
</P>
<P>
	The island of Guam -- on the other side of the international  
dateline -- was the first American territory to deal with the 
potential Sept. 9 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a non-event for Guam,'' government spokeswoman Ginger  
Cruz said after officials triple-checked computer systems. ``We can 
only hope that Y2K will be this uneventful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If any problems did develop, plenty of computer experts were on  
hand in Pennsylvania. There were 75 extra computer specialists and 
other staffers for PECO Energy Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really the first live test of the first vulnerable  
date,'' spokesman Michael Wood said today. ``We believe this 
exercise reinforces our confidence -- and hopefully it should 
increase the public's confidence -- in electric and utility services 
come the new year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina Electric Membership Corp. said it was pleased  
with early results of its test. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drill was one of the many efforts we are making to be  
ready for the Y2K event,'' said Chuck Terrill, chief executive 
officer of the NCEMC, which coordinated the state's 27 electric 
cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, technicians at Georgia Power were having a slow  
morning, according to utility spokeswoman Carol Boatright. ``We're 
simply monitoring everything, and everything is going well,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he has directed the Energy Department to conduct  
an additional 20 reviews of randomly selected electric utilities 
over the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critically important that by October or November that we  
be 100 percent compliant,'' he said. ``We can't just wait until 
three days before millennium starts to be compliant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Americans seemed unconcerned -- or even unaware -- of the  
high powered tests and fearful computer watching. Phoenix police 
Sgt. Michael Sheahan said today's date didn't bother him at all. 
``Four nines?'' he asked. ``That's a good poker hand in 5-card 
stud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A poll out today found a diminishing concern about Y2K. Barely  
one in 10 adults anticipates major computer problems on Jan. 1, 
2000, according to the USA Today/National Science Foundation poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 7 percent expect their personal lives to be disrupted in a  
major way, while 40 percent expect no problems. That's a drop from 
a survey conducted last December, when 14 percent said they 
expected major problems and 30 percent predicted none. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,014 adults was conducted in August by the Gallup  
Organization. It has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE>  Sammy Won't Sink With Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- He should be savoring the last few warm breezes  
of summer right about now, remembering the heft of history in his 
fingers, bookmarking the sights and sounds of one of the great 
closing chapters in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sammy Sosa can't. Not completely, anyway. Not while the rest  
of the ship is taking on water like the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever said that losing gets old fast must have been, like  
Sosa, trapped on a team as hopeless as the Chicago Cubs. And so, 
what seemed a short while ago to be a triumphant march toward 70 
home runs, that newly minted but still most-cherished record in 
baseball, has become a grueling crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fifth inning Thursday against Cincinnati, Sosa hit his  
59th home run of the season, leaving him on the brink of becoming 
the first slugger ever to notch two 60-homer seasons, and 
consecutive ones at that. 
</P>
<P>
	But the celebration turned out to be unmercifully brief. By the  
end of the afternoon, after the Reds climbed back to win 5-3 and 
hand the Cubs yet one more beating, the mood in the Chicago locker 
room was almost funereal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue doing my job,'' said Sosa, surrounded by  
a battery of TV cameras, ``and see what happens tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 59 was a laser beam that traveled 465 feet to the bleachers  
in dead centerfield before disappearing into the juniper bushes. It 
bought Sosa a breather from having to explain how he'd gone 
homerless the last three games -- imagine that -- but not from the 
larger debate that has sprung up around him. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, he had 21 home runs and the Cubs were in second place  
in the National League Central. Since then, Sosa raised his game to 
the point where he is on pace to hit 68 home runs this season. The 
Cubs, meanwhile, have lowered theirs to a winning percentage of 
under .300. After Thursday, they were on pace to lose 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, even though Sosa's current contract runs through  
2001, he sent a shrewdly timed message to management that he was 
interested in renegotiating. While the club remained silent, 
Chicago's two biggest daily newspapers played the debate out in the 
sports columns and the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Sosa baseball's savior or a sideshow? A team player or a  
restless opportunist? Someone who let his defense, baserunning and 
leadership lapse at the expense of his home-run totals? Would he 
look better in a halo or horns? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read the papers,'' he said. But a day earlier, in a  
reflective moment, Sosa admitted he would have exploded if the 
attention had been heaped on him 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm 30. I'm a man. I'm eating good, getting my rest,  
relaxing,'' he said. ``My first year, 1990, I hit 15 home runs with 
the White Sox and I thought I was Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are times, when he's around close friends, that he  
lets down his guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to him before the game,'' Reds shortstop Barry  
Larkin said, ``and the thing Sammy told me was that it's not the 
same because he's not playing for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That frustration was evident again the third inning when he went  
after a 3-0 offering from Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch and popped up 
weakly behind second base. Two innings after Sosa's home run, it 
bubbled to the surface again. With two out in the seventh and 
nobody on, Reds manager Jack McKeon brought in right-handed 
reliever Scott Williamson to pitch to Sosa. He chased two bad 
pitches and barely laid off a third that was a foot wide of the 
plate -- only because it was ball four. To top it off, Sosa got 
called out on strikes to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	His pal and only pursuer, Mark McGwire, isn't faring much  
better. The one-year anniversary of the big redhead's 
record-breaking 62nd homer passed Wednesday without much notice. 
McGwire, holding at 54, went 1-for-3 as the Braves completed a 
three-game sweep of the hapless Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still my friend,'' Sosa said. ``We just haven't had much  
time together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season feels so different from the last. The money hasn't  
changed and his celebrity has only grown. Sosa has his own 
endorsement label. He just bankrolled a medical center back in the 
Dominican Republic. Wherever he goes, whether it's New York or the 
Left Coast, the beautiful people stop by his locker to pay homage, 
to shake hands or press invitations into his palm. Bill Cosby 
dropped by Wrigley Field on Thursday to have Sosa tape a segment 
for his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, something is missing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to finish my job,'' Sosa said one more time, ``then  
put this all behind me.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> New HP CEO Lays Out Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- In one of her first appearances before  
customers, Hewlett-Packard Co. CEO Carleton Fiorina on Thursday 
acknowledged criticism that the computer maker was slow to respond 
to the Internet, but stressed that the company will aggressively 
roll out new online initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been said that Hewlett-Packard didn't jump on the  
electronic bandwagon fast enough,'' she told a conference of 
business executives. ``We did not articulate a single plan or 
vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prime focus going forward will be the world of Web services to  
be developed through the company's Internet business unit, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorina came to Hewlett-Packard in July from Lucent Technologies  
and spoke at a session originally booked for company chairman Lewis 
Platt. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the company spent most of its Internet-related time  
``bulletproofing customers,'' said Fiorina. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Hewlett-Packard has bought Open Skies, which sells  
airline tickets online, and stakes in Internet companies as 
vehicles to promote its hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can count on the fact that we will be a bit more  
aggressive this time around,'' said Fiorina, one of the nation's 
leading women executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the E-services World conference sponsored by  
Hewlett-Packard and other high-tech companies was to build business 
with decision makers while briefing them on the future of doing 
business on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Depression Felt in Most Workplaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Depression among workers poses problems in  
most American offices and factories, according to human resource 
managers who responded to a questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those human resource managers for 406 U.S. companies, more  
than half -- 56 percent -- said employees suffering from depression 
have had a negative impact on productivity at their companies in 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly four in 10 said depression among workers is a moderate or  
large problem for their companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, faxed to 2,300 companies, was conducted in July by  
the Society for Human Resource Management and the National 
Foundation for Brain Research. 
</P>
<P>
	About 17 million Americans experience serious depression each  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms that can indicate depression that human resource  
managers said they most often recognized among workers include 
tiredness or lethargy, poor concentration, a decline in 
productivity, overall sadness and an increase in unexplained 
absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the managers took action when they recognized a  
problem, however. Six out of 10 said they had taken steps such as 
suggesting the employee seek counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing a pretty good job at getting the word out that  
depression is an identifiable illness that affects productivity. 
However, we still have a ways to go in tying that together with 
good treatment,'' said Daniel J. Conti, who runs an employee 
assistance program for Bank One Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the companies responding to the survey have  
similar employee assistance programs that could arrange counseling 
for employees, and 98 percent have health insurance plans that 
cover treatment for mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	But managers and co-workers may not know how to approach someone  
who needs help, or confidentiality concerns may deter a worker from 
seeking assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	That's unfortunate, since co-workers and managers are in a good  
position to see early signs of depression and offer help, said Dr. 
Michael Thase, a psychiatry professor at the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best opportunity is when a productive and competent  
employee suddenly becomes less productive or competent,'' said 
Thase. ``In this day and in this work environment, it's likely to 
be a depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Society for Human Resource Management and the National  
Foundation for Brain Research suggested steps companies can take to 
break down barriers that may prevent workers from getting help. 
They include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Training managers in how to recognize depression and approach a  
worker to offer assistance, which may need to include a temporary 
reduction in workload or hours while treatment is sought. 
</P>
<P>
	--Offering all workers a confidential depression screening, which  
some companies have arranged with counseling services that provide 
a toll-free phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	--Using an outside employee assistance program, so workers don't  
feel they must share personal problems with a colleague to get 
help.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Returns to Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Silverbulletday returns to Belmont Park, the  
site of her only defeat this year, but this time she will be 
competing against 3-year-old fillies, not males. 
</P>
<P>
	And she is the early 1-5 favorite to beat them, as she almost  
always does, in the 1 1/8-mile Gazelle Saturday in her first start 
since finishing seventh in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes June 5 after 
having set the pace for than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	In another Grade I stakes on the card, Honor Glide, winner of  
the Bowling Green and Sword Dancer handicaps in his last two 
starts, is the 9-5 choice to beat seven rivals in the 1 3/8-mile Man 
o'War on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, ridden by Jerry Bailey, will leave from the  
rail in the six-horse Gazelle as she bids for her third straight 
win since the Belmont, her only race against males, and her eighth 
victory in nine starts this year. Her only other loss in 15 career 
starts was a fourth in the Del Mar Debutante last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In her last start, Silverbulletday won the 1 1/4-mile Alabama by  
nine lengths Aug. 21 at Saratoga. Her next start was expected to be 
in the Spinster at Keeneland. Trainer Bob Baffert, however, said 
Wednesday he decided to keep her in New York, where she also is 
supposed to run in the Beldame Oct. 9 at Belmont before going to 
Gulfstream Park for the Breeders' Cup Distaff Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	She would face older fillies in the 1 1/8-mile Beldame.  
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday will carry 124 pounds and spot from nine to 12  
pounds to Country Hideaway, Gold From the West, Awful Smart, 
Queen's Word and Singing Rockette. 
</P>
<P>
	Honor Glide, ridden by Jose Santos, moved up in the turf  
division by winning the 1 3/8-mile Bowling Green July 10 at Belmont 
and the 1 1/2-mile Sword Dancer Aug. 14 at Saratoga. Division leader 
Yagli finished last in the Sword Dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the $500,000 Man o'War are Val's Prince, Fahris,  
Single Empire, Mash One, Federal Trial and Beautiful Dancer. Each 
starter will carry 126 pounds.

Rangers as much as opposing hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first two months of this season, Burkett looked like  
a batting practice pitcher. For the past month, he's resembled the 
pitcher who won 22 games in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkett won his third straight start Wednesday night, pitching 6  
2-3 shutout innings in the Rangers' 3-0 win over Cleveland. His hot 
streak also began against the Indians, baseball's highest-scoring 
team, when he gave up just one run in eight innings three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has pitched back-to-back games as well as you can against  
that ballclub,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``When he's in a 
groove like that, he can throw any pitch where he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burkett (7-7) used different strategies in his two outings  
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 18, he got the Indians to chase high fastballs, leading  
to a season-high eight strikeouts. He tried it again Wednesday, but 
quickly shifted to Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to throw the ball up a couple of times, but I wasn't  
able to control it very well,'' he said. ``It seemed like I had 
really good control down, which is safer anyway, so I stuck with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By keeping the ball low, moving it inside and out and changing  
speeds, Burkett retired the first two batters in each of the first 
six innings. Oates pulled him with two outs in the seventh and 
runners on second and third. He left to a standing ovation from a 
crowd that had jeered him at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was warming up and they announced the battery, I  
happened to hear the boos. It was a nice feeling to be able to 
change that around,'' Burkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter fans remembered how lousy Burkett was in April and  
May, when he allowed 32 earned runs in 27 1-3 innings. He lost his 
spot in the rotation after allowing a club-record 12 runs in one 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	That dark side still lurks every time he takes the mound. For  
instance, he gave up eight runs in 2 2-3 innings of a 21-3 loss to 
New York in his only bad outing during the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just weird,'' said Burkett, who has a 2.33 ERA in three  
starts since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Another oddity is how well he's pitched in September and October  
since joining the Rangers in 1996. He's 8-3 with a 3.62 ERA in 
those months; during the rest of the season, he's 22-31 with a 5.48 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in September I concentrate a little harder,'' Burkett  
said. ``I really don't know what it is. I try to be on my game all 
the time. I go out there with the same attitude all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Rangers one game ahead of second-place Anaheim, Oates  
gambled that Burkett would be at his September best last season by 
letting him start twice in the final 10 games. Burkett won them 
both, allowing just two runs in 16 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Texas has an 8 1/2-game lead over Oakland in the AL  
West, so the focus is on trying to catch Cleveland and New York for 
the best record in the league and home-field advantage in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Rangers and Indians meet in the postseason, there's a  
good chance a key pitcher for Texas will be a guy who started the 
year 0-3 with a 13.23 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing,'' Burkett said, ``is no matter what happens, I  
have a lot of confidence in myself.''

<HEADLINE> No Free Tix at Salt Lake Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Already stung for giving out freebies,  
Salt Lake Olympic organizers say there will be no free tickets to 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime seats for speed skating events will cost up to $175, ski  
jumping at the Utah Winter Sports Park will set spectators back 
between $110 and $190, and seats for hockey's gold medal round will 
cost up to $425. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chief operating officer Fraser Bullock said Thursday the  
goal was to make the most money possible on the most popular events 
while keeping cheap seats available at as many venues as possible. 
The aim is to bring in $180 million in ticket revenue, calculated 
on the assumption that 85 percent of tickets will sell. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some bargains. A $35 ticket will get fans in to see  
bobsled, luge, curling, figure skating or Alpine skiing. Nordic 
skiing prices start at $30, and speed skating sells for as low as 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
	Those savings may well be offset by budget-busting prices for  
the opening and closing ceremonies. The numbers haven't been set 
but are likely to fall somewhere between next summer's games in 
Sydney -- where ceremony tickets will cost $970 -- and the 1996 
ceremonies in Atlanta, $750 by today's prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do know that we're going to be less than Sydney. We're not  
going to go higher than that,'' Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	And entrance to some sporting events may end up costing even  
more, because SLOC plans to put the first 86,600 seats -- 10 percent 
of all public tickets -- up for auction on the Internet. With bids 
starting at the face value of the tickets, expect prices to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than an attempt to gouge spectators, SLOC officials say,  
the move is an attempt to foil scalpers, who pushed prices for the 
Winter Olympics in Nagano and Lillehammer up as much as 10 times 
face value. SLOC hopes to have that auction online in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know those tickets are going to be out there being sold on  
the Internet anyway,'' Bullock said. ``It might as well be by us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another 20 percent of tickets will be allocated to Utah  
residents, who will get two or three months to buy them with 
priority seating. The remaining public tickets will be sold through 
a lottery similar to the one operated for the Atlanta games, 
through the Internet and by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic sponsors will pay for their own tickets, but will get  
first pick of seating and will take about 13 percent of the 
tickets. In a new experiment, SLOC hopes sponsors will agree to 
donate any unused seats to Utah youngsters. In Atlanta, those 
last-minute drop-out tickets were resold and the proceeds split 
between the committee and the sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the public seats, SLOC figures the media will take up  
243,233 seats. Participating athletes, the U.S. and International 
Olympic Committees, international sports federations and other 
members of the ``Olympic family'' will get another 66,000 seats, 
trimmed down about a third from SLOC's original estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	And SLOC president Mitt Romney, responding to questions from the  
board, said ``there's no harm in asking'' the IOC to pay for its 
own seats, even though SLOC agreed under contract to provide free 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be worth $20 million,'' Romney said. ``They'll  
probably say no. But it's worth asking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC plans to present its ticket structure to the IOC in Greece  
on Oct. 4, and hopes the IOC approves the plan by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also accepted a Mormon Church offer to turn a parking  
lot two blocks from its temple in downtown Salt Lake into an 
Olympics medals plaza. The proposal has drawn opposition from city 
leaders who hoped to locate the plaza eight blocks away on the lawn 
of the City-County Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Don Mischer Productions, which produced ceremonies for the  
Atlanta Olympics, was hired to produce Salt Lake's opening and 
closing ceremonies.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Storm Hits San Francisco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A rare, spectacular lightning storm flashed  
through the Bay area, bringing hail, rain and power outages. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak Wednesday night, the storm cut power to about 55,000  
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric customers. That figure was down to 9,400 by 
early today, utility spokeswoman Maureen Bogues said. 
</P>
<P>
	For about 12 hours, the storm touched off hundreds of lightning  
strikes from San Francisco to the Santa Cruz Mountains, 60 miles 
south. Trees and power poles were set on fire, making it dangerous 
for crews to fix electricity failures affecting spots from the 
Oregon line to Bakersfield, 400 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	One lightning bolt nicked a chimney in San Francisco and another  
in San Jose split a tree, part of which fell onto a house. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is spectacular,'' National Weather Service meteorologist  
Jeff Kopps said. ``It's just phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kopps estimated there hadn't been such a lightning storm in the  
area in more than 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 43.06 at 11,079.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Thursday as a late rally  
lifted a market that had sputtered for much of the day amid worries 
about a sinking dollar and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.06 to close at  
11,079.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also ended higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 rose 3.51 to 1,347.66, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 43.28 to 2,852.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet and technology companies were the strongest performers  
in a relatively quiet, flat market. IBM rose 4 to 134 3/4, helping the 
Dow contain its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo rose 9 1/4 to 162 11/16 after Lehman Brothers raised its  
rating on the stock to ``outperform'' from ``neutral.'' And online 
auctioneer eBay rose 9 11/16 to 144 7/16 after CIBC World Markets 
launched coverage with a ``strong buy'' recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	But for much of the session, the broader market languished due  
to the dollar's continuing decline against the Japanese yen. After 
the Japanese government released a stronger-than-expected report on 
the nation's economic growth, the dollar fell to a three-year low 
of 107.78 yen, down sharply from 111.08 yen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report and the rising value of the yen helped push  
Japan's Nikkei stock average 0.2 percent higher. Weakness in the 
dollar has been a persistent undercurrent in the U.S. stock market 
in recent weeks, as improving economies in Asia and Europe attract 
investors who previously sought out the relative safety of U.S. 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak dollar also makes imports more expensive, laying the  
ground for price inflation. That threat further unsettled 
investors, who already fear that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates a third time this year in its effort to quell 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Labor Department reported the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell 
unexpectedly last week to 286,000. Any level below 300,000 is 
considered a sign of an extremely tight labor market, potentially 
adding to the Fed's concerns that wage pressures are escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably stay in a holding pattern until more data  
comes out,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment 
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``Each bit of economic data is 
important as people try to figure out what the Fed is going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next key figure, the Producer Price Index, was scheduled for  
release Friday morning, and analysts say any surprise in the data 
could shake stocks out of their narrow trading range. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was a fairly neutral session as people wait for the  
PPI,'' said Dan Ascani, president and research director at Global 
Market Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, Ga. ``The fixation on the 
numbers has deterred a lot of people from making any big moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continued strength in energy stocks helped lift the market.  
Rising crude oil prices helped Dow component Chevron gain 3 1/8 to 97 
9/16, and BP Amoco rose 4 11/16 to 115 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were mostly lower, due largely to the interest  
rate fears. Chase Manhattan fell 4 1/4 to 77 1/2 after a Friedman 
Billings Ramsey analyst said the bank may see revenue from capital 
markets slip. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products dropped 2 1/4 to 40 1/16 amid reports the  
company is facing a federal investigation involving the 
government's 1996 approval of the drug Redux. American Home 
Products has already seen its share price battered as the company 
faces thousands of civil lawsuits over its diet drugs, which have 
been linked to heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were just even with decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 930.78 million shares, 
compared with 942.24 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.87 to 437.77.  
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, France's CAC-40 index rose 0.8 percent to a record  
close. Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent and Britain's FT-SE 100 
gained 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Returns to Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays designated  
hitter Jose Canseco was back in the starting lineup Thursday night 
after missing four games because of an injured right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jose looks like he's swinging the bat well and the hand is not  
bothering him,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild said before 
Thursday's game with the Detroit Tigers. ``He's back in the lineup 
and a welcome addition, I might add.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco hurt his hand during batting practice last month after  
undergoing back surgery in July. He went 12-for-37 (.324) with nine 
RBIs in 11 games after being activated from the 15-day disabled 
list on Aug. 20, but the hits were all singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco was hitting .281 with 31 home runs and 78 RBIs.

<HEADLINE>  Sammy Won't Sink With Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- He should be savoring the last few warm breezes  
of summer right about now, remembering the heft of history in his 
fingers, bookmarking the sights and sounds of one of the great 
closing chapters in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sammy Sosa can't. Not completely, anyway. Not while the rest  
of the ship is taking on water like the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever said that losing gets old fast must have been, like  
Sosa, trapped on a team as hopeless as the Chicago Cubs. And so, 
what seemed a short while ago to be a triumphant march toward 70 
home runs, that newly minted but still most-cherished record in 
baseball, has become a grueling crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fifth inning Thursday against Cincinnati, Sosa hit his  
59th home run of the season, leaving him on the brink of becoming 
the first slugger ever to notch two 60-homer seasons, and 
consecutive ones at that. 
</P>
<P>
	But the celebration turned out to be unmercifully brief. By the  
end of the afternoon, after the Reds climbed back to win 5-3 and 
hand the Cubs yet one more beating, the mood in the Chicago locker 
room was almost funereal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue doing my job,'' said Sosa, surrounded by  
a battery of TV cameras, ``and see what happens tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 59 was a laser beam that traveled 465 feet to the bleachers  
in dead centerfield before disappearing into the juniper bushes. It 
bought Sosa a breather from having to explain how he'd gone 
homerless the last three games -- imagine that -- but not from the 
larger debate that has sprung up around him. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, he had 21 home runs and the Cubs were in second place  
in the National League Central. Since then, Sosa raised his game to 
the point where he is on pace to hit 68 home runs this season. The 
Cubs, meanwhile, have lowered theirs to a winning percentage of 
under .300. After Thursday, they were on pace to lose 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, even though Sosa's current contract runs through  
2001, he sent a shrewdly timed message to management that he was 
interested in renegotiating. While the club remained silent, 
Chicago's two biggest daily newspapers played the debate out in the 
sports columns and the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Sosa baseball's savior or a sideshow? A team player or a  
restless opportunist? Someone who let his defense, baserunning and 
leadership lapse at the expense of his home-run totals? Would he 
look better in a halo or horns? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read the papers,'' he said. But a day earlier, in a  
reflective moment, Sosa admitted he would have exploded if the 
attention had been heaped on him 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm 30. I'm a man. I'm eating good, getting my rest,  
relaxing,'' he said. ``My first year, 1990, I hit 15 home runs with 
the White Sox and I thought I was Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are times, when he's around close friends, that he  
lets down his guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to him before the game,'' Reds shortstop Barry  
Larkin said, ``and the thing Sammy told me was that it's not the 
same because he's not playing for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That frustration was evident again the third inning when he went  
after a 3-0 offering from Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch and popped up 
weakly behind second base. Two innings after Sosa's home run, it 
bubbled to the surface again. With two out in the seventh and 
nobody on, Reds manager Jack McKeon brought in right-handed 
reliever Scott Williamson to pitch to Sosa. He chased two bad 
pitches and barely laid off a third that was a foot wide of the 
plate -- only because it was ball four. To top it off, Sosa got 
called out on strikes to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	His pal and only pursuer, Mark McGwire, isn't faring much  
better. The one-year anniversary of the big redhead's 
record-breaking 62nd homer passed Wednesday without much notice. 
McGwire, holding at 54, went 1-for-3 as the Braves completed a 
three-game sweep of the hapless Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still my friend,'' Sosa said. ``We just haven't had much  
time together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season feels so different from the last. The money hasn't  
changed and his celebrity has only grown. Sosa has his own 
endorsement label. He just bankrolled a medical center back in the 
Dominican Republic. Wherever he goes, whether it's New York or the 
Left Coast, the beautiful people stop by his locker to pay homage, 
to shake hands or press invitations into his palm. Bill Cosby 
dropped by Wrigley Field on Thursday to have Sosa tape a segment 
for his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, something is missing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to finish my job,'' Sosa said one more time, ``then  
put this all behind me.''

<HEADLINE> Matthews Ready for 1st NFL Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Shane Matthews is used to people  
doubting him. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened when he was at Florida, where he led the Gators to a  
28-8 record and two SEC championships in three years as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened his first five years in the NFL, when he was cut  
four times by the Chicago Bears alone. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's happening now, even though the quarterback will start  
Sunday's season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful if you play well and you can say, `Hey, I've  
showed these people that I can play,''' Matthews said. ``But I'm 
not worried about those people that doubted me. I just want to go 
out and prove to my teammates and my coaches and myself that I can 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a great opportunity for me,'' he added. ``I'm  
looking forward to it. I'm thankful that (coach) Dick Jauron 
believes in me. He's given me this chance, and I'm going to try and 
take full advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of snickers when the Bears cut Erik Kramer two  
days before training camp began. Rookie Cade McNown hadn't signed 
yet, and the Bears were going to rely on Matthews? Come on. 
</P>
<P>
	He set 50 Gators records and 19 SEC marks at Florida but hasn't  
duplicated that success in the NFL. He's been in the league five 
years but has played in just two games, never starting. 
</P>
<P>
	He's bounced between the third string, the practice squad and  
the waiver wire. He's spent part of almost every season at home, 
waiting for a team to call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to quit or anything, but I never knew that my  
day would come,'' he said. ``But it goes to show that if you keep 
working hard, good things will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews never doubted he could play. He did, after all, survive  
three years with Florida coach Steve Spurrier, not exactly a 
warm-and-fuzzy forgiving type. He threw for 9,287 yards and 74 
touchdowns in the Fun 'N' Gun system. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also the only quarterback Spurrier never benched, and the  
two still talk at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about opportunity. You can't show what you can do  
if you're never put on the field,'' Matthews said. ``There are a 
lot of guys in this league that have never been given a chance. And 
there are some guys that have been given thousands of chances and 
they go out and play terrible and continue to keep their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews got his shot when McNown sat out the first 11 days of  
training camp. Though McNown is the team's future, he's not ready 
to take over the starting role just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Matthews wasn't exactly awe-inspiring, either. He was  
8-for-18 for 110 yards in his first preseason game, and 5-for-7 for 
85 yards with a touchdown and an interception in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't been a starter since college,'' he said. ``The first  
couple of preseason games, I went out there and played a little bit 
timid, scared to make mistakes. I've put that behind me the last 
two preseason games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went 21-for-24 for 228 yards and two touchdowns without an  
interception in the last two preseason games. His final preseason 
rating was 107.8, seventh-best among quarterbacks who threw 40 
passes or more. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also a good fit for the Bears' new offense, which has  
multiple sets and requires the quarterback to call plays on the fly 
at the line of scrimmage. At Florida, Matthews estimates he called 
audibles on 82 percent of the plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays with a good, fast tempo,'' Bears offensive  
coordinator Gary Crowton said. ``He's very accurate. He has a good 
release and he gets rid of the ball fast. The way his mind works is 
good for the coaches because he thinks like we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews knows he's got plenty of doubters, and he's OK with  
that. It isn't the first time, and it probably won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are a lot of people who have already written us  
off for the first game since I've never started a game, we have so 
many young players, we have a new coach and this and that,'' he 
said. ``But in this league, anybody can beat anybody. If we 
outprepare those guys and go out there and outexecute them, we'll 
win.''

<HEADLINE> Holan Tries Comeback With Thrashers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Milos Holan realizes the odds are stacked  
against him. Even though the Atlanta Thrashers are an expansion 
team, he's a longshot to make the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	That's OK. The 28-year-old defenseman is not going to get  
uptight during training camp, wondering if this will be the day he 
gets called into the coach's office and told, ``Thanks, but we 
don't have a spot for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leukemia has a way of changing your perspective. For Holan,  
hockey stopped being the No. 1 thing in his life after he spent 
eight months staring at the walls of a hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just doing my best and then I will see what happens,''  
said Holan, who hasn't played in the NHL since undergoing a 
bone-marrow transplant during the 1995-96 season. ``If that's good 
enough, I'll stay. If not, I'll go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holan was an up-and-coming player from the Czech Republic in  
October 1995 when a routine physical changed his life forever. 
Doctors discovered a frightful disease lurking within his seemingly 
healthy body: chronic granuloctic leukemia, a deadly form of blood 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't clearly understand what the word leukemia meant,''  
said Holan, speaking with a thick Czech accent. ``I asked if I 
could die. The doctor said yes. That's when I started worrying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He actually mustered the strength to play 16 games for the  
Anaheim Mighty Ducks while awaiting his marrow transplant. No one 
in his family was a match, so doctors searched for an anonymous 
donor who would be close enough to attempt the high-risk procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1996, a suitable donor was found and Holan entered  
the hospital, not knowing if he would leave alive. After massive 
doses of radiation and chemotherapy wiped out the cancerous cells -- 
but also killed his marrow and immune system -- he received the new 
marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	So began a tortuous ordeal of complications that tested his will  
to live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heart, kidney, gall bladder. I couldn't eat for months,'' said  
Holan, who wilted from a strapping 200-pound athlete to a feeble, 
140-pound patient. ``I thought every day would be my last day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Irena, remained with him around the clock. The couple  
already had a daughter and Irena was pregnant with their first son. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind, I kept fighting every day so I could see my son,''  
Holan recalled. ``That gave me a life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was finally released from the hospital for good on July 3,  
1996, the same day Milos Jr. was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, patients that don't get a perfect match don't ever  
recover fully,'' said Dr. Stephen Foreman, who performed the 
surgery on Holan. ``But his recovery has been amazing. Hockey 
players are tough guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were trying times, like those first few days away from the  
hospital. Instead of feeling comforted about being at home, Holan 
was frightened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought no one was there to help me,'' he said. ``I begged  
my wife to take me back to the hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't, and Holan gradually regained his strength. He served  
as a color commentator for Czech television during the 1998 Nagano 
Olympics, watching his countrymen capture the gold medal. He wrote 
a book about his ordeal. He attempted a comeback with the Mighty 
Ducks last year, but was cut without playing an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Holan began playing in the Czech league in November, totaling 22  
points in 30 games for Vitkovice. He showed enough potential to 
earn one last chance at restarting his NHL career. 
</P>
<P>
	All he asks from the Thrashers is a legitimate shot to make the  
23-man roster. If things don't work out, he will retire as a player 
and rejoin his family -- daughter Veronica is 7, Milos Jr. is 3 -- in 
the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this team doesn't look at me as someone who got sick,''  
said Holan, who has shown no signs of relapse. ``I want them to 
look at me as someone who can help the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense is one of the strongest positions on the Thrashers, who  
already have nine players with NHL experience. But general manager 
Don Waddell remembered Holan's shooting and stick-handling skills, 
pre-leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can bring his skill level back to where it was three  
years ago, it would certainly be a great addition to our hockey 
club,'' Waddell said. ``He's still a young person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Holan finally met the donor who provided the  
lifesaving marrow: Robert Stransky Jr., a nuclear engineer from 
Jessup, Md. They got together at the City of Hope hospital in 
southern California, where the transplant was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `Thank you for saving my life,''' Holan  
remembered. ``It was as simple as that.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters One Step From Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So far, so good.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams, tennis father and coach, surveyed the U.S.  
Open draw before the tournament began and decided it wasn't that 
complicated. Forget the rest of the women's field, he said. His 
daughters, Venus and Serena, would make the final a Williams family 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 124 players ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The women's draw at the Open is down to the final four and the  
Williams sisters are still at it, one match away from making 
poppa's prophecy come true. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step on Friday will be the toughest of all. In  
semifinal matches, Venus Williams faces top-seeded Martina Hingis 
and sister Serena meets defending champion Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport and Serena Williams completed the semifinal pairings  
with three-set victories Wednesday. Davenport survived two match 
points and held off Mary Pierce 6-2. 3-6, 7-5. Then Williams 
defeated former champ Monica Seles 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Hingis beat Anke Huber 6-2, 6-0 and Venus  
Williams downed Barbara Schett 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	So what about pop's prediction?  
</P>
<P>
	``I still have one more match,'' Serena Williams said. ``My dad  
has been right about a lot of things. If I can do well in this 
match, I know it will be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport and Hingis are entirely capable of upsetting the  
Williams plans. Both have won the U.S. Open and came into this 
tournament ranked 1-2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport has won 12 straight matches over the past two years at  
the Open and had not dropped a set until the quarterfinals against 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis has been on a straight-set march through the tournament  
and reached the semifinals at the Open for the fourth straight 
year. She has one championship and one runner-up finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis has a 7-3 record against Venus Williams, including  
victories in three of their last four meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena has beaten Davenport in two of their three meetings, both  
times on the same kind of hardcourts they've been hitting on at the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't disturb Davenport, who will always have a warm spot  
in her heart for the National Tennis Center because she earned her 
first Grand Slam title there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the court here,'' she said. ``It's fast. It's good for  
my game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a good time trying to defend this title, whether it  
ends Friday, ends Saturday, whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport was asked if she might have preferred Seles in the  
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serena is probably a little more athletic and plays a little  
better defense,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it seemed Davenport might not reach the semifinals.  
Pierce had the defending champion in deep trouble but let her get 
away. A rain delay in the third set helped Davenport regroup after 
avoiding the two match points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have been home when the rain came,'' she said. ``I'm  
just lucky to be there. Sometimes, it just turns the tournament 
around and you play even better after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serena has taken a tough path to the semis, dropping the first  
set in each of her last three matches but recovering each time to 
advance. Venus, too, hit a speed bump when she dropped the first 
set of her match against Mary Joe Fernandez before rallying. 
</P>
<P>
	If they win Friday, the Williams sisters would play each other  
for the fourth time. Venus has won the first three and Serena 
thinks she knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus is a more powerful player than I am,'' she said. ``I use  
more of the court than Venus, although she's doing that a lot 
better now. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a bigger serve but I have more aces.''  
</P>
<P>
	Both of them have made poppa proud, and after losing to Serena,  
Seles understood their father's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's Venus' and Serena's time,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Deputy Waco Investigator Is Chosen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The lawyer selected by former Sen. John  
Danforth to assist in his probe of the Waco siege is a federal 
prosecutor who comes from a family prominent in law and public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth selected U.S. Attorney Edward L. Dowd Jr., a Democrat,  
as his deputy in the probe of the 1993 incident that left cult 
leader David Koresh and 80 followers dead in a fiery blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd, 51, who was named U.S. attorney in 1993, resigned to take  
the Danforth job. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was made a day after Danforth accepted U.S.  
Attorney General Janet Reno's invitation to head the investigation 
into whether the FBI started the deadly fire and tried to cover up 
its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a person of persuasive character and knows what he wants  
to do, then he goes after it with a lot of zeal,'' said Dowd's 
brother William, also an attorney. ``Senator Danforth has known him 
for a long time and knew his record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd, 51, grew up in St. Louis and graduated with honors in 1977  
from St. Mary's Law School in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	His family is prominent in St. Louis law circles, and many  
members hold public office. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Edward L. Dowd Sr., was city circuit attorney in the  
1950s and was the 1972 Democratic nominee for governor. A brother, 
James R. Dowd, and a cousin, Robert G. Dowd Jr., serve on the 8th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. They are both former 
St. Louis Circuit Court judges. Another cousin, David Dowd, is the 
city's chief workers' compensation judge. 
</P>
<P>
	There are five Dowds in the St. Louis firm of Dowd &AMP; Dowd, that  
was established in the 1950s by the father. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd worked as an assistant federal prosecutor in St. Louis from  
1979 to 1984. He won about 30 trials and coordinated the U.S. 
attorney's drug task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, also from St. Louis, described Dowd as ``a person who  
is very highly regarded in our community, a very respected 
prosecutor.''

<HEADLINE> Armed Man Menaces Abortion Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A man arrived at a hospital with a  
shotgun Thursday, saying he wanted to kill abortion-performing 
doctors. He was overpowered by guards and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	No shots were fired and no one was injured in the arrest of the  
28-year-old Lincoln Park man. The suspect, who police did not 
identify, was in custody and was to be charged with assault with 
intent to commit murder, Dearborn police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man drove up to Oakwood Hospital's main entrance about 10:30  
a.m. with a 12-gauge shotgun and was ``threatening to kill all 
doctors performing abortions,'' police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told detectives that doctors who perform abortions are  
``murderers who must be killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect further claims that a girlfriend or former wife  
had an abortion sometime in the past and he is avenging the 
so-called `murder' of his daughter,'' a police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the suspect was taking drugs for depression  
and was to undergo a mental examination. Oakwood spokeswoman Laurie 
Armstrong said it was not hospital policy to perform abortions.

<HEADLINE> Black Church Group Picks New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A Philadelphia minister who promised to  
reform the leadership of the nation's largest black church group 
was elected president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. 
Inc. Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William Shaw beat 10 other candidates to succeed the  
Rev. Henry J. Lyons, the minister imprisoned for using the powerful 
position to bilk and steal more than $4 million from companies and 
organizations so he could live in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a point of beginning for us,'' Shaw said after the vote  
was announced. ``I would ask now that we go home and vow in prayer 
that God would give the direction that we ought to take from this 
point on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw received 3,694 votes. The Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson was a  
close second with 3,451 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 65, has been pastor of White Rock Baptist Church for 43  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said the convention's problems stem from ``a lack of  
accountability and a failure to center the convention around 
Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the power of the presidency is multiplied when it is  
shared,'' he said earlier this week during a forum where he 
introduced the members of his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, who placed third to Lyons in 1994, was among a group of  
ministers who unsuccessfully attempted to oust him in 1997 when 
Lyons came under federal and state investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, resigned after he was convicted in February of  
swindling $4 million from businesses and keeping nearly $250,000 
contributed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith to rebuild 
burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the scandal, Shaw and other candidates said the  
president's powers, including control over the group's checkbook, 
should be reduced. Several board members are appointed by the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who was paid $100,000 as president, is serving 5 1/2 years  
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which traces its roots to 1880, claims 8.5  
million members, though at Lyons' trial prosecutors said the figure 
was inflated to attract businesses. They said membership is around 
1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Angelique Walker-Smith, a New York City minister who  
voted for Richardson, said Shaw will help bring the convention 
closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Shaw is an honorable, loving, Christian gentleman and I  
think the convention will be blessed,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Found Off Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An explorer searching for ancient shipwrecks  
found a large undersea field seeping natural gas off the coast of 
the Gaza Strip and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by marine geologist Robert Ballard was announced  
Thursday by the National Geographic Society, which sponsored his 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a natural gas reservoir was found undersea off the  
Israeli city of Ashdod, north of Gaza, estimated to be able to 
produce 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard's discovery indicates the gas field extends south, along  
the full length of the Gaza Strip and the coast of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just one hole,'' Ballard said of the Ashdod well.  
``If you were to exploit this field you would have many rigs ... so 
clearly it's sizable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But politics could complicate development of the field's natural  
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gaza Strip, along the coast of southern Israel adjacent to  
the border with Egypt, is jointly administered by Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said he has not been in touch with either the Israeli or  
Palestinian officials about the find, but is confident both know of 
it because an Israeli observer was on board his research vessel, 
along with Palestinian crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshe Friedman, spokesman for the Israeli Infrastructure  
Ministry, said Thursday that he had not heard of the natural gas 
fields and would not be able to comment without more details. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same research trip, Ballard also located the wrecks of  
two ancient Phoenician ships, the oldest vessels ever discovered in 
the deep sea, dating from about 750 B.C. It was that search that 
led to the gas discovery, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out that the Phoenician ships have a particular  
sonar signature,'' Ballard explained. ``We were using sonar to get 
what we call an acoustic signature and ran around the ships at 
different angles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said they would find a depression in the sea floor and  
something hard within the depression -- the hard object turned out 
to be the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	After the researchers finished their work on the Phoenician  
ships, they steamed along the coast to look for other sunken 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The sonar detected what appeared to be hundreds of ships.  
</P>
<P>
	``We said, 'That can't be true,''' Ballard recalled. ``So we  
sent the Jason vehicle down, which can actually see, and in these 
depressions were deposits caused by seepage coming in contact with 
ocean and rising from deposits was gas. I realized what we had 
found because I'm a geologist,'' Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bubbles expanded in size as they rose toward the surface  
of the sea,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The long narrow depressions were probably associated with cracks  
in the earth that create a way for the gas to escape from 
underground reservoirs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard also reported finding concentrations of tube worms and  
beds of clams surrounding the vents. These were similar to those he 
found surrounding hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Islands in 
the Pacific, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galapagos worms marked the first discovery of living things  
that used chemical energy rather that relying on the sun for 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, president of the Institute for Exploration in Mystic,  
Conn., is a longtime ocean explorer, probably best known for 
locating the wreck of the Titanic in the cold, dark waters of the 
North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the National Geographic Society and his Institute  
for Exploration, Ballard's research off the Israeli coast was 
sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institute and Leon Levy Expeditions.

<HEADLINE> Former Ark. Kicker Little Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Arkansas kicker Steve Little was  
remembered Thursday as a courageous man who kept a positive 
attitude under trying circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, 43, had a record-setting career at Arkansas but his  
professional career came to a stark end when he was paralyzed from 
the neck down in a car accident in 1980 -- the day he was cut by the 
St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles said people should  
learn from Little's poise. 
</P>
<P>
	Broyles, who recruited and coached Little, spoke to 250 during a  
memorial service Thursday. Little tied an NCAA record with a 
67-yard field goal against rival Texas in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Monday at his home in Little Rock. The cause of death  
has not been determined, but may have been from complications 
related to the 1980 wreck, according to his brother, Gene Little. 
</P>
<P>
	Former teammates signed two footballs in the lobby of the  
funeral home where Thursday's service was held. A portrait of 
Little making a kick stood in the room where the service was held. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-yard field goal against Texas tied the record set by  
Texas' Russell Erxleben. The Texas kicker recalled Thursday that 
Little was lined up to kick a 66-yarder but, before the play, moved 
the tee back a yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothered me when he did it because I thought he stuck it in  
my face. But I can't tell you how happy I am today he did it,'' 
Erxleben said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erxleben attended the service along with many former Razorbacks  
players, including linebacker Mike Massey, defensive end Jim Howard 
and offensive tackle Gerald Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Former defensive tackle Brison Manor, who played with Little at  
Arkansas and went on to play for the Denver Broncos, was among 
those sitting with Little's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not his brother but that's the way we treated each other.  
It's part of being a Razorback,'' Manor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Little came to Arkansas in 1974 from Shawnee Mission South High  
School in Overland Park, Kan., where he was an all-state 
quarterback and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broyles remembers making eight consecutive Sunday trips to  
Little's home to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a kicker bad and he was the best in the world,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Little played for the Razorbacks from 1974 to 1977, setting  
school records for points by a kicker (280) while making 53 of 89 
field goals, including seven of 13 from beyond 50 yards. He also 
made 121 of 131 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Victor Nixon said he remembered watching Little play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I was the only Razorback fan who asked, `How can  
he do that?''' Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, Little played for the Arkansas team that defeated  
Georgia 31-10 in the Cotton Bowl and in 1978 was a member of the 
team that beat Oklahoma 31-6 in the Orange Bowl.

<HEADLINE> NASA Switches Two Shuttle Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is flipping its next two space  
shuttle flights by placing a trip to the Hubble Space Telescope 
ahead of an Earth-mapping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will fly at the end of October followed by Endeavour  
in November, pending the outcome of ongoing wiring inspections, 
NASA said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle fleet has been virtually grounded because of damaged  
wires. The problem popped up during the last launch in July, when 
an exposed wire caused a short-circuit that knocked out two of 
Columbia's main engine computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Endeavour was supposed to lift off in mid-September with a radar  
to map Earth's surface, followed by Discovery in mid-October with 
crucial replacement parts for Hubble. Both missions were delayed, 
however, after inspections uncovered dozens of damaged wires in the 
two ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's liftoff is now targeted for no earlier than Oct. 28.  
Endeavour, which requires more work, is tentatively scheduled to 
take off Nov. 19 at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Paying $1.9M Over Shawmut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The investment division of Fleet Financial  
Group has agreed to pay $1.9 million to settle charges by federal 
regulators that Shawmut National Bank of Boston, which Fleet later 
acquired, misused brokerage commissions to pay for client 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement  
Thursday with Fleet, the nation's ninth-largest bank with assets of 
$104.4 billion. The SEC also filed related fraud charges against 
East West Institutional Services Inc., a Detroit brokerage firm, 
and eight individuals, including Michael J. Rothmeier, the former 
president of Shawmut's investment operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet and two of the individuals agreed to settle the civil  
fraud charges, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. East West, 
Rothmeier and the other five people are contesting the charges, and 
their cases will go before an administrative law judge at the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet already has repaid approximately $1.7 million of the  
settlement amount to former Shawmut clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that beginning in mid-1993, Shawmut Investment  
Advisers Inc. violated its responsibility to its pension fund 
clients by failing to tell them that the brokerage commissions they 
paid went to brokers who referred new clients to Shawmut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Full and fair disclosure to investors is the foundation of the  
federal securities laws,'' Juan Marcel Marcelino, the SEC's 
district administrator in Boston, said in a statement. 
``(Investment) advisers must disclose any and all arrangements 
regarding their use of clients' commissions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, in a statement from its Boston headquarters, noted that  
it ``promptly initiated its own internal investigation of these 
practices'' by the former Shawmut division and ``voluntarily 
disclosed'' their existence to the SEC in May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Andreoff, an attorney representing East West,  
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmeier's lawyer, James Quarles, didn't immediately return a  
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC action follows an investigation by the market watchdog  
agency, the FBI and the Labor Department into allegations that 
brokers and pension managers received kickbacks or gifts in 
exchange for steering investments to Shawmut. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the three federal agencies looked into  
allegations that at least two pension funds -- a Teamsters pension 
fund in Chicago and a public fund in Rhode Island -- were bilked of 
millions of dollars in the scheme, The Associated Press reported in 
July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal, legal and labor sources told The AP the investigators  
reviewed union and investment records in at least four states, 
trying to determine whether questionable commissions that Shawmut 
paid to several East West brokers compromised the pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Fleet voluntarily repaid former clients of Shawmut,  
including one of the pension funds, about $1 million for 
questionable commissions. Fleet, which had acquired Shawmut in 
December 1995, became legally liable for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding East West, Fleet said at the time that a review of  
records kept by Shawmut indicated that the commissions paid to the 
brokerage firm may have been improper because it may not have 
performed research for which it had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago attorney had pushed for an explanation of what  
happened with the funds and a closer examination of ties between 
East West, Teamsters officials and alleged associates of organized 
crime in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Fleet voluntarily repaid approximately $700,000  
last spring. The $1.7 million the bank has paid was credited toward 
the settlement announced Thursday with the SEC, and Fleet has 
agreed to pay the remaining $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The two individuals who agreed to settlements with the SEC are  
two former Shawmut traders, Karen Michalski and Christopher D. 
Sargent. They agreed, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to 
refrain from future violations of securities laws, to each pay a 
$5,000 civil fine, and to be barred from the investment advising 
business with a right to reapply after 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Rothmeier, the people contesting the SEC's  
charges are Clarke T. Blizzard, former vice president of sales at 
Shawmut Investment Advisers Inc.; Rudolph Abel and Donald C. Berry, 
former chief investment officers at Shawmut Investment Advisers; 
Christopher P. Roach, a broker at East West; and Craig Janutol, 
president of East West.

<HEADLINE> Pluma Inc. Going Out of Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN, N.C. (AP) -- Pluma Inc., a maker of fleece and other  
active-wear products that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier 
this year, is going out of business and laying off 1,000 workers at 
four plants in North Carolina and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very unfortunate thing, but given our debt load, we  
didn't have any other choice,'' president John Wigodsky said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees will lose their jobs during the next three months,  
Wigodsky said. In Eden, two plants will close by the end of next 
week, putting 500 employees out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Eden-based Pluma, which filed for Chapter 11  
reorganization in May, gave up on finding investors to help it pull 
out of nearly $120 million in debt. They attributed the company's 
failure to foreign competition and poor business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluma, whose brands include Snowbank and Santee clothing, grew  
from a small firm of 80 employees in 1986 to a large, 
publicly-traded company of about 2,000 employees with eight 
different plants. 
</P>
<P>
	But it had been struggling to stem losses since the fourth  
quarter of 1997. The company posted a loss of $36.1 million in 1998 
on sales of $187.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It listed $136.5 million in assets and $118.9 million in debts  
in its bankruptcy petition. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a restructuring plan to cut costs, the company closed  
plants in North Carolina, Virginia and California and cut its work 
force by more than 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Receive Anonymous Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The umpires are at it again.  
</P>
<P>
	National League umpire Steve Rippley has decided against  
retirement, and members of the group trying to oust union leader 
Richie Phillips have received an anonymous letter, accusing each of 
them of being ``a cowardly, selfish scab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How could you jump out of the foxhole in the midst of battle  
and desert your friends for your own selfishness?'' said the 
letter, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. ``How could you 
pledge your allegience to the `intelligence' of Joe Brinkman and 
John Hirschbeck?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, who hasn't worked since his colleagues lost their jobs,  
called the National League office last Thursday, intending to 
retire, but was told to take several days off to think it over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rippley, in all likelihood, will resume active umpiring on  
Friday in Cincinnati,'' Phillips said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The handwritten letter, postmarked in Santa Ana, Calif., on Aug.  
31, was received by about 25 umpires who oppose the union 
leadership, one member of the anti-Phillips faction said, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips engineered the failed strategy of mass resignations,  
which cost 22 umpires their jobs Sept. 2. Phillips' supporters in 
the union say the resignation strategy would have been successful 
had they all stuck with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, you abandoned the ship! You sunk the ship!'' said  
the letter, which contained misspellings and had several words 
underlined for emphasis. ``Now you have to look at yourself in the 
mirror every day forever and see the reflection of a cowardly, 
selfish scab! You can change. You can return your allegience to 
where it belongs!'' 
</P>
<P>
	To form a new union or decertify the current union, 30 percent  
of umpires must file a petition with the National Labor Relations 
Board, which would then hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty gutless person that would write something and  
send out letters and not put their signature to it,'' Hirschbeck 
said. ``I've never not signed a letter in my life. I would assume 
it's from a current umpire or one of the 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on whether the 22 umpires who were let go last week  
count as part of the bargaining unit, there are either 71 or 93 
major league umpires eligible to vote. Fourteen umpires issued a 
statement in July condemning Phillips, and the group now thinks it 
has the support of about 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction is led by three AL umpires: Brinkman,  
Hirschbeck and Davey Phillips. Working with agent Ron Shapiro, who 
has been advising them, the group drafted a response to the 
anonymous letter and was in the process Wednesday of sending it out 
to all umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not have trouble looking at ourselves in the mirror,''  
the group said. ``As for the cowardly comment, we have and will 
continue to stand tall when it comes to our decisions. We will not 
be swayed by the peer pressure, name calling, threats ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips announced July 14 that more than 50 umpires were  
resigning en masse, effective Sept. 2, with umpires saying they 
wanted to prod baseball into an early start of negotiations for a 
labor contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when more than two dozen umps -- nearly  
all in the American League -- either refused to resign or quickly 
withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 umps from the minor leagues and accepted  
the resignations of 22 veterans. Umpires sued to stop baseball from 
letting the 22 go, and in a deal worked out last week in federal 
court, the matter will go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that with a different negotiation approach  
for our association, we will ... save some of the jobs that Richie 
Phillips lost with his flawed and ridiculous strategy,'' the 
anti-Phillips group said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman on July 29  
warned umpires against making threats or attempting to intimidate 
their colleagues. That statement came as Hirschbeck's wife received 
a letter from Ed Montague's wife, calling her husband a ``Judas'' 
for opposing the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for umpires and the leagues held a telephone conference  
call Wednesday to discuss selecting an arbitrator from among the 15 
on a list provided by the American Arbitration Association's 
Philadelphia office. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sides can't agree on arbitrator, they will take turns  
striking names until one remains. That process could begin today or 
Friday, one lawyer said on the condition he not be identified.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The release of unexpectedly strong data on Japan's  
economy sent the dollar plummeting against the yen today and 
boosted Tokyo share prices slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 108.84 yen in late trading, down 2.38 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
111.08 yen overnight. It ranged between 108.73 yen and 111.16 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 36.18 points,  
or 0.21 percent, to close at 17,677.56. On Wednesday, the average 
closed down 66.12 points, or 0.37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency shocked economists when it  
announced that Japan's real gross domestic product grew 0.2 percent 
in the April-June quarter from the prior quarter, or an annual pace 
of expansion of 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had forecast on average a 0.4 percent  
quarter-on-quarter contraction of the GDP, or the value of all 
goods and services produced in a country. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said market participants' attention was now fixed on  
whether or not the Bank of Japan would buy dollars to stem the 
yen's appreciation against the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.55 yen, down  
from 118.24 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices advanced moderately on the GDP  
figures, but the yen's strengthening against the dollar kept gains 
to a minimum, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's reaction to GDP was short-term,'' said Paul  
Migliorato, senior salesman at Commerzbank, adding that investors 
quickly turned cautious as the yen advanced above the 110-yen level 
following release of the data. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts Japan's exporters because it pushes up the  
prices of their goods overseas, making the companies less 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 473.99 million shares changed hands on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, down from 484.61 million 
shares Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners outnumbered advancers 586 to 564, while 185 issues  
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 2.21 points to close at 11,036.34. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.05 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,507.62. The 
TOPIX closed down 2.05 points, or 0.14 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8200 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8100 percent. Its 
price fell 0.09 points to 100.67.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Futures Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Thursday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors maneuvered ahead of the 
government's monthly harvest reports. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn prices declined as the market anticipated only a minor  
reduction by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in its forecast of 
the nation's largest crop. 
</P>
<P>
        Concerns that crops have matured too quickly are balanced by  
the recent run of good drying weather. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans initially rebounded from the previous day amid investor  
jockeying ahead of Friday's USDA reports on production and supply and 
demand, but fell late in the session, dragged down by corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures were pressured by concerns about the world supply  
level. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 3/4 cent to $2.85 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 2 cents to $2.19 cents a bushel; December oats rose 
1/2 cent to $1.16 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 1 cent to $5. 
07 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

        October live cattle fell .35 cent to 68.17 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle fell .30 cent to 78.97 cents a pound; October lean hogs

<HEADLINE> A Glance At The Waco Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI's grudging acknowledgment that it was  
less than candid about its role in the final hours of the 51-day 
standoff with the Branch Davidian sect near Waco, Texas, has raised 
new questions and prompted yet another investigation into the 
tragic events of April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday named former Sen. John  
Danforth, R-Mo., to lead an independent investigation into what 
happened that day. Danforth's probe follows a trio of congressional 
hearings and two federal inquiries into the deaths of David Koresh 
and some 80 of his followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, in question-and-answer form, is a look at some of the  
basic issues: 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Why is Waco back on the national agenda?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Because of recent news reports showing that the FBI did, in  
fact, use potentially incendiary tear gas on that final day, 
despite six years of FBI and Justice Department claims to the 
contrary. In recent weeks, FBI and Justice officials have been in 
the awkward position of having to disavow years of erroneous 
statements to Congress and the public about the FBI Hostage Rescue 
Team's use of tear gas in the hours before the Davidians' compound 
erupted in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What are government officials saying now, compared to what  
they said then? 
</P>
<P>
	A: On Aug. 25, the FBI acknowledged that a ``very limited  
number'' of military pyrotechnic CS gas canisters were fired at a 
concrete shelter adjacent to the Davidians' wooden compound. That 
stands in sharp contrast to earlier public statements. Appearing 
before the House Judiciary Committee less than two weeks after the 
standoff's end, Reno said that based on the briefings she'd been 
given, ``It was my understanding that the tear gas produced no risk 
of fire.'' And in its voluminous October 1993 report documenting 
the final assault, the Justice Department made no mention of any 
pyrotechnic devices. In fact, the Justice report stated: ``The gas 
delivery systems the FBI used were completely non-incendiary.'' 
Some former senior FBI officials who played key roles during the 
standoff, including former deputy assistant FBI director Danny 
Coulson and chief Waco spokesman Bob Ricks, say they were unaware 
until recently that potentially combustible devices were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Cover-up or bureaucratic slip-up?  
</P>
<P>
	A: That's THE question for several congressional committees that  
are investigating the FBI's belated about-face, and for Danforth. 
``My job is to answer the dark question or the dark questions: Was 
there a cover-up? That's a dark question. Did the government kill 
people? ... How did the fire start?'' Danforth said. The Senate 
Judiciary Committee and the House Government Reform Committee also 
are investigating, in preparation for fall hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What roles did Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh play?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The standoff was already under way when Reno took office, and  
she had been on the job less than five weeks when she approved the 
FBI's proposal to use tear gas to flush out the Davidians and break 
the siege. Reno, who has said she made clear to the FBI her concern 
that nothing be used that could ignite a fire, is coming under 
increasing attack on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott on Wednesday became the highest-ranking congressional leader 
to call for her resignation over the escalating controversy. Freeh, 
who didn't take the helm of the FBI until four months after the 
standoff ended, has escaped much of the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Why did this come to light now?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Because of inquiries by documentary filmmakers, reporters and  
lawyers for surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of the dead 
who are going to court next month in their longstanding lawsuit 
that the government was responsible for the deaths. Use of the 
potentially incendiary tear gas was first reported by The Dallas 
Morning News on Aug. 24, triggering the latest controversy over 
Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How did the standoff begin?  
</P>
<P>
	A: After the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms attempted  
on Feb. 28 to execute warrants for suspected firearms violations, 
triggering a deadly gunbattle with heavily armed Davidians who had 
been tipped off about the raid. Four ATF agents and at least 
several Davidians died in the gunfire, and more than 16 other ATF 
agents were wounded. The FBI quickly took control of the operation 
after the botched raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How many people died on the siege's final day?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died  
during the final day's inferno, some from gunshot wounds, others 
from the fire. Fire had so damaged the bodies that coroners never 
were able to establish an exact count of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who caused the fire?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Reno and FBI officials say there is no evidence, even in  
light of the FBI's tear-gas admission, that the fire was caused by 
the pyrotechnic canisters. Aerial infrared tapes newly turned over 
by the FBI capture a radio transmission at 8:08 a.m. in which an 
unnamed agent says the military rounds bounced off the concrete 
structure, which was located 40 yards from the main wooden 
compound. Independent arson investigators determined that the fire, 
which began at 12:07 p.m., was started inside the compound in three 
different locations simultaneously. ``That fire was set by David 
Koresh and the people in that building,'' Reno said. The surviving 
Davidians disagree. In their lawsuit, they contend that the blaze 
was ignited by the tear gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What types of tear gas were used?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Two types of non-incendiary tear gas and the newly revealed  
military pyrotechnic rounds. The non-incendiary liquid tear gas was 
inserted in one of two ways: Either by Combat Engineering Vehicles 
that used their booms to punch holes into the compound's walls to 
insert the gas; or by Bradley Fighting Vehicles that fired 
non-combustible ``Ferret'' rounds that shattered on impact. The 
military M651 canisters, which burn for about 30 seconds to heat 
and release the solidified tear gas inside, were fired from a 
Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Offers Gun Buyback Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking a page from local communities,  
President Clinton announced a $15 million federal plan Thursday to 
slow gun violence by having authorities buy firearms in and around 
public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a group of mayors joined with members of Congress,  
police chiefs and clergy to urge the House of Representatives to 
enact tougher gun safety measures passed earlier this year by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the steps of the Capitol, Denver Mayor Wellington  
Webb, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, compared the 20 
mayors gathered there to an infantry division in a battle to reduce 
gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some air support from the House,'' Webb said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the new federal program will give local police  
departments up to $500,000 each to buy guns in and around public 
housing projects for a ``suggested price'' of $50. The guns will be 
destroyed, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton twice recited this statistic to mayors and police chiefs  
at his White House meeting: American children under 15 are nine 
times more likely to die by accidental shooting than children in 
the other 25 industrialized nations combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every gun turned in through a buyback program means  
potentially one less tragedy,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback plan is modeled on local programs in cities such as  
Washington, Sacramento, Denver and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration calculates that the $15 million program  
should bring in close to 300,000 guns. The money will go to 
individual public housing authorities, which will work out the 
buyback plans with local police, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will suggest that housing authorities hand  
out gift certificates for goods or services rather than cash, the 
White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan drew criticism from Wayne LaPierre, vice president  
of the National Rifle Association, who said in a statement there is 
no evidence showing that the popular buyback programs reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the thousands of weapons turned in through such  
programs over the past few years barely cut into the 220 million to 
250 million guns estimated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms to be in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayors at the Capitol endorsed the federal buyback plan,  
although one city leader, Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne, Ind., wondered 
about its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its good to get any weapon off the street but I'm not sure how  
valuable a tool it is,'' said Helmke, a Republican and past 
president of the mayor's group. ``I think we find that many of the 
folks who return guns wanted to get rid of them anyway. I'm not 
sure in a macro sense what good it ends up doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, a Democrat, was more enthusiastic.  
</P>
<P>
	``How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,'' Webb said.  
``In the same way, you have to get guns off the street a number at 
a time. It's just common sense that fewer guns on the street mean 
they can't be used to commit crimes or harm people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with the Washington program, the national buyback offer would  
not include amnesty for any crimes committed with the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, monetary rewards have lured many to give up  
their firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, a 1994 statewide gun buyback attracted so many  
weapons the program quickly wound up owing $400,000 more than it 
had to give away. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget constraints prevented the Salt Lake City police  
department from offering money, so they had collected only a 
handful of guns during a recent 10-day program. A city buyback 
program several years ago drew about 1,000 guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said his city's most recent buyback program offered tickets  
to professional sporting events in Denver.

<HEADLINE> Child Dies in Alleged Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -- A 2-year-old boy died and his 3-year-old  
sister was found seriously injured today in a car their father said 
was carjacked at gunpoint several hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spicknall II called police at about 2:40 a.m. to report  
that an armed hitchhiker he had picked up on a bridge Wednesday 
night had thrown him into the river, and his car and children were 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police Spokesman Maj. Greg Shipley said construction  
workers found the car at about 8 a.m., parked about a half mile 
from the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spicknall III, 2, and Destiny Array Spicknall, 3, were  
still in the back seat, Shipley said. Both were taken to Dorchester 
General Hospital, where Richard was pronounced dead. Shipley would 
not say how they were injured, saying only that they had suffered 
severe trauma to the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley said police still were searching for the alleged  
carjacker. He would not say whether the father, who is separated 
from the children's mother, was considered a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not ruling anything out,'' Shipley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Troopers continued to interview the man. Shipley said police  
were trying to account for Spicknall's time between when he said he 
was carjacked at about 11 p.m. Wednesday and when he called police 
from a pay phone at 2:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall told police he was taking his children to see their  
grandparents when he stopped for a hitchhiker on a bridge over the 
Choptank River, state police Sgt. Mitchel Parke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told police the hitchhiker, an older white man with a  
mustache and a beard, showed him a black automatic handgun, the men 
struggled, and Spicknall was thrown into the river. He told police 
he ``floundered around'' before reaching a fishing pier and calling 
for help, Parke said Police found him at the phone, dripping wet. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall suffered a scrape on his forehead but didn't need  
medical attention, police said.

<HEADLINE> High Court Delays Louis. Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANGOLA, La. (AP) -- Less than 30 minutes before he was to be put  
to death, convicted murderer Feltus Taylor was granted a stay of 
execution by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The stay, Taylor's sixth, was granted so the justices will have  
time to determine whether his constitutional rights were violated 
at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 38, had prepared for his execution by visiting with  
family members and his spiritual advisor at the prison Thursday, 
Warden Burl Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke down. He was very glad,'' Cain said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers claimed in an appeal that Taylor was given  
anti-psychotic drugs during his trial on an irregular schedule 
without his attorneys' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 38, admitting shooting Donna Ponsano to death in March  
1991 after he robbed the safe of the Cajuns Fabulous Chicken 
Restaurant in Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Clark, the former manager at the restaurant, survived the  
attack after being shot four times in the head, but is now 
paralyzed on his left side. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just turned around and started shooting, Clark said. ``He  
said he wasn't going to leave any witnesses that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stay was announced shortly before Taylor's scheduled 6 p.m.  
execution at the Louisiana State Penitentiary.

<HEADLINE> Rabedeaux Coaching UTEP Hoop Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Jason Rabedeaux, an assistant at Oklahoma,  
confirmed Thursday he has been hired to replace Don Haskins as 
basketball coach at UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux, 34, said UTEP athletic director Bob Stull offered him  
the job by phone around 9 p.m. Wednesday, and he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Stull didn't immediately return a telephone call from The  
Associated Press seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux said Thursday by phone from Norman, Okla., that he  
would wait until a press conference Friday in El Paso to discuss 
details of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an unbelievable opportunity to follow a coach  
that is a role model for coaches everywhere, that has established a 
legacy in college basketball, in the community and obviously at the 
University of Texas-El Paso,'' Rabedeaux said of Haskins, who 
announced his retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, 69, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, retired  
Aug. 24 after 38 seasons at UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who ranks 10th on the college career victory list with  
a 719-353 record, will be remembered for starting five black 
players against all-white, top-ranked Kentucky in the 1966 national 
championship game. Texas Western, as UTEP was then known, won 
72-65. The move was hailed as a turning point in the integration of 
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux was one of five candidates interviewed to replace  
Haskins. It came down to Rabedeaux and Kentucky assistant Shawn 
Finney. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabedeaux was a graduate assistant in 1989 at Washington State,  
then coached by Kelvin Sampson. Sampson moved on to Oklahoma and 
Rabedeaux followed him as an assistant.

<HEADLINE> Hit Man To Testify Against Cohorts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A reputed hit man who admits killing 20 people has  
agreed to plead guilty and to testify against organized crime 
leaders in return for a promise to get out of prison in as little 
as eight years, according to court documents unsealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	John Martorano, 58, will plead guilty to federal racketeering  
charges, which include the murder allegations, and testify against 
former Winter Hill gang cohorts James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger and 
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, according to a document ordered 
unsealed by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger, Flemmi and Martorano are defendants in a 1995 federal  
racketeering case that has been challenged by defense lawyers who 
say it should be thrown out because the FBI gave Flemmi and Bulger 
free rein to commit crimes short of murder while they were 
government informants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf is expected to rule within days in the case that also  
includes reputed New England mob boss Francis Salemme and Robert 
Deluca as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Martorano had been part of the hearings challenging the  
indictment, but dropped out to cooperate with authorities, sources 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	After 14 months of negotiations and hundreds of hours of  
interviews with the state police and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Martorano admitted taking part in 20 murders 
spanning three decades and three states, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most occurred in the Boston area as a result of mob feuds, but  
some involved bystanders, such as two passengers in the car of a 
targeted nightclub manager. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to racketeering, race-fixing, bookmaking and  
extortion, Martorano agreed to plead guilty to racketeering charges 
related to 12 gangland murders in which Flemmi and the fugitive 
Bulger are implicated, according to the documents signed by 
prosecutors and Martorano's lawyer, Francis DiMento. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have agreed to recommend that Martorano be sentenced  
to 12 1/2 to 15 years in prison, court papers said. Because of time 
served awaiting trial, Martorano could be free in eight to 10 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which Wolf must approve, was given the green light by  
prosecutors from Massachusetts, Florida and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma killing happened in 1981, when Roger Wheeler, Telex  
Corp. chairman and owner of World Jai Alai, was slain as he 
finished a round of golf in Tulsa.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Orders French Bank Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French investigators have opened an inquiry into a  
Paris-based bank for its management of funds from Russia's Central 
Bank, including money loaned by the International Monetary Fund, 
judicial sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary investigation is aimed at determining whether  
Eurobank moved money from Russia's Central Bank to the Financial 
Management Co., or FIMACO, based on the British Channel Island of 
Jersey. Eurobank owns FIMACO, and Russia's central bank has a 70 
percent stake in Eurobank. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, opened Friday, would be a first step toward a  
formal investigation, which could eventually lead to charges. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest episode in a many-tentacled inquiry into the  
Russian Central Bank's handling of its funds, and whether Russian 
finance officials were straight with Western lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	FIMACO and Eurobank play central roles in other investigations  
that do not concern France. The French investigation is limited to 
whether there was proper authorization for management of funds in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	The French prosecutor opened the inquiry based on a complaint  
Aug. 3 by French stock market regulators that FIMACO and Eurobank 
were managing assets in France without the required authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the IMF, the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers  
investigated the relationship between the Central Bank and FIMACO 
and found that the bank secretly sent billions of dollars of its 
foreign reserves to FIMACO in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was never informed by Russian officials of the transfer  
of funds -- presumably including IMF money -- out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The French inquiry is limited to whether French banking  
legislation was respected, the judicial sources said, speaking on 
customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, said  
recently that Russia lied about the overall state of its finances 
in 1996, and that if the IMF had known the truth, it would have 
suspended Russia's loan program. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the IMF also says it has not found evidence of  
impropriety in Russia's handling of the roughly $20 billion in IMF 
loans it has received this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the IMF's biggest debtor.  
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, investigators are trying to determine  
whether the Russian mob illegally channeled $10 billion through the 
Bank of New York. Some U.S. newspaper reports have suggested the 
laundered money may have included IMF loans.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs 2 Judicial Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed three judicial  
nominations, filling federal court vacancies in Florida, Kansas and 
Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	By identical votes of 93-1, lawmakers on Wednesday approved:  
</P>
<P>
	--Adalberto Jose Jordan to be a U.S. district judge for the  
Southern District of Florida. A native of Cuba who fled to the 
United States at a young age, Jordan has been an assistant U.S. 
attorney in Miami since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Marsha J. Pechman to be a U.S. district judge for the Western  
District of Washington state. She has been a judge for 11 years in 
King County, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Senate by unanimous consent approved the nomination  
of Carlos Murguia of Kansas City, Kan., to be a U.S. district judge 
in Kansas. Murguia for 10 years has been a judge in Wyandotte 
County, Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, an independent, voted against  
Jordan and Pechman. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes brought the number of President Clinton's judicial  
nominees approved this year to 14, a total criticized as inadequate 
by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	At this time last year, the Senate had confirmed 39 judges; and  
in 1994, 58 judicial nominees had been approved by this point, 
Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 60 vacancies on the federal judiciary,  
according to Senate aides and the Senate Judiciary Committee's Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's votes left a total of 46 nominations pending either  
in the judiciary committee, which clears judicial nominees, or 
before the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the nominations pending is that of U.S. District Judge  
Richard Paez of Los Angeles for a seat on the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals, who was first nominated in January 1996, Leahy 
said. That nomination and a subsequent nomination expired with no 
Senate action, and he was renominated again at the beginning of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not doing our job. We are not being responsible,''  
Leahy said in a floor speech. ``We are really being dishonest and 
condescending and arrogant toward the judiciary ... and it deserves 
better.''

<HEADLINE> New Mercedes Ads Using Humor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A new ad campaign from Mercedes-Benz takes a  
sharp turn from previous marketing efforts, relying more on humor 
than horsepower to sell the German automaker's luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ad for Mercedes' largest marketing push ever shows  
images of Kojak with hair and the Mona Lisa with a toothy grin, 
asserting that it's silly to change something that already works. 
There's only a brief, distant glimpse of cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials are part of a campaign aimed at evoking warm  
feelings about the Mercedes name. It's the first automotive 
advertising from Omnicom Group's Merkley Newman Harty agency, which 
was hired by Mercedes earlier this year after the company fired its 
agency of more than five years, Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to communicate that you can have a complete and total  
experience with Mercedes-Benz that you cannot have anywhere else,'' 
said Mike Jackson, president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 ads that will air over the next several months are filled  
with outlandish images, such as five men straining inside a giant 
slingshot, and focus far less on the cars than Mercedes' previous 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	One features people in business attire, including a leggy woman  
in a microskirt, being subjected to a wind tunnel, a slalom course 
and other auto engineering tests. Another, titled ``Chorus,'' shows 
serene groups of Mercedes employees in odd settings promising good 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all are humorous. One ad features a succession of people  
superimposed into scenes of crash tests to highlight safety 
features. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads also continue a trend of Mercedes spots to rely on  
images of deceased celebrities. The ads use Babe Ruth and Clark 
Gable, whose famous closing line from ``Gone With The Wind'' is 
recast with some computer help as ``Frankly my dear, I don't give a 
hoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also includes print and Internet advertising.  
Jackson said the ads were part of a plan to make Mercedes seem less 
aloof. 
</P>
<P>
	Using humor is ``a very engaging way to communicate,'' he said.  
``It makes the brand Mercedes much more approachable than some 
cold, calculating approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign's price tag was put at $50 million to $60 million  
by Joe Eberhardt, vice president of marketing for Mercedes-Benz 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads come as Mercedes, a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG,  
takes part in an industrywide sales boom. Mercedes' U.S. sales are 
up 9 percent this year through August, with 120,966 vehicles sold. 
Among luxury nameplates, Mercedes is second in sales behind Lexus 
and leads BMW, Lincoln and Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
	One advertising expert said it was rare for an automaker to try  
being funny to sell cars that are priced at up to $129,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to be very careful, because if there's ever a  
strategy that can backfire, it's humor,'' said Bruce G. Vanden 
Bergh, an advertising professor at Michigan State University. The 
ads must ``walk the fine line where they're funny and relevant and 
present Mercedes in a new light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers who have broken with the auto industry's  
traditionally conservative marketing have seen mixed results. 
Unique campaigns for Volkswagen and Saturn have been credited with 
improving sales. But a $200 million campaign by Nissan in 1996-97 
with a smiling Japanese man called ``Mr. K'' was junked after the 
automaker's sales slumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he was not concerned that customers might find the  
ads too strange, saying previous efforts by Mercedes went over 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a certain small percent that will take strong  
issue with the communications, and we accept that as the price tag 
of being edgy,'' he said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Highlights of Thursday's play in the $14.5  
million U.S. Open tennis championships: 
</P>
<P>
	 *Weather:* Hazy and humid with late afternoon rain and a high of  
83. 
</P>
<P>

38,647. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Results:* Men's singles, quarterfinals: Cedric Pioline, the  
runnerup to Pete Sampras in 1993, came back from a set down to 
eliminate No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten. Pioline won three straight 
tiebreaks, including 16-14 in the third set, to overtake Kuerten. 
In the other quarterfinal, No. 7 Todd Martin beat Slava Dosedel in 
four sets, reaching the U.S. Open semifinals for the second time 
and the first since 1994. Martin and Pioline will meet in a 
semifinal on Saturday.

<P>
	 *Quote of the Day:* ``I'm just a little bit frustrated because I  
really played well. I deserved to win maybe. I had the same chance 
as him. That's a little bit frustrating. It's like this. If we

<HEADLINE> Over 10,000 Stepladders Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 10,700 stepladders are being recalled  
because of faulty steps that can cause people to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the RIDGID ladders,  
made by Louisville Ladder Group of Louisville, Ky., have steps that 
are too short and improperly attached to the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	The company received report of one step falling off, but no  
injuries, the commission said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ladders were sold at Home Depot stores from May until July  
for $119 to $223. They come in lengths of 6, 8 and 10 feet, with a 
red plastic top and gray railings and model numbers that start with 
R-3011. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should call 1-888-318-7911 to find out if the steps  
are properly attached. Home Depot will exchange the ladder or 
refund consumers for the cost.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Surged in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing surged in July  
mainly reflecting heavy credit card use, which posted its sharpest 
increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced  
at a 7.9 percent annual rate in July to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.354 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, consumers borrowed $8.8 billion more in July than  
during the month before, greater than the $6.3 billion gain many 
analysts' had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in July's rate follows a more restrained 2.9  
percent gain in June and was the biggest jump since May when 
consumers' credit outstanding rose at an annual rate of 9.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	July's increase was led by demand for revolving credit --  
primarily credit cards revolving loans, which rose at an annual 
rate of 12.1 percent. That was the largest increase since a 12.2 
percent rate in July of 1997. In June, revolving credit rose at a 
rate of 11.5 percent, much higher than the 8.6 percent rate of 
increase the Fed originally estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for non-revolving loans, meanwhile, rose at a 4.8 percent  
rate in July. That category includes loans for autos, mobile homes, 
boats, trailers, education and vacations. In June, non-revolving 
credit actually fell at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, a bigger 
drop than the Fed previously estimated.

<HEADLINE> A Strange Day in Louisiana Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- There were unintelligible screams from  
one candidate. Another signed up for the fall election using a 
racial epithet as a nickname. Still another filed for a run unaware 
he was too young. 
</P>
<P>
	Even by Louisiana's colorful political standards, the final day  
to sign up for the state's Oct. 23 statewide elections was bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the serious contenders, including Gov. Mike Foster and  
three major challengers for his seat, had signed up for the race on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the candidates who signed up Thursday to challenge  
Foster were well known. But two caused a stir. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Ward, a Democrat who has run near the back of the pack in  
several statewide and congressional elections, signed up as Messiah 
Darryl Paul Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	While signing papers he uttered loud, unintelligible shouts and  
screams, as though he were speaking in tongues. A witness said he 
hurried out of the office telling one group of reporters and 
onlookers, ``God loves you all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later came Albert Jones, a black man who signed up for the  
ballot as Albert ``Super Nigger'' Jones. Asked why he wanted to use 
the racial epithet on the ballot, Jones said it would help draw 
attention to the problem of people not voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call people who don't vote either niggers or communists,''  
Jones said in a sometimes rambling explanation. ``It doesn't have 
anything to do with color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Martin, head of the elections division for the secretary of  
state's office, said he could find nothing in the law that would 
prohibit Jones from using the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	Within an hour of the qualifying deadline, a 23-year-old  
political newcomer, Scott Wilfong, a Republican political 
consultant, signed papers to run against incumbent Secretary of 
State Fox McKeithen. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the 5 p.m. deadline rolled around, McKeithen  
jubilantly noted that the constitutionally set minimum age for the 
office is 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilfong had left his office and was not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Black Baptists To Pick New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- In an election that could set a new course  
for the nation's largest black denomination, the National Baptist 
Convention U.S.A. Inc. voted for a new leader Thursday to succeed 
its imprisoned former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven candidates vied for the presidency, many of them saying  
the broad powers of the office contributed to the Rev. Henry Lyons' 
downfall on charges of bilking companies of more than $4 million so 
that he could live in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one man should have all the power,'' Fannie Williams of New  
Orleans, one of the thousands of delegates at the church's annual 
meeting, said as she waited to vote for the Rev. W. Franklyn 
Richardson. The Mount Vernon, N.Y., minister advocates term limits 
for the president and having an elected, rather than appointed, 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, resigned after he was convicted in February of  
swindling $4 million from businesses and keeping nearly $250,000 
contributed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith to rebuild 
burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the scandal, many candidates said the president's  
powers, including control over the group's checkbook, should be 
reduced. Several board members are appointed by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, who was paid $100,000 as president, is serving 5 1/2 years  
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, which traces its roots to 1880, claims 8.5  
million members, though at Lyons' trial prosecutors said the figure 
was inflated to attract businesses. They said membership is around 
1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some voters expressed admiration for Lyons' work and an  
understanding of human frailty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a man, and he was caught up like any of us,'' said  
Bernice Hayes, of Dayton, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Still Opposes Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite the political bruising she's  
received from Republicans and even some fellow Democrats, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton insists she was never in the loop on her husband's 
decision to offer clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a decision that had to go through channels, a  
decision that had to be made by the highest levels of 
recommendations to the president and ultimately by the president,'' 
she said Wednesday. ``It is not surprising to me that I was not 
lobbied, or informed or asked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a ``listening tour'' stop at a Long Island high school,  
Mrs. Clinton said, ``Of course, since we are moving forward I would 
hope that it proceeds smoothly and that the prisoners, when they're 
released, abide by the terms of the clemency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the president and Mrs. Clinton have drawn sharp criticism  
after he said last month that he would commute the sentences of 16 
Puerto Rican nationalists if they renounced the use of violence and 
adhered to other restrictions on their travel and association. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them were members of pro-independence guerrilla group  
FALN, which carried out more than 130 bombings in the United States 
in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, 12 accepted the deal, and they could be free by the  
end of the week. One prisoner rejected the offer, and three 
nationalists -- including two not in jail but who still have 
outstanding fines -- have until Friday to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican critics of the president wondered aloud whether the  
offer was made to ingratiate Mrs. Clinton with New York's more than 
1 million Puerto Rican residents, who could prove vital for her 
presumed run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton removed any perceived advantage, however, last  
weekend when she said she opposed the president's clemency offer 
because the prisoners failed to respond to the offer quickly 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes. I  
believe the offer of clemency should be withdrawn,'' she had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her surprise announcement infuriated several Puerto Rican  
political leaders, among them Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., who said 
he could no longer support her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton tried to patch up the rift during a visit Wednesday  
to Bay Shore High School on Long Island, where she was greeted 
warmly by the school's 1,400 students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand by that statement, yet I understand the depth of  
feeling in the Puerto Rican community and I look forward to working 
with them on other issues that we can make a difference on,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not reply directly to a reporter's question  
about whether a mixup in White House signals had allowed her to 
formally condemn the deal on Saturday, even as the prisoners 
themselves were apparently considering whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had not been advised in advance they would do so,  
and Howard Wolfson, her press secretary, said there was no 
indication that even the White House knew on Saturday that an 
agreement was close. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said Mrs. Clinton also did not know the White House had  
sent a letter Friday to the FALN convicts' lawyers setting a 
seven-day deadline.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Down on Dollar's Weakness / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Thursday amid a sharp  
decline in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, and more 
pressure from corporate bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32  
point, or $2.81 1/4 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.09 percent from 
Wednesday's 6.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for bonds fell as the dollar dropped to its lowest levels  
against the yen since August 1996. The dollar fell as new signs 
showed continued economic recovery in Japan. Bonds prices move 
inversely to the price of the dollar because U.S. government backed 
securities are less attractive to investors when the dollar is down 
against foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys also remained under pressure from new corporate bond  
offerings, including one from Freddie Mac and another from Proctor 
&AMP; Gamble. Government bonds are hurt by corporate bond sales because 
they tend to pay higher yields, and thus make Treasurys less 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were down 1/16 point,  
and intermediate maturities were down 5/32 point to 7/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.81 percent as the  
discount was unchanged from Wednesday's 4.68 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.13 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage 
point to 4.93 percent. One-year yields were 5.26 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.02 percentage point to 5.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.25 percent from 5.12 1/2 percent late Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 13/32 to 113 11/16. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.82 percent from 5.80 percent.

<HEADLINE> 97-Year-Old Killed by Road Grader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERMILLION, Minn. (AP) -- A 97-year-old man on his way to morning  
Mass stepped into the path of a road grader and was crushed to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle was operated by a county employee who was blinded by  
the sun Wednesday and didn't see Peter Marschall until it was too 
late, the Minnesota State Patrol said. No charges were filed 
against the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle was carrying 5 to 7 tons of gravel.  
</P>
<P>
	A parishioner rushed into St. John the Baptist Catholic Church  
with news of the accident. The Rev. Joe Arackal, who had been 
waiting for Marschall to arrive before starting the service, 
administered last rites. 
</P>
<P>
	The bells at the church tolled 97 times for the oldest resident  
of this community of about 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Marschall's body was a listening device that he used to  
plug into the sound system to hear Mass at the church where he was 
baptized in 1902. 
</P>
<P>
	Marschall was a beloved figure in the town about 25 miles  
southeast of Minneapolis. He could be seen walking a mile or two 
every day, wearing his green farmer's cap and waving. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all thought he would make a hundred years,'' said Paul  
Kasel, owner of the grocery. ``His mind was good. He was so spry 
and active.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Pilcher, who was driving the grader, had known Marschall  
all his life. He had no comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates FBI Agent's Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a sex  
harassment suit filed by an FBI agent who said she was subjected to 
taunts, sexual comments and unfair treatment during much of her 
20-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen M. Anderson's suit had been dismissed by U.S. District  
Judge Vaughn Walker, who refused to consider most of her claims 
dating to 1986 because she failed to complain to a government 
equal-employment counselor within 45 days. He said the rest of her 
evidence was not enough to show harassment or unequal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Wednesday that a 1994  
complaint by the agent was enough to put the FBI on notice of many 
years of ``continuing violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anderson's allegations show a longstanding, unabated pattern  
of unwanted, sexually oriented teasing, harassment and ridicule 
that not only was condoned by her supervisors, but in which they 
personally took part,'' said Judge Barry Silverman in the 3-0 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Anderson, who left the FBI's San Jose office several  
months ago, was entitled to a trial on her claims of harassment, 
discriminatory treatment and retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a very motivated, very capable agent whose efforts to  
advance her career were thwarted by a very deeply entrenched 
resistance towards women in the FBI,'' said her lawyer, John G. 
Heller. 
</P>
<P>
	George Grotz, FBI spokesman in San Francisco, declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was hired in 1979, one of about 200 female agents in a  
force of 7,200 nationwide, Heller said. She soon was assigned to 
San Jose, where she initially received commendations. 
</P>
<P>
	According to her 1997 lawsuit, her supervisor, William Smith,  
between 1986 and 1990 called her ``gorgeous,'' ``the good little 
girl'' and ``the office sex goddess,'' and whistled at her. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, an easel with a drawing of a pair of breasts and the  
words ``Operation Cupcake'' was left in a room where she was to 
conduct a briefing. She complained to Smith, who said in front of 
the group, ``This is your training bra session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same year, she said, someone left her a copy of a letter  
supposedly sent by the late FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, 
explaining why he would not hire female agents. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said a fellow agent, with whom she had a brief sexual  
relationship, continually asked to renew it and made suggestive 
comments even after becoming her supervisor in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said she was passed over for promotions and excluded  
from critical meetings. She said she was assigned to a dead-end job 
after filing her first complaint and taken off a desirable case in 
retaliation for suing.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Tax Cut Despite Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans intend to spend the  
next several days touting their veto-threatened tax cut as they 
head into a season of struggle with Democrats and the White House 
over issues extending to spending, health, gun control and campaign 
finance as well as taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax bill publicity campaign appeared aimed at blaming  
President Clinton for failure, as many top Republicans doubt 
compromise is possible. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, 
told reporters today that the promised veto ``would pretty well 
kill it for this year,'' partly because legislative time is short. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey would not completely close the door on an agreement,  
saying Republicans were willing to listen if Clinton wants to 
negotiate seriously on tax cuts. But he said the GOP does not want 
a grand spending and tax deal using projected surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not prepared to trade with the president with the  
American people's money -- a spending buck for me, a tax reduction 
for you,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In hopes of shaping the political environment to their liking,  
Republicans plan a public relations campaign culminating in a 
ceremony next week at which congressional leaders will formally 
send the measure to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have made an overpayment, over the next 10  
year period, in terms of taxes,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., told reporters Wednesday as lawmakers returned to 
the Capitol from a monthlong vacation. ``They've got change coming 
to them. We think they should have an opportunity to keep that 
change that they are entitled to by this overpayment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton insists the 10-year, $792 billion measure would  
jeopardize the nation's economy, however, and has not wavered in 
his stated intention of a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Wednesday  
that politically, the GOP tax cut had turned out to be a ``bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans appeared increasingly likely to set the tax issue  
aside until next year's election campaign rather than attempt to 
work out a compromise that also would cover issues as diverse as 
spending and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can wait 14 months, get a new president and then do a tax  
cut,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, 
outlining the case against compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has yet to decide what  
course to follow, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	More broadly, Lott and Daschle both sounded pessimistic on the  
prospects for compromise this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any indication the president wants to work with  
us,'' Lott told reporters after smilingly predicting an 
``action-packed'' September and October. ``What the president wants 
is more spending, more spending, more spending for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he had talked with Lott and he expressed the hope  
they could work together. But, he quickly added, ``Clearly we 
(Democrats) will fight and we will aggressively pursue'' an agenda 
that include gun control, education, legislation relating to HMOs, 
an increase in the minimum wage and money for hard-hit farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt that compromise eventually would emerge on  
spending measures because Congress must provide money for federal 
agencies and programs for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Only 
one of the 13 required bills has passed, and most lawmakers 
privately concede they will have to break the spending constraints 
imposed by the 1997 balanced budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the prospect was for confrontation this fall, with  
an uncertain outcome: 
</P>
<P>
	--Bipartisan health care legislation is pending in the House, and  
debate is expected by the end of the month. The GOP leadership 
opposes its provision granting patients the right to sue their 
insurance companies, however, and the Senate has passed its own 
version of the measure that Clinton has condemned as too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several months after the shootings at Columbine High School in  
Colorado, gun control issues were being thrashed out in compromise 
talks between the House and Senate. The Senate approved provisions 
to expand background checks for sales at gun shows, to ban certain 
high capacity ammunition clips and to require the sale of safety 
decides with handguns. The House killed all three provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Democrats are eager to try and attach a minimum wage  
increase to legislation that Republicans have crafted to overhaul 
the nation's bankruptcy laws. One Republican aide, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said it was possible a GOP senator might 
try to pre-empt the Democrats and bring up the issue first. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Republicans favor ``lockbox'' legislation to safeguard Social  
Security receipts. Senate Democrats have objections to the measure 
as drafted, and Lott indicated he would bring the issue up on the 
Senate floor in the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The House is scheduled to debate campaign finance legislation  
next week that would ban the use of so-called soft money, which are 
unlimited campaign donations sought by both political parties. The 
measure is likely to pass, setting the stage for a GOP filibuster 
when the issue comes up in the Senate next month.

<HEADLINE> Drought Spreads Across Eastern U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although recent rains have perked up some  
lawns and pastures, this summer's drought has spread and deepened 
across much of the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely not over,'' said Albert Peterlin, the  
Agriculture Department's chief meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe to extreme drought conditions exist from Maine to Indiana  
and down through Florida, according to the government's latest 
drought analysis released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate drought conditions persist through other parts of the  
Midwest and South and even in Virginia and North Carolina, where 
some areas recently got 6 inches of rain or more from the remnants 
of Hurricane Dennis. The drought analysis is updated weekly by the 
Agriculture Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, the severe and extreme drought conditions were  
confined primarily to the mid-Atlantic states and a portion of 
Kentucky and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drought is expanding into the more fertile or productive  
areas of the country,'' Peterlin said. ``The good news is that the 
growing season is about over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent rains came too late to save most crops that have been  
damaged by the drought and missed some of the driest areas 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the soybean crop in four states -- Alabama,  
Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee -- is rated poor or very poor, as 
well as 50 percent of the corn in Missouri and 48 percent of the 
corn in Pennsylvania, according to USDA's weekly crop report. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for livestock producers is even more widespread. At  
least two-thirds of the pastureland in Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, 
New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and West 
Virginia is rated as poor or very poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrible,'' said Joe Cornerly, a spokesman for the Ohio  
Farm Bureau. While most of Ohio's crops are in fair to good 
condition, according to the USDA, many producers in the state think 
they have lost half their corn and 30 percent to 40 percent of 
their soybeans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a pick-up in rain but accumulatively we're way  
behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there is so much standing water in several Eastern  
states, including Maryland and Virginia, that communities are 
battling outbreaks of mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the drought won't be over even in that region without more  
rain and snow through the fall and winter, said Peterlin. Even 
though rivers and streams are full, soil moisture is still below 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the drought, all or parts of 16 states have been  
declared agricultural disaster areas this year: Arizona, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Selling Mansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NYACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Now that she's invested $290,000 on  
renovations, talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell is looking to move from 
the mansion known as ``Pretty Penny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her publicist, Jennifer Glaisek, said Thursday that Ms.  
O'Donnell is looking for more privacy and security than the 22-room 
home can provide. The 150-year-old house is on a main road in this 
New York City suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous occupants, actress Helen Hayes and her husband,  
Charles MacArthur, bought the house in 1931. Miss Hayes said its 
name came from remark of a friend: ``This place must have cost a 
pretty penny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell bought the house for $770,000 in 1996. The new listing  
price? $2.75 million.

<HEADLINE> Fans Take Pieces of Tiger Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A Detroit baseball fan apparently feeling  
sentimental for the bathrooms at Tiger Stadium tried to make off 
with a urinal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers play their last game at Tiger Stadium later this  
month, and police and stadium security say some fans have begun 
scavenging for nostalgic items. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the man who tried to steal one of the trough-style  
urinals, other fans have been unscrewing oak armrests from Tiger 
Den seats and spiriting them out of the stadium, officials told the 
Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many people, going to Tiger Stadium was something that  
they did with their parents or with their dad, and it means a great 
deal to them,'' said Detroit police Lt. Shereece Fleming-Freeman. 
``People just want a piece of anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 home games left at Tiger Stadium, the last Sept. 27  
against Kansas City, some Detroit officials worry if anything will 
be left of the stadium by then.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Leaves Gallery $60M Art Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Vienna-born psychiatrist has left $60  
million worth of Chinese antiquities to the Arthur M. Sackler 
Gallery, making the nation's capital the premier center for the 
study of Chinese art. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported today that the gift comes from Paul  
Singer and the late Arthur M. Sackler, whose children and 
foundations supported Singer's purchases in the last years of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, who died in 1997, collected art obsessively while living  
in a tiny apartment in Summit, N.J. Most of the 5,000 objects he 
collected were more than 1,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who knew about Chinese art knew about Dr. Singer and  
his collection,'' said Thomas Lawton, director emeritus of the 
Freer Gallery of Art, also in Washington. ``He had his 5,000 
objects stashed in every corner of the place (apartment).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer's gift, which is especially strong in small, provincial  
objects, makes ancient Chinese art the richest of the fields 
covered jointly by the holdings of the Sackler and the Freer. 
</P>
<P>
	The two institutions, joined underground by a series of tunnels  
and separated only by a glass wall, share a staff and function 
almost as a single entity within the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	A catalogue of the Paul Singer Collection and an exhibit at the  
Sackler are being prepared. Eighteen objects from the collection 
already are on view at the Sackler.

	Afternoon storms soaked parts of the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and  
Southeast on Thursday, while lighter rain fell on parts of the West 
and high pressure kept the central states clear. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front approaching the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states  
triggered afternoon showers and thunderstorms from West Virginia to 
western New York state. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms were expected to increase in coverage and intensity,  
bringing wind gusts to 50 mph, hail and heavy rain, reaching 
coastal areas in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	On the front's southern tail, foul weather menaced parts of  
Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and North Carolina -- where 
more than half an inch of rain had fallen by midday -- but wasn't 
expected to match the intensity of the northern storms.

<HEADLINE> Md. Dad Charged in Child's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -- A father was charged with murder Thursday  
after his son was killed and his daughter critically wounded in 
what he claimed was a carjacking by a hitchhiker who threw him into 
a river. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Spicknall II, 27, was arrested around 4 p.m., more than  
eight hours after the children were found in the car. Police said 
Richard Spicknall III, 2, and Destiny Array Spicknall, 3, had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they had not established a motive. Spicknall was  
being held pending a bond hearing Thursday night on charges 
including murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began about 2:40 a.m., when Spicknall called  
police to report that an armed hitchhiker he picked up on a bridge 
over the Choptank River on Wednesday night had thrown him into the 
water 25 feet below, and that his car and children were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall called police from a fishing pier more than three  
hours after he said he was thrown into the river. Police found him 
at the phone, dripping wet. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 8 a.m., construction workers found the car parked behind  
a house about a half mile from the bridge, said Maj. Greg Shipley, 
a state police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Spicknall is separated from the children's mother, Lisa  
Spicknall, 24. He told police he was taking his children to see 
their grandparents in Ocean City when he stopped for the 
hitchhiker, whom he described as an older, bearded white man 
wearing a tan T-shirt and blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Spicknall filed for bankruptcy in  
May. At the time, he had been working for eight months as a manager 
at the ESPN Zone theme restaurant and bar in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge is 50 miles southeast of Baltimore on Maryland's  
Eastern Shore.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Hear Switched Baby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Virginia Supreme Court has refused to  
hear a woman's appeal of a settlement between a hospital and her 
biological daughter, who was switched at birth with another baby. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-sentence ruling Thursday, the court said ``there is no  
reversible error'' in a Buena Vista judge's approval of the 
University of Virginia Medical Center's $875,000 settlement for 
4-year-old Rebecca Chittum and the families raising her. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson had claimed that as Rebecca's biological mother,  
she had a right to approve or veto the settlement, which she 
considered insufficient. She is suing the hospital for $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson's lawyer, Cynthia Johnson, said she had not seen the  
ruling and had not had a chance to discuss it with her client. She 
declined further comment. The lawyer and client are not related. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnson discovered last year that the child she had been  
raising, Callie Marie Johnson, was not her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Her biological baby, Rebecca, had been sent home with Whitney  
Rogers and Kevin Chittum a few days after her 1995 birth, and that 
couple's true daughter was sent home with Ms. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson learned the truth a few days after Chittum and Ms.  
Rogers died in a car crash on July 4, 1998, without ever learning 
of the switch. Since then the parents of Chittum and Ms. Rogers 
have been raising Rebecca. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 5, a judge approved the settlement between the  
hospital, Rebecca and the grandparents who have been sharing 
custody of her. But Ms. Johnson claims she had a right to approve 
or reject any settlement for the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the University of Virginia Medical Center, where the  
switch was made, said the decision confirms ``that the amount of 
the settlement is fair and is in the best interests of this 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement call for Rebecca to get $200,000 up front  
and $400,000 in an annuity that would be worth $1.5 million in 25 
years. The grandparents would share $125,000, and their lawyer 
would get $150,000.

<HEADLINE> Capitals Re-Sign Svejkovsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ODENTON, Md. (AP) -- The Washington Capitals re-signed free agent  
right wing Jaroslav Svejkovsky on Thursday to a three-year deal for 
approximately $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Svejkovsky's contract calls for about $550,000 in the first  
year, followed by $600,000 and $650,000 in the remaining two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Svejkovsky has shown flashes of talent while playing with the  
Capitals for parts of the last three seasons, and the team's front 
office views him as one of its brighter young stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yogi has been a prolific scorer at each level of hockey he's  
played,'' Washington vice president and general manager George 
McPhee said. ``Injuries the last two seasons have hampered his 
production in the NHL, but we are expecting big things from Yogi 
this season and in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year old native of Czech Republic had six goals and eight  
assists in 25 games last year, but injuries sidelined him for 52 
contests. Svejkovsky's best moments came during a seven-game point 
streak where he had three goals and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 193-pound Svejkovsky also had four goals and one  
assist in 17 games two years ago. He was named the American Hockey 
League's player of the year in 1996-97 after a 38-goal, 28-assist 
performance with the Portland Pirates.

<HEADLINE> Champion Expects Tougher Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Before competing in the 1998 Comfort  
Classic, Hugh Baiocchi got a few pointers about the mechanics of 
his game from fellow Senior PGA Tour pro Steve Veriato. 
</P>
<P>
	Baiocchi then set a tournament record with a bogey-free,  
20-under-par effort that gave him a two-stroke victory over Bruce 
Summerhays and a six-shot margin over the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	As he prepared for Friday's opening round of the 1999  
tournament, Baiocchi spent some time on the putting green with 
Craig Farnsworth, a psychologist who assisted CBS golf commentator 
Gary McCord on his instruction book. Baiocchi said McCord gave him 
some thoughts on visualization and reading greens. 
</P>
<P>
	Does another round of pointers translate to another victory?  
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows? Lightning might strike twice,'' Baiocchi said,  
chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
	Baiocchi's battle with the Brickyard Crossing Golf Course on the  
grounds of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was pretty much a 
laugher last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty under was fairly spectacular. I would think something  
in the region of 14 to 15 (under) would be good. I certainly would 
take that,'' he said. ``These are the best seniors in the world. I 
don't know how you defend a course against these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You give it more water when it has been as dry as it has this  
summer, course superintendent Jeff Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we try to do is provide consistent conditions, try to  
accommodate the (PGA) officials' requests,'' Stuart said. ``Last 
year was an exception. We didn't have any wind. The greens were 
fairly receptive. There was a lot of roll on the fairways. They 
shot well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More water, and conditioning that water to make it penetrate  
quicker, have made the fairways softer, eliminating much of the 
roll, Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll see those scores again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Baiocchi, 53, is more concerned about the competition than the  
course, especially with 50-year-old Tom Watson making his senior 
tour debut Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing OK,'' said Baiocchi, who has top-10 finishes in  
seven of his last 10 tournaments. ``These guys are so damned good. 
And with Tom Watson in the field, that's going to raise the bar 
even higher.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers bought out the  
remaining year of guard Pooh Richardson's contract on Thursday, the 
team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the buyout weren't disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, 33, has spent the last five years with the Clippers.  
He entered the league in 1989 as the 10th overall pick of the 
Minnesota Timberwolves. After a three-year stint in Minnesota, 
Richardson played for the Indiana Pacers for two seasons. He was 
acquired by the Clippers in a 1994 trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has career averages of 11.1 points and 6.5 assists  
per game in 639 games. He was hampered by an ankle injury last 
season and expressed frustration playing for the woeful Clippers.

<HEADLINE> German Sports Chief Faces Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The former head of East German sports and a  
one-time leading sports doctor were indicted today on charges that 
they set up a program to distribute synthetic hormones to young 
swimmers and track and field athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accused Manfred Ewald and Dr. Manfred Hoeppner  
with being an accessories to causing bodily harm through the drugs 
in cases involving 142 female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin prosecutors have convicted and fined several coaches and  
sports doctors of giving performance-enhancing drugs to underage 
athletes without their or their parents' knowledge. The charges are 
based on information from secret police documents and other files 
that came to light after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they hoped the early trials would allow them to  
build a case against those responsible for setting up the drug 
program, which helped relatively small East Germany win dozens of 
gold medals at Olympics and other championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest indictment charges the 142 athletes suffered lasting  
side-effects from the anabolic steroids, such as hormonal 
disturbances and the development of male characteristics such as 
excessive hair or muscles. A few women still suffer from menstrual 
and gynecological problems, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Ewald, 73, a former member of the East  
German communist party's central committee, was in charge of 
keeping the doping secret, supposedly instructing coaches to tell 
athletes the pills they were taking were vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeppner, 65, headed the East German Sports Medicine Service's  
division for performance athletics from 1978 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin authorities are investigating about 500 people suspected  
to have been involved in the doping system.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter died Thursday, one year  
after learning Lou Gehrig's disease was the reason he could barely 
toss a baseball with an arm once famous for pinpoint control. He 
was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, baseball's first big-money free agent, died at home in  
Hertford, N.C., where he was born and raised. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unconscious for several days last month after falling and  
hitting his head on concrete steps. But he improved and was sent 
home to his Perquimans County farm on Saturday, according to the 
Rev. Keith Vaughan, a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	As the centerpiece of pitching staffs, first with the Oakland  
Athletics and then with the New York Yankees, Hunter won 224 games, 
produced five straight 20-victory seasons, a perfect game and a Cy 
Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bigger the game, the better he pitched,'' is how Hunter's  
Hall of Fame plaque at Cooperstown, N.Y., describes him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fabulous human being. He was a man of honor. He was a  
man of loyalty,'' said Reggie Jackson, who played with Hunter on 
championship teams in Oakland and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It was last September when Hunter learned he had amyotrophic  
lateral sclerosis, a disease that attacks nerves in the spinal cord 
and brain that control muscle movement. There is no cure for ALS, 
commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease, after another Yankees Hall of 
Famer who was afflicted with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter first noticed the condition in the winter of 1997-98  
while hunting near his farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' he said. ``It  
was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was something 
wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first he thought it might be a tick bite, but after repeated  
visits to doctors in Norfolk, Va., and the Duke and Johns Hopkins 
medical centers, Hunter got the dreaded diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put Hunter on a drug regimen to slow the disease, but it  
progressed quickly, leaving the once strong-armed pitcher unable to 
function without help. He talked of how Helen, his high school 
sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years, helped him through each 
day, dressing him and cutting his food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while,'' he said, ``we sit there and cry together.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hunter also had diabetes and required insulin injections three  
times a day. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a brief visit to the Yankees' training base in Tampa,  
Fla., last spring, but was barely able to shake hands with old 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Old friends were shocked when they saw him. His arms hung limply  
at his side. His hands seemed soft and puffy, much different from 
those he displayed as a powerful pitcher and farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right,'' he said at the time. ``It's just my  
hands and arms don't work right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics owner Charles O. Finley found Hunter in Hertford and  
made him one of the first building blocks in a dynasty team that 
won three straight World Series from 1972-74. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley gave him the nickname ``Catfish'' and Hunter went along  
with it. He loved a joke and when the owner decided all his players 
should have mustaches, Hunter was one of the first to grow one and 
collect the $300 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came up with the A's in 1965 and punctuated the team's  
move from Kansas City to Oakland with a perfect game against the 
Minnesota Twins on May 8, 1968. At the time, it was just the 
seventh perfect game in modern baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a big-game pitcher, a consistent pitcher who always  
kept you in the ball game,'' said Sal Bando, the third baseman on 
that Oakland team. ``He consistently pitched well in big games. He 
was a No. 1 starter, and you can't win without one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando recalled Hunter as the ultimate team player, a guy who  
loved to sit around the clubhouse, spinning stories with a country 
drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very low key, a very warm person. He treated everybody  
the same. If you were an extra man or you were a star, it didn't 
matter. Just a down-to-earth guy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando also remembered how Hunter did not let baseball interfere  
with the rest of his life. Typical was when the pitcher won 20 
games for the first time in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was up by 4 or 5 and went fishing. He got in about noon,  
showered, went to the ballpark, pitched 10 innings and drove in the 
winning run,'' Bando said. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1974, when the Athletics won their third straight World  
Series, Hunter was ready to become a baseball trailblazer. Finley 
had failed to pay an annuity clause in his contract and the 
pitcher's grievance went to arbitration. He was declared a free 
agent, setting off a surreal scene in little Hertford, about 100 
miles northeast of Raleigh, where baseball executives arrived to 
woo him. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he settled on the Yankees, agreeing to a landmark $3.75  
million, five-year contract that was signed on New Year's Eve 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner never regretted the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish Hunter was the cornerstone of the Yankees' success  
over the last quarter century,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We were not 
winning before Catfish arrived. ... He exemplified class and 
dignity and he taught us how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was the second Yankees Hall of Famer to die this year.  
Joe DiMaggio died March 8 at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's baseball economics, Hunter's contract was a  
small-change deal. But it made him the highest-paid player in 
baseball history at the time, and set the stage for full-scale free 
agency, which began after the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the first player who broke it open for other  
players to be paid what they're worth,'' he said in 1987, shortly 
after he was elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing his contract with the Yankees, he became the  
team's workhorse the following two years, completing 51 of 75 
starts and leading it to its first pennant in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish was a very unique guy,'' said Lou Piniella, a teammate  
on those Yankees clubs. ``If you didn't know he was making that 
kind of money, you'd never guess it because he was humble, very 
reserved about being a star-type player. We had a lot of fun when 
he was in New York. There was a lot of give and take, and Catfish 
was in the middle of it all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a class guy, very humble, very reserved, almost a  
little bit shy. But he told great stories. He had a heck of a sense 
of humor. When you play with guys like that, you feel blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won three straight pennants with Hunter from  
1976-78. When his contract ended, he returned to his beloved 
Hertford, to his farm and his outdoor life. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife, survivors include three children and a  
grandson. Funeral services will be Sunday in Cedar Wood Cemetery in 
Hertford, behind the field where Hunter played high school 
baseball.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Executive Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean prosecutors Thursday  
arrested an executive from the Hyundai conglomerate suspected of 
heading a major stock manipulation scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Lee Ik-chi, head of Hyundai Securities Co.,  
admitted to involvement in the operation during three days of 
questioning. One other Hyundai official has also been arrested, and 
dozens of others have been investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee allegedly diverted $183 million in company funds from at  
least two other Hyundai subsidiaries to manipulate the stock price 
of Hyundai Electronics Co. last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the alleged five-month operation, the stock price of Hyundai  
Electronics Co., the world's leading memory chip maker, shot up 
almost 2.5 times, enabling the conglomerate to make at least $416 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the two Hyundai subsidiaries that are said to have  
supplied the funds -- Park Se-yong, chairman of Hyundai Marine 
Merchant Co. and Kim Hyung-byuk, chairman of Hyundai Heavy 
Industries -- were questioned earlier this week. They have not been 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The case received wide attention in this country, partly because  
Lee was credited with reviving South Korea's depressed stock 
market. In March, he launched a successful ``Buy Korea'' fund that 
has drawn $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has brought calls for greater efforts to restructure  
South Korea's conglomerates, which are known as chaebol. The 
government is pushing them to reform their business practices and 
shed money-losing subsidiaries, thus lowering debt burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock price manipulation is punishable by a prison term of up to  
10 years or a fine of up to three times the profit gained.

<HEADLINE> Accused Rapist Tried To Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENOLDEN, Pa. (AP) -- A man tried to surrender on a parole  
violation days before he strangled a woman and raped a 13-year-old 
girl, but was turned away because of an error, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Bennett, 30, walked into the police station in Glenolden  
on Aug. 26 and said he wanted to surrender, Police Chief Edward 
Cooke said. He was arrested hours after the Sept. 1 killing of 
Roxanne Carol Leidy and rape of the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke said an officer called a national crime database and  
verified that a bench warrant had been issued but was unable to 
confirm the warrant with Delaware County prison officials and told 
Bennett to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	A constable who was called to take Bennett to prison confirmed  
the warrant with prison officials a few minutes later, but when he 
arrived at the police station, Bennett was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely devastating,'' said Leidy's brother,  
Christopher Miller. ``How could they just let him go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show a bench warrant was issued for Bennett on  
July 21 at the request of his probation officer. He had failed to 
show up for meetings with the officer and for sex-offender 
treatment classes that were conditions of his probation on a 1997 
rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke said Bennett did not offer any specific reason for turning  
himself in. ``He was just very business-like,'' Cooke said 
Thursday. ``He just came in because the probation officer urged him 
to surrender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick L. Meehan, Delaware County district attorney, attributed  
confusion over the warrant to ``miscommunication at the prison 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he wanted to know why Bennett was let go at a time when  
an active warrant was out for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a problem that should not have occurred,'' he said.  
``Where was the breakdown? And how can the system be changed so 
that this doesn't happen again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prison Board Chairman Charles P. Sexton Jr. said the prison  
would investigate and report to Meehan. He declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke defended his officers, saying they followed proper  
procedures and, under the circumstances, couldn't have acted 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy in hindsight to say, if he had been in custody,  
then the murder wouldn't have happened,'' Cooke said. ``If we all 
had a crystal ball, how easy police work would be.''

<HEADLINE> High School Hoops Star Sues To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rickey Higgins' senior season was his chance to  
catch the eye of college basketball recruiters. But it was over 
before it even started. 
</P>
<P>
	As a junior last year, he helped lead Warren Township High  
School to a surprising second-place finish in the state basketball 
tournament. After that, his troubles began, and within three 
months, the 17-year-old was arrested twice on alcohol-related 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	He was subsequently declared ineligible for the upcoming  
basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Higgins is suing his suburban high school. In a federal  
lawsuit, Higgins says he is recovering alcoholic and argues that 
the school's disciplinary action amounts to discrimination under 
the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I deserve a second chance,'' Higgins said Thursday.  
``Most people who are alcoholics think no one will help them, and 
I'm getting that feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins is seeking his reinstatement to the team and $100,000 in  
compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say Higgins may have a tough time proving his case  
under the ADA, although they acknowledge courts continue to 
decipher it almost a decade after it was passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor who helped  
write the ADA, said the law can't be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	``An employer or school has no obligation to accommodate an  
alcoholic if they didn't know he was an alcoholic,'' she said. 
``You don't get second chances under the ADA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett Rodick, the attorney for Warren Township High School,  
said the lawsuit is ``clearly an attempt to broaden the ADA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The ADA cannot be used as a shield against the consequences of  
illegal conduct,'' he said. ``I think the school has a right to 
expect of its athletes or anyone involved in extracurricular 
activities that they don't engage in illegal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins, a 5-foot-11 guard, missed much of last season with a  
back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to lead the team in scoring in its state semifinal  
victory and was named second team all-tournament. The second-place 
finish in March was the best ever for Warren Township High, about 
30 miles north of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins was cited in April when he was the passenger in a car  
that contained open alcohol. In May, he was convicted of driving 
under the influence of alcohol after he ran into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, school officials ruled that Higgins violated the  
school's athletic code, which says any student-athlete involved in 
two alcohol-related incidents loses a year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins' alcoholism was diagnosed by the teen's personal  
physician and also a psychologist and social worker he has been 
working with, said his attorney, Steven Glink. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid could not control his use of alcohol,'' Glink said.  
``Because he could not control it it's a disability and he should 
not be punished for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins' father and grandfather also are alcoholics, Glink said.  
</P>
<P>
	Higgins said he has received recruiting letters from colleges  
and hoped to make an impression on some bigger schools this season. 
He said his family was disappointed with the district's decision 
because he reported the incidents to the school and then took steps 
to correct his problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a dream of mine to play college ball,'' he  
said. ``This will definitely hurt that. I just want to get out 
there and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Decker, executive director of the National Association of  
Protection and Advocacy Systems, a group that provides legal 
advocacy services to people with disabilities, said the 1990 law 
covers recovering alcoholics and drug abusers but not current 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he had not seen the lawsuit, Decker said it sounds like  
the school was reacting to specific incidents and not the fact 
Higgins may be an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he can claim he was discriminated against based  
on those incidents,'' Decker said. ``My guess is we would never 
touch a case like this.''

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter Dies at 53 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter died Thursday, one year  
after learning Lou Gehrig's disease was the reason he could barely 
toss a baseball with an arm once famous for pinpoint control. He

<HEADLINE> Top Dole Campaign Aide Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole's communications director, Ari  
Fleischer, is leaving her Republican presidential campaign next 
week to explore opportunities in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to a point in your career when the prospect of less  
hours and more money is appealing,'' Fleischer said in a telephone 
interview. The campaign had planned to announce the change Friday, 
but Fleischer confirmed his departure after being contacted by The 
Associated Press and told that sources said he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes at a critical time for the former American Red  
Cross president who is trying to build momentum from a solid 
third-place finish in Iowa's straw poll. Her public profile has 
been surprisingly low since the Aug. 14 event, but she is planning 
several high-profile appearances this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of Dole's most visible senior adviser could fuel  
speculation about the viability of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer said he is leaving on good terms.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss her. I think she's a great lady. I still  
think she is going to make history,'' said Fleischer, who broke the 
news to Mrs. Dole over the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talked to Mrs. Dole, we ended up hugging,'' Fleischer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good man and I'm going to miss him and the campaign is  
going to miss him,'' said campaign manager Tom Daffron, who hopes 
to announce a replacement shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer has casually discussed private-sector options since  
June, including the possibility of joining a trade association, a 
public relations firm or opening his own media consulting company. 
But he said he didn't want to fully explore those opportunities 
while on Dole's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew if I started talking to people it would get out. That's  
not the way I do business. If I'm going to do something, it's going 
to be forthright,'' Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, 38, is former communications director of the powerful  
House Ways and Means Committee. He joined the Dole campaign in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second top aide to depart the campaign. Consultant  
Kieran Mahoney left in May, saying he wanted to spend more time 
with his family. Officials close to the situation said Mahoney was 
not satisfied with his role in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> STDs on Rise for Gay Seattle Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An apparent increase in risky sexual behavior may  
be contributing to a re-emergence of syphilis and gonorrhea among 
gay men in the Seattle area, according to federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington's King County, which includes Seattle, cases of  
syphilis jumped from zero in 1996 to 46 in the first half of 1999, 
while gonorrhea went from 180 cases per 100,000 gay men in 1997 to 
430 in 1998 and 420 in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has alarmed health officials because those infected  
with syphilis run a much higher risk of acquiring and transmitting 
the AIDS virus, the CDC said. More than 70 percent of the gay men 
infected with syphilis there had the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think if we're not able to reverse these kinds of behavior,  
increased HIV rates will follow,'' said Alonzo Plough, director of 
public health for Seattle and King County. 
</P>
<P>
	After an epidemic in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the number  
of cases of syphilis in King County dropped off dramatically in the 
mid-1990s. The estimated rate of syphilis in the Seattle area is 
projected at 200 per 100,000 gay men for 1999, compared with 90 per 
100,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact reason for the rise in the sexually transmitted  
diseases is unknown, but the CDC said it appears to be due to an 
increase in unprotected sex with anonymous partners, especially in 
places like bathhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC and other health officials have warned recently about  
growing complacency about AIDS because of the powerful new drug 
cocktails that can subdue the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar syphilis outbreaks in gay men have been reported in San  
Francisco and Chicago, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that the successes on the drug treatment side can  
gives us even greater prevention challenges,'' Plough said. 
</P>
<P>
	Syphilis causes rashes and lesions and, if left untreated, can  
lead to degeneration of bones, heart and nerve tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bakan, senior editor of the Seattle Gay News, called for  
a ``reinvigorated education effort for gay men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's an absolutely dangerous decline in the amount  
of educational programs'' promoting safe sex, he said. ``Maybe 
we've lost that momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we always assume that young people just assimilate  
this information, and they don't. Many of these people come from 
homes where sex was just not talked about.''

<HEADLINE> Fan Selling McGwire's 500th HR Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Shearer, the 28-year-old architect who  
caught McGwire's 500th home run ball, has decided to sell it during 
an Oct. 30 auction in Las Vegas that also will include Mickey 
Mantle's 500th home run ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to a lot of people,'' Shearer said Thursday. ``We  
talked a lot to my wife's family and my family. The more we talked 
about it, we started to feel better about selling it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's ball, along with Mantle's, is the highlight of the  
auction, arranged by Michael Barnes, president of One-of-a-Kind 
Actions in Festus, Mo. Last season, Barnes helped Phil Ozersky, a 
26-year-old researcher at Washington University, sell McGwire's 
70th home run ball. Canadian comic book tycoon Todd McFarlane paid 
$3,005,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the market is strongly weighted for current  
players: McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.,'' Barnes said. 
``At this sale, what you have is the power hitter of the past, and 
the power hitter of today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season began, Barnes offered $100,000 to whoever  
caught McGwire's 500th. The $100,000, however, was just an advance 
on what the ball might bring at an auction. Eddie Murray's 500th 
home run ball sold for $200,000, money that the seller put in a 
20-year annuity that eventually will be worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been making sure that we're sure it will sell for more  
than $100,000,'' Barnes said. ``We feel it's a very strong 
six-figure ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no definite plans for what Shearer and his wife  
Jennifer will do with the money, although Jim mentioned his student 
loan debt. And after paying his alma maters back, he's ready to 
give them some more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be disappointed if I don't get enough to share with the  
high school and colleges that we went to,'' Shearer said. Donations 
to other charities are in their plans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball has been resting safely in a safe deposit box since  
McGwire hit it Aug. 5. Shearer hasn't made any trips to the bank 
``just to look at it,'' but said he's shown it off quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sit there and look at it, and it's just a baseball,'' he  
said. ``But then, you remember sitting in the stands and watching 
it sail toward your seat, and it gets kind of exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting his 500th home run, McGwire said the bat he used  
to hit it would be donated to the Hall of Fame, and he'd like to 
see the ball join it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a true believer that anything that's historical, or that  
anytime somebody reaches a milestone, that it belongs in the hall 
of fame,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen players have hit 500 homers and the Hall of Fame has  
four of the balls. Shearer said he has been in contact with the 
Hall, and hopes to reach an arrangement to display the ball there 
until the auction.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China To Resume WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The United States and China agreed  
today to restart negotiations on Chinese entry into the World Trade 
Organization, brightening the atmosphere for a presidential summit 
after four months of strained ties. 
</P>
<P>
	The most senior U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators hashed out  
the decision in an unexpectedly lengthy three-hour meeting. Both 
skipped a dinner for trade ministers attending the Pacific Rim 
free-trade forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discussion underscored the desire to re-engage in  
substantive discussions,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky said in brief remarks afterward. ``That in itself is 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to work together to conclude negotiations at an  
early date and bring China into the WTO at an early date,'' Chinese 
trade minister Shi Guangsheng said in comments a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said the two set no deadline, and neither provided  
details on their meeting nor said when more talks would be held. As 
small a step forward as it was, their decision demonstrated a 
willingness by both governments to put the acrimony of the last 
four months behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	After U.S. planes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in  
May, relations unraveling for months plummeted further. China 
suspended contacts on human rights, arms controls, military affairs 
and the WTO, and it demanded U.S. redress for the bombing, which 
Beijing believes was deliberate, but Washington claims was 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, diplomatic efforts to repair ties have  
quickened ahead of the meeting between President Clinton and 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Saturday before a summit of the 
21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign  
Minister Tang Jiaxuan held a 90-minute discussion over breakfast 
today on restoring the severed dialogues. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a clear desire on both sides to see a significant  
improvement in relations,'' a senior administration official said 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang attempted to pressure Albright for concessions on Taiwan,  
telling reporters the island remained the biggest stumbling block 
to better China-U.S. ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears about a war between China and Taiwan have risen the past  
few months after the Taiwanese president likened their relations to 
those between equal states. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as a 
renegade province, threatened to retake the island by force and has 
tried to determine Washington's response. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright repeated to Tang that Washington acknowledges China's  
claim to Taiwan but wants to see the dispute settled peacefully, 
the senior administration official said.

<HEADLINE>  A's Get Boost From Appier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Kevin Appier had just given up a bloop,  
two-out, two-run, game-tying single to Darren Lewis in the 
Athletics' biggest game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as he pitched to the next batter, he felt a sting in his  
chronically sore right leg and limped a bit around the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Art Howe and team trainer Larry Davis hurried out to  
check on him, but Appier just growled, told them to get off the 
field and reared back to strike out Mike Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	And with that, Appier pushed through the pain and kept Oakland  
close in what shapes up as a pulsating race with Boston for the AL 
wild-card berth. The Red Sox lead Oakland by three games with 22 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's wound up 6-2 winners Wednesday in their last meeting of  
the year with the Red Sox, snapping Boston's four-game winning 
streak and ending their own three-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Kevin because he's a true professional, and that's why  
he was brought here,'' first baseman Jason Giambi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier spent his 10-year career in Kansas City before coming  
Oakland in a July 31 trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pitching out there hurt,'' Giambi said. ``He wants to be  
a part of all this and the whole team knows it and we get up for 
his games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he was pitching in a game the A's absolutely had to have to  
maintain a realistic chance at catching the Red Sox. Appier would 
go six innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He finished by 
fanning pinch-hitter Reggie Jefferson with two on and two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell a guy who's a warrior by the way he leaves it all  
out there on the field,'' A's catcher Mike Macfarlane said. ``That 
last strike to Jefferson was filthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relievers Tim Kubinski and Doug Jones completed the five-hitter  
begun by Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of my better outings,'' said Appier, who improved  
to 5-3 with a 5.63 ERA as a member of the A's. ``I was pumped up 
but it was real easy to get pumped up for this one. There was a lot 
on the line and fortunately we played a great game. I'm hoping we 
can play great ball from here on out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who has been bothered by a nagging thigh muscle injury  
since early in the season with Kansas City, said he thinks he can 
get through the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It barked a couple times while I was out there but I don't  
think it inhibited me,'' Appier said. ``It's improved over last 
game and hopefully these last few games, it will be all the way 
back to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giambi said the A's are counting on Appier to steady the club's  
young pitching staff as the team gears up for its playoff push. And 
Appier delivered a key lesson with his gritty performance 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin has always been a great pitcher,'' Giambi said. ``He's  
just been snake bit a couple times but he came back strong in a 
huge game for us and we needed that kind of game out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heck of a lot easier being three games down than five  
games down. It would have been nice to be two back, but we'll take 
where we are, try to take care of our business every night and see 
where we go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland opens a seven-game road trip Friday in Tampa Bay.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston, 4-2 midway through what Butch Huskey calls the team's  
road trip of the year, finishes it against two top teams, starting 
a series Friday in New York before going to Cleveland for three 
more games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a pretty good situation. We're still three games  
up,'' said Boston's Pat Rapp, an unlucky loser Wednesday when three 
Red Sox errors led to four unearned runs. ``We have tough teams 
coming up on the road trip and we still have to battle.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Devalues Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government will devalue  
the national currency, a newsletter reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The move reflected the weakness of the economy after a decade of  
mismanagement and NATO's 78-day bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The V.I.P. newsletter quoted Deputy Prime Minister Jovan Zebic  
as saying that state financial institutions had been ordered to 
strengthen foreign currency reserves ahead of the devaluation. No 
date was set for the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The official exchange rate for the dinar now is 11 to one dollar  
-- half the black market rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The last devaluation of the dinar was in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	A similar decision was postponed in October because the National  
Bank's hard currency reserves were too low to protect any new 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, hard currency reserves were estimated at  
approximately $110 million. To increase the reserves -- to nearly 
$300 million -- the government recently proposed that all foreign 
trade companies have at least $5,500 on permanent bank deposit.

<HEADLINE> Danforth Vows Thorough Waco Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vowing to pursue the ``dark questions'' of the  
Waco siege, former Republican Sen. John Danforth opened an 
independent inquiry Thursday into whether the FBI started the 
deadly fire and later tried to cover its actions. He pledged a 
thorough inquiry that could include questioning of Attorney General 
Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, talking to reporters at the White House,  
applauded the selection of Danforth, calling him ``an honorable man 
and an intelligent and straightforward man. The only thing I would 
ask is that he conduct a thorough and prompt investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton added that ``I certainly don't think there's any  
reason'' for Reno to resign as several Republican leaders have 
urged. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in the Justice Department, where Reno  
announced she had appointed him, Danforth said the country can 
survive bad judgment, ``but the thing that really undermines the 
integrity of government is whether there were bad acts, whether 
there was a cover-up and whether the government killed people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth  
said. ``How did the fire start? Were there shootings?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his inquiry would include whether false statements were  
made to Congress and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, who said he has authority to question both Reno and  
Freeh, will hold the title special counsel and is empowered to use 
a federal grand jury for his investigation. He said he hoped to get 
voluntary cooperation for what will start as an administrative, not 
a criminal, inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Danforth also will investigate whether there ``was any  
illegal use of the armed forces'' in the final assault. Members of 
the Pentagon's Delta Force commandoes were at Waco the day of the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, who spoke with Danforth briefly this week, said in a  
statement that he welcomed the selection, and Reno called Danforth 
``a man of impeccable credentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the former senator made a round of courtesy calls on Capitol  
Hill, congressional leaders said they envision Congress' own Waco 
investigations will be more wide-ranging than Danforth's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know it all,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she herself had no plans to resign, despite calls from  
some Republicans to do so. ``I don't run from controversy,'' she 
said, removing herself entirely from the Waco matter from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will obviously be a witness, and I think it's important''  
the probe ``be conducted without influence of those who had been 
involved,'' Reno explained. With that, Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder would be the top person Danforth consults at Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has said that before the April 19, 1993, FBI assault on the  
Branch Davidian compound, she directed that only non-incendiary 
tear gas be used, to avoid the possibility of triggering a fire 
that might endanger lives. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been under renewed criticism since revelations that the  
FBI, contradicting a position it had taken for six years, had used 
some incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff, 
which ended in a fire and the deaths of David Koresh and about 80 
followers. Reno and the FBI maintain that the devices did not cause 
the deadly fire, which they insist was set by the cult members. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
Congress should not defer to the executive branch in delving into 
Waco because ``after all, Congress was misled by the executive 
branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that they would do it in the broadest possible  
way,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions Danforth said he would leave for Congress:  
whether it was a good idea for the FBI to have assaulted the 
compound on the final day and for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms to have raided it three months earlier, beginning the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth chose as his deputy the U.S. attorney in St. Louis,  
Edward Dowd, a Clinton appointee who is joining the St. Louis law 
firm where Danforth is a partner. A lifelong Democrat, Dowd was 
recommended for the U.S. attorney's job by House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. Dowd's father was the Democratic nominee for 
Missouri governor in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said the investigative legwork in his inquiry would be  
done by private investigators ``to the maximum extent'' possible 
and by ``some government investigators'' from agencies other than 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,''  
said Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``I can't say that under no circumstances would I  
call on any help at all from the FBI, because I don't know how the 
course of this will proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth will remain at his law firm in St. Louis but probably  
will open an office in Washington. Dowd will be full time on the 
probe, and Danforth will devote most of his time to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said some family members and friends advised him not to  
take the job, with one telling him it would not be a good career 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, hey, I'm 63'' and ``at this point in your life. ...''  
Danforth joked with reporters. He said the gravity of the questions 
surrounding Waco compelled him to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said he wants to present as many of the facts as he can  
to the American people -- a goal that could be difficult if his 
inquiry turns into a criminal investigation and he starts using a 
grand jury to question witnesses under oath. Grand jury testimony 
is secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth and the FBI agents could face some difficult choices.  
</P>
<P>
	Agents who cooperate voluntarily could be placing themselves in  
legal jeopardy by talking, depending on what evidence they provide. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agent refuses to answer, Danforth must decide whether to  
immunize the witness to compel him to talk, a step that would 
probably preclude Danforth from prosecuting the person later if 
Danforth decides the agent has engaged in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth is the first person to wield the powers spelled out in  
a new set of Justice Department regulations adopted in the wake of 
the expiration of the independent counsel statute June 30.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy could  
miss up to two weeks after having minor hip surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a relatively simple procedure,'' Avalanche trainer Pat  
Karns said Thursday. ``Patrick shouldn't be out for more than a few 
weeks. He's been experiencing some pain in his right hip, and the 
surgery will alleviate the pain.''

<HEADLINE> A's Get Boost From Appier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Kevin Appier had just given up a bloop,  
two-out, two-run, game-tying single to Darren Lewis in the 
Athletics' biggest game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as he pitched to the next batter, he felt a sting in his  
chronically sore right leg and limped a bit around the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Art Howe and team trainer Larry Davis hurried out to  
check on him, but Appier just growled, told them to get off the 
field and reared back to strike out Mike Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	And with that, Appier pushed through the pain and kept Oakland  
close in what shapes up as a pulsating race with Boston for the AL 
wild-card berth. The Red Sox lead Oakland by three games with 22 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's wound up 6-2 winners Wednesday in their last meeting of  
the year with the Red Sox, snapping Boston's four-game winning 
streak and ending their own three-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Kevin because he's a true professional, and that's why  
he was brought here,'' first baseman Jason Giambi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier spent his 10-year career in Kansas City before coming  
Oakland in a July 31 trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pitching out there hurt,'' Giambi said. ``He wants to be  
a part of all this and the whole team knows it and we get up for 
his games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he was pitching in a game the A's absolutely had to have to  
maintain a realistic chance at catching the Red Sox. Appier would 
go six innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He finished by 
fanning pinch-hitter Reggie Jefferson with two on and two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell a guy who's a warrior by the way he leaves it all  
out there on the field,'' A's catcher Mike Macfarlane said. ``That 
last strike to Jefferson was filthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relievers Tim Kubinski and Doug Jones completed the five-hitter  
begun by Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of my better outings,'' said Appier, who improved  
to 5-3 with a 5.63 ERA as a member of the A's. ``I was pumped up 
but it was real easy to get pumped up for this one. There was a lot 
on the line and fortunately we played a great game. I'm hoping we 
can play great ball from here on out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who has been bothered by a nagging thigh muscle injury  
since early in the season with Kansas City, said he thinks he can 
get through the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It barked a couple times while I was out there but I don't  
think it inhibited me,'' Appier said. ``It's improved over last 
game and hopefully these last few games, it will be all the way 
back to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giambi said the A's are counting on Appier to steady the club's  
young pitching staff as the team gears up for its playoff push. And 
Appier delivered a key lesson with his gritty performance 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin has always been a great pitcher,'' Giambi said. ``He's  
just been snake bit a couple times but he came back strong in a 
huge game for us and we needed that kind of game out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heck of a lot easier being three games down than five  
games down. It would have been nice to be two back, but we'll take 
where we are, try to take care of our business every night and see 
where we go from here.''

road trip of the year, finishes it against two top teams, starting

<HEADLINE> Sony Signs On With TiVo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Sony Corp. of America joined a growing  
list of companies rushing to market the latest device for couch 
potatoes by taking a stake in TiVo Inc., a maker of digital video 
recorders that could one day replace VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony plans to invest more than $25 million in Sunnyvale,  
Calif.-based TiVo and will become one of the company's two 
producers of ``personal video recorders'' -- set-top devices that 
rely on hard drives rather than videotape to record television 
shows. TiVo had already signed up Philips Electronics to 
manufacture the devices, which began selling at Best Buy stores on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	PVR technology allows viewers to replay a portion of a program  
while the machine continues to record the rest and can skip over 
commercials more readily than VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony would own or 8.8 percent of TiVo after the company's  
upcoming initial public offering, TiVo said Wednesday in an amended 
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TiVo 
plans to sell another 5.5 million shares to the public, hoping to 
raise at least $71.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	TiVo is one of two California companies that have developed PVR  
technology. Replay Networks of Mountain View also has developed the 
technology and has licensed Matsushita Electronic Co.'s Panasonic 
to sell its product. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices range in price from $499 to $1,499. TiVo also  
charges a monthly service fee.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Players Injured, Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Second baseman Luis Castillo's breakthrough season  
with the Florida Marlins may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo dislocated his left shoulder during Wednesday's 5-4  
victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in 13 innings. He'll be 
sidelined indefinitely, but there's a chance Castillo can return 
before the end of the season, manager John Boles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida also lost outfielder Todd Dunwoody, who fractured his  
left thumb when he was hit by a pitch in the 12th inning. He's out 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo hurt his shoulder diving for a ground ball in the  
ninth. He injured the same shoulder in the minor leagues in 1995, 
missing the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo has been perhaps the Marlins' best player this year,  
hitting .302 and stealing 50 bases. He tied a club record with a 
22-game hitting streak that ended Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the 23-year-old second baseman's first full major-league  
season. He won a starting job in spring training and is now 
considered a cornerstone of the franchise's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our club, if he doesn't get on base, we have a heck of a  
time scoring,'' Boles said before Wednesday's game.

</P>
<P>
	France Telecom, a former government monopoly that owns France's  
cable lines, and Suez Lyonnaise, a major utility company that also 
provides cable services, will initially hold 49.9 percent and 50.1 
percent stakes respectively in the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, the product of a year of tough negotiations,  
calls for the signing on of a third partner with expertise in the 
cable industry to join in the venture by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new partner, who has yet to be named, will buy a stake of up  
to 20 percent in the new company while Suez Lyonnaise will reduce 
its interest to around 38.4 percent. France Telecom will gradually 
sell out of the group in the next three years, after which shares 
in the company will be floated on the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wavers on Immigration Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, facing criticism  
from rival GOP presidential candidates, backed off his vow to deny 
border states reimbursement for illegal immigration-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner told the San Francisco Chronicle  
last week that if elected, he would not pay California back for the 
billions of dollars illegal immigration costs annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a federal role,'' Bush told the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
	Those costs include providing illegal immigrants medical  
treatment and education, and incarcerating the criminals among 
them. A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling held that states must 
educate illegal immigrants, and the federal government requires 
states to provide them emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign later said the governor misunderstood the  
question. It released a statement saying that Bush believed he was 
being asked whether the federal government should reimburse state 
for costs of education funding in general. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle, in a story published Wednesday, said its reporter  
specifically asked Bush whether he would reimburse California for 
money the state spends on services and education for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush is supportive of  
reimbursing states for incarceration, education and medical 
treatment of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, such reimbursements are sometimes inadequate and should  
be improved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took office as Texas governor, Bush inherited and later  
supported a lawsuit seeking reimbursement from the federal 
government for the costs of illegal immigration. A federal judge 
dismissed it in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican candidate Steve Forbes, riding an Amtrak train toward  
Philadelphia, denounced Bush's position as published in the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes likened border states' immigration costs to a natural  
disaster, and said the federal government should help, just as it 
does after an earthquake or a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Controlling the borders is a national responsibility,'' Forbes  
said. ``I think it's a national responsibility to reimburse states 
for those costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also seeking the presidential  
nomination, said the federal government's ``refusal'' to reimburse 
California helped precipitate divisive battles over illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``One issue on which those on all sides of the immigration  
debate can agree is that the federal government must meet its 
obligation to reimburse state and local governments for the costs 
associated with illegal immigration,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Harrison, a spokesman for the California Finance  
Department, said the cost of educating illegal immigrants in the 
state is estimated at about $2 billion a year. The federal 
government does not pay for any of that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It costs the state $577 million to incarcerate undocumented  
immigrants; the state received $173 million from Washington in the 
1998-99 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis has requested $273 million from the federal  
government for 1999-2000, Harrison said, ``basically to make a 
statement that they owe us more.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Acquire Garcia From Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Third baseman Freddy Garcia was acquired by the  
Atlanta Braves from the Pittsburgh Pirates on Thursday for for 
minor league pitcher Greg Dukeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, 27, hit .231 with five doubles, six homers and 23 RBIs  
in 55 games with the Pirates this season before he was sent to 
Triple-A Nashville. He will join the Braves in time for their game 
at San Francisco on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dukeman, selected by the Braves in the 1997 amateur draft, was  
0-1 with a 3.38 ERA in 17 games this year with Danville, a rookie 
league team. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Garcia on their roster, the Braves transferred  
pitcher Rudy Seanez from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves infielder Marty Malloy, who had been designated for  
assignment, cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple-A 
Richmond.

<HEADLINE> Texas Tech's Williams Out Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Texas isn't the only school trying to cope  
with life without Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech, which has a star running back of the same name, will  
have to replace its Williams for Saturday night's game against 
Louisiana-Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams injured his left knee Monday night during the second  
quarter of a season-opening loss to Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	He played until the third quarter, then left with a career-low  
33 yards on 13 carries and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Spike Dykes said losing Williams, even for a game, was a  
``catastrophe'' for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky Williams is one of the hardest working, leaders on our  
team,'' Dykes said. ``Not having him on the field means we lose a 
lot of experience and leadership and a lot of ability to run the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed that Williams sprained the anterior cruciate  
ligament in the knee. He's wearing a leg wrap and walking with 
crutches until being further evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has played every game at Tech the past two seasons. He  
ran for 1,582 yards and 13 touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After being hurt, Williams had his knee bandaged and returned to  
the field minutes later. In the second half, he told trainers that 
he felt the knee give out, and was helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Williams will be freshman Shaud Williams, who ran for  
40 yards on five carries Monday.

<HEADLINE> Global Y2K Air Readiness of Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two months after a deadline, nations worldwide  
are rushing to report the readiness of their airlines and airports 
for the Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	As of the end of August, 53 countries still had not responded to  
a survey issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a 
U.N. group that sets international flight standards. In recent 
days, the number has fallen to 41. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-based organization had asked its 185 members to  
respond by July 1, so other nations could gauge where it will be 
safe to fly on New Year's Eve, when older computers may malfunction 
at the start of the 2000. A report by ICAO, originally due to be 
released by July 31, is now scheduled to be released this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Mead, inspector general of the Transportation  
Department, told a joint meeting of two House subcommittees 
Thursday that it is imperative the lagging nations disclose their 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is running out,'' Mead said. ``In our opinion, these  
`uncertainties' should be resolved by Oct. 15, 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denis Chagnon, an ICAO spokesman, downplayed the impact of the  
nations' tardiness. ``The ones that have not responded represent a 
small portion of international traffic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Fiji, the Cook Islands and Papua, New Guinea,  
according to data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony to the two panels -- the Science technology  
subcommittee and the House Government Reform and Oversight 
management subcommittee -- a government official said international 
airlines also appeared to be playing catch-up with their Year 2000 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Willemssen, head of civil agencies information systems for  
the General Accounting Office, said the FAA had collected 
information on 146 international airlines between April and May. 
According to its latest figures, about 33 percent said their 
computer systems were ready for the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 35 percent planned to complete their work by Sept. 30,  
and the remaining 32 percent planned on a later date or did not 
provide information. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the International Air Transport Association,  
which represents international airlines, told a New York news 
conference that travelers should not be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel confident any airline that chooses to fly  
internationally can do so safely,'' said spokesman William 
Gaillard. ``There will be no safety and security issues that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In general terms, the Year 2000 problem could affect older  
computers. Some were programmed to recognize years in two-digit 
format, such as ``99'' for 1999. There is concern that they may 
misconstrue the Year 2000, or ``00,'' as the start of 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	As of June 30, the FAA said its systems were ready. U.S. and  
Canadian airlines said recently their systems were 95 percent ready 
and would be fully prepared by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department plans to issue advisories soon  
about international destinations.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Faces Boxing Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Boxing's bad boy is coming to the Motor City next  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamboyant WBO featherweight champion Prince Naseem Hamed will  
face WBC titleholder Cesar Soto in a 12-round unification match on 
Oct. 22 at Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Englishman, of Yemeni descent, is considered one of the  
hardest punchers in boxing -- pound-for-pound. But he is best known 
for his leopard-print trunks and his 10-minute entrances that 
finish with a flip over the top rope and into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've brought some flash into boxing when it badly  
needed it,'' Hamed said. ``I'm supremely confident, but I always 
back it up. There's no pressure on me, because I know what I will 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in his unbeaten career, Hamed made several Muhammed  
Ali-like predictions of the exact round he would win by knockout. 
But after his last two fights produced just a decision win and an 
11th-round knockout, and since he's facing someone who has never 
been knocked out in an 11-year career, he declined to do much 
prognosticating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to make any predictions, because I've been wrong  
the last couple times,'' he said Thursday. ``We are both heavy 
punchers, so I think it will end in a knockout, but it could be 
early or it could be late. I just know that it won't be me getting 
knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Soto's WBC belt is more prestigious than Hamed's WBO  
title, the Mexican will enter the ring as a huge underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I expect to win the fight,'' Soto said through an  
interpreter. ``We both hit very hard, so I don't think the fight 
will last long. I'm going to fight like a true Mexican warrior -- an 
Aztec.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The card, which will also include a super-bantamweight title  
fight between Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough, will be televised 
live by HBO. That will mark the first time in nearly 30 years of 
boxing that HBO will present a card from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	On the undercard, Thomas Hearns, a Detroit boxing legend, will  
defend the pbscure IBO cruiserweight title against Crawford Ashley. 
Trainer Emanuel Steward expects it to be the 40-year-old Hearns 
last fight in Detroit, with his career scheduled to end in a 
pay-per-view fight in Las Vegas in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were offered a fight with Ashley last year, but we turned  
it down,'' Steward said. ``He's a tough guy, and we know we are 
bringing in a competitive fighter. Then we should wrap it up in 
December, but we don't know who that will be with yet. The 
mandatory IBO defense is Virgil Hill, but Tommy beat him already, 
and he's a dull fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hearns has been a welterweight, junior middleweight,  
middleweight and light heavyweight champion.

<HEADLINE> Schools Finally Open in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Teachers welcomed 180,000 students to their first  
day of classes today after testing the reform-minded school board 
and their own union leaders by staying off the job for more than a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Detroit Federation of Teachers voted  
overwhelmingly Wednesday to return to work this morning. Some 
headed back to their schools after the vote to begin classroom 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	At Joy Middle School, pupils were greeted by yellow and blue  
balloons and ribbons and held a back-to-school rally. Terrance 
Knight, 28, attended with his son, Christopher Long, who started 
the sixth grade today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can't wait to get going,'' said Knight, who added that it  
was tough to get his children to go to bed on time Wednesday night. 
His daughter started eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters have a half-day of classes today, followed Friday  
by a full day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with the teachers' decision to return to  
school immediately. We believe that the return to schools will 
allow Detroit Public Schools to maintain the momentum that was 
developed for improvements in the school system,'' the district's 
chief executive, David Adamany, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote by the 11,500-member teachers union didn't  
guarantee an end to the strike that began Aug. 30, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers merely voted to approve a temporary extension of their  
old contract until the union could organize a vote on whether to 
ratify a tentative agreement reached with the school district on 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratification ballots were expected to be mailed to teachers  
around Sept. 20, said Keith Johnson, the union's lead negotiator. 
Rejection of the tentative deal could send teachers back to picket 
lines, but Johnson said he didn't think that was likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got an overwhelming vote of confidence from our members,''  
he said. ``It's certainly an improvement from what was initially 
proposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first academic year for the Detroit district since the  
Michigan Legislature put it under the control of Mayor Dennis 
Archer was to have begun Aug. 31. Union President John Elliott and 
bargainers for the district planned to extend the teachers' old 
contract by 10 days while talks over the new agreement continued. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Aug. 30, thousands of teachers surprised their union and  
the school board by rejecting the contract extension. That marked 
the beginning of a strike that drew fire from state lawmakers, who 
hinted that the teachers would face stiff penalties if they stayed 
off the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city, performed so  
poorly that the state Legislature voted to remove the elected 
school board and replace it with a board appointed by Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the reforms proposed by Adamany -- including a longer  
school day and merit pay -- were sidelined after the teachers voted 
to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary teacher Abdulhaleem Ibnjames said he was ready to go  
back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contract is not to my liking, but when do you go to the  
negotiating table and get everything you want?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Entry to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The scene is common across China's cities:  
migrants from the cramped countryside crowd street corners looking 
for work while nearby laid-off factory workers squat on sidewalks 
selling shoddy wares for change. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment by official admission is already at unsettling  
levels across China. And the communist government is about to 
increase the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-month suspension driven by acrimony with the United  
States, China is set to reopen negotiations this week to join the 
World Trade Organization. Even the most benign projections 
acknowledge that the market-opening concessions needed for 
membership will close factories and farms, forcing more people out 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, China's reform-minded leaders have become eager to  
make it into WTO and end a 13-year effort to join world trade's 
rule-making body. A deal could come as early as Saturday, when 
President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin join a summit 
of Pacific rim leaders in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and China agreed today to restart negotiations  
on Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization, brightening the 
atmosphere before the presidential summit. The most senior U.S. and 
Chinese trade negotiators hashed out the decision in an 
unexpectedly lengthy three-hour meeting in Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismal state of the economy and the potential for social  
unrest have made the Communist Party's leadership desperate for 
solutions, and one is WTO membership. Deficit spending and interest 
rate cuts have failed for nearly two years to arrest sliding 
economic growth and falling prices. Deflation is looming, and 
beyond that, perhaps a devaluation of the yuan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambitious reforms that Jiang and his premier, Zhu Rongji, hoped  
would remove the last vestiges of central planning from the economy 
have all but stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	After Clinton rejected a broad market-opening offer by Zhu in  
April, opponents of reform -- managers of big state industries 
fearful of competition, provincial politicians and communist 
conservatives -- coalesced and called the proposal a sellout. 
Military hawks wary of foreign intentions joined in after NATO 
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, and China called off WTO 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese people ought to remind Chinese leaders not to  
place China-U.S. relations above the national interest,'' Gan Yang, 
a conservative scholar and magazine editor in Hong Kong wrote in an 
article that became an anti-WTO rallying call. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders hope joining WTO will spur the economy and  
``avoid political debates and ideological obstacles'' to further 
reform, said Hai Wen, an economist at Peking University. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is at a kind of crossroads because we are a socialist  
market economy,'' Hai said. ``The political risk is very high if 
you want to push for further market-oriented reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To recapture the initiative, Zhu sent foreign trade officials to  
major provincial cities during the past two months to sell WTO 
membership, Western and Asian diplomats said. The message, 
according to the diplomats, focused on the benefits of joining the 
WTO and the inevitability of global competition. 
</P>
<P>
	By binding China to a series of steps to lower tariffs and open  
its domestic markets, WTO membership would boost imports and 
exports, force cosseted state industries into the market and 
re-energize foreign investors whose interests have waned, Hai and 
other economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO could bring China as much as a full percentage point of  
economic growth, according to an estimate by the solidly capitalist 
China International Capital Corporation Ltd., China's first 
investment bank. Even that slim margin could mean fewer jobs lost. 
</P>
<P>
	China's labor minister said last month that 7.4 million urban  
workers lost their jobs in the first half of the year, nearly as 
many as all of last year. On top of that, 130 million farmers are 
scouring cities for work. Beijing alone estimates it has 1.5 
million more migrants than needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outsiders come in here looking for work, and there are  
already so many laid-off people,'' said Cui, a retired factory 
worker who would only give his surname. He augments his pension 
repairing bicycles near the Yongding Gate overpass, one of many 
spots migrants gather hoping to pick up work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reform is bad and not reforming is bad too. The only thing is  
to reform slowly,'' Cui said with a resigned sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	China International Capital, in a recent report, predicted that  
WTO membership would push millions more farmers off China's tiny, 
inefficient farms. Chinese and Western economists expect workers in 
the automobile, pharmaceutical, telecommunications and steel 
industries to be hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
	By joining WTO now, Zhu and his government hope to be able to  
blunt the pain. A quick entry would give China a say in the next 
round of global trade talks, due to start in November. Agricultural 
tariffs are a key target.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Kosovo War Showed Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Kosovo conflict served as a reminder that  
the United States cannot commit troops in every crisis that 
``catches our eye and emotion,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a conference of the International Institute for  
Strategic Studies in Coronado, Calif., Cohen said the United States 
and its NATO allies were right to intervene in Kosovo to end Serb 
repression. But the experience also underscored that intervention 
is not the answer in every crisis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the enduring lessons of this and every conflict is that  
we must resist the temptation to use our forces in every dispute 
that catches our eye and emotion,'' Cohen said in remarks prepared 
for delivery. An advance copy of his speech was made available to 
reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen made no mention in his prepared remarks of the crisis  
unfolding in East Timor. His comments on limiting U.S. military 
commitments seemed to suggest, however, a reluctance to consider 
sending troops to that area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the 78-day NATO air war against Yugoslavia showed the  
changing nature of warfare and political conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it highlighted a ``superpower paradox'': U.S. supremacy  
in conventional military power is prompting adversaries to develop 
unconventional methods of warfare. Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, for example, used ``rape, pillage and slaughter'' as a 
military tactic, Cohen said. By expelling hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and killing many others, Milosevic 
created a humanitarian crisis as a combat strategy, he said.

	U.S.: No Troops for East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration sees no need to  
commit troops if a U.N. peacekeeping force is agreed to in East 
Timor because Australia and New Zealand already have promised such 
forces and other countries may make similar offers, a senior 
official says. ``America or nothing doesn't apply,'' the official 
said yesterday, adding that the administration could be helpful in 
other ways if U.N. peacekeepers are sent to the troubled province. 
In a bid to overturn last week's referendum, in which almost 80 
percent of East Timorese supported independence, rampaging armed 
militias with ties to the Indonesian military have created a 
humanitarian disaster in the province. 

</P>
<P>
	Analysts Brace for E. Timor Outcome  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- As East Timor sinks further into chaos,  
economists and analysts in this regional business hub say that 
Indonesia's response to the crisis could determine the country's 
economic future. ``How Indonesia handles the case will speak 
volumes to investors about the Indonesian government and armed 
forces,'' said Friedrich Wu, chief economist at Development Bank of 
Singapore, Southeast Asia's largest bank. Indonesia, the world's 
fourth-most populous country, is under severe international 
criticism for its conduct in East Timor, whose overwhelming vote 
for independence has been met by terror by pro-Jakarta militia.

	Israel Frees Palestinian Prisoners  
</P>
<P>
	BEITUNIYA, West Bank (AP) -- The first concrete sign that the  
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is coming to an 
end walked out of prison today, as Israel released Palestinians 
held as security prisoners. By midmorning, a total of 200 prisoners 
held for anti-Israeli acts, such as killing suspected Palestinian 
collaborators and wounding Israelis, were to be released, including 
28 citizens of Arab countries. All signed a pledge not to revert to 
violence.

	Bush Wavers on Immigration Payments  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Responding to Republican rivals, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush retracted a statement opposing federal 
reimbursements to states for costs they incur from illegal 
immigration. ``That's not a federal role, in my judgment,'' Bush 
told the San Francisco Chronicle last week. Those costs can include 
providing illegal immigrants medical treatment and education and 
incarcerating criminals among them. In 1982 the Supreme Court ruled 
states must educate illegal immigrants and the federal government 
now requires states to also provide ``emergency'' medical care to 
them. Bush's campaign issued a prepared statement yesterday saying 
he had ``misunderstood'' the question.

	Death Toll in Greece Quake at 72  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Late-night rescues buoyed the spirits of  
emergency teams working round the clock, but there were few signs 
of life from dozens believed to still be trapped in crumbled 
buildings as the death toll from Greece's quake rose to at least 
72. Authorities scrambled to set up tents and find shelter in 
hotels for thousands sleeping outdoors in parks and soccer 
stadiums, while inspectors today were to expand checks on homes 
damaged by the capital's strongest quake in nearly a century. 

</P>
<P>
	14 Dead in Moscow Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Authorities searched for survivors and clues today  
after a huge explosion tore apart a nine-story Moscow apartment 
building, killing at least 14 people and leaving dozens more feared 
dead in the rubble. Rescue workers said at least 60 people were 
hospitalized with serious injuries after being pulled from the 
wreckage. Up to 100 people could be trapped in the debris, they 
said. The Federal Security Service, the country's main intelligence 
agency, launched an investigation into the blast. Some officials 
said it appeared to have been a natural gas explosion, but others 
said it was too early to rule out a terrorist attack. Police 
checked the wreckage for possible clues.

	Tokyo Stocks End Up  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In Tokyo today, the Nikkei rose 36.18 points to  
close at 17,677.56. In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 2.21 points to close at 11,036.34.

	McEnroe Is Captain of Davis Team  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By winning seven Grand Slam championships, 77  
career singles titles and 77 career doubles crowns, John McEnroe 
had his share of tennis thrills -- right up there, though, was his 
appointment yesterday as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team. ``It 
is one of the proudest moments of my life,'' McEnroe said after 
Judy Levering, president of the United States Tennis Association, 
named him to the post. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who came into 
the U.S. Open ranked 1-2 in the world, have passed on Davis Cup 
play in the past, but seem enthused about McEnroe's appointment.

<HEADLINE> Seattle: We Won't Trade Galloway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- If Joey Galloway wants to play this  
season, it will be for the Seattle Seahawks or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope he'd walk in the door and say, `OK, I'm ready to  
play,''' coach-general manager Mike Holmgren said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Seahawks got ready for their season opener against  
Detroit, on Sunday in the Kingdome, their star receiver remained at 
his home in Columbus, Ohio, presumably waiting for the team to 
blink in the contract stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren sounded as if he was willing to let Galloway sit out  
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to trade him,'' he said. ``I want him here. I  
want him to be a part of this and he knows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, Seattle's leading receiver in each of the last three  
seasons, missed all of the Seahawks' training camp and their four 
exhibition games. The Seahawks placed him on their ``reserve-did 
not report'' list this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway has one year left on a five-year contract and would be  
paid $1.6 million this season. He signed the contract after Seattle 
made him the eighth overall pick in the 1995 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Galloway stayed home this season, he would remain the  
property of the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway has turned down a seven-year contract offer for $35  
million, including a $7 million signing bonus. He is seeking a 
five-year deal worth about $25 million with a $10 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations broke off two weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Other teams are seeking to acquire Galloway in a trade, Holmgren  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been approached in casual conversations by about 15  
teams,'' he said. ``I've told them all the same thing: 'I am not 
trading him. He's here. I want him here.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Metz, Galloway's Phoenix, Ariz.-based agent, would not  
respond Wednesday to Holmgren's latest remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Galloway missing and Michael Pritchard out with a knee  
injury, Sean Dawkins and Charles Jordan will be Seattle's starting 
receivers for the Lions game. Derrick Mayes will be the third 
receiver. All are new this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jon Kitna will be starting his seventh NFL game.  
</P>
<P>
	Dawkins and Jordan signed with the Seahawks as free agents, and  
Mayes was acquired by Seattle in a trade with Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thin there in this first game, certainly,'' Holmgren  
said of his receiving corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Galloway caught 65 passes for 1,047 yards and 10  
touchdowns, while Pritchard made 58 receptions for 742 yards and 
three TDs. Pritchard is expected back for Seattle's second game in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway told KIRO Radio on Tuesday night, ``I would love to be  
there right now playing, but at the same time I can't accept 
playing for something that's way below market value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren also announced that former Pro Bowl offensive tackle  
Howard Ballard, who retired last Sunday after playing 11 seasons in 
the NFL, will remain with the team as an assistant coach this 
season. He will help offensive line coach Tom Lovat.

<HEADLINE> Delta Leads in Airline Bumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines continues to lead the industry in  
the rate of involuntary passenger bumpings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, Delta reported 5,519 bumpings -- nearly  
half the total of 11,908 for all 10 major airlines. The 
Atlanta-based carrier ranked worst in the industry with a rate of 
2.07 involuntary bumpings per 10,000 passengers, according to the 
figures released Wednesday by the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline with the next highest rate of involuntary bumpings  
was Southwest, which reported 2,509 bumpings for a rate of 1.48 per 
10,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Embarrassed by a similar ranking last winter, Delta vowed  
improvement. But a Delta spokesman said computer software deployed 
to fix the overbooking problem wasn't in use soon enough to be 
reflected in the April-June period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting in July, we've seen major progress that will be  
reflected in the next set of numbers,'' spokesman John Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most bumpings are voluntary, with passengers agreeing to take  
later flights in exchange for credits toward future flights. Delta 
reported 45,221 voluntary bumpings in the second quarter. That was 
second to American, which had 64,664 voluntary bumpings, but only 
717 involuntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary bumpings occur when planes are overbooked and some  
passengers are rerouted on later flights.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Won't OK Budget Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top congressional Republicans said Thursday  
they will not engage President Clinton in budget summit talks this 
year because he would insist on higher spending in exchange for the 
GOP's cherished tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not prepared to trade with the president with the  
American people's money, a spending buck for me, a tax reduction 
for you,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	While not ruling out that Republicans themselves will break  
budget limits to help push the coming fiscal year's spending bills 
through Congress, Armey renewed the GOP's pledge to use Social 
Security surpluses solely to reduce the $5.6 trillion national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to let one dime of Social Security money be  
spent'' to expand other federal programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to give a little and take a little,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a Senate GOP leader. ``But we're going 
to have to protect Social Security, that's a must.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks partly reflect Republicans' distaste for high-level  
budget bargaining with Clinton and distrust of him. Many 
Republicans think Clinton has outfoxed them in past talks, and 
there is also resentment about decisions being made by a handful of 
GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments also underline the GOP's goal of casting this  
autumn's budget battle as their desire to protect Social Security 
vs. Clinton's plans for higher spending. Republicans say they will 
win the public relations war if voters view the budget fight that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Republicans rallied behind Social Security, their  
leaders were all but abandoning hope of achieving a major tax cut 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Wednesday,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Thursday that Clinton's 
virtually certain veto of the GOP's $792 billion, 10-year tax cut 
will probably end this year's legislative battling over taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our one chance to do that,'' Hastert told reporters.  
He cited the difficulty of pushing a second tax package through 
Congress during this session's dwindling weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey and others insisted that their August strategy of staging  
hundreds of town meetings talking up tax cuts had worked. 
</P>
<P>
	But few opinion polls reflect a deep public interest in tax  
reductions. And about 10 conservative Democrats from districts 
where the popularity of tax cuts would be likeliest to appear said 
their voters prefer using surpluses for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Clinton said Thursday he is willing to be flexible  
in reaching a tax cut deal this fall, but said the ball is fully in 
the GOP court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether there is (a compromise) bill, of course, is up to  
them. They can control what bills come up,'' Clinton said at the 
White House. ``But if they're saying, well, it's our way or no way, 
then that is evidence that this has been pretty much about politics 
all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one believes the budget showdown will cause a shutdown of  
federal agencies, as occurred in 1995 and 1996. But short of using 
Social Security surpluses, it is unclear where GOP leaders will 
find enough money to push all 13 fiscal 2000 spending bills through 
Congress, let alone get Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bills finance agency budgets. So far lawmakers have  
sent just two of the measures to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 2000 begins on Oct. 1, just three weeks away. By then,  
GOP leaders plan to send Clinton a stopgap bill temporarily 
financing agencies while the two sides work through their spending 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton wants more than $20 billion in spending beyond  
initial GOP plans. Even many Republicans want billions more for 
favorite programs, such as the $7 billion emergency package for 
farmers passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to bridge some of the gap with the $14 billion  
non-Social Security surplus expected for next year. They had 
planned to use $5 billion of it for the tax bill, but Clinton's 
veto will let that portion be used for spending instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending any of that money will bust spending limits enacted in  
the 1997 budget-balancing law. GOP leaders have long conceded that 
those funds will be used, but will need billions more. Republican 
lawmakers and aides are scouring the budget for spending they can 
cut or delay. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress worked through spending bills:  
</P>
<P>
	--The House by 235-187 approved a $92 billion measure financing  
housing, veterans and environmental programs. The White House has 
promised to veto it because of insufficient spending. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Democrats blocked a GOP effort to cut mass transit aid  
to New York and California as part of a $49 billion transportation 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--Facing Democratic opposition, Senate Republicans set aside an  
effort to prevent the Clinton administration from raising royalties 
paid by oil companies drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers agreed to a compromise $28 billion  
measure financing the Treasury Department and smaller agencies. It 
would double the next president's salary to $400,000 and give 
members of Congress a $4,600 pay boost next January, raising their 
annual salaries to $141,300. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House passed, 208-206, a compromise bill providing $429  
million for the District of Columbia's municipal budget. The White 
House has threatened a veto because the bill prohibits the city 
from using other revenues to provide hypodermic needles to illegal 
drug users.

<HEADLINE> Final Microsoft Legal Filings Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Microsoft Corp. are  
expected to rebut each other's courtroom arguments in the final 
exchange of legal filings before the judge's initial ruling in a 
sweeping antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were under orders from U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson to present by Friday their final written versions 
of the facts of the case. The filings could approach 1,000 pages 
for each side. 
</P>
<P>
	The filings also give them opportunity to rebut each other's  
arguments in the last batch of court papers submitted to the judge 
a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers will appear in court for a single day's closing  
arguments in less than two weeks, before the first phase of the 
judge's two-part verdict. That ruling could come as early as late 
October, although the case is almost certain to wind through 
appeals courts for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is clearly interested in moving ahead. He has denied  
requests to delay the trial and limited the number of witnesses to 
testify. Last month at a law panel, he explained he was trying ``to 
avoid the Vietnam morasses'' that other antitrust cases, such as 
the breakup of AT&AMP;T, became. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to argue in its filing Friday that  
developments in the nation's high-tech industry undermine the 
government's antitrust claims. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft attorney said the company will point to the  
remarkable financial success of Red Hat Inc., a leading vendor of 
the upstart Linux software operating system. Red Hat stock has 
soared from $14 on its first day trading last month to close 
Thursday at $123.25. 
</P>
<P>
	An economist who testified for the Justice Department, Franklin  
Fisher, had dismissed as ``a joke, of course'' the potential threat 
that Linux posed to the market dominance of Microsoft's Windows 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the company will tell the judge it believes Linux to be ``real 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the essence of competition in this business,'' the lawyer  
said. ``You have to see the trend and react to it before it has 
market share or you'll be relegated to the history pages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has argued that Linux has been successful  
challenging Microsoft in the sale of high-end business ``server'' 
computers, not consumer machines. 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was quoted in earlier evidence  
in the trial as saying at a technology conference this spring that 
Linux's impact ``will be fairly limited'' and that he's never had a 
customer mention Linux to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also was expected to cite an announcement just days  
ago by rival Sun Microsystems Inc. that it has begun distributing 
free on the Internet a package of business applications meant to 
compete with Microsoft's Office software. 
</P>
<P>
	But asking Jackson to take ``judicial notice'' of the industry  
changes is an unusual legal ploy since the evidentiary record in 
the trial is officially closed. The judge can recognize these 
events but can't consider them as evidence because the government 
wasn't given the opportunity to challenge Microsoft's 
interpretation of their meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	One antitrust scholar said the recent business challenges to  
Microsoft were in part fueled by pressure exerted by the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government created an environment by which bolder moves by  
companies are going to occur,'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust 
expert at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kovacic described that effect as a double-edged sword for  
the government, since it appears to decrease the need for 
government action to restore competition in the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tantalizing dilemma,'' he said. ``It reduces some of  
the urgency to intervene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began last October, the sides have met formally  
three times outside the courtroom, including once in early June. 
Future talks are anticipated later this year, but outside experts 
consider a settlement unlikely.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 500 Sick in E.coli Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Nearly 500 people have been sickened and one  
child died in the largest E. coli outbreak in state history -- and 
possibly one of the worst nationally -- health officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak of the deadly bacteria at the Washington County  
Fair, about 35 miles north of Albany, was likely caused by the 
contamination of the fair's water. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said the water supply may have been tainted  
when rainwater washed over cow feces from a nearby farm and ran 
into an underground aquifer tapped by the fair's wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, officials were worried that the contamination may  
have spread beyond the Greenwich fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A fair worker who sold sausages might have taken three gallons  
of tainted water with her to use for coffee, lemonade and frozen 
treats at the Rensselaer County Fair in Schaghticoke, state Health 
Commissioner Antonia Novello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Novello said no cases of E. coli had been connected to the  
Rensselaer fair, one county to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, 497 people had been treated at hospitals for E.  
coli symptoms, Novello said. Eighty-five case have been confirmed 
as E. coli poisoning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A child, 3-year old Rachel Aldrich of Clifton Park, succumbed to  
the Greenwich outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed that one of the wells at the Washington County Fair  
was infected with E. Coli bacteria. Health officials also think 
that a deadly strain of E. Coli, 0157:H7, also came from that well, 
but they have yet to find any traces of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The well is near a cattle barn and the ground around it had been  
dug up for the installation of two new wells. Heavy rains in late 
August could have driven E. coli contaminated cattle manure into 
the well, Novello said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that health officials will never find the deadly  
strain since the first tests for E. coli were done Sept. 3, four 
days after the fair ended, said Donald Dixon Despommier, a 
microbiology professor at Columbia University's School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like closing the barn door after the horses are already  
gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on the well in June showed no contamination, health  
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame Honoring Globetrotters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- The Harlem Globetrotters will be  
honored by the Basketball Hall of Fame for their contributions to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globetrotters are the first team to receive the John Bunn  
Award, named after the Hall of Fame's first executive director. The 
award, for outstanding contributions to the game, will be presented 
Sept. 30 as part of this year's enshrinement festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also being honored at the awards dinner are NBC broadcaster Bob  
Costas and the late Smith Barrier, who was executive sports editor 
of the News &AMP; Record of Greensboro, N.C., for more than 30 years. 
Both will receive the Curt Gowdy Award for their coverage of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globetrotters, founded by Abe Saperstein and Inman Jackson,  
started barnstorming as the ``Savoy Big Five'' in 1926. Saperstein 
changed the name in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
	Then one night in 1939, with the Globetrotters leading by the  
score of 112-5, the players began clowning around to keep the crowd 
occupied. And more than 20,000 games later they are still amusing 
crowds with the ``pivot weave'' dreamed up by Jackson, the team's 
first ``Clown Prince.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s, the team was featured in a television cartoon  
series and in 1982 the Globetrotters became the only sports team to 
receive a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.

	LONDON (AP) -- Olympic officials reached agreement Thursday on  
the framework for a world anti-drug agency to be launched by the 
end of the year. But the location and head of the organization have 
yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee said a special working group  
achieved consensus on the possible structure for the agency, which 
is intended to spearhead a global campaign against banned 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said documents will be finalized shortly and submitted  
to political and sports officials in time for the agency to be in 
place by Jan. 1 and fully operational before next year's Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the format, the statutes and possible terms of  
reference,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard, the project 
coordinator, said. ``I am reasonably confident the agency will be 
set up before Jan. 1. We are on schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said a foundation would be created under Swiss law in  
Lausanne, home of the IOC. The board of the foundation, including 
Olympic officials and some governmental bodies, will decide where 
the agency will be based and who will run it. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said several cities have expressed interest in serving  
as headquarters for the agency, including Lausanne; Vienna, 
Austria; Madrid, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal, and Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the board would invite nominations for a chief  
executive to run the agency's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of an international anti-doping agency was approved in  
February at a world drug summit in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting produced heated debate over the status and location  
of the agency. Critics said the agency should be completely 
independent of the IOC and should not be based in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has insisted that it should play a leading role in the  
project, pointing out that it is putting up the initial $25 million 
to set up the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the agency, as promised, would be up and running by  
the Sydney Games. But he said the agency was not designed to be 
directly involved in testing during those games. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's main task will be to coordinate year-round  
drug-testing programs around the world, particularly unannounced 
out-of-competition controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will also seek to harmonize anti-doping policies and  
procedures, intensify research and educational programs and publish 
an annual list of banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC allocated $2 million towards efforts to  
develop reliable tests for human growth hormone and EPO, two common 
performance-enhancing drugs which cannot be detected by standard 
urine controls.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-College Coach Raveling Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former college coach George Raveling was  
hospitalized in Thursday after passing out while putting the Nike 
NBA All-Star team through a workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at the Asepeyo clinic at Sant Cugat, just outside  
Barcelona, said Raveling would be kept overnight for observation. 
He was said to be in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, it was feared Raveling had suffered a heart attack,  
but doctors ruled that out and said the illness was more likely due 
to something the coach had eaten. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Nike said Raveling had passed out because of  
stress from a busy schedule in recent months. The company said it 
expected him to be ready to coach the All Stars, which include 
Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen, for a game Friday against FC 
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	Raveling, in his 31 years as coach, took three teams to NCAA  
Tournaments, Washington State, Iowa and Southern Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Olympic team and was voted national coach of the  
year.

<HEADLINE> Rosie O'Donnell Selling Mansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NYACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Now that she's invested $290,000 on  
renovations, talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell is looking to move from 
the mansion known as ``Pretty Penny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her publicist, Jennifer Glaisek, said Thursday that Ms.  
O'Donnell is looking for more privacy and security than the 22-room 
home can provide. The 150-year-old house is on a main road in this 
New York City suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous occupants, actress Helen Hayes and her husband,  
Charles MacArthur, bought the house in 1931. Miss Hayes said its 
name came from remark of a friend: ``This place must have cost a 
pretty penny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell bought the house for $770,000 in 1996. The new listing  
price? $2.75 million.

	Bush To Post Contributions Online  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Texas Gov. George W. Bush began posting  
daily lists of his campaign contributors on the Internet, the first 
group of names included several House members who reached into 
their campaign bank accounts to make contributions to the 
Republican presidential front-runner. Bush received almost $20,000 
from House members -- including $1,000 apiece from House GOP 
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts and Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy 
Blunt. Some four dozen state and local officials also contributed 
to Bush from their campaign accounts. Bush is the first 
presidential candidate to release his donors in advance of the 
federally required reporting periods, and they can be found at 
Bush's campaign Web site: www.georgewbush.com

	Black Church Group Picks New Leader  
</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A minister who promised to reform the  
leadership of the nation's largest black church group was elected 
president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. tonight. 
The Rev. William Shaw beat 10 other candidates to succeed the Rev. 
Henry J. Lyons, the St. Petersburg minister now imprisoned for 
using the powerful position to bilk and steal more than $4 million 
from companies and organizations. In the wake of that scandal, Shaw 
and other candidates called for limits on the president's power. 
Shaw has said the convention's problems stem from ``a lack of 
accountability and a failure to center the convention around 
Christ.''

	U.N. Workers Fired on in E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- U.N. workers evacuated their embattled  
compound in East Timor Friday, leaving a skeleton crew to continue 
working to bring the territory to full nationhood. 
Anti-independence militiaman fired on the convoy as it left Dili. 
There was no immediate word of any injuries among the U.N. 
staffers, who had been trapped in the complex by the rampaging 
militias for several days. Some evacuaees arrived in Darwin, 
Australia, later Friday. On Thursday, the Roman Catholic Church 
accused pro-Indonesian militiamen of targeting nuns and priests in 
predominantly Catholic East Timor, where voters have overwhelmingly 
chosen independence from mostly Muslim Indonesia.

	Venezuela's Political Standoff Ends  
</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A standoff between Congress and the  
powerful Constitutional Assembly was resolved late tonight, hours 
after thousands of street demonstrators charged that Venezuela's 
democracy is in jeopardy. In an accord mediated by the Catholic 
Church, the assembly agreed to reverse an order that virtually shut 
down Congress last month. Congress will be allowed to resume its 
normal activities including its reconvening as a full body Oct. 2. 
The agreement ``is a demonstration of tolerance in a democratic 
country that aspires to be able to carry out a process of change 
while respecting the law,'' said opposition Congressman Cesar Perez 
Vivas.

	53 PBS Stations Did List-Swapping  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's  
inspector general has found that 53 public television and radio 
stations -- double an earlier estimate -- engaged in list-swapping 
with political organizations. The report, completed late Thursday, 
found that 29 public television and 24 public radio stations 
exchanged and/or rented the names of their members or contributors 
to political organizations, parties or candidates. Although sharing 
membership lists is a routine business among countless companies 
and organizations, the CPB is a nonprofit entity considered a 
charity for tax purposes.

	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The release of 199 Palestinian  
security prisoners Thursday got the new Israeli-Palestinian peace 
deal off to a smooth start. It paves the way for the next step, an 
Israeli transfer of 7 percent of the West Bank, or 160 square 
miles, to Palestinian civilian rule by the weekend. The handover is 
to be completed before Monday's festive launch of talks on a 
historic final peace accord that aims to end decades of hostility

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ai Sugiyama of Japan and Mahesh Bhupathi of  
India teamed Thursday to win the mixed doubles title at the U.S. 
Open, defeating Americans Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Grand Slam tournament title for Sugiyama and  
the second major mixed doubles championship for Bhupathi, who 
teamed with Rika Hiraki to capture the French Open in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhupathi also has won two Grand Slam tournament men's doubles  
titles this year with Leander Paes: the French Open and Wimbledon.

	 *TOP-SEED GONE:* Virginia Razzano of France, the No. 1 seeded  
player in the U.S. Open junior girls singles, was defeated Thursday 
by Laura Granville of Chicago, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved Granville, seeded 11th in the 64-player draw,  
into the quarterfinals.

</P>
<P>
	 *OH, SAY CAN YOU HEAR:* The planes screaming over Louis  
Armstrong Stadium were enough to keep Yevgeny Kafelnikov muttering 
throughout his quarterfinal match with Richard Krajicek, but the 
Russian put his foot down when the national anthem wafted in. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone was practicing her rendition of ``The Star-Spangled  
Banner'' on the adjacent Grandstand court, and in mid-song 
Kafelnikov took off his white cap and placed it over his heart 
while rolling his eyes. When the crowd stopped laughing and 
Krajicek tried to serve at deuce, Kafelnikov waved him off as the 
singing continued. 
</P>
<P>
	When the anthem was done, the crowd applauded and a fan cried  
out, ``Play ball!,'' and the match resumed. Krajicek won the next 
two points to hold serve.

<P>
	In his 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5) loss to Yevgeny  
Kafelnikov on Wednesday night, Krajicek was credited with 48 aces, 
based on the umpire's score card. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Krajicek was credited with 49 aces.  
</P>
<P>
	On the first point of the 12th game in the fifth set, Krajicek  
served an ace. The serve was called out by the line judge, but 
overruled by the chair umpire. The score was noted as 15-0, but the 
ace was not recorded into the electronic score card. 
</P>
<P>
	A videotape of the match was reviewed and all the aces counted.

<TEXT>
<P>
	POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- Jockey J.C. Gonzalez of Mexico was killed  
Thursday in a spill in the fifth race on opening day of the Los 
Angeles County Fair meeting at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, the Fairplex Park riding champion with 28 victories  
last year, died of head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 23, was leading the 1 1-16-mile race when his horse,  
Wolfhunt, broke down on the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Accommodator, ridden by Danny Sorenson, tripped while passing  
Wolfhunt, throwing Sorenson to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Both jockeys were taken to the Fairplex first-aid station, where  
Dr. Neal Archer pronounced Gonzalez dead. Sorenson was examined and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the 12-race program was canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just saddened at Fairplex. He was a very special jockey  
to us because he won the jockey title last year in a runaway,'' 
said George Bradvica, the equine manager at Fairplex Park. ``He was 
a young kid, he was up and coming, and he was here to defend his 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very upset. This is our 61st racing season. We've  
never had a fatality before, and it just hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, a resident of nearby Arcadia, won his first major  
riding title with 24 victories in the 1998 Hollywood Park fall 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez had 181 career victories in 1,478 races, with 172  
seconds and 161 thirds and earnings of $4,155,00. 
</P>
<P>
	In 237 starts this year, Gonzalez's mounts won 23 races and  
$365,310. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfhunt, the 5-2 second-favorite in a field of eight, broke  
both forelegs and was destroyed. Accommodator reportedly was in 
good condition, according to a track spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed at Midday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with the biggest names  
in technology outperforming the rest of the market. A sinking 
dollar held most stocks lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 0.95 at 11,037.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 2.02 at 1,342.13, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 15.22 at 2,823.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet and technology companies were the strongest performers  
in a relatively quiet, flat market. IBM, up 4 1/16 to 134 13/16, 
helped the Dow stay in positive territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo rose 5 15/16 to 159 3/8 after Lehman Brothers raised its  
rating on the stock to ``outperform'' from ``neutral.'' And online 
auctioneer eBay rose 5 1/16 to 139 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat, which sells Linux software, rose 6 1/2 to 123 1/4. The  
company's shares have been on a tear as it attracts more coverage 
from Wall Street brokerages, and got a further boost this week from 
Gateway Inc.'s decision to join the Linux operating system reseller 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big-cap technology stocks are performing well, and  
everything else is middling at best,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, 
chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader market was held to slim gains by the dollar's  
continuing decline against the Japanese yen. After the Japanese 
government released a stronger-than-expected report on the nation's 
economic growth, the dollar fell to 108.84 yen today from 111.22 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report and the rising value of the yen helped push  
Japan's Nikkei stock average 0.2 percent higher. Weakness in the 
dollar has been a persistent undercurrent in the U.S. stock market 
in recent weeks, as improving economies in Asia and Europe attract 
investors who previously sought out U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington today, the Labor Department reported the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell 
unexpectedly last week to 286,000. Any level below 300,000 is 
considered a sign of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wage pressures that could result from a tight labor market are  
among the concerns of the Federal Reserve as it watches out for 
inflation. The Fed has already raised interest rates twice this 
year, hoping to keep the economy from growing too quickly, and 
investors fear that a third rate increase will come later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably stay in a holding pattern until more data  
comes out,'' Battipaglia said. ``Each bit of economic data is 
important as people try to figure out what the Fed is going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products dropped 3 7/16 to 38 7/8 amid reports that  
the company is facing a federal investigation involving the 
government's 1996 approval of the drug Redux. American Home 
Products has already seen its share price battered as the company 
faces thousands of civil lawsuits over its diet drugs, which have 
been linked to heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues and decliners were nearly even on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 341.98 million shares, behind 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.18 to 437.08.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mostly higher  
Thursday on unexpectedly strong news about Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, news that the gross domestic product grew in the  
second quarter boosted share prices, but pushed the U.S. dollar 
lower against the yen. GDP is the measure of all goods and services 
produced in a country. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 36.18 points,  
or 0.21 percent, to 17,677.56. On Wednesday, the average had fallen 
0.37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Confounding market expectations, the Japanese Economic Planning  
Agency announced Thursday that the economy grew 0.2 percent in the 
April-June quarter, while the overall economy was growing at an 
annual rate of 0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Market gains, however, were limited by the yen's continued rise  
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 108.84 yen in late trading, down 2.38 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
111.08 yen overnight. It ranged between 108.73 yen and 111.16 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts Japan's exporters because it pushes up the  
prices of their goods overseas, making the companies less 
competitive.

would finally be joining the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Addresses Baptist Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes told  
one of the nation's largest black denominations Thursday that he 
wants to offer more freedom to parents on where they send their 
children to school and to workers on how they invest retirement 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Before some 7,000 members gathered for the annual meeting of the  
National Baptist Convention USA, the magazine publisher said he 
would promote educational freedom through faith-based schools and 
school choice grants and would reform Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know something about creating wealth, and let me tell you:  
One way we could help every American family create personal wealth 
is to give younger workers the freedom to have the majority of 
their Social Security taxes directly deposited into their own 
personal individual retirement accounts,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The money could be put in a variety of investment possibilities  
-- mutual funds, government bonds or bank CDs. And the holder would 
have to be a certain age to get the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan could lift millions of Americans out of poverty, he  
said. A person earning $36,000 a year could retire with a nest egg 
of more than $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a person dies, that money would go tax-free to a spouse,  
children or grandchildren -- not back to the government as it does 
under the present Social Security setup. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, 52, also sounded his recurring theme of a flat tax.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the convention delegates were also in Tampa to elect a  
successor to the Rev. Henry J. Lyons. Lyons resigned in disgrace in 
March and is serving state and federal prison sentences for 
financial misdealings growing out of convention business. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was the only presidential candidate to address the  
influential group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that you've been through a storm,'' Forbes said. ``But  
you have kept the faith and it has not gone unnoticed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference after Forbes' speech, convention board  
member the Rev. Charles Noble said while the group does not endorse 
any candidate, many black Baptists would stand behind Forbes in his 
quest for the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the leaders across the country ... have a great  
concern about many of the issues that Forbes (raised),'' Noble 
said, citing civil rights, education, and individual and family 
economics. ``We feel very comfortable with his platform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has taken the initiative to reach out and make the party  
inclusive,'' the minister from Shiloh Baptist Church in Newark, 
Ohio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he would send federal education money back to states  
and local communities to let parents choose where and how to school 
their children -- whether it be public, private, charter, or home 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long ago, certain politicians stood in the schoolhouse  
door to keep children out of good schools,'' Forbes said. ``Today, 
we find big government politicians standing in the schoolhouse door 
to keep children trapped in dangerous, failing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``No mother,'' he said, ``should be forced to send her child to  
a lousy school.''

<HEADLINE> CEOs Discuss 'Digital Divide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Executives in the telecommunications industry,  
from companies both big and small, spelled out for regulators and 
lawmakers Thursday the obstacles they face in providing high-speed 
Internet services to rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel convened by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South  
Dakota and moderated by the head of the Federal Communications 
Commission highlighted the so-called ``digital divide'' between 
those who have access to high-speed Internet services and those who 
live in underserved areas where such capabilities may not be 
readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do this right, we will have a nation of haves and  
have-nots,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle echoed this, saying those without access to high-speed  
Internet services could also be cut off from affordable information 
on education and healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T chief Michael Armstrong said he believes his industry does  
have a responsibility to prevent such a future, trumpeting AT&AMP;T's 
investments in high-speed Internet technology delivered over its 
recently acquired cable lines as a way to reach more consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting our money where our mouth is,'' Armstrong said.  
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard urged the chief executives assembled  
to ``get beyond the rhetoric of blaming the Congress, the FCC or 
each other'' and focus on ways to tackle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry heads raised both regulation and economic  
incentives as hurdles they sometimes face in bringing their 
advanced telecommunications services to areas with low volumes of 
customers and large distances to cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public policy does effect the level of investment that goes  
into developing technology,'' said Ivan Seidenberg, head of Bell 
Atlantic. His company and some other regional Bells like U.S. West 
are seeking to enter the long-distance market -- a move which they 
argue will enable them to make greater investments in rural areas 
at lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Newer telecommunications businesses say they are willing to  
expand their reach to underserved areas, but it cannot be cost 
prohibitive for them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a little help in making sure the cost of entry is  
conducive to making investments,'' said Robert Knowling of COVAD 
Communications. ``I'm poised to go anywhere I can if it makes 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the smaller companies represented at Thursday's event  
described how they have successfully introduced high-speed Internet 
services even to the sparsely populated areas they serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Averaging about a customer per square mile, Valley Telephone  
Cooperative Inc. of Texas began offering Internet access over 
high-speed digital phone lines several years ago to serve just a 
few dozen customers 
</P>
<P>
	``The economics are unique,'' said the company's chief, Charles  
Gowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the wireless industry say using that  
technology to deliver Internet services may provide a way around 
the distance problems posed by offering them over traditional 
landlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economically, wireless is a better way of providing universal  
service,'' said John Stanton of Western Wireless. ``You simply out 
up a tower and are available to provide service.''

<HEADLINE> President of PBS To Leave Oct. 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ervin S. Duggan, president of the Public  
Broadcasting Service for the past 5 1/2 years, announced Thursday he 
was leaving the job on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Duggan said he had fulfilled his objectives for the Alexandria,  
Va.-based association of public television stations during his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``A strategy to create greater financial security and enduring  
value for PBS and its member stations is now in place,'' Duggan 
said in a statement. ``I have relished serving as a public champion 
of PBS's unique mission of education, culture and citizenship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Duggan's leadership, PBS increased revenues 70 percent --  
from $182 million in 1995 to a projected $309 million in 2000. PBS, 
which serves 100 million people weekly, also took on new ventures, 
including PBS Online and the PBS Kids channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who has really strengthened public television  
... both in terms of finances and in terms of extension of 
services. He is going to be very much missed,'' said Colin G. 
Campbell, chairman of the PBS board. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said Duggan courted congressional support when it  
seemed the network's funding was in jeopardy, and maintained 
quality programming in an era of increased competition from cable 
and other commercial ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Duggan's future, PBS spokesman Tom Epstein said, ``He's  
going to explore what else is out there. He felt he couldn't look 
for something new while he was still full time with PBS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PBS board member John F. Swope will serve as interim chief  
executive when Duggan leaves.

<HEADLINE> Day of Nines Goes By Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dreaded date 9-9-99 arrived Thursday with no  
immediate reports of any major Y2K-like computer trouble, boosting 
the confidence of the end-of-millennium programming experts. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been fears that the string of nines might cause some  
computers to misread the date as an old command to end a program. 
</P>
<P>
	But those concerns appeared to be largely unfounded, as most  
experts predicted after months of review and tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one more confirmation that our analysis and testing  
have been really solid,'' said T.D. Fehr, vice president for 
airplane systems at Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, computers abroad also behaved well, according  
to information from more than a dozen countries gathered by the 
International Y2K Cooperation Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The only possible glitch occurred at a Tasmania technical  
college where Australian officials were looking into reports of 
malfunctioning spreadsheet programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 bug, which can cause some computers to wrongly  
interpret the two-digit year ``00'' as 1900, is still a looming 
issue. Nevertheless, Y2K officials believe that because they were 
on target Thursday, they should be on target with Jan. 1 
predictions, too. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``no one should be foolish enough to take this as a sign  
that we're going to coast through the Y2K changeover with no 
problems,'' warned Don Meyer, spokesman for the Senate's Y2K 
advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Several industries took advantage of the changeover to rehearse  
their New Year's Day operations and test backup systems. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15,000 employees from at least 400 electric utilities --  
from senior executives to janitors -- took part in a nationwide 
drill monitored by U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson from the 
Bonneville Power Administration in Vancouver, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was designed to simulate electric outages in different  
parts of the country, test communications under those circumstances 
and determine how utilities and agencies would respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The results came up with another pair of ``9s'' -- as in 99  
percent ready for the millennium, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's still that 1 percent,'' Richardson said. ``And  
that 1 percent covers a lot of consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 9 was one of several dates that could cause computer  
trouble. The next one comes on Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year 
for the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firms Fined $137M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Japanese companies are the latest to  
face criminal fines for plotting to raise and fix the prices of 
vitamins used in nearly every American home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department announced Thursday that the companies had  
agreed to plead guilty and pay $137 million in fines for taking 
part in a worldwide conspiracy to control the prices of vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	``This conspiracy artificially inflated the cost to virtually  
every American of such everyday necessities as milk, bread, orange 
juice and cereal, which were fortified with vitamins produced by 
these companies,'' said Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general 
in charge of antitrust activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies fined were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Takeda Chemical Industries of Osaka, $72 million for conspiring  
to fix the price and allocate the sales of vitamins B2 and C. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eisai Co. of Tokyo, $40 million for conspiring to fix the price  
and allocate sales of vitamin E. 
</P>
<P>
	--Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo, $25 million for fixing the  
price and allocating the sales of vitamin B5. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Justice department announced a $500 million fine to  
be paid by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., a Swiss pharmaceutical 
company, in the vitamin price-fixing investigation. That is the 
largest federal criminal fine ever imposed in any type of case. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the German firm, BASF AG, agreed to pay a $225  
million fine for its role in the conspiracy to increase vitamin 
prices in the United States and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	And in March, Swiss vitamin manufacturer Lonza AG and five U.S.  
executives agreed to plead guilty to participating in the global 
vitamin plot. Lonza agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the companies also are defendants in a civil suit  
brought by the buyers of bulk vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the department said, the cartel boosted the price of  
more than $5 billion in products sold in the United States between 
January 1990 and this February. 
</P>
<P>
	Involved were vitamins A, B2, B5, C, E and beta carotene, the  
ones most often taken as pills or added to enrich foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the case was broken open when another  
conspirator, Rhone-Poulenc, SA, a French pharmaceutical company, 
began cooperating with investigators. Rhone-Poulenc was accepted 
into the antitrust division's leniency program, which protects 
companies from criminal prosecution if they voluntarily report 
their involvement in a crime before prosecutors learn of their 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also announced that the Japanese firm Takeda has  
agreed to cooperate with its investigators looking into the food 
flavor enhancers industry.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Timber Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is weighing in on a controversy  
that has blocked already curtailed timber cutting on federal land 
in another dispute over protection of endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of timber sales by the U.S. Forest Service were put on  
hold earlier this year in the South and Northwest when federal 
judges found the government failed to adequately assess the 
potential harm to rare plants and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to vote today on an attempt to get  
around the court ruling by declaring that federal agencies -- and 
not the courts -- have the ``sole discretion'' on what surveys 
should be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., wants the provision deleted from a $14  
billion Interior Department spending bill that includes money for 
federal timber sales as well as other natural resource and energy 
programs. A vote on Robb's amendment was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House turned back another effort to kill NASA's  
space station as Congress, returning from its summer recess, jumped 
into the first of a string of spending measures. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 298-121 vote, the House defeated an attempt by Reps. Tim  
Roemer, D-Ind., and Mark Sanford, R-S.C., to eliminate $2.4 billion 
for the space station, one of NASA's high profile programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision is part of a $92 billion measure financing  
veterans, housing, science and environmental programs for fiscal 
2000, which begins next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, sponsors of the Interior bill had hoped to finish  
the measure this week, but a dispute over oil royalty payments and 
a threat of a filibuster could push it into next week.

	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, wants to block the Clinton  
administration from boosting royalties paid by oil companies 
drilling on public lands, arguing the proposed rule change amounts 
to an additional tax on an industry already reeling from low oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison's amendment would prevent royalty payment changes for  
at least another year. But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on 
Wednesday threatened to filibuster the massive spending bill if 
Hutchison's amendment were not withdrawn. She argues that under 
current royalty rules, oil companies are shortchanging the 
government by as much as $66 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The logging controversy stems from two federal court decisions --  
one in Georgia and another in Washington state -- in which judges 
determined that the U.S. Forest Service wasn't adequately surveying 
forests for endangered species prior to issuing logging permits. 
</P>
<P>
	First a judge blocked timber sales in the Chattahoochee National  
Forest in the South. Then, another judge suspended timber sales in 
Oregon and Washington under the compromise Northwest Forest Plan 
forged in 1994 as a way to allow limited cutting and still protect 
the endangered spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington and Larry Craig of  
Idaho crafted language in the Interior bill aimed at overcoming the 
new court restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig maintained the suspension of already curtailed timber  
sales amounted to a broken promise to loggers, who under the 1994 
agreement were assured some timber harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has estimated that about 550 million board feet of  
timber will not be cut in the Northwest because of the court 
requirement for more detailed forest surveys for sensitive species. 
Logging on 8,000 acres of federal forest in the South also has been 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., in debate on the Senate bill  
Wednesday, called the decision on the new survey requirements a 
``fraud'' aimed at reneging on promises made to loggers and a blow 
to logging communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about a survey vs. families, about snails and slugs  
vs. streets and schools,'' Smith said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Ministers from the Americas, Asia  
and Europe criticized Indonesia today for failing to stop the 
terror in East Timor but stopped short of endorsing a peacekeeping 
mission to the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia indicated it could cope with the East Timor crisis on  
its own and did not want any uninvited interference from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Some countries have urged the United Nations to send troops to  
stop a deadly rampage that pro-Indonesian militias launched after 
the territory voted for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakarta declared martial law in East Timor on Tuesday, but the  
situation has not improved, government ministers said in an 
emergency session. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 
annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Wednesday canceled his trip  
to the APEC summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The only top-level Indonesian official in Auckland for the APEC  
meetings, Economic Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita, refused to 
attend the East Timor session. A lower-level Indonesian official 
attended but only listened, a senior U.S. administration official 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginandjar told The Associated Press that Indonesia was working  
to restore order and outside help should only be considered if 
Jakarta found a reason to request it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we need assistance, we will ask for it, but I don't think  
we like to be pushed,'' Ginandjar said. The minister expressed 
concerns that some Western leaders had called for Jakarta to 
restore order quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The term `quickly' is ambiguous, because, `How quick?'''  
Ginandjar said. ``The factions in East Timor have been fighting for 
a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Ginandjar said Indonesia did not want to be pushed, New  
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said the foreign ministers are 
putting ``as much pressure as we can on the Indonesian 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British officials agreed they would rather see the  
Indonesians restore peace on their own, but they're holding out the 
possibility of an international response. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's emergency meeting did little to move beyond earlier  
warnings to Jakarta, but officials said the consensus reached by 
most of the world's powerful and wealthy nations should give 
Indonesia a clear message that the crisis can't drag on 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Washington ruled out the use of U.S. troops in any  
international peacekeeping force and said any soldiers can't be 
sent in without Indonesia's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in  
1975 but the occupation was never accepted by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook came to the East Timor  
talks in Auckland to represent Britain and the European Union, even 
though Britain is not a member of APEC. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Britain was dispatching the Glasgow, a guided-missile  
destroyer, to the East Timor area in case it is needed. The British 
government also is considering the possibility of sending in ground 
troops as part of a peacekeeping force, Cook told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior International Monetary Fund official today stepped up  
pressure on Indonesia to rein in violence in East Timor, which he 
said was a necessary condition for the fund to continue with a 
rescue loan program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The events in East Timor are first of all a large human  
tragedy, and the international community including the IMF cannot 
be indifferent to that,'' Hubert Neiss, IMF's Asia Pacific 
director, told CNN on a nightly news program. ``We haven't 
threatened to cut off funding, but we have to work under the right 
conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Flares Found in Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A spent illumination flare found in evidence  
stored after the Branch Davidian tragedy may have been one of two 
such devices fired by FBI agents to stop an intruder from entering 
the sect's compound during the early days of the standoff, The 
Dallas Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the flares were fired as members of the FBI's Hostage  
Rescue Team kept watch over the compound near Waco, FBI spokesman 
John Collingwood told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``From talking to people in our Hostage Rescue Team, at one  
time, when your floodlight illumination was not active, they shot 
two parachute illumination rounds because of concern about people 
trying to sneak into the compound,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Rangers discovered the spent remains of one of the  
devices, a star parachute flare, when they searched a Waco storage 
facility Friday for missing pyrotechnic tear-gas grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	James Francis Jr., chairman of the Texas Public Safety  
Commission, said the discovery was troubling because the government 
had powerful spotlights trained on the Davidian compound during 
most of the 51-day standoff and would not have needed a flare to 
light up the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Collingwood said none of the devices were used by the Hostage  
Rescue Team on April 19, 1993, the day the Branch Davidian compound 
burned, killing David Koresh and about 80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has maintained the Branch Davidians deliberately  
set the fires. An independent review of the standoff has been 
ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	A major focus of the investigation will be whether the FBI fired  
flammable devices into the compound and why it took six years to 
acknowledge the use of military tear-gas canisters.

<HEADLINE> No Movement on L.A. Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than a week before an important deadline  
in the troubled effort to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles, the 
only decision a group of league owners could make was that a 
decision needs to be made soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``No recommendation, no consensus and a lot of different points  
of view,'' commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Thursday after a 
meeting of the league's expansion committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dozen owners at the meeting, some remained determined  
to have the league place a team in the nation's No. 2 television 
market. Others expressed strong sentiment for Houston, where a 
financing plan for a new stadium is in place and awaiting an NFL 
go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that surprised me today was that there were so many  
divergent opinions,'' committee co-chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the 
New England Patriots, said. ``People who've spent a lot of time on 
this would like to see this end and let us get on with our other 
business. But the bottom line is we need to get 24 votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league gave Los Angeles groups a six-month window to come up  
with a suitable site and financing plan for a stadium for the 
league's 32nd franchise. The deadline is Sept. 15, and four Los 
Angeles-area groups are still trying to make a viable case. The 
proposals include renovating the Los Angeles Coliseum or building a 
new stadium in nearby Carson, Hollywood Park or Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with (NFL executive) Roger Goodell, and we are going  
back for a meeting on Monday,'' said Ed Roski, one of the 
businessmen leading the effort to bring a team to the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. ``I got the impression from him that Los Angeles was 
still very much alive and they want to hear our proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said he and the committee co-chairmen will meet in New  
York with representatives of each of the four groups, plus Bob 
McNair, who heads the Houston effort. The commissioner said the 
deadline will remain in place, and the committee likely will 
discuss the matter via conference call between Sept. 15 and Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee would then take a vote at a meeting Oct. 5, on the  
eve of a full ownership meeting in Atlanta. The votes of 
three-fourths of the 31 owners are required to approve a final 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be making a final decision, hopefully, on the sixth of  
October,'' Tagliabue said. ``And that'll be based on the status of 
things as of Sept. 15.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue would not say which city or bid had the upper hand.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has essentially been trying to find its way back to Los  
Angeles since both the Raiders and Rams left town in 1995, but the 
league has not yet found a proposal to its liking. Asked if there 
could be another postponement, beyond the Oct. 6 meeting, Tagliabue 
wouldn't rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL often goes into overtime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter Dies at 53 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, the Hall of Fame pitcher who ushered in  
baseball's era of big bucks for free agents, died today at age 53 
after battling the disease named after another New York Yankees 
great, Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter died at his home in Hertford, N.C., according to George  
Byrum of Swindell Funeral Home. Hunter fell and hit his head on 
concrete steps at his home on Aug. 8. He was unconscious for 
several days, but improved enough to be sent home Saturday, 
according to the Rev. Keith Vaughan, a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was one of baseball's most dominant pitchers during a  
15-year career that brought him five World Series rings with the 
Oakland Athletics and the Yankees. He strung together five straight 
20-victory seasons, pitched a perfect game and won a Cy Young 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first multimillionaire player when he was declared  
a free agent on a technicality after the 1974 season, then became 
the Yankees' workhorse the following two years, completing 51 of 75 
starts and leading them to their first pennant in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the first player who broke it open for other  
players to be paid what they're worth,'' he said in 1987, a few 
hours after he was elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner never doubted Hunter was worth  
every penny he got, calling him the cornerstone of the team's 1970s 
championships. More than simply a crafty pitcher with a range of 
speeds and exquisite control, Hunter gave the fractious Athletics 
and Yankees leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``He exemplified class and dignity and taught us how to win,''  
Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was a player's player, fiercely competitive on the field,  
a prankster who loved to have fun with teammates after the game. He 
grew a mustache and wore his hair long like them in the fashion of 
the late '60s and early '70s, but he retained his farmboy values 
and spun stories with a country drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, Hunter learned he had amyothropic lateral  
sclerosis (ALS), a neurological disease that attacks nerves in the 
spinal cord and brain that control muscle movement, causing 
progressive paralysis and leading to death. There is no cure for 
the condition, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, also had diabetes and required insulin injections three  
times a day since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	A dedicated outdoorsman, Hunter first noticed the neurological  
condition in the winter of 1997-98 when he was out hunting near his 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' Hunter said.  
``It was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was 
something wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept 
getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, he thought it might be a tick bite, but after repeated  
visits to doctors in Norfolk, Va., and the Duke and Johns Hopkins 
medical centers, Hunter got the dreaded diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew the story of Gehrig, the Yankees' Hall of Famer who died  
of ALS at age 37 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' Hunter said, ``I couldn't even talk.''  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put Hunter on a drug regimen to slow the disease but it  
progressed quickly, leaving the once strong-armed pitcher unable to 
function without help. He talked of how Helen, his high school 
sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years, helped him through each 
day, dressing him and cutting his food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while,'' he said, ``we sit there and cry together.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hunter made a brief visit to the Yankees' training base in  
Tampa, Fla., last spring. He was barely able to shake hands with 
old teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right,'' he said at the time. ``It's just my  
hands and arms don't work right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he thought of his three children, Todd, then 28, Kim,  
25, and Paul, 18. He also thought of a 3-year-old grandson, Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see them grow up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Old friends were shocked when they saw him. His arms hung limp  
at his side. His hands seemed soft and puffy, a far cry from the 
powerful hands of the pitcher and farmer he had been. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Athletics found Hunter in Hertford, and owner  
Charles O. Finley, intent on promoting his players to the hilt, 
pinned the nickname ``Catfish'' on him. To friends and family, 
however, he always remained Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came up with the A's in 1965 and punctuated the team's  
move to Oakland in 1968 with a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins. At the time, it was just the seventh perfect game in modern 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1971, Hunter strung together five straight  
20-victory seasons, winning the AL Cy Young Award in 1974. After 
that season, he was declared a free agent by arbitrator Peter Seitz 
because Finley had failed to make payments on an annuity that was 
part of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, with baseball's reserve clause still in place, it  
was unprecedented to have a star of Hunter's magnitude available on 
the open market. That autumn, major league club executives trudged 
into Hertford to recruit Hunter, who was more interested in going 
out to hunt than talking contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hunter agreed to $3.75 million, five-year deal with the  
Yankees that, for tax reasons, was announced on New Year's Eve, 
Dec. 31, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was certainly the wakeup call about how underpaid players  
were,'' said Marvin Miller, the head of the players' association at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a move from one raucous team to another, and Hunter was a  
central figure on both franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be 50 years old,'' he said, thinking back  
on his some of the wild times he spent with the A's and Yankees. 
``I thought I'd die before then because ballplayers when I played 
ball loved to have a good time, go out together. I loved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In today's baseball economics, Hunter's contract was a  
small-change deal. But it made him the highest-paid player in 
baseball history at the time, and set the stage for full-scale free 
agency, which began after the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter finished his career with the Yankees in 1979, winning 224  
games in 15 seasons and pitching in five World Series. He returned 
to his hometown and his farm and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would trade all of that for good health,'' Hunter said as he  
battled ALS. ``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody know 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last May 8, on the 31st anniversary of his perfect game, Hunter  
attended the kickoff event for the Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS 
Foundation in Hertford. Throughout the day, he walked through the 
crowds talking to people and hugging friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times you think you might go the next day, but you're not.  
The main thing is that everyone is here and I appreciate it,'' an 
emotional Hunter said during a ceremony honoring him on the 
baseball field at Perquimans County High School, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with reporters before the ceremony, he said, ``A  
lot of people are good for a long time with it (ALS), a lot of 
people don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is to keep on hoping, keep on trying, keep on  
believing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled at 3 p.m. Sunday in Cedar Wood Cemetery  
in Hertford, behind the field where Hunter played high school 
baseball.

<HEADLINE>  Catfish Hunter Dies at 53 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, the Hall of Fame pitcher who ushered in  
baseball's era of big bucks for free agents, died today at age 53 
after battling the disease named after another New York Yankees 
great, Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter died at his home in Hertford, N.C., according to George  
Byrum of Swindell Funeral Home. Hunter fell and hit his head on 
concrete steps at his home on Aug. 8. He was unconscious for 
several days, but improved enough to be sent home Saturday, 
according to the Rev. Keith Vaughan, a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was one of baseball's most dominant pitchers during a  
15-year career that brought him five World Series rings with the 
Oakland Athletics and the Yankees. He strung together five straight 
20-victory seasons, pitched a perfect game and won a Cy Young 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the first multimillionaire player when he was declared  
a free agent on a technicality after the 1974 season, then became 
the Yankees' workhorse the following two years, completing 51 of 75 
starts and leading them to their first pennant in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was probably the first player who broke it open for other  
players to be paid what they're worth,'' he said in 1987, a few 
hours after he was elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner never doubted Hunter was worth  
every penny he got, calling him the cornerstone of the team's 1970s 
championships. More than simply a crafty pitcher with a range of 
speeds and exquisite control, Hunter gave the fractious Athletics 
and Yankees leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``He exemplified class and dignity and taught us how to win,''  
Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was a player's player, fiercely competitive on the field,  
a prankster who loved to have fun with teammates after the game. He 
grew a mustache and wore his hair long like them in the fashion of 
the late '60s and early '70s, but he retained his farmboy values 
and spun stories with a country drawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, Hunter learned he had amyothropic lateral  
sclerosis (ALS), a neurological disease that attacks nerves in the 
spinal cord and brain that control muscle movement, causing 
progressive paralysis and leading to death. There is no cure for 
the condition, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, also had diabetes and required insulin injections three  
times a day since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	A dedicated outdoorsman, Hunter first noticed the neurological  
condition in the winter of 1997-98 when he was out hunting near his 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't lift my shotgun with my right hand,'' Hunter said.  
``It was a little bit cool that day, and I thought there was 
something wrong with me that would go away. But it just kept 
getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, he thought it might be a tick bite, but after repeated  
visits to doctors in Norfolk, Va., and the Duke and Johns Hopkins 
medical centers, Hunter got the dreaded diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew the story of Gehrig, the Yankees' Hall of Famer who died  
of ALS at age 37 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' Hunter said, ``I couldn't even talk.''  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put Hunter on a drug regimen to slow the disease but it  
progressed quickly, leaving the once strong-armed pitcher unable to 
function without help. He talked of how Helen, his high school 
sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years, helped him through each 
day, dressing him and cutting his food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while,'' he said, ``we sit there and cry together.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hunter made a brief visit to the Yankees' training base in  
Tampa, Fla., last spring. He was barely able to shake hands with 
old teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right,'' he said at the time. ``It's just my  
hands and arms don't work right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he thought of his three children, Todd, then 28, Kim,  
25, and Paul, 18. He also thought of a 3-year-old grandson, Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see them grow up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Old friends were shocked when they saw him. His arms hung limp  
at his side. His hands seemed soft and puffy, a far cry from the 
powerful hands of the pitcher and farmer he had been. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Athletics found Hunter in Hertford, and owner  
Charles O. Finley, intent on promoting his players to the hilt, 
pinned the nickname ``Catfish'' on him. To friends and family, 
however, he always remained Jim. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came up with the A's in 1965 and punctuated the team's  
move to Oakland in 1968 with a perfect game against the Minnesota 
Twins. At the time, it was just the seventh perfect game in modern 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1971, Hunter strung together five straight  
20-victory seasons, winning the AL Cy Young Award in 1974. After 
that season, he was declared a free agent by arbitrator Peter Seitz 
because Finley had failed to make payments on an annuity that was 
part of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, with baseball's reserve clause still in place, it  
was unprecedented to have a star of Hunter's magnitude available on 
the open market. That autumn, major league club executives trudged 
into Hertford to recruit Hunter, who was more interested in going 
out to hunt than talking contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hunter agreed to $3.75 million, five-year deal with the  
Yankees that, for tax reasons, was announced on New Year's Eve, 
Dec. 31, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was certainly the wakeup call about how underpaid players  
were,'' said Marvin Miller, the head of the players' association at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a move from one raucous team to another, and Hunter was a  
central figure on both franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be 50 years old,'' he said, thinking back  
on his some of the wild times he spent with the A's and Yankees. 
``I thought I'd die before then because ballplayers when I played 
ball loved to have a good time, go out together. I loved it.'' 
</P>
<P>

small-change deal. But it made him the highest-paid player in 
baseball history at the time, and set the stage for full-scale free 
agency, which began after the 1976 season. 
</P>

	Hunter finished his career with the Yankees in 1979, winning 224  
games in 15 seasons and pitching in five World Series. He returned 
to his hometown and his farm and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 
1987. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore To Visit Snubbed School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disappointed students will get a consolation  
prize after George W. Bush failed to show up for a scheduled visit 
to their Rhode Island school: Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nimble bit of counter-scheduling, the vice president has  
rearranged a campaign trip Friday to squeeze in an appearance at 
Ella Risk School in Central Falls, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner  
canceled the school visit Wednesday, blaming bad weather that had 
delayed his flight from New Hampshire to Rhode Island. He kept his 
date with contributors at a $1,000-a-plate Providence fund-raiser 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president heard about the issue in Central Falls and,  
since he's going to be in New England (Friday), he wanted to stop 
by the school. He'll be there regardless of weather -- rain or 
shine,'' White House spokesman Chris Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, seeking the Democratic nomination, trails Bush in  
head-to-head national polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said Gore must be worried about the GOP  
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very interesting that the sitting vice president  
is not only copying the governor's theme -- ``prosperity with a 
purpose'' -- but is also copying his schedule,'' Bush spokeswoman 
Mindy Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Bush met with the school's principal and superintendent  
before leaving Rhode Island and promised to visit the school later 
in the campaign. Gov. Lincoln Almond, a Bush backer, visited the 
school Thursday. ``They're getting a lot of attention,'' Tucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With education topping polls of voter concerns, Bush and Gore  
have already outlined plans to improve schools. The vice president 
promises unlimited access to preschool; Bush wants students in poor 
performing schools to be able to spend federal money on other 
options, including private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehane said the campaign was contacted by Sen. Jack Reed,  
D-R.I., who said school officials had reported that students were 
disappointed by Bush's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going to be quite a thing for these youngsters,''  
Central Falls guidance counselor and community development director 
Leo Leclerc said shortly after Bush called off the event.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Found Off Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An explorer searching for ancient shipwrecks  
found a large undersea field seeping natural gas off the coast of 
the Gaza Strip and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by marine geologist Robert Ballard was announced  
Thursday by the National Geographic Society, which sponsored his 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, a natural gas reservoir was found undersea off the  
Israeli city of Ashdod, north of Gaza, estimated to be able to 
produce 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard's discovery indicates the gas field extends south, along  
the full length of the Gaza Strip and the coast of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just one hole,'' Ballard said of the Ashdod well.  
``If you were to exploit this field you would have many rigs ... so 
clearly it's sizable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But politics could complicate development of the field's natural  
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gaza Strip, along the coast of southern Israel adjacent to  
the border with Egypt, is jointly administered by Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said he has not been in touch with either the Israeli or  
Palestinian officials about the find, but is confident both know of 
it because an Israeli observer was on board his research vessel, 
along with Palestinian crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshe Friedman, spokesman for the Israeli Infrastructure  
Ministry, said Thursday that he had not heard of the natural gas 
fields and would not be able to comment without more details. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same research trip, Ballard also located the wrecks of  
two ancient Phoenician ships, the oldest vessels ever discovered in 
the deep sea, dating from about 750 B.C. It was that search that 
led to the gas discovery, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out that the Phoenician ships have a particular  
sonar signature,'' Ballard explained. ``We were using sonar to get 
what we call an acoustic signature and ran around the ships at 
different angles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said they would find a depression in the sea floor and  
something hard within the depression -- the hard object turned out 
to be the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	After the researchers finished their work on the Phoenician  
ships, they steamed along the coast to look for other sunken 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The sonar detected what appeared to be hundreds of ships.  
</P>
<P>
	``We said, 'That can't be true,''' Ballard recalled. ``So we  
sent the Jason vehicle down, which can actually see, and in these 
depressions were deposits caused by seepage coming in contact with 
ocean and rising from deposits was gas. I realized what we had 
found because I'm a geologist,'' Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bubbles expanded in size as they rose toward the surface  
of the sea,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The long narrow depressions were probably associated with cracks  
in the earth that create a way for the gas to escape from 
underground reservoirs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard also reported finding concentrations of tube worms and  
beds of clams surrounding the vents. These were similar to those he 
found surrounding hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Islands in 
the Pacific, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galapagos worms marked the first discovery of living things  
that used chemical energy rather that relying on the sun for 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, president of the Institute for Exploration in Mystic,  
Conn., is a longtime ocean explorer, probably best known for 
locating the wreck of the Titanic in the cold, dark waters of the 
North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the National Geographic Society and his Institute  
for Exploration, Ballard's research off the Israeli coast was 
sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institute and Leon Levy Expeditions.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Hawks Purses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky has made something  
``especially for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern is marketing a new line of  
handbags to help pay off the debts she incurred from President 
Clinton's impeachment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since she started selling them through her Web site last week,  
Ms. Lewinsky has moved several hundred ``Made especially for you by 
Monica'' handbags, which cost between $70 and $130 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky first started making handbags last year, when she  
stayed in, trying to avoid the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went back to something I did in high school, which was  
designing and sewing,'' she said in a phone interview Wednesday 
with The Associated Press. ``It's been nourishing for me 
emotionally to work with colors and different fabrics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dollar from each bag will go toward various charities, and the  
profits will go toward paying off her debts, Ms. Lewinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new business has been a family affair. Ms. Lewinsky's  
stepmother taught her to knit, her mother put her in touch with the 
fashion industry and her brother helped set up the 
www.therealmonicainc.com Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be one of the first steps to where my future goes. I  
want it to be successful,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Pats' QB Bledsoe Ready To Face Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Drew Bledsoe fidgeted on the sideline at  
the Meadowlands, his finger broken and his teammates beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	That was last December when the New England Patriots ended their  
regular season with a 31-10 loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe is fidgeting again, but this time it's because he can't  
wait to return to the Meadowlands. He's healthy now and will start 
in Sunday's season opener against the same opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be on the sidelines in a situation where I felt like maybe  
I could make a difference was very frustrating,'' he said. ``So I'm 
very excited to get back out there and start playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe broke his right index finger Nov. 23 against Miami, but  
still threw the winning pass with 29 seconds left in a 26-23 
victory. Despite the injury, he led the Patriots to two straight 
wins before losing to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Zolak took over the next week in a 24-21 win over San  
Francisco, but flopped against the Jets and then Jacksonville in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Bledsoe's back in control.  
</P>
<P>
	``This time around, we're able to put our best foot forward,''  
Patriots coach Pete Carroll said. ``This could be a very exciting 
time for the Patriots and he'll be the guy leading the charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's added incentive as the Jets are 3-1 against the Patriots  
since Bledsoe's former coach, Bill Parcells, took over in New York, 
a move that turned up the hype on the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's faded to a certain extent,'' Bledsoe said. ``There's  
still that motivation to go try and beat your old coach and beat a 
very good football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1993, Bledsoe was simply feeling his way after being  
taken with the first pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my rookie year in a lot of situations I was just dropping  
back and looking for somebody to get the ball to,'' he said. ``I 
didn't know too much about what was happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he took the Patriots to the playoffs in 1994 and to the  
Super Bowl two years later. They've been in the playoffs in four of 
his six seasons and Bledsoe has emerged as a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things have gotten bad, he's the one that steps up and  
says, `I'm raising my game. You guys can come with me or not but 
I'm going to raise my game anyway,''' wide receiver Shawn Jefferson 
said. ``He wants to win more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so far the big prize -- a Super Bowl championship -- has  
eluded Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite holding most of the Patriots' passing records and three  
NFL marks, he's far from satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to win a championship,'' he said. ``That's what it's  
all about in the end unless you do something outlandish like (Dan) 
Marino where you throw for a bazillion yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a quarterback, you're judged by how many championships did  
you win and I've yet to prove that I'm capable of taking our team 
to a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the years are flying by.  
</P>
<P>
	He can't believe he's in his seventh season, even though he's  
just 27 years old. And his original estimate that he'd play 10 
seasons and then retire may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like I'm just getting started,'' Bledsoe said. ``I'll  
play as long as I'm having fun. I'll play as long as I feel 
effective and I'll play as long as I feel like we have a chance to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, at some point, any one of those three things is no longer  
true, then I'll hang it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that probably would be with the Patriots. He said he'd  
retire rather than go to another team just for an opportunity to 
win an NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows the chances to achieve that are few.  
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the best team I ever have a chance to play on,''  
Bledsoe said. ``So you have to have a sense of urgency going into 
each season and going into each game because you just don't know 
how many opportunities you're going to get.''

taken with the first pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my rookie year in a lot of situations I was just dropping  
back and looking for somebody to get the ball to,'' he said. ``I 
didn't know too much about what was happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he took the Patriots to the playoffs in 1994 and to the  
Super Bowl two years later. They've been in the playoffs in four of 
his six seasons and Bledsoe has emerged as a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things have gotten bad, he's the one that steps up and  
says, `I'm raising my game. You guys can come with me or not but 
I'm going to raise my game anyway,''' wide receiver Shawn Jefferson 
said. ``He wants to win more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so far the big prize -- a Super Bowl championship -- has  
eluded Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite holding most of the Patriots' passing records and three  
NFL marks, he's far from satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to win a championship,'' he said. ``That's what it's  
all about in the end unless you do something outlandish like (Dan) 
Marino where you throw for a bazillion yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a quarterback, you're judged by how many championships did  
you win and I've yet to prove that I'm capable of taking our team 
to a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the years are flying by.  
</P>
<P>
	He can't believe he's in his seventh season, even though he's  
just 27 years old. And his original estimate that he'd play 10 
seasons and then retire may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like I'm just getting started,'' Bledsoe said. ``I'll  
play as long as I'm having fun. I'll play as long as I feel 
effective and I'll play as long as I feel like we have a chance to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, at some point, any one of those three things is no longer  
true, then I'll hang it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that probably would be with the Patriots. He said he'd  
retire rather than go to another team just for an opportunity to 
win an NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows the chances to achieve that are few.  
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the best team I ever have a chance to play on,''  
Bledsoe said. ``So you have to have a sense of urgency going into 
each season and going into each game because you just don't know 
how many opportunities you're going to get.''

<HEADLINE> Insurer Aims for Worker Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD (AP) -- Aetna Inc. is launching a new managed care  
program aimed at bringing workers who are out on disability back to 
work as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	HealthWorks, which will be offered nationwide next year, deploys  
case managers to work with an employee's doctor to ease the 
transition back to work from disability leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we can anticipate health-related absences, we're more  
likely to influence a successful recovery and transition back to 
productivity,'' said Frolly Boyd, head of group insurance for Aetna 
U.S. Healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Kroll, an analyst with SG Cowen Securities, Inc., in New  
York, said the program should be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very positive program for Aetna,'' said Kroll. ``In  
getting people back to work, it's not just the employer who wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national  
organization for health care consumers, said the program sounds 
fine on paper, but should be carefully evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value and the harm will totally depend on how they  
implement it,'' said Pollack. ``If it pressures people to come back 
to a job before their disability really warrants their coming back, 
then it will cause a great disservice to both the company and the 
person with the disability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Aetna maintains that the program is designed to help  
employers improve productivity while reducing steep health care 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we can anticipate health-related absences, we're more  
likely to influence a successful recovery and transition back to 
productivity,'' said Frolly Boyd, head of group insurance for Aetna 
U.S. Healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
	Disability is a major expense for U.S. employers. The 90 million  
Americans who suffer from chronic conditions such as asthma, 
diabetes, heart disease and back pain account for $1 of every $6 
spent on health care, according to a survey by the Agency for 
Health Care Policy and Research. 
</P>
<P>
	And according to Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm, the  
indirect costs of disability such as overtime wages and temporary 
replacements account for 12 percent to 20 percent of a large 
company's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the HealthWorks plan, once an employee becomes disabled,  
an Aetna medical team that includes disability trained nurses and 
rehabilitation specialists coordinate case management. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurses would help teach the worker how to manage his or her  
disability at home. They also would collaborate with the patient's 
doctor and employer on a schedule for rehabilitation and return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began assembling the HealthWorks staff a year ago,  
selecting case managers from its nursing team. Aetna spokeswoman 
Julie Brown said the company chose individuals with the ability to 
effectively negotiate among a number of parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., is the largest U.S. provider of  
health benefits with 21 million members. It also is among the top 
four U.S. providers of disability insurance.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Part of the landing gear on a DC-9  
carrying 46 people collapsed as the plane touched down Thursday at 
the Nashville airport, but the pilot safely steered it to a stop 
with the left wing dragging on the runway. No injuries were 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just as many Christians go to church only on Easter and  
Christmas, many Jews enter synagogues only on the holiest of Jewish 
holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, some become overwhelmed by the prayers of  
repentance. Strangers in a strange land, they're lost before the 
first ``amen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, the Israeli scholar and mystic and author  
of the forthcoming book, ``Simple Words: Thinking About What Really 
Matters in Life,'' has reassuring words for the religiously 
unschooled: Don't try to keep up with the liturgy. Find one 
sentence in the prayer book that has meaning for you and focus on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' says the rabbi, ``is the beginning of a real  
connection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connections are central to the rabbi's work, whether it's his  
three-decade project, a multi-volume translation of the Talmud, 
Judaism's 1,500 year-old compendium of tradition, law and legend; 
or ``The Thirteen Petalled Rose,'' a discourse on the essence of 
Jewish belief. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli scholars have called him a once-in-a-millennium thinker  
who speaks with authority and self-deprecating humor on topics from 
science fiction to Talmudic thought. He is known for his personal 
exploration of Jewish mysticism and his examination of the human 
soul as a spark of divine light. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year that starts Friday at  
sundown, begins a 10-day period of examination and rebirth known as 
the Days of Awe. It ends with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, 
when Jews communally confess their sins so they can renew their 
lives and turn toward God. 
</P>
<P>
	Such renewal, Steinsaltz said, can occur on an ordinary day.  
``It can be done when one is undressing,'' he said in a telephone 
interview from his home in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the High Holy Days the synagogue becomes the stage for a  
more profound encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a meeting place,'' he says. ``As symbolic as it may be,  
in one way or another I'm coming to visit God ... It's a framework 
for thinking about subjects (people) didn't have time to think 
about all year ... `Am I really doing what I should do? What is 
really important for me?' It may begin a whole chain of thought and 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teshuvah, Hebrew for repentance, denotes both a return to God  
and a change of direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an endeavor to break away from the past and reach a  
higher level,'' Steinsaltz writes in ``The Thirteen Petalled 
Rose.'' ``Repentance is the highest expression of man's capacity to 
choose freely. It is a manifestation of the divine in man.'' Still, 
sudden transformation is rare even during the Days of Awe. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It's) generally ... a series of small turnings,'' he writes.  
</P>
<P>
	Turning toward God is the theme of many Rosh Hashanah and Yom  
Kippur prayers, and Steinsaltz says it can be a daunting prospect 
for religious and secular souls alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps our greatest difficulty in relating to God is our  
inherent inability to form any coherent understanding of the 
Almighty,'' he writes in ``Simple Words.'' Sometimes, people 
construct ways of understanding God that ``should be helpful 
crutches, but these crutches may actually cripple us instead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main crutch, he says, is giving God a human face. ``For many  
people, the image of God is quite clear: a big, white-bearded man 
sitting on a throne very high in the sky. He has, at least 
figuratively, a stick in one hand, and a bag of candy in the other, 
bestowing each on his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	``As enticing as this grandfather image of God is, it contains  
within itself its own destruction. The budding atheist or agnostic 
11- or 12-year-old is one who cannot -- with full justification -- 
continue believing in this definition of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinsaltz proposes another, plainer avenue toward understanding  
God: ``the belief that things somehow fit together into a whole 
that makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The mystical writings about God say things that every child  
knows,'' he writes. ```God, You are the completeness of 
everything.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The secret of belief is not to expect to see miracles, or to  
have grand mystical experiences, but rather, to preserve the innate 
notion they are born with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People looking for an immediate response from God during the  
High Holy Days are bound to be disappointed, he says. ``For most 
people, the ram's horn will sound at Yom Kippur's end without any 
revelations or signals that they are on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinsaltz writes with the consoling tone of a rabbi who has  
counseled many a discouraged disciple: ``A person generally hears 
the longed-for answer not when he puts his question, not when he is 
struggling, but when he pauses at a summit and looks back on his 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Man Jailed for Extra 19 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For 19 years, a convicted killer told prison  
officials, prosecutors and a string of court-appointed attorneys 
that he had done his time and was no longer supposed to be locked 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a deal with prosecutors, he kept telling them.  
</P>
<P>
	But it was not until this summer that anyone could find the  
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	David Marshall Brown, 54, was finally released last week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised that he had no anger. His feeling is that he  
knows there had been a mistake made and he wanted to get out of 
prison,'' said one of Brown's current attorneys, Sharon Meisler. 
</P>
<P>
	During the years he languished behind bars, Brown described in  
detail a 1965 plea agreement in which he was supposed to be 
released by 1980. But no one could find the seven-page deal, and 
his original lawyer was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Meisler, who works in the public defender's office and was  
hired to research Brown's case in March, found the lost paperwork 
in July -- misfiled in a folder for one of his co-defendants, who 
was freed in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like what happened is the boys' (files) got separated  
into different boxes and the memo goes into a box that does not 
belong to David Brown. And nobody checks,'' Ms. Meisler said. 
``This was before the days of copy machines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor who agreed to the deal in 1965, Richard S. Lowe,  
who is now a judge, said he does not recall the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown declined to be interviewed. He has no family in the area  
but is staying with friends and looking for a manual labor job, Ms. 
Meisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Mary Ann Killinger said her office  
has not opposed Brown's release since the 1970s, but she did not 
know why he remained in prison. The state parole board was unable 
to find a file on him. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no plans for a lawsuit against the state, according to  
Brown's current court-appointed attorney, Dominick Centrella. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether he could sue anyway, said University of  
Pennsylvania law professor Edward Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very hard thing to file suit about, that someone  
should have found something that was misfiled,'' Rubin said. 
``There's a natural instinct that there ought to be some remedy in 
a situation like this. The real tragedy is that no one can give him 
his life back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was 19 when he was arrested with two other Warminster men  
-- Michael McCaffrey and Daniel O'Neill -- for the murder of Eugene 
T. Jordan, the 62-year-old owner of a delicatessen. Brown, who was 
armed with a police nightstick, was charged with accompanying 
O'Neill, the shooter, into the deli. McCaffrey drove the getaway 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and McCaffrey pleaded guilty to murder and robbery and got  
life sentences in a deal that stipulated that prosecutors would not 
oppose parole after 15 years. McCaffrey was released more than two 
decades ago. O'Neill remains in prison serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown earned a high school equivalency degree in prison and has  
about half the credits necessary for a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he was allowed to work outside prison in various  
programs, including one in which he described what it was like to 
be behind bars.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Hits 31-Month High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures soared past the $23-a-barrel mark Thursday for  
the first time since early 1997 on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
after reports showed inventories had sunk lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of other energy products also rose sharply. In other  
markets, palladium rose to a five-month high, helped by the 
dollar's fall against the yen, and pork futures fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for October delivery rose 67 cents to $23.33 a barrel,  
the highest since February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3 percent jump was in response to a pair of reports which  
showed U.S. inventories at their lowest level since January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute said late Wednesday that crude  
oil stockpiles had fallen by nearly 6 million barrels last week -- a 
decline about twice the size analysts had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	In similar findings Thursday that helped spur the rally, the  
U.S. Department of Energy reported a 4.5 million barrel decline in 
crude stockpiles and a 2 million barrel drop in gasoline stockpiles 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The world oil glut that sent crude prices spiraling to a record  
low of $10.35 a barrel last December has shrunk rapidly in response 
to production cutbacks by the Organization of the Petroleum Export 
Countries and a rebounding Asian economy that has spurred demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``This data just fuels the concern about the mid- to long-term  
scenario,'' said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst for the Pegasus 
Econometric Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still an expectation that OPEC will make no change in  
production at its September meeting in Vienna,'' he said. ``And 
that is going to leave the market with a supply-demand deficit 
during the fourth and first quarters, when crude demand is 
strongest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil, meanwhile, jumped to its highest level since Oct.  
6, 1997. October heating oil rose 1.56 cents to 61.08 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	October regular gasoline rose 1.70 cents to 68.40 cents a  
gallon; October natural gas rose 2.39 cents to $2.851 per 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
October rose 77 cents to $23.04 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures rose nearly 3 percent based on the yen's climb  
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since metals are dollar-based commodities, a rise in its value  
encourages selling to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium rose $9 to $361.85 an ounce on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures' slide on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was due  
mostly to technical selling on a market with abundant supplies, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	October lean hogs fell 2 cents to 43.30 cents a pound; February  
frozen pork bellies fell 1.20 cents to 53.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> eBay Pulls Plug on Another Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Internet auction house eBay pulled the plug again  
on an item up for bids that didn't pass legal muster. This time, it 
was a 47 percent share in another Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceman.com, a Houston-based site that provides product price  
comparisons, tried Wednesday to auction nearly half of its equity 
for at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have been calling to see if this is real,'' said  
Neal Verma, president of VermaNet, which operates Priceman.com. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a string of auction interruptions on eBay.  
The site has had to stop auctions of babies, human kidneys and even 
cocaine. The company has said all were believed to be hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Priceman.com sale was canceled after a few hours without any  
firm bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sale of stock raises a sufficient number of complex and  
problematic legal issues that we cannot permit such sales to occur 
on the site,'' said Holly McDermott, spokeswoman for 
California-based eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Verma, 23, said his company was serious about the listing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have been interested and have asked us to fax them  
our business plan, or executive summary,'' Verma said. ``One guy 
wanted to know where the $10 million would go. He wanted a detailed 
marketing plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going through traditional lines to secure funding for  
another of their Web sites, ServicesAuction.com, Verma said he 
wanted to see if a less conventional approach could work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to try something nobody had done before,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest goal of the $10 million would have been to fund  
marketing of Priceman.com, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need at least $5 million to create a buzz and get your  
name above all the noise,'' Verma said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief eBay listing might have done the trick, somewhat.  
Priceman.com received so much traffic after the eBay listing that 
it couldn't handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to the sudden traffic, we are having technical problems,''  
read the eBay message that greeted visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Baudhuin, special counsel for the Fort Worth district office  
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said VermaNet may have 
offered its shares improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you offer stock publicly, there has to be a  
registration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verma said he believed the company followed correct policy in  
making the offering on eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the company will continue to follow up with those who  
showed interest, he said.

<HEADLINE> Drug May Help Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An experimental drug may relieve some of the  
miserable side effects of cancer treatment, allowing stronger doses 
of chemotherapy and radiation, researchers say. Ironically, the 
drug works by briefly blocking a gene that is a natural defense 
against cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the drug has been used only in mice, researchers at the  
University of Illinois at Chicago are preparing to test it in 
baboons and hope to have it ready for human tests in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the drug study in mice appears Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei V. Gudkov, lead author of the study, said that if the  
drug works in humans, it may be possible to give more vigorous 
radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer without an 
increase in the side effects that cause such misery for patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer treatment is usually such a pain that people feel bad  
not only physically but also emotionally and psychologically,'' 
said Gudkov, a molecular genetics researcher at the university. 
``Making this treatment more bearable would be a tremendous 
advantage for these patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an interesting and novel finding that could be very  
important in cancer treatment,'' said Dr. Carlos Cardon-Cardo, 
director of molecular pathology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardon-Cardo said that if side effects of cancer treatment could  
be eliminated or controlled, ``it would allow us to give higher 
doses and more effective doses'' of radiation and anti-tumor 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned, however, that the experimental drug has so far  
been tested only in mice and its effects in humans is still 
unknown. Also, Cardon-Cardo said researchers will have to carefully 
evaluate the drug's long-term influence on healthy cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Gudkov said the drug works by temporarily knocking out a gene  
called p53 that normally protects the body against flawed genes 
that might lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The job of p53 is to identify cells with damaged genes and cause  
those cells to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	When patients undergo radiation or chemotherapy, the treatment  
often damages cells that are then forced by p53 to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, said Gudkov, is that p53 sometimes acts so  
powerfully that it kills cells that are only slightly damaged and 
that, given a chance, could recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``P53 pushes a lot of damage cells to die just as a preventative  
measure,'' he said. ``It kills too many cells. It kills cells that 
may not need to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the death of these damaged cells that causes many of the  
side effects of cancer treatment -- nausea, anemia, hair and weight 
loss and a weakened immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Gudkov and his team identified a drug, called pifithrin, that  
blocks the action of p53 for about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Using mice that had tumors, the researchers injected pifithrin  
in some animals and not in others. All the animals were then 
subjected to radiation typical of a cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gudkov said those mice with blocked p53 gene tolerated the  
radiation much better than the other animals. In one test, all 30 
treated mice lived 8 1/2 months, while only five of an untreated group 
survived that long. 
</P>
<P>
	A hopeful sign, he said, is that there were no new cancers among  
the treated mice, a suggestion that p53 resumed its job of killing 
potentially cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Gudkov said it appears that by the time the effects of the  
pifithrin wears off, many cells damaged by radiation or 
chemotherapy had repaired themselves. P53 then acted only against 
those cells beyond repair, leaving the other cells alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drug could be used only in cancer patients whose  
tumors have a missing or mutated p53 gene, a characteristic of 
about half of all cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gudkov said pifithrin will be tested on baboons before it is  
tested on humans. The baboon work is just getting started, he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: 19 Clicks Between Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Any two randomly picked pages on the World Wide Web are on  
average just 19 clicks away from each other, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, reported in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature, suggest that the Web is so interconnected that any desired 
information is nearby even though there are 800 million documents 
available. The key is knowing which links to click. 
</P>
<P>
	The study calls to mind the movie and Broadway play ``Six  
Degrees of Separation'' -- which holds that all people are connected 
to one another by no more than six individuals -- and the party game 
``Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,'' in which players try to make a 
connection between actor Kevin Bacon and another celebrity using 
six or fewer other stars and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a University  
of Notre Dame physics professor, and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	They constructed a robot that collected all the links on a Web  
page and followed them to their destination. The process was 
repeated over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
	Using statistical tools, they figured out the average distance  
between two random pages. And even if the Web grows 1,000 percent, 
the distance would change only from 19 clicks to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Search engine companies could use the findings to create  
programs that more intelligently figure out what's available. A 
recent study showed that even the best search engine scours only 
about 34 percent of the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing something about the topology lets you know how far you  
need to go to catch something that might be out there,'' said Steve 
Lawrence, a researcher at the NEC Research Institute and co-author 
of a previous study on the effectiveness of searches. ``The search 
engine companies are going to benefit from this kind of 
knowledge.''

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Industry Said Policing Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The alcohol industry is doing a pretty good  
job of voluntarily policing its ads but should establish a 
third-party review to assure that teen-agers are not targeted, 
federal regulators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Federal Trade Commission finds that for the  
most part, companies selling alcoholic products are following their 
own set codes. It does recommend strengthening some standards to 
better deter advertising to young audiences, although the FTC's 
report to Congress did not urge mandatory regulation of 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding ways to deter alcohol use by those under 21 is a  
challenge for government agencies, consumer organizations and the 
beverage alcohol industry,'' said FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC urged companies to make more stringent a standard that  
generally permits media ads even when half the audience is under 
21. The commission also advised that the industry limit placement 
of alcoholic products to movies rated R and NC-17, after finding 
that some of these products make their way into PG films and 
television shows popular with teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also suggested companies should prohibit ads with  
substantial underage appeal, even if they also appeal to adults or 
instead target their ads to persons 25 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies applauded the report's findings and said many of the  
recommendations would not amount to major changes in their 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Coors Brewing Co. chief executive Peter Coors said his company  
already sets a higher standard for its ad audiences, by requiring 
that 60 percent of viewers be over the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel pretty good about where we are,'' Coors said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coors and others support a third-party review system, as a way  
to solidify public confidence in the alcohol industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are responsible advertisers and believe that voluntary  
third-party review will reinforce a foundation of trust with the 
American people that we are a responsible industry,'' said Charles 
Phillips, head of United Distillers &AMP; Vintners North America Inc., 
whose consumer brands include Smirnoff vodka and Guiness stout. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups do not think there is a need for a third-party  
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Becker, vice president of alcohol issues for the Beer  
Institute, said brewers already must meet the voluntary industry 
codes, standards set by networks and other rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adding to this comprehensive advertising process would be  
redundant,'' Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report examined product placement, Internet advertising and  
college marketing in the industry using reports from eight leading 
beer, wine and liquor companies and input from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC did identify some areas where companies failed to comply  
with their own codes. Two of the eight companies, during certain 
weeks, aired many ads -- as high as 25 percent -- to an audience with 
a majority of underage viewers. Another two could not provide 
reliable information to show whether they were complying or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumer advocates said the data demonstrates the need for  
mandatory regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear from their own data that the industry isn't even  
following their standards,'' said Fritz Wiecking, manager for 
federal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest's 
alcohol project. Without enforcement and oversight, the strength of 
such standards are irrelevant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC also recommended that companies avoid content in their  
Web sites that would attract underage consumers and reduce 
on-campus advertising and sponsorship of college spring break 
events.

<HEADLINE> NYC Tries To Combat Encephalitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In New York City, where murder is down and the  
quality of life is up, there's suddenly a deadly new menace: 
mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people have died in the last few weeks in an outbreak of  
mosquito-borne encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Nine 
other people have been infected, and 60 other possible cases are 
being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials in helicopters and on foot began spraying  
pesticide around the city last weekend to prevent the spread of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that forested or swampy  
areas in the entire city will be sprayed over the next several days 
and sporadically for the next several weeks, until the frost sets 
in, and again in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The spraying is aimed at stagnant pools of water where the bugs  
breed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more dead mosquitoes, the better,'' Giuliani said.  
</P>
<P>
	Roger Nasci, an entomologist with the federal Centers for  
Disease Control and Prevention, said it is ``exceedingly rare'' for 
the disease to hit a Northeastern city, and blamed the outbreak on 
``bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was New York's first confirmed outbreak of the disease, a  
strain known as St. Louis encephalitis. One of the confirmed cases 
was in the borough of Brooklyn. All of the rest have been in 
Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease originates in birds, which pass it along to feeding  
mosquitos. Once encephalitis reaches humans via a mosquito bite, it 
cannot be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there have been relatively few confirmed cases, Nasci  
expressed concern that ``a very large population'' is at risk among 
New York City's 7.3 million people. Children, the elderly and 
anyone with immune system problems can die from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC sent a team in earlier this week to help New York City  
combat the virus, and a city hot line has been flooded with more 
than 13,000 calls since word of the illness emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	But people relaxing in Flushing Meadow Park in Queens seemed  
unconcerned Thursday afternoon, even though the park was one of the 
first areas targeted as a possible mosquito breeding ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was meant to die by a mosquito, I would have died  
already,'' said sunbather Anthony Ferro, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Guerin, 55, was catching some sun and enjoying a barbecue  
with his wife. Neither was wearing any bug spray. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not that many good days left in the summer,'' Guerin  
said. ``It's a concern of ours, but (the illness) is not a 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis encephalitis, named for the city where the first cases  
were identified in 1933, is often treatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Flushing Hospital reported the outbreak on Aug. 24  
after identifying four patients with symptoms. The symptoms, which 
generally appear five to 15 days after a bite, include fever and 
headaches.

<HEADLINE>  Danforth To Head Waco Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth is  
launching an investigation into the FBI's 1993 Branch Davidian 
standoff amid more calls for the resignation of the attorney 
general who appointed him, Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth spent most of the afternoon Wednesday at the Justice  
Department meeting with various officials, including Reno, about 
the scope of the investigation and how much authority he would 
have, according to government officials familiar with the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice Department official said Reno would introduce  
Danforth today at her weekly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's selection of Danforth came as the top Republican in the  
Senate said he now has doubts about who started the fire that ended 
the 51-day siege 6 1/2 years ago near Waco, Texas, and believes it is 
time for Reno to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Wednesday that  
new revelations that the government withheld evidence about its use 
of force in the April 19, 1993, assault add to a ``pattern'' of 
refusing to cooperate with congressional requests, such as repeated 
GOP requests that she seek an investigation of Democratic 
fund-raising in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are doubts because questions have been raised,'' Lott  
told reporters. ``All of that leads me to conclude that the 
attorney general should resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., also called for Reno  
to step down, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the attorney general received a strong  
endorsement from Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, who said Reno ``deserves commendation rather than 
criticism,'' and that ``under no circumstances'' should she resign. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has expressed continuing confidence in Reno,  
but has not done the same for FBI Director Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's comment added fuel to a GOP campaign against Reno since  
the belated revelation that the FBI fired two potentially 
incendiary devices near the Branch Davidian compound hours before 
fire swept through the wooden building and that the agency failed 
to produce, until last week, videotapes showing agents' raid on the 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 members died in the inferno, which the government  
maintains was ignited by sect members, not federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno selected Danforth and he accepted the offer during several  
days of negotiations that focused on what authority Danforth would 
have and how wide the investigation would be, according to 
government officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth left the Senate in 1995 and is respected by members of  
both parties for his stubborn independence and reputation for 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, 63, is an Episopal priest with solid Republican  
credentials. He successfully shepherded the troubled nomination of 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas through a tough confirmation 
process. He also has a background in law enforcement. Before 
entering the Senate, he served as attorney general in Missouri for 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth's independent probe could clash with multiple hearings  
that Republicans on Capitol Hill were preparing, but House 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Wednesday he 
would withhold his planned legislation to establish a five-member 
commission to first see if Danforth gets the full cooperation of 
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should events prove otherwise, we will reconsider this  
decision,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	While senators of both parties expressed their respect for  
Danforth's integrity, some warned that the multiple committee 
probes could hamper his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd begin to get in the way of Senator Danforth unless they  
fed into'' that inquiry, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said.

	Palestinian Prisoners Released in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	BEITUNIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel released 199 Palestinian  
security prisoners today, providing the first real evidence that 
the peace process is back on track after nearly a year of deadlock. 
The inmates, raising cuffed hands in triumph and flashing victory 
signs, chanted ``God is great'' as buses carrying them to freedom 
were greeted by cheering relatives and bagpipe bands at army 
checkpoints in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The releases, a day 
early, marked the launch of a new interim land-for-security deal 
that also requires the transfer of 7 percent of the West Bank to 
Palestinian civilian rule by the weekend.

	Bradley Hits Campaign Trail  
</P>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Traditional Democratic sympathies for  
the poor and disadvantaged lie at the heart of Democratic 
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley's campaign as he tries to 
articulate for Democrats a compelling reason to choose him over 
Vice President Al Gore. Today, Bradley carries his call for a 
``deeper prosperity'' than that achieved under Gore and President 
Clinton from his sleepy home town to a black fraternity in St. 
Louis, through the Mississippi River home of Mark Twain and through 
to Iowa, where winter nominating caucuses will launch the 2000 
presidential contest.

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia said today it would not  
allow U.N. peacekeepers into chaos-ridden East Timor, despite 
growing international pressure to let foreign troops restore law 
and order. The announcement by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas came 
after Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and some of his top aides 
met with a high-level U.N. delegation to discuss ways to resolve 
the East Timor crisis. Rumors that Habibie planned to resign over 
the East Timor crisis swept Jakarta, adding to the confusion and 
sending the stock market into panic. But a spokesman for Habibie 
today denied that he was preparing to step down.

	Death Toll in Greece Quake at 74  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Rescuers lifted a woman to safety today  
from the ruins of a factory toppled nearly 46 hours earlier by a 
powerful earthquake that has claimed at least 74 lives and left 
dozens of others missing. The cries of joy from the woman's husband 
buoyed the spirits of emergency teams working round the clock, but 
there were few signs of life from other crumbled buildings and the 
death toll was expected to climb. In northern Greece, meanwhile, 
twin quakes under the Aegean Sea escalated fears that more serious 
temblors were possible around a country laced with fault lines. 

</P>

	Russian Troops Suffer More Losses  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Despite the extensive use of air  
power and artillery, Russian troops suffered heavy losses in their 
battles with Islamic rebels in southern Russia, officials said 
today. Rebels in central Dagestan shot down a Russian Su-25 ground 
attack aircraft today -- the first jet lost since the beginning of 
fighting. The pilot ejected to safety, the Interfax news agency 
reported. The military wouldn't say how the plane was shot down. 
The rebels have previously hit several helicopters with gunfire and 
ground-to-ground rockets, but there have been no reports of the 
rebels firing anti-aircraft missiles.

	DOSWELL, Va. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy who said his safety  
restraint was too loose leaped from a Paramount Kings Dominion 
roller coaster, the same ride from which a man fell to his death 
last month. Officials at the theme park said Eamon McIntyre jumped 
off the Shockwave shortly after it started, mistakenly believing 
his shoulder harness wasn't locked. The boy was not seriously hurt 
in the Sept. 2 incident. Officials said the ride was inspected 
afterwards and no problem was found.

career singles titles and 77 career doubles crowns, John McEnroe 
had his share of tennis thrills -- right up there, though, was his 
appointment yesterday as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team. ``It 
is one of the proudest moments of my life,'' McEnroe said after 
Judy Levering, president of the United States Tennis Association, 
named him to the post.

<HEADLINE> McKenzie's Start Streak May End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Barring something unforeseen, veteran  
offensive lineman Raleigh McKenzie will begin Sunday's game on 
unfamiliar territory: the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie has started 126 straight games as a lineman for three  
teams, none of them the Packers. Green Bay signed him in the 
offseason, and he was penciled in as the starting left guard during 
minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	But after an indifferent preseason by the entire line,  
second-year pro Mike Wahle beat out McKenzie for the position last 
week. The Packers plan to use McKenzie as a backup to Wahle and 
right guard Marco Rivera, but he will almost certainly miss his 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, a 14-year veteran, isn't worried about it.  
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of thing is just about being in the right place at  
the right time,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean you've got something 
special. All streaks come to an end anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 36, McKenzie is the oldest player on the Packers' roster. He  
spent the last two seasons in San Diego, where he landed after a 
two-year stint in Philadelphia under current Green Bay coach Ray 
Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	His streak began in 1991, when he helped the Washington Redskins  
win the Super Bowl with his play at right guard. He has played all 
five offensive line positions during his career, and his 
versatility was a primary reason the Packers signed him. 
</P>
<P>
	For McKenzie, the move to Green Bay was a chance to reunite with  
twin brother Reggie, a former NFL linebacker in his third season as 
the Packers' director of pro personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be with a good team that wants me and where  
I can contribute,'' he said. ``I'm getting to the end here, so I'd 
like one more Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' offensive line was a weak link during exhibition  
play. Miami's pass-rushers pressured quarterbacks Brett Favre and 
Matt Hasselbeck relentlessly, and Green Bay never established a 
consistent running game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahle, who didn't look sharp against Miami, will be pressured by  
guard Joe Andruzzi, who has been out with a ligament tear in his 
knee. Andruzzi, who was on his way to a starting spot before the 
injury last month, has practiced this week and is probable for 
Sunday's game.

<HEADLINE> Reebok To Cut More Than 600 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOUGHTON, Mass. (AP) -- Reebok International Ltd. on Thursday  
said it plans to lay off 10 percent of its 6,600 workers worldwide 
in an attempt to cut costs and restructure its business. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reductions, 120 jobs will be cut at the company's  
headquarters in Massachusetts. Other details about the locations 
and amount of job cuts will be announced over the next few weeks, 
company spokeswoman Nancy Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a close competitor to Nike, Reebok has been fighting  
falling sneaker sales and losing market share to Adidas and New 
Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. of Boston. Reebok's U.S. market share 
has fallen from more than 21 percent in 1995 to 14 percent last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reebok has been troubled by marketing problems such as an  
inability to maintain a brand message that leaves consumers with a 
clear Reebok identity, industry observers said.

<HEADLINE> Masscare Rumors Sweep East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATAMBUA, Indonesia (AP) -- Allegations of widespread killings in  
East Timor's turmoil are sweeping fast-growing border refugee 
camps, where an estimated 50,000 people now shelter under the gaze 
of militiaman accused of creating the mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the frightened refugees said they were forcibly sent  
across the border to camps controlled by the same army and militias 
spreading terror at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The tens of thousands who huddled under blue and orange plastic  
tarpaulins in one camp near Atambua, 10 miles west of the border, 
swapped horror stories, but reports of large-scale slayings were 
impossible to confirm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw some dead. But I don't know how many or who killed them.  
I just tried to get out as quickly as possible,'' said Jesus da 
Costa, a taxi driver who fled Dili Tuesday at the height of the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor plummeted into lawlessness after Saturday's  
announcement that an overwhelming majority of voters approved 
independence. Militias opposed to independence turned wild and 
violent, forcing thousands to flee to West Timor, the half of the 
island that has been anchored in Indonesia since it gained 
independence from the Netherlands in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, thousands more were arriving any way they could --  
usually hungry, tired and dirty. Supplies of food and water were 
running low in the camps, and many feared overcrowding and 
sanitation problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hitched rides on military vehicles. Others were so  
desperate they took empty garbage trucks from Dili, about 120 miles 
to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	They clutched their meager possessions -- furniture,  
refrigerators, television sets and even dismantled satellite 
dishes. Some displaced farmers took their goats, chickens and pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people in the camps described to reporters how they  
witnessed slayings by the militias. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw dozens of people shot,'' said one man who said he  
witnessed the storming by militiamen of the Dili house of Roman 
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Militia men wearing black shirts and masked stabbed a young  
man right in front of me. He bled to death,'' said the man, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity because he fears retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations, which planned to withdraw most of its staff  
on Friday, has been unable to monitor the scale of the violence. 
Militias have threatened to kill foreign journalists and observers 
who try to get to refugee camps or enter East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican's missionary news service FIDES cited local church  
sources as saying three priests were slain in a grenade attack on a 
parish in the town of Suai on Monday. One hundred people were 
reportedly killed in the attack. Priests and nuns were reported 
killed in other attacks around East Timor, a predominantly Roman 
Catholic province in mostly Muslim Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian government has denied massacres are taking place  
and says the situation will stabilize when martial law takes hold 
under a new general. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some rogue elements have been noted, among them, rogue army  
elements,'' Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Thursday. ``Also 
perhaps some East Timorese who have been part of the Indonesian 
army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many militia members made their way to the border and  
-- after being accused of perpetrating weeks of terror before and 
after Saturday's vote -- were supervising and guarding the camps 
along with the Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	The wives of some militia members still in East Timor said they  
feared for the lives of their husbands and rejected claims of 
atrocities against innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to be widows. Our militia husbands are fighting  
so that East Timor will stay part of Indonesia,'' said Hermandinda 
Bobu, 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated the collective size of the camps, as well  
numbers of refugees in schools, homes and churches, at about 
50,000. Humanitarian groups have estimated that up to 200,000 
people -- a quarter of East Timor's population -- might be homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have made it across the border were unsure of their  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worried. My two sons are missing,'' said Katarina Borse,  
30. ``I'm too tired to cry now.''

<HEADLINE> Lower Leg Pain May Be Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Do your lower legs hurt after you walk a few  
blocks? Are they sometimes numb, tingly or cold? 
</P>
<P>
	If the answer is yes, doctors say you need a checkup -- you may  
have a problem that could threaten not just your ability to walk, 
but your life. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called peripheral vascular disease, a long name that simply  
means arteries in your legs are blocked, preventing proper blood 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be extremely painful -- some patients can't even walk  
through their house without stopping to rest. Left untreated, parts 
of the leg or foot can become gangrenous and have to be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, if your leg arteries are clogged, arteries around the  
heart and brain are likely to be clogged, too, putting you at risk 
for a heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news: There are ways to control peripheral vascular  
disease, or PVD, and the earlier it's diagnosed, the easier the 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet few of the 8 million Americans believed to have PVD know  
that painful legs are something to worry about. Many assume they're 
just out of shape or getting older, so they don't even mention 
symptoms to their doctors, said Dr. Rodney Raabe, a PVD specialist 
of Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a massive public education problem,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	So Raabe is spearheading a nationwide program next week that  
aims to test -- for free -- up to 75,000 people for PVD. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized by the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional  
Radiology, the ``Legs for Life'' screenings will be offered at over 
500 hospitals and clinics. The campaign isn't aimed just at leg 
pain sufferers, but also at people at risk who don't yet have 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's at risk? Anyone can get PVD, which is why doctors want to  
examine people with lower leg pain during walking or exercise that 
-- unlike pain from arthritis or injury -- subsides after a few 
minutes of rest. Other symptoms: numbness, tingling or coldness in 
the lower legs or feet, or sores there that don't heal. 
</P>
<P>
	But PVD occurs most often in people over 50 and smokers. Other  
risk factors include diabetes; high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol or other heart disease; obesity; and relatives with 
PVD. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a quick, painless test -- doctors just measure your blood  
pressure at the ankle and the arm. Further from the heart, leg 
pressure is supposed to be higher or at least equal to arm 
pressure. If it's not, you're developing PVD, Raabe explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't put off getting tested, advises a patient who ignored his  
own symptoms long enough that he ultimately had a toe amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Zhad Korduba is a New York anesthesiologist who admits, with  
all his medical training, he should have known he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a patient had come up to me and told me these symptoms, I  
would have jumped all over it,'' said Korduba, 59. Instead, ``I 
kind of chucked it off to getting older and being out of shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korduba enjoyed hiking, but a few years ago noticed his legs got  
unusually tired while walking uphill. Later, he had severe leg 
cramps after tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew a change in health like that should prompt a doctor  
visit, but ignored the symptoms until they suddenly worsened a few 
months ago. He'd walk a mere 1 1/2 blocks before having to stop from 
sharp pain. 
</P>
<P>
	When PVD is diagnosed early, the preferred treatment is walking.  
It may hurt at first -- you may have to rest while pain fades and 
then walk a little more. But many people gradually walk further and 
further pain-free, as new blood vessels grow around their blocked 
arteries, Raabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideal is to walk about 3 miles a day, five days a week, if  
you really want good vascular health,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also may prescribe aspirin or other blood thinners.  
</P>
<P>
	For worse cases, an angioplasty -- threading a balloon into the  
blocked leg artery -- can clear the clog. The most severe patients 
get a leg bypass -- just like with heart bypass surgery, doctors sew 
a new artery around the clogged one. 
</P>
<P>
	Korduba's PVD was so bad he had to have a toe amputated and a  
leg angioplasty, but he now walks pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The radiological society has opened an Internet site --  
http://www.legsforlife.org -- with a questionnaire to alert people 
to their risk of PVD. It also lists sites offering the free tests 
next week. Or, call 1-877-357-2847 to request a brochure on PVD.

<HEADLINE> Brees-Jackson Duel Highlights Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- When Drew Brees takes the snap, it's  
well known what he's going to do. With Jarious Jackson, it's 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no secret that Brees will try to outgun the 16th-ranked  
Irish (1-1) Saturday with his magnificent arm. How Jackson attacks 
No. 20 Purdue (1-0) is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	``They present a number of problems in the sense that they run  
option football, as well as power football, as well as spread 
football,'' Purdue coach Joe Tiller said. ``You can't afford to be 
one-dimensional defensively when you're setting your plan against 
them. You have to be ready for everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, playing behind an inexperienced offensive line and in  
front of young tailbacks, carries the brunt of the Irish offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, that wouldn't be such a bad thing. He ranked 13th  
nationally last season in passing efficiency and was intercepted 
only six times while guiding Notre Dame to a 9-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he has been erratic. Against Michigan, he threw for  
a career-best 302 yards but also had five errant option pitches, 
fumbled as he was sacked near the Wolverines' goal line and was 
sacked four times. He's also thrown four interceptions already. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame's offense has stumbled right along with him,  
committing seven turnovers after having 13 in all of 1997 and 18 
last year. To make matters worse, Jackson missed several practices 
this week with a turf toe injury but that isn't expected to keep 
him out of Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to eliminate the sloppiness,'' Irish coach Bob Davie  
said. ``We cannot pitch the ball on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees, however, seems to have continued his success from last  
season. He threw for 273 yards against Central Florida last week, 
completing 26-of-43 for four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his progress, Brees has been working to force fewer  
passes, like the two interceptions he threw last year when Notre 
Dame beat Purdue 31-30. The first set up the winning field goal 
with less than a minute to play after Brees threw wildly across the 
middle rather than take a sack. The second ended Purdue's final 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees likes what he sees of Notre Dame's secondary, which has  
been prone to give up big gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they try to disguise anything,'' Brees said.  
``If they're going to blitz, they show you they're going to blitz. 
They've got such good players, such great athletes, they're good 
enough to let you know what's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of what defense the Irish use, they know the only way  
to beat Purdue is to keep Brees off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, the Irish will have to mount a consistent, sustained  
offensive attack, something they have yet to do. While they rushed 
for 363 yards against Kansas and Jackson threw for 302 against 
Michigan, large chunks of both totals came on big plays, rather 
than the grind-it-out style Notre Dame thrives on. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to control the football to try to keep them off the  
field with their offense,'' Davie said. ``But they are such a 
quick-strike offense that they are going to score, so you can't 
just button it up and say you are going to just run the football. 
You are going to have to create some plays to score.''

<HEADLINE> Jollibee Foods May Buy ChowKing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine's food giant Jollibee  
Foods Corp. said Thursday it is interested in acquiring full 
ownership of ChowKing Food Corp., the nation's largest Chinese 
fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Jollibee, which owns and operates the largest hamburger chain in  
the Philippines, said it wants to acquire ChowKing if majority 
owners accept its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying ChowKing would expand Jollibee's revenue base and enhance  
its dominance in the Philippine fast-food market. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Jollibee Chairman Tony Tan Caktiong, who owns half  
of ChowKing, is urging a group led by ChowKing President Robert 
Kuan, the chain's other major shareholder, to approve a buyout, the 
national Philippine Daily Inquirer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No timetable was set for completing the deal, Jollibee said in a  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale needs the approval of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Defendants Innocent in Fur Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Three men were found innocent Thursday of  
charges they plotted to bomb a fur farm that sustained more than $1 
million in damages in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Bishop, 25, of Ithaca, N.Y., and Sean Gautschy, 23, of  
Salt Lake City, were found innocent of charges stemming from the 
bombing of the Fur Breeder's Cooperative on March 11, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Troy Peace, 21, of Huntington Beach, Calif., was found  
innocent of two counts from an earlier attempt to the bomb the 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The case hinged on the credibility of testimony given by  
prosecution witness, Douglas Joshua Ellerman, 21, who was sentenced 
to seven years after offering information that led to the current 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellerman testified that he, Gautschy, Bishop and Alexander Slack  
-- who committed suicide in June -- broke into the co-op, planted 
five bombs and lit two fires. He also said Peace took part in an 
earlier aborted attempt to bomb the same facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop's lawyer, Fred Metos, argued that Ellerman and his  
brother gave several inconsistent statements while testifying, 
including conflicting accounts of who bought the bomb-making 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were all reportedly members of the ``Straight  
Edge'' movement, whose members swear off drugs, alcohol, tobacco 
and casual sex. Some members also support animal liberation causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooperative is one of the country's largest and provides  
mink to hundreds of farmers in the West.

<HEADLINE> HMOs for Rural Elderly Scarce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The doors of HMOs are shut to most senior  
citizens and disabled people who live in rural counties and are 
covered by Medicare, says a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-fourth of Medicare's 39 million beneficiaries, or 9.2  
million, live in a rural county, according to the study -- based on 
Medicare and Census Bureau figures -- by the liberal consumer group 
Families USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, 6.7 million, or 73 percent, do not have access in  
their home county to an HMO, because none of the private health 
plans in their area participate in Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, for rural people in the Medicare program, HMOs have  
not decided that it is profitable to provide services,'' said Ron 
Pollack, executive director of Families USA. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans  
said HMOs have had trouble signing up the few doctors and hospitals 
in rural areas because these health care providers often can do as 
well or better financially by submitting bills to Medicare on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a problem that we think is likely to get worse,'' said  
Susan Pisano. 
</P>
<P>
	About 17 percent of senior citizens in rural counties -- or 1.6  
million -- have only one HMO open to them. Only 10 percent, or about 
900,000, have more than one private health plan to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare beneficiaries who do not have access to an HMO still  
get care through the nation's health insurance program for the 
elderly and disabled. The government simply pays each of their 
medical bills directly instead of paying a private health plan a 
flat fee to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
	However, HMOs are attractive to senior citizens because many  
offer extra benefits, such as prescription drugs, which are not 
usually covered by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors of the report also say the lack of participation by HMOs  
in rural areas raises questions about the viability of Medicare 
reform proposals, supported by many lawmakers, that would give 
private health plans a bigger role in caring for the nation's 
elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that sparse populations and the scarcity of  
health care providers in rural areas make it difficult for HMOs to 
create the economies of scale that allow them to profit there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Families USA report predicted that HMO closings announced  
for 2000 will mean an even greater portion of rural Medicare 
beneficiaries -- 77 percent -- will have no HMO available to them 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found 13 states where no rural counties currently have  
a Medicare HMO: Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont 
and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Sega Goes High-Tech With Dreamcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sonic the Hedgehog runs faster than ever before.  
Metal swords bang with a perfect clang. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega Enterprises is looking to dazzle American consumers with  
special effects, hopeful its new Dreamcast video game system will 
propel the struggling company back to the top of the U.S. gaming 
market from the brink of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast hits the nation's stores on Thursday, and retailers  
are bracing for Christmas-like crowds through the weekend as video 
gamers rush to get first dibs on the super-powerful machines and 
the first 16 games designed for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Thursday's launch, Sega tallied more than 300,000  
pre-orders for the $199 machine -- three times more than 
anticipated. Dreamcast games will sell for about $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
	But big hype and a strong launch won't guarantee long-term  
success, especially with Sony and Nintendo due to introduce new 
machines and Dreamcast sales drooping in Japan, where the game was 
introduced a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry watchers warn that Sega will need to keep introducing  
new games, building sales through next year for Dreamcast to 
succeed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have managed to create a big buzz and now they have to  
deliver,'' said John Davison, editor-in-chief of Electronic Gaming 
Monthly, a magazine based in Oak Brook, Ill. ``They can't afford to 
stumble at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sega was an industry leader in the early 1990s with its Genesis  
gaming console, but its next system, Saturn, bombed when it was 
launched in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Tokyo-based company holds about 1 percent of the U.S.  
video-game market, having been trampled by Sony and Nintendo 
products with more powerful machines and wider game selections. 
</P>
<P>
	For its fiscal year ended March 31, Sega had a loss of almost  
$400 million and slashed about 1,000 employees, about a quarter of 
its workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Sega is betting big on Dreamcast.  
</P>
<P>
	With a $100 million marketing and advertising campaign, Sega  
hopes to convince consumers that its new 128-bit system -- four 
times as powerful as the best-selling Sony PlayStation and twice as 
fast as Nintendo 64 -- will provide a more exciting gaming 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast is the first home-gaming system to include Internet

	The machine also features advanced 3-D graphics that make the  
on-screen images look clear and crisp. In the new Dreamcast 
football game, NFL2K, a gamer can select bad weather and a 
spectacularly realistic rain storm begins on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast's computer brain is also designed to ``learn'' from  
its mistakes against a game player. If your quarterback passes 
repeatedly to a single receiver on your football team, the game 
reacts after a handful of throws by assigning a back to shadow that 
receiver, forcing you to change your strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have taken a big graphical and technological leap with  
Dreamcast,'' said Joe Fielding, editorial director at the Web site 
videogames.com. ``It is far better than anything out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many retailers, surprised by the heavy demand, planned to open  
their stores Wednesday night and early Thursday for the planned and

	``I had to have it immediately. I couldn't wait,'' said Ken

people at the Electronics Boutique store at the King of Prussia 
mall outside Philadelphia.

<P>
	``As soon as I get the machine and three or four games, I am  
running home to play it,'' he said. ``I'm having an all-night 
Dreamcast party.''

	``We are actually planning for this to be a bigger event than  
``Star Wars'' was in May,'' said Tom Alfonsi, senior vice president 
of merchandising at K-B Toys. ``Going into this, we never thought 
this would be so big. But now we see how big it really is.''

<HEADLINE> Danforth Seen As Fair, Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ordained Episcopal priest, former Sen. John  
C. Danforth is often tagged by friends and foes alike as ``St. 
Jack,'' a nickname he eschews but that sums up both his reputation 
for integrity -- and stubborn independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies call the Missouri Republican the perfect choice to head  
an independent inquiry into the fiery end -- and a fatal for 80 
people -- to the FBI's 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian compound 
in Waco, Texas, in 1993. He was chosen for the job today by 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Danforth's entire public life was a testament to  
integrity in government,'' said Walter McCormick, a longtime Senate 
Commerce Committee aide to the senator. ``He will get to the bottom 
of it, and there will be no hide-the-ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of another erstwhile adviser, Supreme Court Justice  
Clarence Thomas, viewed Danforth's moral integrity as a beacon that 
guided her husband's stormy confirmation hearings in October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of sexual harassment by a former colleague, Anita Hill,  
the conservative black jurist ultimately survived the controversy 
to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall, a liberal champion 
of civil rights and the first black member of the high court. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Danforth had also emerged as a civil rights leader and  
was preparing to battle the Bush White House to pass the 1991 Civil 
Rights Act aimed at protecting the jobs of women and minorities. At 
the time, the lanky Missourian characterized the paradox as ``an 
interesting happenstance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're lucky they've found a man who can restore  
trust when an institution's credibility is in question,'' Ginni 
Thomas, the justice's wife, said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``He's a man who very easily and naturally 
combines the principles of his religious faith with public 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled how, during the 10 days of hearings, the Thomases  
and Danforths prayed in the Senate Russell Office Building's 
bathroom moments before Thomas made his first statement at his 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	A grandson of the founder of the Ralston Purina animal food  
empire, Danforth, 63, was born to wealth. He was active in his 
family's philanthropies and while in Washington ministered to 
elderly shut-ins and conducted Tuesday morning services at St. 
Alban's Church. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Yale Seminary and Yale Law School, he was elected  
to the Senate in 1976 after holding the Missouri attorney general's 
job for eight years. In Missouri, he is viewed as the progenitor of 
the modern Republicanism, with two of his proteges, Christopher 
Bond and John Ashcroft, now holding the state's two seats in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a capacity to be a bulldog,'' said Ashcroft, who won  
the race to replace the retiring Danforth in 1994. ``He's a man 
without prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, Danforth was sometimes called ``St. Jack,'' both by  
admirers of his virtue and nonconformity and by critics who saw him 
as self-righteous. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth is a fiscal conservative but is progressive on social  
issues, with the exception of staunch anti-abortion views. He has 
opposed the death penalty, fought prayer in public schools, argued 
against efforts to criminalize flag burning and defended the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Danforth has served as chairman of a civic  
group working to revitalize St. Louis with projects ranging from 
beautification to stopping racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls them like he sees them,'' former Sen. Thomas  
Eagleton, a Missouri Democrat who served 10 years with Danforth, 
told the AP. ``Members of the Senate or House will have full faith 
in his finding.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Post Contributions Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Texas Gov. George W. Bush began posting  
daily lists of his campaign contributors on the Internet, the first 
group of names included several House members who reached into 
their campaign bank accounts to make contributions to the 
Republican presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush received almost $20,000 from House members -- including  
$1,000 apiece from House GOP Conference Chairman J.C. Watts and 
Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt -- and another $5,000 from the 
leadership PAC of National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman 
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Some four dozen state and local officials 
also contributed to Bush from their campaign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he offers the best promise to give new direction to  
the country as we enter a new century,'' said Rep. Sherwood 
Boehlert, R-N.Y., who also gave $1,000. Boehlert has taken both 
Bush and his father, former President George Bush, on tours of the 
Baseball Hall of Fame, which is in his congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Bush reported raising $12 million between July 1 and  
Aug. 26, bringing his total to a record $49 million and assuring 
that he will break the $50 million barrier before the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., expects to report raising more than $10 million by Sept. 
30, including $2 million transferred earlier from his Senate 
account, and Gary Bauer reported that he had raised more than $5 
million to date. 
</P>
<P>
	These latest numbers came Thursday as the Bush campaign  
announced that it would put his campaign contributions on his web 
site two weeks after they are received. Bush is the first 
presidential candidate to release his donors in advance of the 
federally required reporting periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said that it's important to raise the individual limit  
(of $1,000) to make it easier for candidates to be able raise 
money, but I also believe we ought to have instant disclosure,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor's action comes in the wake of criticism of  
his fund-raising practices and his decision to jettison the 
Watergate-era reforms of limiting campaign spending in exchange for 
some federal financial assistance. On Monday, another Republican 
presidential hopeful, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said the 
decision by both Bush and publisher Steve Forbes to forgo the 
federal funds so they can spend as much as they want is ``a 
precedent that will basically emasculate the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain declined to comment Thursday on Bush's decision to  
release the names of his contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the action was not a  
response to the attacks on his fund raising. ``This has been in the 
planning stages for quite a while,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander said Bush's  
actions could deflect the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that reform advocates have been in favor of for  
a long time,'' said Alexander, professor emeritus of political 
science at the University of Southern California. ``It certainly 
deflects from the negative stories about his not accepting the 
public funding and going the private route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush moved toward the $50 million mark, Bauer announced he  
had broken through the $5 million barrier. He said he had taken in 
more than 90,000 contributions and called his progress ``a very 
encouraging sign'' that the campaign is about issues, not just 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Election Commission has voted to stop a  
practice by which presidential candidates are raising money for the 
general election long before they have won their party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC voted to prevent candidates from raising money for their  
general election accounts until June 1 of the presidential election 
year. Commission spokesman Ian Stirton said the regulations won't 
take effect until next year and therefore won't affect the current 
candidates.

<HEADLINE> Mom Won't Go To Jail for Negligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman whose infant son starved to death, in  
part because her surgically reduced breasts failed to supply enough 
milk, was sentenced Wednesday to probation rather than jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabitha Walrond, 21, could have gotten four years in prison for  
criminally negligent homicide in the death of 2-month-old Tyler, 
although prosecutors asked for a six-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Judge Robert Straus gave Ms. Walrond five years'  
probation, saying he didn't believe ``incarceration would serve the 
public interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond was ordered to undergo counseling and must either  
hold a job or attend school during the probationary period. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond claimed she did not realize her reduced breasts were  
leaving the baby malnourished, and her lawyer said she was turned 
away when she tried to take him to a clinic because he did not have 
a Medicaid card. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's paternal grandmother, Marsha Purrell, spoke at the  
sentencing, holding up photos of the baby as a healthy 8-pound 
newborn and as an emaciated 5-pound corpse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tabitha, how could my beautiful grandson change from this to  
that?'' she asked. ``How could your mother -- especially your mother 
and her family -- allow this to happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walrond also faces sentencing on an unrelated charge of  
marijuana possession.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Fall by 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits  
unexpectedly declined last week, good news for job seekers but a 
sign of potential trouble to economists who worry about inflation 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 286,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless  
benefits for the week that ended Saturday, a drop of 4,000 from the 
previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was the 
lowest level since Aug. 21, when claims were at 285,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists had been expecting that new claims would  
actually rise a little to 290,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out  
week-to-week volatility, rose by just 750 to 287,500 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an  
indication of an extremely tight labor market. In August, the 
nation's unemployment rate inched down to 4.2 percent, returning to 
a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	That is good for workers but worrisome to economists. They fear  
employers scrambling for workers will offer higher wages and 
benefits, which could drive up prices and trigger inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	That has not happened so far. Although growth in productivity --  
the amount of output for each hour worked -- slowed in the spring, 
it is one of the forces helping to keep inflation low. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the government last week said hourly earnings for workers  
rose slightly in August. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the government will release a report on inflation at  
the wholesale level; many economists are expecting a slight rise to 
0.3 percent, reflecting higher energy and food prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The decrease in new jobless claims ``certainly sound great for  
Mr. and Mrs. Public but unfortunately it's not going to be too 
great for the Federal Reserve -- at least the more hawkish members 
of the Fed,'' said economist Richard Yamarone with Argus Research 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bode well for Fed members who are worried that wage  
inflation is going to spark soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on Aug. 24 bumped up interest rates for the second time  
this year but signaled that no additional increases may be 
necessary unless the economy shows signs of overheating or if 
inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been worried about the prospects of the  
Fed raising interest rates again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Thursday, Federal Reserve board member Roger  
Ferguson Jr., who has been nominated to be vice chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, did not address the prospects of another rate 
increase. He did mention the policy challenges of keeping inflation 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	``To paraphrase, Chairman (Alan) Greenspan, the economy works  
best when inflation is so low that businesses and households do not 
have to take it into account when making everyday decisions,'' 
according to the prepared text of Ferguson's speech at the National 
Economists Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, however, difficult choices may be required  
about the timing and magnitude of policy actions consistent with 
achieving price stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One approach to such difficult choices, he said, is to ``mandate  
a quantitative inflation target for the central bank, or to have 
the central bank select an inflation target that it must endeavor 
to achieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the Labor Department said that for the week  
ending Aug. 28, 33 states and territories reported decreases in new 
jobless claim applications, while 20 reported increases. The state 
data lag a week behind the national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decrease was California, down 1,990.  
Officials attributed the decline to fewer layoffs in the trade and 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with big decreases were: Georgia, down 1,756; South  
Carolina, down 1,750; Tennessee, down 1,348; and Michigan, down 
783. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in jobless benefits claims  
was New York, up 1,216. State officials did not offer an 
explanation for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states and territories with increases were: Kentucky, up  
674; Illinois, up 661; Puerto Rico, up 632; and Virginia, up 481.

<HEADLINE> Fomer Governor To Celebrate 100th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jimmie Davis, who wrote the  
tune ``You Are My Sunshine,'' will celebrate his 100th birthday 
with plenty of green for a church close to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 900 people have bought $100 tickets to a benefit for  
the Jimmie Davis Tabernacle, a church in Davis' hometown that was 
built to celebrate God through music. 
</P>
<P>
	The church got about $25,000 from Davis' 95th birthday  
celebration and $20,000 from his 90th, said Davis' accountant. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's party, guests will get a steak dinner and will be  
entertained by gospel tunes. They'll also get a CD with 20 versions 
of Davis' trademark song. 
</P>
<P>
	And then everyone can go home early, because the former  
segregationist governor ``was really adamant about ending at 9 
o'clock,'' said Mary Lastrapes, an assistant to a state lawmaker 
who helped organize the event.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Family To Sell Ranch to Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Environmentalists are applauding the  
federal government's plan to purchase a 95,000-acre cattle ranch 
described as a ``scientific treasure'' and manage it as public 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservation groups had lobbied for federal acquisition of the  
scenic Baca Ranch to preserve open space in northern New Mexico. 
They got their wish Wednesday when a Texas family agreed to sell 
the ranch, home to one of the nation's largest elk herds, for $101 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was hailed by The Wilderness Society, which  
called the ranch ``a scientific treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This place deserves to be added to the federal public land  
system for the American people,'' said Pamela Pride Eaton, 
Denver-based regional director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, reached after two years of negotiations, still needs  
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are still a long way from the day when people can  
hike and fish up there, I can say in all honesty that we have never 
been this close to a deal,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the land would be sold to the Forest  
Service and managed as the Valles Caldera National Preserve by nine 
trustees appointed by the president. It would continue to be 
operated as a cattle ranch while also providing recreational 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch is owned by the heirs of oil man James P. Dunigan, who  
died in 1980. It was a land grant in 1860 to the heirs of a Spanish 
leader, and the property remained mostly intact as it passed 
through three owners before the Dunigans bought it in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	They paid $2.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The heirs have said they wanted to be sure the property was  
never developed. The forests on the ranch had been extensively 
logged before the Dunigans bought it, but a new growth of trees 
masks most of the scars of clear-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	Situated in the Jemez Mountains, the area features mountain  
towers, grassy meadows, trout streams and six valleys that include 
the Valle Grande, which stretches nearly six miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch contains the Valles Caldera, the collapsed crater of  
an ancient volcano that has been closed to the public since 1860. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife abounds on the property, including bear, mountain lion,  
bald eagles and golden eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 miles northwest of Santa Fe, the ranch is surrounded by  
publicly owned lands in the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier 
National Monument.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- August Stephen Cinquegrana, one of San  
Francisco's most respected filmmakers who was once nominated for an 
Academy Award, died Aug. 16 of cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinquegrana became an editor at KPIX-TV, where he earned the  
station an Emmy award for his editing on the Patty Hearst 
kidnapping story. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinquegrana won an American Film Institute Independent  
Filmmaker's Award in 1977, and used the $10,000 prize money to make 
``Goodnight, Miss Ann,'' a documentary about Los Angeles boxing 
clubs. The film earned him an Academy Award nomination for best 
short documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked closely with director Francis Ford Coppola at Zoetrope  
Studios and directed several documentaries for PBS and HBO. His 
last documentary, ``The Digital Divide,'' will be broadcast on PBS 
in January. The film discusses the social consequences of the 
computer revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinquegrana is survived by his wife Prudence, a daughter, two  
grandchildren, two sisters and a brother.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lenon Hoyte, an art teacher who shared her dream  
of a doll museum with Harlem children and collectors from around 
the world, died Aug. 1. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Better known as Aunt Len, Ms. Hoyte officially opened her  
collection of dolls in 1974. Housed in a three-story brownstone she 
bought with her husband in 1938, the collection of Aunt Len's Doll 
and Toy Museum once numbered 6,000 dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were a dozen versions of Shirley Temple, Barbie,  
Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives and black dolls, which are 
now highly sought by collectors because so few were made before the 
20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	After paying a modest entrance fee that never exceeded $2,  
visitors would encounter mannequins ranging from thumb-size to two 
or three feet tall. The museum remained open until the early 1990s 
when Ms. Hoyte was no longer able to care for it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at  
Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers 
around the world.

as ``The Swamp Boogie Queen'' for her frenetic, two-fisted piano 
style, died Sunday of a heart attack. She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Kathryn Jewel Thorne, Ms. Webster first learned to play

</P>
<P>
	A young Otis Redding discovered her in 1964. She toured with him  
until his death in a 1967 plane crash that might have killed her. 
She couldn't fly because she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Devastated, Ms. Webster essentially stopped performing until the  
early 1980s, when she took Europe by storm. She became a favorite 
in the U.S. blues festival circuit and recorded on the 
Chicago-based Alligator Records label with the likes of Robert Cray 
and Bonnie Raitt.

<HEADLINE> Shutdown Ordered at Ky. DOE Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has ordered  
a one-day shutdown of a U.S. Department of Energy cleanup site in 
Paducah to check safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The order issued Wednesday is believed to be the first ever for  
a plant owned by the agency, which runs nuclear facilities 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``safety stand down'' ordered for today followed the  
completion last week of an initial visit to the site at the Paducah 
Gaseous Diffusion Plant by the agency's environment, safety and 
health team. 
</P>
<P>
	The team didn't uncover any imminent hazards to the plant's  
workers or the general public but found some room for improvement 
in radiological protection and plant operations, the DOE said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been security-related stand-downs, but this is the  
first for safety,'' said Steven Wyatt, a spokesman for the Paducah 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	All operations, except for emergency-related activities, will be  
suspended while employees and managers of the agency and of Bechtel 
Jacobs, the contractor hired by the DOE to clean up the site, 
review safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension of DOE activities at the plant won't directly  
affect operations of U.S. Enrichment Corp., which uses the plant to 
enrich uranium for use as fuel in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE investigation follows allegations that workers were  
unknowingly exposed to plutonium for many years. Plutonium has been 
linked to leukemia and other forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has said that 100,000 tons of spent  
nuclear fuel recycled at the plant from 1953 to about 1975 
contained trace amounts of plutonium. The state has said traces of 
plutonium found near the plant were in similar, insignificant 
amounts and posed no significant public risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The order drew fire Wednesday from Kentucky's two senators, Jim  
Bunning and Mitch McConnell. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like a classic case of locking the barn door after  
the horses have been stolen,'' the Republicans said in a joint 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are glad that the Department of Energy has taken this  
preliminary step to address and improve safety standards at the 
Paducah plant, we have serious concerns about how the DOE has 
handled this matter so far,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Delays Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan postponed Friday the launch of a satellite  
for monitoring weather and aircraft because of trouble with a cable 
that delivers power to the rocket, a space agency spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The launching was rescheduled for Sunday or a later date, said  
Yoichi Fujita, spokesman for the National Space Development Agency 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, engineers preparing for the firing of the H-2  
rocket that would carry the satellite into space discovered that 
the cable had fallen out of place, the agency said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable, or umbilical carrier, links the rocket to the  
fairing, a supportive structure that provides fuel, electricity and 
other materials to the rocket prior to launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's postponement was the second for the project. The  
initial launch was set for Aug. 5 but was delayed because of a 
defective part. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest launch of the multifunctional transport satellite, or  
MTSAT, had been scheduled for Friday afternoon atop Japan's H-2 
rocket from the agency's Tanegashima Space Center in southern 
Japan.

<HEADLINE> APEC Tries To Iron Out Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Top Pacific Rim officials met  
Thursday but came up with no quick answers for two pressing issues: 
What to ask for in the next big round of global trade talks and how 
to admit China to the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade officials at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit  
hope to reach agreement on proposals for cutting numerous tariffs 
charged on industrial goods, in some cases to zero, a move they 
believe would create more trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with  
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan but came up with no formula 
for getting China into the World Trade Organization, the 
Geneva-based body that governs most global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pursuing negotiations this week but there was no  
breakthrough on it one way or another,'' said a senior U.S. 
administration official, speaking to reporters early Thursday on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and Tang spent much of their 90-minute session working  
toward talks Saturday between President Clinton and Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin, the U.S. administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC trade ministers have reached consensus on parts of their  
wish list to present to the WTO at major global trade talks 
beginning Nov. 30 in Seattle, but they still faced many unresolved 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand Trade Minister Lockwood Smith told reporters the  
ministers were still trying to work out a final report for their 
leaders. He declined to elaborate on the sticking points, and other 
delegations had nothing to say to journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The APEC ministers are discussing topics ranging from forestry  
to finance. They hope, for example, to agree on proposals for 
reforming financial markets -- a topic that has resonated in the 
region since the Asian economic meltdown that began in July 1997 
and exposed many economic problems that had festered for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations about any broad trade agreements have been played  
down at the APEC summit that ends Monday, with much attention 
focused on the deteriorating political situation in East Timor, 
where Indonesia has declared martial law amid chaos that followed a 
recent independence vote.

<HEADLINE> Brewers: Miller Park Not on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers expect Miller Park to  
reverse their fortunes on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The team finally admitted Wednesday that the transformation  
won't happen on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two months after a 2,100-ton crane collapsed onto a wall  
and killed three workers at Miller Park, the Brewers said their new 
stadium's scheduled April 2000 opening will be delayed. In fact, 
the delay could be a full year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we don't have a report (from the stadium builders),  
it's a practical measure for us to acknowledge that Oct. 3 will not 
be the final game at County Stadium,'' vice president of corporate 
affairs Laurel Prieb said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel there was a practical priority of taking care of  
54,000 fans who had purchased tickets for Oct. 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A backhanded acknowledgement of the delay first came in a press  
release describing alterations in the team's plans for the 1999 
season's final game on Oct. 3, ``originally targeted to be the 
final game at County Stadium before the July 14 construction 
accident caused a delay for Miller Park's opening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was yet another blow to the Brewers franchise,  
which has endured a brutally disappointing year by every 
estimation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year has been the worst I can remember,'' infielder Jeff  
Cirillo said. ``The whole second half has been one blowup after 
another, one bad thing after another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team and the league apparently have assumed a delay would be  
inevitable. Since last month, major league baseball officials in 
New York have been conducting business under the assumption the 
Brewers will not move into Miller Park until opening day 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers have spent the last half-decade planning for the  
move, which will allow them to dramatically increase revenue and 
perhaps even escape baseball's impoverished lower class. With six 
straight losing seasons and a seventh on the way, Miller Park has 
been the beacon of light in the Brewers' dark present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day this year, no matter whether you were playing good  
or playing bad, you could see workers up there banging on 
something, and it made you feel good because you knew you were 
pushing forward,'' Cirillo said. ``Now, you don't know where your 
future lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers and the board of directors overseeing the stadium  
claim to be examining the possibility of opening the park in July 
2000, similar to the manner in which the Seattle Mariners opened 
Safeco Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the months of cleanup work still to be done and the  
logistical problems of doing construction work during a Wisconsin 
winter, an April 2001 opening would seem to be all but certain. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is 63 percent complete and 300 workers currently are  
on the site, according to the board's construction committee. Board 
chairman Frank Busalacchi said Wednesday that a decision on when to 
open Miller Park likely will come soon, possibly during the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Brewers' moving plans remain up in the air, the team  
is foundering on the field. After Wednesday's 9-1 loss to Arizona, 
Milwaukee had lost 26 of its last 37 games, including 18 of 26 
under interim manager Jim Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner and GM Sal Bando were ousted last month by  
team president Wendy Selig-Prieb. With no general manager to 
impress and no permanent manager to rally the players, morale is 
approaching rock-bottom in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to come out every day and try to hold it  
together,'' third baseman Sean Berry said. ``We try to keep 
fighting, because that's all you can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delay also will affect the team's finances. The Brewers  
figured to double their revenue in their first year in the 
ballpark, and a substantial portion of that money was to be spent 
on increasing the team's $39 million payroll, the 19th-highest 
among baseball's 30 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that money and the funds that would have been generated  
during the final days at County Stadium and the first year at 
Miller Park, Milwaukee will operate in the red for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Brewers are looking at another full campaign in  
the drafty, smelly old facility slated for demolition as soon as 
Miller Park is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of memories here for some people, but I don't  
have many, especially positive memories,'' All-Star outfielder 
Jeromy Burnitz said. ``I was looking forward to getting in the new 
stadium.''

<HEADLINE> `3rd Rock' Wins Dubious Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The American Lung Association says those  
cigar-chomping aliens on ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' really stink. 
</P>
<P>
	Displacing three-time winner ``Seinfeld,'' the NBC comedy on  
Thursday won the association's Phlemmy Award, coughed up each year 
to vilify the TV show that most glamorizes smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``3rd Rock'' episode the organization found most offensive  
featured Emmy-nominated stars John Lithgow and Kristen Johnston and 
other cast members smoking cigars in an enclosed area with 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seinfeld,'' which ended its production run in 1998 but  
continues in reruns, got a dishonorable mention this year because 
of Kramer's incessant cigar smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The association's Pink Lung Award went to TV series that were  
smoke-free in March, including ``ER,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' 
``Chicago Hope,'' ``Spin City,'' ``Home Improvement'' and ``The 
Practice.''

<HEADLINE> Pacific Rim Trade Officials At Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Halfway through their negotiations,  
senior Pacific Rim trade officials failed today to find common 
ground on a strategy for the next round of global trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade ministers made progress in the first of two days of talks  
on reducing agricultural subsidies and devised a plan for letting 
China and Taiwan take part in the next World Trade Organization 
negotiations -- even if they have yet to formally joined the global 
trade body. 
</P>
<P>
	On the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,  
U.S. trade negotiator Charlene Barshefsky and Chinese trade 
minister Shi Guangsheng discussed China's entry to WTO, trying to 
restart talks Beijing suspended in May after the bombing of its 
embassy in Belgrade by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ministers did not resolve what recommendations they will  
make to WTO for new trade talks, due to open in the United States 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Their difficulties followed two days of inconclusive talks by  
lower-level officials and put in question whether this year's APEC 
conclave would meet its key goal: devising a strong, common WTO 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	While once focused on liberalizing markets within the group,  
APEC has in recent years acted as a lobbying bloc within the 
134-member WTO. APEC members carry weight, accounting for 45 
percent of the world's trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence in East Timor, where pro-Indonesian militants have  
rampaged against supporters of independence, has drawn attention 
away from APEC's free-trade agenda this year. Officials attended a 
separate meeting today to urge Indonesia to end the violence or 
seek foreign help. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade ministers still have negotiations Friday to come up with a  
solution, before leaders of the 21 governments in APEC are to 
endorse a statement at a weekend summit. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand Trade Minister Lockwood Smith expressed optimism a  
compromise could be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that we'll be able to achieve significant  
progress,'' Smith told reporters after the first day's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade ministers were trying to reach a compromise between  
two broad approaches to the new WTO talks, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	One would be to have countries make specific early commitments  
to open markets, or parts of them. The other, known to negotiators 
as ``a single undertaking,'' would have countries open markets 
comprehensively at the conclusion of the WTO talks, due to last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC ministers are discussing trade issues ranging from forestry  
to finance and are considering cutting numerous tariffs on 
industrial goods, in some cases to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said APEC members also seemed ready to recommend  
abolishing export subsidies and some non-tariff barriers for 
agricultural goods.

<HEADLINE> Study: Alternative Schools Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A growing number of parents are taking  
advantage of educational alternatives such as charter schools 
despite little proof that they boost student performance, a new 
study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in four U.S. schoolchildren attend schools other than  
neighborhood public schools, researchers at the Policy Analysis for 
California Education said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But while school choice is on the rise, there is surprisingly  
little evidence that it improves student achievement, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury is still out,'' concluded the study by PACE, based at  
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Private school enrollment has remained at about 10 percent for  
years. But with newer options of charter schools, magnet schools, 
open enrollment and voucher programs, the alternatives -- including 
private schools -- are attracting an increasing percentage, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	School choice advocates say the real measure of achievement is  
the happiness of parents who have taken their children out of 
failing neighborhood public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Choice is really popular out there among parents, particularly  
among minority, low-income parents in districts that are not doing 
a good job,'' said Terry Moe, a political science professor at 
Stanford whose book, ``Politics, Markets and America's Schools,'' 
has been influential in the school choice movement. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the think tank's report ``unduly negative.''  
</P>
<P>
	``There is every reason to be very positive and optimistic about  
the effects of competition on public schools and on children,'' Moe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as school choice expands, a rising number of public  
districts are relying on a private school tactic -- advertising -- to 
lure pupils and the reimbursement money they bring from their home 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Private schools, of course, have long advertised, and  
privately-run public charter schools often do so. But, until school 
choice in the 1990s, there was no reason for public schools to 
advertise for students. 
</P>
<P>
	Public districts that advertise say it's just a logical  
extension of word-of-mouth promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gateway education system in Huntington, Mass., began  
advertising this year in daily and weekly newspapers in Berkshire 
County and Springfield. An ad in Wednesday's Berkshire Eagle 
announced 83 places were still open for students at five schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we promote here is a rural environment, small class size,  
a safe and nurturing environment,'' said Superintendent Don 
Nicoletti.

	ABIQUIU, N.M. (AP) -- On a plateau across the Rio Chama from this  
250-year-old Hispanic village, the stillness of the afternoon is 
pierced by a man's chanting voice. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the call to prayer heard five times a day by hundreds of  
millions the world over, the signal for Muslims to drop what they 
are doing and turn their attention to God. 
</P>
<P>
	In this pocket of rural northern New Mexico, it draws a small  
group of worshipers from the blindingly bright sunshine into the 
cool darkness of a domed-roof, adobe mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	They slip off their shoes, splash water on their hands, feet and  
faces in a tiled anteroom, then enter the main mosque. Facing east, 
toward Mecca, they pray: ``Praise be to Allah, Creator of the 
worlds ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	An increasing number of the world's religions have become part  
of the fabric of faith in largely Roman Catholic New Mexico. 
Besides Islamic mosques, there are Sikh gurdwaras and Buddhist 
stupas. And the state is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious landscape of the United States is changing  
rapidly, with temples and mosques going up from coast to coast, 
said E. Allen Richardson, author of ``Strangers in This Land: 
Pluralism and the Response to Diversity in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just in the major metropolitan areas. It's every  
place,'' said Richardson, an expert on Hinduism who teaches Eastern 
religions at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mainstream religions of the Eastern Hemisphere -- including  
Islam, often called the fastest-growing religion in the United 
States -- have become American religions, fueled by immigration over 
the past three decades, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosque near Abiquiu is part of Dar al Islam, an organization  
with a two-fold mission: to educate non-Muslims about Islam, and to 
bring Muslims together. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded 20 years ago, Dar al Islam built the North African-style  
mosque and attached madressa, or school, with the dream of starting 
a model village -- a showcase for Islam in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Anchored by a school that operated for six years in the 1980s, a  
small community of Muslim families grew at the site. But the dream 
of a self-sustaining village in rural, poor, northern New Mexico 
proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	The handful of Muslims who remained by 1989 turned the Abiquiu  
complex into a site for summer programs -- part of a nationwide 
outreach that includes workshops, conferences and training 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dar al Islam sponsors intensive religious retreats aimed  
particularly at young Muslims, to teach them about traditional 
Islam, spokesman Hakim Archuletta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Muslims in America, he said, have learned a distorted  
version of Islam. Traditional Islam is ``very universal, very 
tolerant ... not this other thing that you're seeing out there in 
the news -- politically oriented, fundamentalist, mean Islam,'' 
Archuletta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiquiu is also a site for residential programs for non-Muslim  
teachers from public and private secondary schools, who get a 
grounding in the faith and world view of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe how much I've learned in two weeks,'' said  
Renee Townley, a social studies teacher from suburban Cincinnati 
who joined 19 other teachers at an August session. ``I knew very 
little about Islam and Muslim life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A community of Sikhs, distinctive in their turbans and white  
clothing, has become a fixture in northern New Mexico since it was 
founded nearly 30 years ago. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion 
founded by a Hindu teacher in the 15th century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sikhs begin their day before 4 a.m., with 2 1/2 hours of  
prayer, yoga and meditation in the gold-domed gurdwara, or temple, 
on the outskirts of Espanola. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sikhs run a variety of thriving businesses -- a nationwide  
security firm, companies that distribute tea, cereals and herbal 
products, and computer and other consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
	The community of about 325 has become a political force in the  
state, contributing to both major parties. The annual birthday 
party for Yogi Bhajan, their spiritual and administrative leader, 
draws the governor and local congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here, and we're here long-term. We befriend everybody  
... political leaders as well as ecumenical leaders, business 
leaders,'' said spokeswoman Mukta Kaur Khalsa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sikhs are vegetarians and use no alcohol, drugs or cigarettes,  
and they teach Kundalini Yoga in local communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buddhist community in New Mexico includes immigrants from  
China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Tibet, as well as Westerners. 
Some attend services led by monks at Albuquerque temples. Some sit 
in meditation at adobe Zen centers in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Fe, on a busy commercial and residential thoroughfare,  
the spire of a stupa rises from a small oasis of grass and gardens 
strung with fluttering prayer flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in the mid 1980s by followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it's  
the site of public meditations several times a week. There is a 
resident lama, or teacher, and a bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the local Tibetan refugee community, about 100  
people, go to the stupa on special occasions, but usually gather in 
private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to establish a Tibetan cultural center for the  
community, where the young people can learn about Buddhism,'' said 
spokesman Pema Rabgay. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a common attitude within the nation's growing religious  
minorities, said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these faiths are here to stay. ... In the next century,  
we're going to be a very different people than we've been, 
religiously,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Metals Producers Reject Phelps' Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Merger partners Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. and  
Asarco Inc. said Thursday their boards of directors have rejected a 
$2.7 billion all-stock offer by Phelps Dodge Corp. to acquire both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both metals producers also urged their  
shareholders to reject the offer from Phelps, a Phoenix-based 
mining company, and to approve the planned merger between Cyprus 
Amax and Asarco. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax, based in Englewood, Colo., and New York-based  
Asarco are two of the world's leading copper and metals producers. 
They agreed in July to merge and form the nation's largest copper 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders are expected to vote on the merger Sept. 30.  
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge spokeswoman Sue Suvers said Thursday's announcement  
would not deter efforts to sell shareholders on the Phelps 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton H. Ward, chairman and chief and executive of Cyprus Amax,  
and Francis R. McAllister, chairman and CEO of Asarco, said in a 
joint statement that they rejected the offer from Phelps because it 
would not give their shareholders a fair ownership interest and it 
could raise antitrust issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely clear from Phelps Dodge's actions over the  
course of the last few weeks that it is trying to coerce Cyprus 
Amax and Asarco shareholders into a situation that is not in their 
best interests,'' they said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Casino Compromise Near in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Indian tribes and California Gov. Gray  
Davis drew closer Thursday to an agreement that would keep Indian 
casinos open, with many tribes ready to give in to the governor on 
union rights for casino workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders, under the gun to reach an agreement before the  
Legislature's 1999 session ends Friday, said Thursday that many 
tribes would agree to unionizing rights for casino workers despite 
concerns it would infringe on their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizing rights was one of the remaining hurdles for  
negotiators. Davis and labor-supportive lawmakers had insisted that 
any agreement between tribes and the state include such 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Macarro, tribal chairman of the Pechanga band in Temecula,  
said tribes may not favor mandatory union rights, but ``those who 
favor the compact have a reluctant acceptance about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes were forced to the bargaining table when the state  
Supreme Court recently overturned a 1998 voter-approved measure 
allowing a major expansion of Indian casinos. The court ruled that 
the measure allowed Nevada-style gambling banned by the state 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	As the governor and tribal leaders worked on the compact  
Thursday night, legislators were working on a proposed ballot 
measure that would let voters change the state Constitution to give 
tribes a monopoly on slots and Nevada-style blackjack games. 
</P>
<P>
	But before legislators approve the ballot measure, they and the  
Davis administration want the compact signed. A signed compact 
would let the casinos continue operating until the measure goes to 
voters in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Thursday the tribes sent Davis a proposed compact close to  
one he proposed. Both included a plan for limiting the number of 
slot machines, something many of the tribes had considered a 
roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis proposed a limit of 42,000 slot machines. The tribes'  
proposal set the bar at 43,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In both proposals, a coordinator for all the tribes would  
oversee the slot allocations and the distribution of revenues 
generated by the slot acquisitions. The revenue-sharing would 
benefit all tribes, including those without casinos.

<HEADLINE> Esprit CEO Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The chairman and chief executive officer at  
clothing maker Esprit de Corp. has resigned, the company said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Margolis, who has been leading the company since 1996, will  
leave Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in 1989, San Francisco-based Esprit had 80 stores  
and discount outlets around the country. Now it has only 20 stores 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Esprit has recently began targeting a slightly older customer --  
women aged 19 to 30 as opposed to preteens and teens -- by offering 
higher quality and slightly more expensive clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Esprit's new market niche is ``more contemporary than the Gap  
but less expensive than Banana Republic,'' said Margolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the initiative, Esprit has stabilized. Many attribute the  
success to Margolis' advertising and catalog design vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to take a brilliant brand and revive a segment  
of our industry was a great challenge,'' Margolis said. ``I have 
accomplished what I set out to achieve at Esprit and now it is time 
to move on to other pursuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say what those pursuits would be.  
</P>
<P>
	A replacement for Margolis has not been named.

<HEADLINE> Sammy Won't Sink With Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- He should be savoring the last few warm breezes  
of summer right about now, remembering the heft of history in his 
fingers, bookmarking the sights and sounds of one of the great 
closing chapters in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sammy Sosa can't. Not completely, anyway. Not while the rest  
of the ship is taking on water like the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever said that losing gets old fast must have been, like  
Sosa, trapped on a team as hopeless as the Chicago Cubs. And so, 
what seemed a short while ago to be a triumphant march toward 70 
home runs, that newly minted but still most-cherished record in 
baseball, has become a grueling crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fifth inning Thursday against Cincinnati, Sosa hit his  
59th home run of the season, leaving him on the brink of becoming 
the first slugger ever to notch two 60-homer seasons, and 
consecutive ones at that. 
</P>
<P>
	But the celebration turned out to be unmercifully brief. By the  
end of the afternoon, after the Reds climbed back to win 5-3 and 
hand the Cubs yet one more beating, the mood in the Chicago locker 
room was almost funereal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue doing my job,'' said Sosa, surrounded by  
a battery of TV cameras, ``and see what happens tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 59 was a laser beam that traveled 465 feet to the bleachers  
in dead centerfield before disappearing into the juniper bushes. It 
bought Sosa a breather from having to explain how he'd gone 
homerless the last three games -- imagine that -- but not from the 
larger debate that has sprung up around him. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, he had 21 home runs and the Cubs were in second place  
in the National League Central. Since then, Sosa raised his game to 
the point where he is on pace to hit 68 home runs this season. The 
Cubs, meanwhile, have lowered theirs to a winning percentage of 
under .300. After Thursday, they were on pace to lose 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, even though Sosa's current contract runs through  
2001, he sent a shrewdly timed message to management that he was 
interested in renegotiating. While the club remained silent, 
Chicago's two biggest daily newspapers played the debate out in the 
sports columns and the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Sosa baseball's savior or a sideshow? A team player or a  
restless opportunist? Someone who let his defense, baserunning and 
leadership lapse at the expense of his home-run totals? Would he 
look better in a halo or horns? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read the papers,'' he said. But a day earlier, in a  
reflective moment, Sosa admitted he would have exploded if the 
attention had been heaped on him 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm 30. I'm a man. I'm eating good, getting my rest,  
relaxing,'' he said. ``My first year, 1990, I hit 15 home runs with 
the White Sox and I thought I was Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are times, when he's around close friends, that he  
lets down his guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to him before the game,'' Reds shortstop Barry  
Larkin said, ``and the thing Sammy told me was that it's not the 
same because he's not playing for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That frustration was evident again the third inning when he went  
after a 3-0 offering from Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch and popped up 
weakly behind second base. Two innings after Sosa's home run, it 
bubbled to the surface again. With two out in the seventh and 
nobody on, Reds manager Jack McKeon brought in right-handed 
reliever Scott Williamson to pitch to Sosa. He chased two bad 
pitches and barely laid off a third that was a foot wide of the 
plate -- only because it was ball four. To top it off, Sosa got 
called out on strikes to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	His pal and only pursuer, Mark McGwire, isn't faring much  
better. The one-year anniversary of the big redhead's 
record-breaking 62nd homer passed Wednesday without much notice. 
McGwire, holding at 54, went 1-for-3 as the Braves completed a 
three-game sweep of the hapless Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still my friend,'' Sosa said. ``We just haven't had much  
time together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season feels so different from the last. The money hasn't  
changed and his celebrity has only grown. Sosa has his own 
endorsement label. He just bankrolled a medical center back in the 
Dominican Republic. Wherever he goes, whether it's New York or the 
Left Coast, the beautiful people stop by his locker to pay homage, 
to shake hands or press invitations into his palm. Bill Cosby 
dropped by Wrigley Field on Thursday to have Sosa tape a segment 
for his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, something is missing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to finish my job,'' Sosa said one more time, ``then  
put this all behind me.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Anticipation Mounts for Italian GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONZA, Italy (AP) -- Eddie Irvine and Rubens Barrichello are  
expecting an emotional race in Sunday's Italian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine wants to say goodbye to Ferrari fans with a victory in  
his farewell race in Italy with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrichello, driving for the Stewart-Ford team, wants to produce  
an outstanding performance at Ferrari's home track to prove he 
deserves his recently signed two-year contract with the Italian 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair will switch places next season, with Irvine becoming  
the No. 1 driver for the Stewart team under the new Jaguar label, 
and Barrichello becoming No. 2 at Ferrari, behind Michael 
Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm No. 2 because I'm joining Ferrari years after Michael, and  
because I must learn from him and from the team,'' Barrichello said 
Thursday. ``However, I'm a No. 2 with the chance of becoming No. 1. 
It's up to me to prove how good I am, that I am capable to win. 
That's the challenge I'm taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be difficult to drive with Michael ... but I got the  
best chance of my life to have a competitive car. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Sunday, before my new fans, it will be an emotional test  
for me. I'm sure I will get a lot of support, although I'll be 
driving a white (Stewart) car instead of a red (Ferrari) racer. I 
want to show well here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher has a broken leg sustained during the British GP July  
11, and won't race at Monza or in the next European GP, at 
Nurburgring, Germany, leaving Irvine to carry Ferrari's title 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, one point behind Finland's Mika Hakkinen in the  
standings with four races left, was in a buoyant mood at Monza, 
after the fast times clocked in last week's tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put a lot of pressure on McLaren in Monza, a fast  
circuit all about power and hard braking,'' Irvine said. ``It's a 
decisive race and I want to win it. It would be great for me, for 
the fans and the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, who has three victories this season following six  
winless years in Formula One, finished second to Schumacher in the 
Italian GP last year. 
</P>
<P>
	David Coulthard, winner of the last GP race, in Belgium,  
following a first-corner near-collision with teammate Hakkinen, has 
high hopes for a second straight victory to boost his title 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mathematically I have the chance to win the title,'' said  
Coulthard, third in the championship standings with 46 points. 
Hakkinen, the defending world champion, has 60 points, and Irvine 
59. 
</P>
<P>
	Free practice will be Friday and qualifying Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hoop Star Wingfield Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Former University of Cincinnati basketball  
star Dontonio Wingfield was arrested Thursday after failing to 
appear in court earlier this week for sentencing on charges of 
assaulting two suburban police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge David Davis issued an arrest  
warrant for the 25-year-old Wingfield on Tuesday. It was the second 
time Davis had done that. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Davis ordered Wingfield arrested when he failed to  
show up for a court appearance. Wingfield arrived a week late, but 
Davis threw out the arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	This time the judge wasn't so lenient. When Wingfield showed up  
Thursday, he was arrested by sheriff's deputies and taken to jail. 
He was scheduled to be back in Davis' court Friday to be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield, a native of Albany, Ga., played for the University of  
Cincinnati in the 1993-94 season. He left after his freshman year 
and played for the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics and Portland Trail 
Blazers. Portland released him last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield originally was charged with felonious assault on a  
police officer -- with a possible punishment of up to 10 years and a 
$20,000 fine -- but reached a plea agreement with prosecutors on the 
lesser offense. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, Wingfield became involved in a dispute with  
girlfriend Christina Cornett at her apartment. Police said 
Wingfield was verbally abusive, resisted arrest, and broke a finger 
and tore tendons of one officer.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. To Pull East Timor Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations prepared to evacuate  
all but a skeleton staff from East Timor amid allegations by the 
Roman Catholic Church today that anti-independence militiamen 
massacred nuns, priests and civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the U.N. compound in Dili open is vital to the world  
body's plans to shepherd East Timor to full nationhood after its 
people voted overwhelmingly on Aug. 30 for independence from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican's missionary news service FIDES said today that  
militiamen targeted members of the Catholic church. FIDES cited 
local sources as saying three priests were slain in a grenade 
attack on parish in Suai on Sept. 6. One of the three priests, Rev. 
Hilario Madeira, was well-known as an independence backer, FIDES 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIDES also said witnesses reported that 15 priests were killed  
in Dili and Baucau and some nuns were killed in Baucau. Bishop 
Basilio Do Nascimento, based in Baucau, was injured on Wednesday in 
an attack and is hiding in the forest, FIDES added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic charity group, Caritas, cited reports that  
the director of its East Timor operations, Father Francisco 
Barreto, had been killed by army-backed militiamen in Dare. Other 
Caritas workers were also feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will eventually know their fate,'' Caritas Australia  
spokeswoman Ann Wigglesworth told Sky News television. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Taur Matan Ruak, the field commander of  
pro-independence guerrillas, told Portuguese state radio RDP that 
militias killed at least 32 civilians, including two children, in a 
wave of attacks on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruak said 12 people, including two children, were shot to death  
in Ermera and 19 were killed in Liquisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The persecution and capture of civilians is continuing,'' Ruak  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, officials held nonstop  
meetings about the crisis. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas meet a 
high-level U.N. delegation but again rejected demands for U.N. 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie was buffeted by reports that the military  
had encroached on his powers, sending the stock market and currency 
into a nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, an Australian air force C-130 transport plane flew in a  
new round of supplies this morning. Telephone services and water 
supplies were also restored to the U.N. compound. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials said about 40 to 50 U.N. staff, including police  
and military liaison officers, will stay behind when another 150 
U.N. international workers and 167 local staff members are to be 
evacuated on Friday by the Australian air force. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, U.N. mission chief Ian Martin said the  
Indonesian military would secure the exit route while the 
Australian armed forces would maintain security at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the security situation had improved but was still  
dangerous in Dili today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of the city is a disgrace with significant numbers  
of militia members still roaming the streets with impunity,'' he 
said. ``Dili is a ghost town which not very much left to loot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses at the U.N. compound said shots echoed nearby at  
sunset. Army personnel had also lit fires near its perimeter and 
several stun grenades had been let off. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is scrambling to find ways to protect several  
hundred panic-stricken refugees who had streamed into the compound 
over the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers Wednesday night opened fire on about 300  
refugees who had fled from a school next door to the U.N. compound, 
and ran into the surrounding hills. It was not known whether anyone 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hid behind a big rock because we couldn't go any further.  
There was so much shooting. But others got away when the soldiers 
came up the hill,'' said a teen-age girl who identified herself 
only as Shanti. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the Indonesian army promised to help relocate the  
remaining refugees to a new camp at Dare, about 6 miles south of 
Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor plummeted into lawlessness after Saturday's  
announcement that an overwhelming majority of voters approved 
independence. The announcement triggered a wild and violent 
backlash from the militias opposed to independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The father of rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao,  
Manuel Gusmao, was killed by pro-Jakarta loyalist militias, 
according to a report by the Portuguese news agency Lusa that was 
confirmed by a Gusmao aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, widely expected to become the first president of an  
independent East Timor, has taken refuge in the British Embassy in 
Jakarta after being freed from a prison on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees continued to pour into neighboring West Timor, escaping  
the violence.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for 1965 Car Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who was convicted of planting a bomb that  
killed a champion horsewoman more than three decades ago was 
sentenced Thursday to 100 to 300 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	However, James Blottiaux, 55, could be paroled after serving 8 1/2  
years under a now-defunct Illinois law in effect at the time of the 
crime. Prosecutors said that was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	Blottiaux, a one-time truck driver and body shop worker accused  
of being a paid killer, was convicted in July of murder and arson 
in the 1965 car bombing that killed Cheryl Lynn Rude. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Blottiaux was hired by the late horseman Silas  
Jayne to kill Jayne's brother and rival, George Jayne. Blottiaux 
planted a dynamite bomb in George Jayne's Cadillac and did not stop 
Ms. Rude, who rode at Jayne's stables, from getting in and starting 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Blottiaux had been investigated for years, but prosecutors did  
not charge him until 1997, after uncovering evidence against him in 
a larger probe of crimes in the suburban horse world. 
</P>
<P>
	George Jayne was shot to death while playing cards in 1970.  
Silas Jayne was convicted of conspiring to kill him, served eight 
years in prison and died of leukemia in 1987.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. To Pull East Timor Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The United Nations prepared to evacuate  
all but a skeleton staff from East Timor amid allegations by the 
Roman Catholic Church today that anti-independence militiamen 
massacred nuns, priests and civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the U.N. compound in Dili open is vital to the world  
body's plans to shepherd East Timor to full nationhood after its 
people voted overwhelmingly on Aug. 30 for independence from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican's missionary news service FIDES said today that  
militiamen targeted members of the Catholic church. FIDES cited 
local sources as saying three priests were slain in a grenade 
attack on parish in Suai on Sept. 6. One of the three priests, Rev. 
Hilario Madeira, was well-known as an independence backer, FIDES 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIDES also said witnesses reported that 15 priests were killed  
in Dili and Baucau and some nuns were killed in Baucau. Bishop 
Basilio Do Nascimento, based in Baucau, was injured on Wednesday in 
an attack and is hiding in the forest, FIDES added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic charity group, Caritas, cited reports that  
the director of its East Timor operations, Father Francisco 
Barreto, had been killed by army-backed militiamen in Dare. Other 
Caritas workers were also feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will eventually know their fate,'' Caritas Australia  
spokeswoman Ann Wigglesworth told Sky News television. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Taur Matan Ruak, the field commander of  
pro-independence guerrillas, told Portuguese state radio RDP that 
militias killed at least 32 civilians, including two children, in a 
wave of attacks on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruak said 12 people, including two children, were shot to death  
in Ermera and 19 were killed in Liquisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The persecution and capture of civilians is continuing,'' Ruak  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, officials held nonstop  
meetings about the crisis. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas meet a 
high-level U.N. delegation but again rejected demands for U.N. 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie was buffeted by reports that the military  
had encroached on his powers, sending the stock market and currency 
into a nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, an Australian air force C-130 transport plane flew in a  
new round of supplies this morning. Telephone services and water 
supplies were also restored to the U.N. compound. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials said about 40 to 50 U.N. staff, including police  
and military liaison officers, will stay behind when another 150 
U.N. international workers and 167 local staff members are to be 
evacuated on Friday by the Australian air force. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, U.N. mission chief Ian Martin said the  
Indonesian military would secure the exit route while the 
Australian armed forces would maintain security at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the security situation had improved but was still  
dangerous in Dili today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of the city is a disgrace with significant numbers  
of militia members still roaming the streets with impunity,'' he 
said. ``Dili is a ghost town which not very much left to loot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses at the U.N. compound said shots echoed nearby at  
sunset. Army personnel had also lit fires near its perimeter and 
several stun grenades had been let off. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is scrambling to find ways to protect several  
hundred panic-stricken refugees who had streamed into the compound 
over the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers Wednesday night opened fire on about 300  
refugees who had fled from a school next door to the U.N. compound, 
and ran into the surrounding hills. It was not known whether anyone 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hid behind a big rock because we couldn't go any further.  
There was so much shooting. But others got away when the soldiers 
came up the hill,'' said a teen-age girl who identified herself 
only as Shanti. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the Indonesian army promised to help relocate the  
remaining refugees to a new camp at Dare, about 6 miles south of 
Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor plummeted into lawlessness after Saturday's  
announcement that an overwhelming majority of voters approved 
independence. The announcement triggered a wild and violent 
backlash from the militias opposed to independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The father of rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao,  
Manuel Gusmao, was killed by pro-Jakarta loyalist militias, 
according to a report by the Portuguese news agency Lusa that was 
confirmed by a Gusmao aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, widely expected to become the first president of an  
independent East Timor, has taken refuge in the British Embassy in 
Jakarta after being freed from a prison on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees continued to pour into neighboring West Timor, escaping  
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 people were crammed into one camp just outside the  
provincial capital, Kupang, badly straining resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of people may have been killed,'' said refugee  
Yossmina Katu. ``There were lots of areas of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evident in the camps were swaggering members of the Aitarak

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested for Burning Teen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Calif. (AP) -- A man and his 15-year-old stepson are  
being held without bail in connection with the burning death of a 
teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, whose identity was withheld, and 36-year-old Michael  
Crosby were arrested Wednesday at their Norwalk home, about 15 
miles southeast of Los Angeles, and booked for investigation of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	They could be arraigned as early as today, said Sgt. Norine  
Plett of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of girl, believed to be between 13 and 17 years  
old, is unknown. She was apparently doused with a flammable liquid 
and set on fire outside a machine shop in nearby Whittier on July 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors who reported hearing screams coming from the flames  
alerted authorities, and firefighters found her body in a heap of 
flaming shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Plett said a neighbor of Crosby's led police to him. Crosby, who  
has a criminal record, initially was jailed Wednesday on a 
probation violation but was booked for investigation of murder 
following further investigation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	No other details were released.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had no motive for the killing and said Crosby and  
his stepson apparently had no relationship with the victim.

<HEADLINE> Burtons Start 1st, 3rd at Autolite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Jeff and Ward Burton, the Virginia brothers  
who finished 1-2 in last week's Southern 500 at Darlington, will 
start bumper to bumper again in Friday night's Autolite Platinum 
250 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series race. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton, who led his brother across the finish line for the  
second time in the Winston Cup series last weekend, posted a fast 
lap of 121.984 mph to earn his first Busch Grand National pole of 
the season and seventh of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell a real good lap from a good lap. I'm pretty  
proud of this,'' Jeff Burton said. ``When we qualify well, that's 
unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Green, third in the driver standings, was second at 121.907  
mph on the three-quarter-mile oval, and Ward Burton was third at 
121.841 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew my first lap was good and I knew I had to get a good  
first lap in,'' Green said. ``Hopefully we can outrun those Cup 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Series points leader and defending race champion Dale Earnhardt  
Jr. qualified 20th at 120.714 mph, and second-place Matt Kenseth 
was 29th at 120.482. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to get into race trim and see what we've got,''  
said Earnhardt, who dominated this race a year ago, leading the 
last 154 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've struggled since we got here and I don't know what's  
really wrong,'' Kenseth said after his run. ``This probably won't 
get us in on the first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With seven races left in the season, Kenseth trails Earnhardt by  
26 points and Green is another 190 back despite missing the second 
race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the career leader with 39 BGN victories, qualified  
fourth at 121.764 mph, even after a first lap that he said 
``stunk.'' Todd Bodine will start fifth after touring Richmond 
International Raceway at 121.709 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is the career leader with five BGN victories at Richmond,  
and he's also won five of his 10 starts in the series this year, 
including last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Winston Cup regulars who attempted to qualify included  
Jimmy Spencer, who was seventh; Ken Schrader, who was 17th; and 
Kenny Wallace, who was 22nd.

<HEADLINE> Sammy Won't Sink With Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- He should be savoring the last few warm breezes  
of summer right about now, remembering the heft of history in his 
fingers, bookmarking the sights and sounds of one of the great 
closing chapters in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sammy Sosa can't. Not completely, anyway. Not while the rest  
of the ship is taking on water like the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever said that losing gets old fast must have been, like  
Sosa, trapped on a team as hopeless as the Chicago Cubs. And so, 
what seemed a short while ago to be a triumphant march toward 70 
home runs, that newly minted but still most-cherished record in 
baseball, has become a grueling crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fifth inning Thursday against Cincinnati, Sosa hit his  
59th home run of the season, leaving him on the brink of becoming 
the first slugger ever to notch two 60-homer seasons, and 
consecutive ones at that. 
</P>
<P>
	But the celebration turned out to be unmercifully brief. By the  
end of the afternoon, after the Reds climbed back to win 5-3 and 
hand the Cubs yet one more beating, the mood in the Chicago locker 
room was almost funereal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue doing my job,'' said Sosa, surrounded by  
a battery of TV cameras, ``and see what happens tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 59 was a laser beam that traveled 465 feet to the bleachers  
in dead centerfield before disappearing into the juniper bushes. It 
bought Sosa a breather from having to explain how he'd gone 
homerless the last three games -- imagine that -- but not from the 
larger debate that has sprung up around him. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 9, he had 21 home runs and the Cubs were in second place  
in the National League Central. Since then, Sosa raised his game to 
the point where he is on pace to hit 68 home runs this season. The 
Cubs, meanwhile, have lowered theirs to a winning percentage of 
under .300. After Thursday, they were on pace to lose 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, even though Sosa's current contract runs through  
2001, he sent a shrewdly timed message to management that he was 
interested in renegotiating. While the club remained silent, 
Chicago's two biggest daily newspapers played the debate out in the 
sports columns and the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Sosa baseball's savior or a sideshow? A team player or a  
restless opportunist? Someone who let his defense, baserunning and 
leadership lapse at the expense of his home-run totals? Would he 
look better in a halo or horns? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read the papers,'' he said. But a day earlier, in a  
reflective moment, Sosa admitted he would have exploded if the 
attention had been heaped on him 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm 30. I'm a man. I'm eating good, getting my rest,  
relaxing,'' he said. ``My first year, 1990, I hit 15 home runs with 
the White Sox and I thought I was Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are times, when he's around close friends, that he  
lets down his guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to him before the game,'' Reds shortstop Barry  
Larkin said, ``and the thing Sammy told me was that it's not the 
same because he's not playing for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That frustration was evident again the third inning when he went  
after a 3-0 offering from Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch and popped up 
weakly behind second base. Two innings after Sosa's home run, it 
bubbled to the surface again. With two out in the seventh and 
nobody on, Reds manager Jack McKeon brought in right-handed 
reliever Scott Williamson to pitch to Sosa. He chased two bad 
pitches and barely laid off a third that was a foot wide of the 
plate -- only because it was ball four. To top it off, Sosa got 
called out on strikes to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	His pal and only pursuer, Mark McGwire, isn't faring much  
better. The one-year anniversary of the big redhead's 
record-breaking 62nd homer passed Wednesday without much notice. 
McGwire, holding at 54, went 1-for-3 as the Braves completed a 
three-game sweep of the hapless Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still my friend,'' Sosa said. ``We just haven't had much  
time together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season feels so different from the last. The money hasn't  
changed and his celebrity has only grown. Sosa has his own 
endorsement label. He just bankrolled a medical center back in the 
Dominican Republic. Wherever he goes, whether it's New York or the 
Left Coast, the beautiful people stop by his locker to pay homage, 
to shake hands or press invitations into his palm. Bill Cosby 
dropped by Wrigley Field on Thursday to have Sosa tape a segment 
for his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, something is missing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to finish my job,'' Sosa said one more time, ``then  
put this all behind me.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 43.06 at 11,079.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher today as a late rally  
lifted a market that had sputtered for much of the day amid worries 
about a sinking dollar and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 43.06 at 11,079.40. Broader stock indicators also 
ended higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet and technology companies were the strongest performers  
in a relatively quiet, flat market. IBM helped the Dow contain its 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo rose after Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the stock  
to ``outperform'' from ``neutral.'' And online auctioneer eBay rose 
after CIBC World Market launched coverage with a ``strong buy'' 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	But for much of the session, the broader market languished due  
to the dollar's continuing decline against the Japanese yen. After 
the Japanese government released a stronger-than-expected report on 
the nation's economic growth, the dollar fell to 107.67 yen, down 
from 110.76 yen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report and the rising value of the yen helped push  
Japan's Nikkei stock average 0.2 percent higher. Weakness in the 
dollar has been a persistent undercurrent in the U.S. stock market 
in recent weeks, as improving economies in Asia and Europe attract 
investors who previously sought out U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak dollar also makes imports more expensive, laying the  
ground for price inflation. That threat further unsettled 
investors, who are already worried that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates for a third time this year in its effort to 
quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington today, the Labor Department reported the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell 
unexpectedly last week to 286,000. Any level below 300,000 is 
considered a sign of an extremely tight labor market, potentially 
adding to the Fed's concerns that wage pressures are escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably stay in a holding pattern until more data  
comes out,'' Battipaglia said. ``Each bit of economic data is 
important as people try to figure out what the Fed is going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next key figure, the Producer Price Index, is scheduled for  
release Friday morning, and analysts say any surprise in the data 
could shake stocks out of their narrow trading range. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was a fairly neutral session as people wait for the  
PPI,'' said Dan Ascani, president and research director at Global 
Market Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, Ga. ``The fixation on the 
numbers has deterred a lot of people from making any big moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were mostly lower, due largely to the interest  
rate fears. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products dropped amid reports the company is  
facing a federal investigation involving the government's 1996 
approval of the drug Redux. American Home Products has already seen 
its share price battered as the company faces thousands of civil 
lawsuits over its diet drugs, which have been linked to heart valve 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 3.51 to 1,347.66, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 43.29 to 
2,852.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were just even with decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, with 1,480 up, 1,478 down and 571 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 766.93 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
779.23 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.87 to 437.77.

<HEADLINE> Hunter Said To Exude Honesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Catfish Hunter's blue eyes brimmed with tears  
last spring as he spoke about wishing he could trade his fame and 
fortune for a life of anonymity, good health and a chance to see 
his grandchildren grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be a groundskeeper and not let anybody know me,'' he said,  
his strong, gravelly voice cracking as we looked at each other in 
the privacy of a small room at the New York Yankees' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter wasn't simply speaking out of a fear of death from Lou  
Gehrig's disease. Everyone who knew him understood that he had 
always put family and faith above fame, had always gotten his 
priorities right. 
</P>
<P>
	It hurts to write about Hunter in the past tense, to realize  
this great athlete, this genuinely decent man, is gone so soon. 
</P>
<P>
	There are plenty of scoundrels and fools in sports, plenty of  
phony heroes, but Hunter wasn't one of them. He exuded the kind of 
honesty and integrity that is instantly recognizable, and he had a 
sense of humor and an easy way of telling stories that made people 
like him right away. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the richest ballplayer of his time, a groundbreaker for  
all the big bucks thrown at athletes these days. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as former New York teammate and current Seattle manager Lou  
Piniella told me recently, ``If you didn't know he was making that 
kind of money, you'd never guess it because he was humble, very 
reserved about being a star-type player. ... If you didn't like 
Catfish, you just didn't like people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if you never met Hunter, it was easy to like him as a  
player. He was the consummate professional, ``a big-game pitcher,'' 
as the expression goes. 
</P>
<P>
	I first met him when he pitched for the Oakland Athletics in the  
early '70s, playing on a ballclub that was as wild as it was 
successful. Stories about all-night escapades and pranks were 
already legendary, and Hunter was in the middle of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when manager Dick Williams handed him the ball and his  
teammates took the field behind him, they all knew Hunter could be 
relied upon to give them a good chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter brought those qualities to the Yankees, and he helped  
turn that fractious team of Billy Martin, Reggie Jackson, Thurman 
Munson and Graig Nettles into a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be 50 years old,'' Hunter said, thinking  
back on those days of pranks and parties. ``I thought I'd die 
before then. Because ballplayers when I played ball loved to have a 
good time, go out together. I loved it. I think the guys today 
don't have as much fun as we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The essence of Hunter's game was control, a mastery of fastballs  
thrown at different speeds, sliders and curveballs that kept 
batters guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	He had learned how to pitch while throwing to his brother on the  
family farm in North Carolina. Even in those early sessions he 
sought control over raw speed, in no small part because he didn't 
want to splinter the side of his father's smoking shed where he 
practiced. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter drew his life's lessons from baseball and the farm, and  
both contributed to his strength of character. From baseball, he 
learned to filter out distractions and worries, to focus on the 
moment. From raising cotton, peanuts, corn and soybeans, he learned 
to cope with the vagaries of the weather and the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as anything about the disease that led to his death,  
Hunter resented the loss of control it imposed on his life. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to give up hunting and give away his beloved dogs that he  
had named after former teammates. He had to rely on his wife, 
Helen, to dress him and feed him. He hated feeling as if he were a 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
	He had always been so strong, but by the time we spoke at the  
Yankees' camp he couldn't even sign his autograph for a young boy 
who approached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Hunter never lost faith, never questioned why he was singled  
out for this struggle, because to do so would mean questioning why 
he had been so blessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who knew him and reflect now on his life -- his Hall of  
Fame career, his five World Series rings, his humor, warmth, 
integrity and class -- know they, too, were blessed.

<HEADLINE> Missing Alzheimer's Patient Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- An Alzheimer's disease patient was found  
in a storage room at the nursing home where he lived, four days 
after his disappearance triggered a search by police and vigils by 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward Baker, 81, was dehydrated and suffering from bedsores when  
he was found Wednesday. He was transported from Sherwood Place 
nursing home to a hospital where he was in fair condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the nursing home insisted they performed a  
thorough search for Baker, who has difficulty walking and is 
generally confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tremendous shock, very traumatic,'' Baker's wife,  
Eleanore, said. ``He doesn't seem to know where he was or what 
happened to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While police continued investigating the disappearance, Ms.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Firms Settle Piracy Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. has agreed to pay  
$350,000 to an alliance of software developers to settle piracy 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Business Software Alliance, a Washington-based watchdog  
group, said Thursday the claims were related to unlicensed copies 
of programs installed on computers that belonged to Stone Container 
Corp. before its recent merger with Jefferson Smurfit Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not immediately return telephone calls  
Thursday morning. But in a statement released by the Business 
Software Alliance, a Smurfit-Stone official said the firm was now 
in full compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smurfit itself has always been careful to ensure that it owned  
an adequate number of licenses to support all of the software 
installed on its computers,'' Jim Hayssen, vice president of 
information technology for Smurfit-Stone, said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Jefferson Smurfit Corp. merged with Stone Container Corp.  
last fall, we became aware of licensing deficiencies at many of its 
plants and offices spread throughout the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Business Software Alliance has collected about $40 million  
in fines from U.S. companies illegally pirating software over the 
past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The unlicensed software at Stone Container was brought to the  
group's attention by a phone call to its anti-piracy hotline.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Looks to This Writer for Wit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bruce Vilanch is the man of a million punch  
lines, the wisenheimer of the Emmys and Oscars, the gag writer who 
delivers wit on demand like a Pez dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer on this weekend's Emmy broadcast, Vilanch has had a  
hand in crafting memorably funny moments on countless awards and 
variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the guy who gave Billy Crystal this line during the  
Oscars: ``A billion people are watching us tonight, except Linda 
Tripp, who's taping it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Whoopi Goldberg said this about Los Angeles -- ``L.A. If you  
can't be a star, at least you can be a star witness'' -- that was 
Vilanch's line. 
</P>
<P>
	He supplied Roseanne with this wisecrack on true-to-life Barbie  
dolls: ``I'm waiting for Trailer Court Barbie and Eating Disorder 
Barbie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilanch and Crystal also created the musical number for a Oscar  
broadcast in which Crystal sang: ``Those eyes, those thighs, 
surprise! It's `The Crying Game.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Vilanch has gotten screen time as a regular on  
``Hollywood Squares,'' for which he is head writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week comes ``Get Bruce!'', a documentary about Vilanch's  
role as hired hip man for the stars. The film opens Sept. 17 in Los 
Angeles, New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie follows his career as an entertainment reporter for  
the Chicago Tribune in the early 1970s, a humorist for TV programs 
such as ``The Brady Bunch Variety Hour'' in the late '70s and 
writer for almost every awards show in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	His credits include the Grammys, the Tonys, the Daytime Emmys  
and the People's Choice, American Comedy and World Music awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm down to the American Bulimia Awards,'' Vilanch, a tubby  
figure with shaggy blond hair and beard, said in an interview. 
``There's nothing else left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Sunday's Emmys, he is writing for hosts David Hyde Pierce  
and Jenna Elfman and preparing lines for nominees who want 
something funny to say in case they win. 
</P>
<P>
	When the idea for the documentary arose, ``I was kind of  
amazed,'' Vilanch said. ``How many people get a documentary made 
about them? It's me, and Hitler and Gandhi and R. Crumb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Get Bruce!'' showcases his work preparing Crystal and Ms.  
Goldberg to emcee the Oscars, including material that wound up on 
the cutting-room floor. 
</P>
<P>
	To spoof Oliver Stone's ``JFK,'' Vilanch and Crystal pondered a  
number to the ``Fiddler on the Roof'' tune ``Tradition'': ``A 
gunman on the knoll? Sounds crazy, I know. But Oliver Stone might 
say every one of us is a suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie features stars Vilanch has worked with, including Lily  
Tomlin, Nathan Lane, Robin Williams, Raquel Welch and Steven 
Seagal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give great mind,'' Williams tells Vilanch.  
</P>
<P>
	Lane says of Vilanch: ``He's given more great lines to  
celebrities than a Hollywood coke dealer.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Heading Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is heading overseas for a  
week just as the GOP-controlled Congress resumes work with promises 
to confront him with their $792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's promise in return -- to veto the package as  
irresponsible -- probably will have to wait until he concludes a 
week of political and economic diplomacy in South Asia. He returns 
to Washington on Sept. 16 and likely will find the tax cut 
legislation on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
	All week, as Clinton prepared to leave for New Zealand, he  
worked criticism of the tax cut into speeches on education, welfare 
and crime. He contends the package would waste an expected budget 
surplus and force a return to deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering a reporter's question on the subject Thursday, Clinton  
took a last shot before leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know good and well I'm not going sign this bill. It's  
wrong for America. It's bad for the economy,'' he said. At the same 
time, Clinton said there is some room for negotiation. ``It's up to 
them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, he was off for Auckland and a meeting Saturday that  
the White House hopes will produce a trade breakthrough with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the eve  
of a summit of Pacific Rim leaders -- the two leaders' first meeting 
in 15 months. Since then, relations plummeted on allegations of 
Chinese spying and theft of U.S. nuclear secrets, the U.S. bombing 
of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia and tensions between China and 
rival Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks aimed at allowing China's entry into the World Trade  
Organization stalled after NATO's bombing of the embassy on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House before his departure, Clinton said  
the United States has tried to mend fences since the ``terrible 
accident'' in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would very much like to resume the WTO negotiations. I think  
it would be good for China, good for the United States and good for 
the world economic system,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also applauded economic progress in Japan, which he called a  
boon for the world economy. ``They're doing better and I'm real 
pleased about it. I think the world should be pleased about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will meet jointly Sunday with Presidents Keizo Obuchi of  
Japan and Kim Dae-jung of South Korea, discussing North Korea's 
suspected preparations to test a long-range ballistic missile. 
Clinton also will meet with Russia's new prime minister, Vladimir 
Putin, on the heels of new allegations about Russian corruption and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Sunday, Clinton will join leaders for the opening talks of  
the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). 
</P>
<P>
	After the conclusion of the APEC meeting, Clinton will fly to  
Queenstown on Tuesday for a day of rest. On Wednesday, the 
president will travel to Christchurch, a southern city that is the 
starting point for most American expeditions to the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
	He will speak at the Antarctica Center about efforts to protect  
the global environment. The president also will meet with New 
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and opposition leader Helen 
Clarke. He also is to attend a black-tie dinner given by Shipley 
before a late takeoff for home. En route to Washington, Clinton 
will stop in Hawaii again for refueling and a day of golf.

<HEADLINE> Student Pleads Guilty to Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty today to  
fatally shooting a teacher at a middle school graduation dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Wurst's plea to a third-degree murder charge spares the  
teen-ager the mandatory life sentence a first-degree murder 
conviction would have carried. Under Pennsylvania law, Wurst could 
not have been sentenced to death because he was younger than 16 
when science teacher John Gillette was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had been scheduled to begin next month.  
</P>
<P>
	Gillette, 48, was killed in April 1998 at a James W. Parker  
Middle School graduation dance at a banquet hall in Edinboro. Two 
students were wounded. It was one of a series of school-related 
shootings that shocked the nation that spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's lawyers had not disputed that he fired the shots, but  
said he was insane. The boy was 14 and in the eighth grade at the 
time of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst has been held in the Erie County Jail since the shooting,  
except for a few weeks last fall when he was sent to a state 
hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-degree murder -- which state law defines as an  
unpremeditated killing with malice -- carries a maximum sentence of 
20 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst also pleaded guilty to attempted homicide and assault  
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst would be eligible for a separate unit at a state prison  
for inmates younger than 18 who have been convicted as adults. That 
unit is part of the state prison at Houtzdale, in central 
Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI Checking Redux Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products Corp., already the  
subject of thousands of civil lawsuits over its diet drugs, now may 
be involved in a federal investigation involving the government's 
1996 approval of the drug Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been interviewing  
employees for the Food and Drug Administration about the 
controversial approval of the drug, according to published reports 
by the Wall Street Journal and the Newark Star-Ledger. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are focusing on whether AHP and other companies  
told the FDA everything they knew about adverse reactions to Redux 
and other diet drugs during the approval process. During the FDA 
deliberations, AHP advised Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron 
Pharmaceuticals, which has the U.S. rights to Redux and had joined 
with AHP to market and produce the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Redux and its predecessor Pondimin, both part of the  
``fen-phen'' diet drug combination, were pulled from the market in 
1997 after being linked to heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made yet about whether there will be a  
formal criminal inquiry, the Journal said, citing an unidentified 
federal agent. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI and FDA officials would not confirm or comment on the  
investigation to either newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to The Associated Press Wednesday evening, AHP  
senior vice president and general counsel Louis Hoynes said the 
company was ``absolutely unaware of any investigation by the U.S. 
Department of Justice or the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
relating to diet drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoynes added that the company knew of ``no such basis for such  
an investigation and we are confident that American Home Products' 
actions concerning Pondmin and Redux were lawful and appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the Journal report, AHP attorney Marc Farley said  
such preliminary investigations often lead nowhere and should be 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agents can look into anything,'' said Farley, a former  
assistant U.S. attorney who worked on health fraud cases for 
several years. ``I just think it's very unfair to anybody -- whether 
it's a company or an individual -- to have this kind of (public) 
exposure when law enforcement is looking at them in a preliminary 
capacity without the need for showing any probable cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Interneuron spokesman told the Journal the company had not  
been contacted by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA advisory committee initially rejected approval of Redux  
in 1995 over safety concerns before reversing itself the following 
year, believing that its benefits for the drugs' target market -- 
the clinically obese -- outweighed the risks. The FDA subsequently 
approved Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	Redux and Pondimin were taken off the market in September 1997  
at the request of the FDA after some users developed heart-valve 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, AHP has faced thousands of civil suits involving  
patients who died or suffered heart valve damage or developed a 
rare but often fatal lung disorder called primary pulmonary 
hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texas jury awarded $23 million last month to a woman who sued  
AHP, blaming fen-phen for her heart problems. Lawyers had argued 
that American Home hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart 
valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP is currently facing a class-action lawsuit in New Jersey  
from residents who are healthy but want money for a lifetime of 
medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	A government investigation would be the latest in a string of  
setbacks for AHP. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AHP recalled more than 500,000 emergency injection  
kits for treating severe allergic reactions and asthma attacks 
because the medicines might lose potency too soon. AHP also agreed 
to pay a reported $50 million-plus to settle claims from 36,000 
women who complained that Norplant caused headaches, irregular 
menstrual bleeding, nausea and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The company this summer suspended shipments of a childhood  
diarrhea vaccine after it was linked to bowel obstruction in 32 
infants. And last year, American Home recalled the painkiller 
Duract after it caused fatal liver problems.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Won't OK Budget Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top congressional Republicans said Thursday  
they will not engage President Clinton in budget summit talks this 
year because he would insist on higher spending in exchange for the 
GOP's cherished tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not prepared to trade with the president with the  
American people's money, a spending buck for me, a tax reduction 
for you,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	While not ruling out that Republicans themselves will break  
budget limits to help push the coming fiscal year's spending bills 
through Congress, Armey renewed the GOP's pledge to use Social 
Security surpluses solely to reduce the $5.6 trillion national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to let one dime of Social Security money be  
spent'' to expand other federal programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to give a little and take a little,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a Senate GOP leader. ``But we're going 
to have to protect Social Security, that's a must.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks partly reflect Republicans' distaste for high-level  
budget bargaining with Clinton and distrust of him. Many 
Republicans think Clinton has outfoxed them in past talks, and 
there is also resentment about decisions being made by a handful of 
GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments also underline the GOP's goal of casting this  
autumn's budget battle as their desire to protect Social Security 
vs. Clinton's plans for higher spending. Republicans say they will 
win the public relations war if voters view the budget fight that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Republicans rallied behind Social Security, their  
leaders were all but abandoning hope of achieving a major tax cut 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Wednesday,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Thursday that Clinton's 
virtually certain veto of the GOP's $792 billion, 10-year tax cut 
will probably end this year's legislative battling over taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our one chance to do that,'' Hastert told reporters.  
He cited the difficulty of pushing a second tax package through 
Congress during this session's dwindling weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey and others insisted that their August strategy of staging  
hundreds of town meetings talking up tax cuts had worked. 
</P>
<P>
	But few opinion polls reflect much public interest in tax  
reductions. And about 10 conservative Democrats from districts 
where the popularity of tax cuts would be likeliest to appear said 
their voters prefer using surpluses for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has emphasized his preference to use budget surpluses to  
reduce the national debt, provide Medicare prescription drugs and 
expand other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax plan passed by the Republican leadership would not  
permit these priorities to be pursued,'' he told mayors and police 
chiefs visiting the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	No one believes the budget showdown will cause a shutdown of  
federal agencies, as occurred in 1995 and 1996. But short of using 
Social Security surpluses, it is unclear where GOP leaders will 
find enough money to push all 13 fiscal 2000 spending bills through 
Congress, let alone get Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bills finance agency budgets. So far lawmakers have  
sent just two of the measures to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 2000 begins on Oct. 1, just three weeks away. By then,  
GOP leaders plan to send Clinton a stopgap bill temporarily 
financing agencies while the two sides work through their spending 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton wants more than $20 billion in spending beyond  
initial GOP plans. Even many Republicans want billions more for 
favorite programs, such as the $7 billion emergency package for 
farmers passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to bridge some of the gap with the $14 billion  
non-Social Security surplus expected for next year. They had 
planned to use $5 billion of it for the tax bill, but Clinton's 
veto will let that portion be used for spending instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending any of that money will bust spending limits enacted in  
the 1997 budget-balancing law. GOP leaders have long conceded that 
those funds will be used, but they will need billions more. 
Republican lawmakers and aides are scouring the budget for spending 
they can cut or delay. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress worked through spending bills:  
</P>
<P>
	--The House neared approval of a $92 billion measure financing  
housing, veterans and environmental programs. The White House has 
promised to veto it because of insufficient spending. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Democrats blocked a GOP effort to cut mass transit aid  
to New York and California as part of a $49 billion transportation 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--Facing Democratic opposition, Senate Republicans set aside an  
effort to prevent the Clinton administration from raising royalties 
paid by oil companies drilling on public lands.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Introduces HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of House Republicans introduced their  
version of HMO legislation Thursday, expressing frustration with 
GOP leaders who have not endorsed their bill or offered a patient 
rights alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to happen whether the leadership decides they like  
this bill or not,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., whose bill 
allows new lawsuits against HMOs but only under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP lawmakers suggested they would sign on with Democrats to  
force the issue to the floor if Republican leaders do not agree to 
support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that can hurt us politically,'' said Rep.  
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``I hope our leadership got the message. Do 
the math. They're losing control of this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, with a slim majority in the House, are struggling  
to develop a strategy for addressing patient rights in the era of 
restrictive health maintenance organizations and other managed care 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP hold 222 seats in the 435-member House, with 211  
Democrats and an independent who usually votes with the Democrats; 
there is one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, 20 Republicans have signed onto legislation  
co-sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Charles Norwood, 
R-Ga. That bill is backed by Democratic leaders and President 
Clinton, and appears to have more than enough support to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Searching for an alternative, House Speaker Dennis Hastert asked  
Coburn and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., to write a Republican bill. 
Hastert, R-Ill., promised to bring it to the House floor in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair expected Hastert to endorse that bill, which they  
introduced Thursday. He has not done so and has not articulated his 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg planned to meet Friday with Hastert and other  
GOP leaders. Still, there was clear frustration Thursday that after 
a month's recess, Hastert was not with them at their news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn said he planned to use Friday's meeting to explain the  
``political realities'' to the party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's spokesman, John Feehrey, responded that the speaker is  
``still committed to working on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker has been working on this issue for many years,''  
he said. ``It's a difficult issue that requires a delicate 
balancing act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Coburn and Shadegg tries to offer something for  
those wanting to allow patients to sue HMOs who deny them care and 
those concerned that more lawsuits will drive up the cost of health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow lawsuits, but only in federal court and  
only if a patient first has gone through the health plan's review 
process. Patients also would have to take their cases to more 
doctors who would assess a patient's injury and determine if any 
decision by the plan had caused that injury. The bill also would 
cap the damages patients could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a variety of provisions in virtually every HMO  
bill: allowing easier access to emergency rooms and specialists, 
and giving patients access to more information about how their 
plans work.

<HEADLINE> Pool Picked in Dragging Death Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A pool of 48 potential jurors was selected  
Thursday for the second Jasper dragging death trial, and lawyers 
will try to cut the panel on Friday to 12 jurors and two 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	That would set the stage for opening statements Monday in the  
capital murder trial of 32-year-old Lawrence Russell Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's trial will take place 150 miles west of the Jasper  
County road where authorities found body parts of James Byrd Jr., 
49, after he was beaten, chained to a pickup truck and dragged for 
nearly three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, his prison buddy John William King and Shawn Allen Berry  
were charged with capital murder in Byrd's death, which happened 
outside the deep East Texas town of Jasper. Byrd's body was 
discovered on June 7, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County jurors convicted King and sentenced him to death  
last February. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they believe the three men killed Byrd as  
a publicity stunt to promote their own fledgling hate group and as 
an initiation rite of Berry into the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry is still to be tried.

	CIUDAD RODRIGO, Spain (AP) -- Jan Ullrich ended fellow German  
cyclist Marcel Wust's three-day winning streak by taking the fifth 
stage of the Tour of Spain on Thursday, and defending champion 
Abraham Olano replaced Wust as the overall leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich covered the 99-mile route from Bejar to Ciudad Rodrigo  
in central Spain in three hours, 52 minutes, 56 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Olano finished second, while Belgium's Frank Vandenbroucke was  
third, both on same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Olano took the overall leader's yellow jersey. His time of  
23:28:25 gave him a 10 seconds edge on Ullrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Spaniard Igor Gonzalez was in third place overall, 15 seconds  
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Wust, winner of the second, third and fourth stages, slumped

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Moore Ends Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Swayed by the way his teammates went to bat  
for him, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rob Moore ended his 
holdout Thursday by signing a one-year tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
	When Moore made a surprise appearance at practice, fellow  
starter Frank Sanders pumped his fist in the air and broke into a 
broad grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore credited Sanders with convincing him to return in time to  
play in the team's season opener Sunday against the Eagles at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a long conversation with him Tuesday,'' Moore said.  
``And just to realize how much the guys missed me and I missed them 
-- how much I missed the game -- that's what it boiled down to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was drafted in the second round in 1995 after the  
Cardinals traded their first-round pick and other considerations to 
the New York Jets for Moore, and has started alongside him ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said they discussed what the team was doing to  
compensate for Moore's absence, and then spoke about friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just tried to make sure that he understood that he was  
missed, and that the guys love him,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona will still face the Eagles without rookie offensive  
lineman L.J. Shelton, a first-round draft pick who has refused all 
contract offers, and defensive tackles Eric Swann and Mark Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann is recovering from knee surgery, and Smith is the team's  
last veteran holdout, prompting Sanders to say the squad wasn't 
complete yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe offensive-wise, but defensively they still want Swann  
back, and Mark Smith, because they need those two big guys in the 
middle,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement allows Moore to perform while he and the front  
office continue to negotiate on a longer, more lucrative contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore held out in frustration after the team designated him its  
franchise player and then offered him a contract averaging $4.5 
million a year but with a relatively small, $2 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Moore will make the average of the top five  
salaries at his position, about $3.5 million. He planned to take 
out an insurance policy to protect himself against major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes the Cardinals will deal in good faith, and  
owner Bill Bidwill backed up Moore's thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've agreed to bargain during the next two weeks, or months --  
or whatever it takes to get a longer agreement done,'' Bidwill 
said. ``We're very happy to have Rob here, and we hope to get him 
under contract for more than one year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he was in good shape. When the team was at training  
camp, practicing twice a day, he did his own two-a-days, running 
``50 to 60 routes a day, including all kinds of sprints and agility 
drills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But offensive coordinator Marc Trestman wasn't sure how much  
action the two-time Pro Bowl selection would see in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go in there Sunday and play the guys we've been  
practicing with and working with, because ultimately they're the 
most prepared,'' Trestman said. ``If Rob can give some juice along 
the way and bring something to the table, we'll play it by ear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jake Plummer blistered the team on Monday for not  
signing Moore, who was close to agreement on a $15 million, 
three-year contract until the talks stalled on the size of the 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy,'' said Plummer, who declined to give a longer  
interview. ``I'm very happy. I'm going to see him right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, wearing street clothes to the practice fields and  
accompanied by Bidwill, said Plummer's tirade touched him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It meant a lot to me as a player that my quarterback was  
willing to stand up for me and say what he believed,'' Moore said.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Groups Launch TV Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A coalition of Hispanic organizations is calling  
for a boycott of the four major networks during the first two weeks 
of the TV season to protest ``the continued invisibility of Latinos 
on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC begins Sunday and  
continues through Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of La Raza, which is coordinating the  
boycott, counts just one Hispanic -- Martin Sheen, on NBC's ``The 
West Wing'' -- among the lead characters in the 38 new series 
premiering this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others continue on returning series: Bruno Campos (NBC's  
``Jesse''), and, on CBS, Hector Elizondo (``Chicago Hope'') and 
Cheech Marin (``Nash Bridges''). 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they make up less than 2 percent of all characters on prime-time 
shows, according to Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the boycott will not be measured by ratings, she  
said. ``If we can educate a large proportion of the community and 
others who are interested in this issue, then we've succeeded,'' 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the planned boycott, CBS spokesman Chris Ender  
said, ``We have talented Latinos in leading roles, but we recognize 
that there needs to be more representation both in front of the 
camera and behind the camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making improvements and understand that we need to do  
more,'' ABC said in a statement. ``This is an ongoing process and 
ABC is deeply committed to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox declined to comment on the boycott, and NBC had no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Targeting the ``big four'' networks for the boycott doesn't  
imply endorsement of UPN and WB, Navarrete said. ``And it's not to 
say that cable or film are doing that much better. We're starting 
with these four networks, because they are what everybody has in 
common.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP has similarly criticized network TV over a dearth of  
blacks on screen. At its national conference in July, that 
organization, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group, 
said it was going to monitor how network shows incorporate minority 
roles in their programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, the ``brownout'' was announced at the annual  
convention of La Raza, an Hispanic coordinating organization whose 
240 affiliate groups claim a membership of 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some networks have already made cast changes, though executives  
insisted they were in the works even before the outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	In their original form, none of the 27 new comedies and dramas  
set to premiere on the top four networks had minorities in a 
leading role and few had them in supporting roles. But more than a 
dozen minority characters have been added to new and returning 
series, including a Hispanic woman in ABC's sitcom ``Sabrina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly welcome the addition of characters,'' Navarrete  
said, ``but there's a bigger problem.''

<HEADLINE> Area Off Limits to New Memorials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several federal commissions are calling for a  
ban on new memorials in a cross-shaped area stretching from the 
Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial and from the White House to the 
Jefferson Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed restricted area, called ``the Reserve,'' includes  
the central grassy region known as The Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reserve is a unique national space, an embodiment of our  
democratic ideals and achievements, and must be preserved as an 
indispensable and nationally significant cultural resource,'' 
according to the proposal drafted by the staffs of the National 
Capital Planning Commission, the National Capital Memorial 
Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	To take effect, the proposal must be approved by the  
commissions' members, who are appointed by the president. Some have 
already endorsed the plan, including the Fine Arts Commission 
chairman, J. Carter Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban would exempt the proposed World War II Memorial, which  
would cross the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial. It has been 
approved by the commissions but not yet begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitol's grounds are exempt from the proposed ban since  
Congress controls them. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's announcement opens a 60-day period when citizens may  
express their views before the commissions take final action. The 
first public meeting is scheduled for Sept. 29

<HEADLINE> Brewers: Miller Park Not on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers expect Miller Park to  
reverse their fortunes on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The team finally admitted Wednesday that the transformation  
won't happen on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two months after a 2,100-ton crane collapsed onto a wall  
and killed three workers at Miller Park, the Brewers said their new 
stadium's scheduled April 2000 opening will be delayed. In fact, 
the delay could be a full year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we don't have a report (from the stadium builders),  
it's a practical measure for us to acknowledge that Oct. 3 will not 
be the final game at County Stadium,'' vice president of corporate 
affairs Laurel Prieb said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel there was a practical priority of taking care of  
54,000 fans who had purchased tickets for Oct. 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A backhanded acknowledgement of the delay first came in a press  
release describing alterations in the team's plans for the 1999 
season's final game on Oct. 3, ``originally targeted to be the 
final game at County Stadium before the July 14 construction 
accident caused a delay for Miller Park's opening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was yet another blow to the Brewers franchise,  
which has endured a brutally disappointing year by every 
estimation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year has been the worst I can remember,'' infielder Jeff  
Cirillo said. ``The whole second half has been one blowup after 
another, one bad thing after another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team and the league apparently have assumed a delay would be  
inevitable. Since last month, major league baseball officials in 
New York have been conducting business under the assumption the 
Brewers will not move into Miller Park until opening day 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers have spent the last half-decade planning for the  
move, which will allow them to dramatically increase revenue and 
perhaps even escape baseball's impoverished lower class. With six 
straight losing seasons and a seventh on the way, Miller Park has 
been the beacon of light in the Brewers' dark present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day this year, no matter whether you were playing good  
or playing bad, you could see workers up there banging on 
something, and it made you feel good because you knew you were 
pushing forward,'' Cirillo said. ``Now, you don't know where your 
future lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers and the board of directors overseeing the stadium  
claim to be examining the possibility of opening the park in July 
2000, similar to the manner in which the Seattle Mariners opened 
Safeco Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the months of cleanup work still to be done and the  
logistical problems of doing construction work during a Wisconsin 
winter, an April 2001 opening would seem to be all but certain. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is 63 percent complete and 300 workers currently are  
on the site, according to the board's construction committee. Board 
chairman Frank Busalacchi said Wednesday that a decision on when to 
open Miller Park likely will come soon, possibly during the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Brewers' moving plans remain up in the air, the team  
is foundering on the field. After Wednesday's 9-1 loss to Arizona, 
Milwaukee had lost 26 of its last 37 games, including 18 of 26 
under interim manager Jim Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner and GM Sal Bando were ousted last month by  
team president Wendy Selig-Prieb. With no general manager to 
impress and no permanent manager to rally the players, morale is 
approaching rock-bottom in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to come out every day and try to hold it  
together,'' third baseman Sean Berry said. ``We try to keep 
fighting, because that's all you can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delay also will affect the team's finances. The Brewers  
figured to double their revenue in their first year in the 
ballpark, and a substantial portion of that money was to be spent 
on increasing the team's $39 million payroll, the 19th-highest 
among baseball's 30 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that money and the funds that would have been generated  
during the final days at County Stadium and the first year at 
Miller Park, Milwaukee will operate in the red for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Brewers are looking at another full campaign in  
the drafty, smelly old facility slated for demolition as soon as 
Miller Park is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of memories here for some people, but I don't  
have many, especially positive memories,'' All-Star outfielder 
Jeromy Burnitz said. ``I was looking forward to getting in the new 
stadium.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Jumps from Roller Coaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOSWELL, Va. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy who said his safety  
restraint was too loose leaped from a Paramount Kings Dominion 
roller coaster, the same ride from which a man fell to his death 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the theme park said Eamon McIntyre jumped off the  
Shockwave shortly after it started, mistakenly believing his 
shoulder harness wasn't locked. The boy was not seriously hurt in 
the Sept. 2 incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the ride was inspected afterwards and no problem  
was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes there is a guest perception that something  
may not be quite right, especially in light of recent incidents,'' 
Susan Lomax, a spokeswoman for Kings Dominion, told The Washington 
Post on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shockwave ride, which includes a steep vertical loop and a  
sideways spiral, lasts about two minutes. Riders are standing 
during the trip and have a shoulder harness and a waist-level guard 
to hold them in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy said he slipped under the waist-level guard and jumped  
from the roller coaster as it began its initial climb after he and 
several other riders tried but failed to get the attention of the 
ride operator. He said he landed on a catwalk, twisting his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lomax said she couldn't explain how the boy was able to get  
out of the restraints, which are designed to prohibit people from 
squirming out once the ride begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he wriggled himself out,'' she said. ``But we had  
the ride mechanics come out, and they found no indication of 
mechanical failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials cited rider misconduct in the accident last month  
that killed Timothy Fan, 20, of New York City.

<HEADLINE> 15 More Held in Airport Drug Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Fifteen airport workers were arrested Thursday on  
charges they diverted cocaine-laden luggage around customs and into 
the hands of undercover agents posing as drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests were the second major roundup of suspected drug  
smugglers at Miami International Airport. Seventy-four people have 
been arrested since Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover agents used fake cocaine in a yearlong sting  
operation. Ramp workers, supervisors and others allegedly used 
their airport access to smuggle drugs into the United States, U.S. 
Attorney Thomas E. Scott said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveillance photos and audio tapes showed workers removing  
luggage full of fake cocaine from planes, circumvented customs 
inspectors and handed off the luggage to the undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 115 pounds of fake cocaine made it through Miami  
International Airport on eight different occasions between October 
1997 and September 1999, Customs special agent Frank Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fake cocaine was planted on flights from the Caribbean and  
South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that real cocaine was not used does not matter,''  
Scott said. ``These folks believed it was real cocaine and treated 
it as real cocaine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the suspects charged the undercover agents $2,000 per  
2.2 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 suspects were arrested at their homes early Thursday on  
charges including conspiracy to import cocaine into the United 
States, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and 
attempts to import and possess with the intent to distribute 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the suspects face up to 15 years, others face up to life  
in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said the federal investigation was still underway and  
there could be more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-nine people were indicted on federal drug and weapon  
smuggling conspiracy charges Aug. 25. Thirty were American Airlines 
baggage handlers and ground crew workers at Miami International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged smugglers hid bogus cocaine in food carts, garbage  
bags and carry-on luggage. The workers used their ID badges to 
access secured areas, sometimes on their days off. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arrested Thursday worked for four companies that service  
the aircraft industry at the airport: Evergreen Aviation Ground 
Logistics Enterprises, Inc., American Sales and Management 
Organization, RS Investigations, Inc. and Dispatch Service, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the criminal complaint, the shipments were  
transported aboard Bahamas Air, Ecuatoriana and Air Aruba.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were mixed early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors awaited the government's 
monthly harvest forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for both corn and soybeans had slipped on Wednesday after  
a week-long rally when the U.S. Agriculture Department indicated 
crops were faring better than anticipated despite a sustained dry 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans rebounded slightly amid investor jockeying ahead of  
Friday's USDA reports on production and supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, the nation's leading crop, was pressured by news that  
South Korea had rejected offers for three cargoes of corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.87 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $2.21 a bushel; December oats rose 1/4 
cent to $1.16 a bushel; November soybeans rose 3 1/2 cents to $5.11 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures advanced in early trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mob Hit Man Cuts Deal With Feds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A mob hit man who says he killed 20 people has cut  
a deal with prosecutors that would allow him to get out of prison 
in as little as eight years, according to documents released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Martorano, 58, agreed to plead guilty to 12 of the  
slayings. His victims included a millionaire executive in Tulsa, 
Okla., and two teen-agers in Boston who happened to be with one of 
his targets. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern said all of the killings probably  
would have gone unsolved without the deal, which requires Martorano 
to testify against his former cronies. 
</P>
<P>
	Those other reputed mobsters include James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger  
and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, who were themselves federal 
informants allegedly given free rein by the FBI to commit crimes 
short of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger, who is on the run, Flemmi and Martorano are defendants  
in a federal racketeering case that includes reputed New England 
mob boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the case should be thrown out because of the  
cozy relationship between the FBI and Flemmi and Bulger. A federal 
judge is expected to rule on their motion within days. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't go forward with this agreement, there always  
would have been the lingering suspicion that the reason was to 
protect the FBI,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martorano agreed to plead guilty to federal racketeering,  
race-fixing, bookmaking and extortion charges in return for his 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf also agrees, Martorano will  
be sentenced to 12 1/2 to 15 years in federal prison, with credit for 
the five years he has already served while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Martorano, so nondescript he didn't even have a nickname, is  
nonetheless among the mob's deadliest admitted killers. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes Sammy ``the Bull'' Gravano, the Gambino family  
underboss who admitted to 19 killings and served five years after 
testifying against the New York mob. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968 in Boston, Joseph ``The Animal'' Barboza admitted  
killing 26 people but served less than a year in prison after 
agreeing to testify against the New England mob. He was slain in 
San Francisco in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Martorano said he first killed in 1965. He shot an ex-convict  
who had testified before a grand jury that indicted his brother 
Jimmy for being an accessory to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of the killings he admitted but will not plead  
guilty to. 
</P>
<P>
	He will plead guilty to murder in the 1981 shooting of Roger  
Wheeler, the chairman of Telex Corp. and owner of World Jai Alai, 
outside his country club in Tulsa; and in the 1982 killing of John 
Callahan, a former president of World Jai Alai whose body was found 
in the trunk of a Cadillac at Miami International Airport. World 
Jai Alai operated frontons, which are where the jai alai games are 
played.

<HEADLINE> McCrary, Ravens Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Pro Bowl defensive end Michael McCrary  
reached an agreement in principle Thursday with the Baltimore 
Ravens on a five-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the length of the pact, terms were not released by  
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary, who had 14 1/2 sacks for Baltimore last season, still had  
a year left on his contract, but his agent was instructed to reach 
a deal before Sunday's season opener. McCrary staged a two-day 
walkout late last month to protest the slow pace of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	McCrary, 29, had been seeking a six- or seven-year deal  
averaging $7 million per season, including a $13 million signing 
bonus. The Ravens countered with a six-year contract averaging $6.5 
million, including a $11.5 million bonus.

<HEADLINE> NASA Program Has Broad Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House rejected the annual effort to kill  
NASA's space station on Wednesday as Congress began a hectic autumn 
of sorting through spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers returned from their summer recess, the House voted  
298-121 to defeat an attempt by Reps. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., and Mark 
Sanford, R-S.C., to eliminate the space station, one of NASA's 
highest profile programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A spending bill the House is debating would provide $2.4 billion  
next year for the station, whose first components are already 
orbiting the Earth. Construction is expected to take five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Roemer, who has been trying to terminate the program since 1992,  
cited its cost overruns and pressures its price tag put on the rest 
of the federal budget. One congressional estimate for building and 
maintaining the station over its lifetime is nearly $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But with space station contracts spread among many congressional  
districts, the program has broad support in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The space station funds were included in a $92 billion measure  
financing veterans, housing, science and environmental programs for 
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to President Clinton have threatened to veto the bill  
because it contains less than the White House wants for many 
programs. Congress has sent Clinton only two of the 13 spending 
measures for the coming fiscal year, bogged down by disputes over 
how much to spend and how to pay for the expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, House  
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and other Democrats 
criticized GOP housing cuts. Cuomo said the measure would cut funds 
``that help people work their way out of poverty,'' and were 
designed by Republicans to help finance a tax cut for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans said Clinton proposed unrealistic increases for  
housing based on proposed higher taxes and fees with no chance of 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done our very best to prioritize limited federal  
dollars in a responsible way that takes care of our neediest 
citizens,'' said Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chief author of the 
veterans-housing bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate resumed considering a $14 billion measure financing  
the Interior Department and cultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate there focused on an attempt by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas, to block the Clinton administration from boosting 
royalties paid by oil companies drilling on public lands.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Hits Campaign Trail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Traditional Democratic sympathies for  
the poor and disadvantaged lie at the heart of Bill Bradley's 
campaign as he tries to articulate for Democrats a compelling 
reason to choose him over Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Bradley carries his call for a ``deeper prosperity'' than  
that achieved under Gore and President Clinton from his sleepy home 
town to a black fraternity in St. Louis, through the Mississippi 
River home of Mark Twain and through to Iowa, where winter 
nominating caucuses will launch the 2000 presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to  
improve the well-being of all our citizens,'' Bradley said 
Wednesday as he launched an intensified fall campaign for the 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need in America is a deeper prosperity. Deeper not  
only in the sense that it touches people who have been left out -- 
that it saves family farms caught in the whirlwind of change, that 
it brings hot breakfasts to children who go to school without them, 
that it brings security to worried seniors -- but deeper in the 
sense that we have a prosperity ... that makes us feel rich inside 
and out,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised a Bradley White House that would pursue big,  
essential goals, with strict gun control, campaign finance reform, 
universal health insurance and the eradication of child poverty 
topping his list. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview taped earlier and broadcast this morning,  
Bradley signaled out gun control and the differences he sees 
between Gore and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the vice president, Bradley told NBC's ``Today'' show, ``I  
think we'd be very different presidents. ... I had a life before I 
got into politics and after I left the Senate. I think the vice 
president has had a life based mostly in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he is a stronger advocate of gun control than is  
Gore. ``We're at a time where we need registration of all handguns 
in America ... and he has not supported that,'' Bradley said. 
``Registration is the key. ... If we can do it for automobiles we 
can do it for handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dramatic upheaval, such as that needed to topple Gore as the  
establishment Democrats' favorite for their party's presidential 
nomination, seemed to be on Bradley's mind Wednesday as he led a 
gaggle of reporters on a sunset tour of his boyhood haunts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a field of weeds and grass bearing no trace of the Pittsburgh  
Plate Glass factory that once gave this small town an audible hum -- 
not to mention jobs for its 4,000 residents -- Bradley said he was 
reminded of ``how life has unknown terms and how change is all 
around us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator and pro-basketball star is  
focusing this post-Labor-Day stretch on introducing himself and his 
personal ethos to a broader audience than he has yet reached in 
some seven months of low-profile campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on that low profile that aides blamed a new Washington  
Post-ABC poll putting Bradley far behind Gore, 29 percent to 64 
percent among those who lean toward voting Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley ``is not well known and he is not going to be very well  
known until later in this process -- January or February, at 
least,'' said Anita Dunn, a senior adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on coming campaign commercials, a film crew  
documented Bradley's every step, every embrace of old friends on 
this trip. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Crystal City Little League fields in what was known in  
the early 1960s as the black side of town, Bradley recalled a 
championship game in Iowa. Safe and holding on first base, Bradley 
had lifted his foot off the bag to pull up his socks. The first 
baseman touched the ball to Bradley's leg and he was called out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the ol' hidden-ball-in-the-glove routine,'' Bradley  
chuckled. ``Ever since that time I've dreamed of going back to Iowa 
and winning one.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Block Mass Transit Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats blocked an attempt today to protect  
oil companies from having to pay increased royalties and thwarted 
proposed cuts in federal mass-transit funds for the two biggest 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil and mass-transit disputes threatened Senate action on  
two massive spending bills, for transportation and a variety of 
natural resource and energy programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans failed to get the required 60 votes to cut off  
debate on mass-transit proposals in the $49 billion transportation 
bill. Democrats had promised to filibuster the bill because it 
would cut transit funds for California and New York, while 
increasing money to other states. Further action on the bill is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, Republicans were forced to temporarily set  
aside an amendment that would block the Interior Department from 
imposing new rules on royalty payments on oil taken from federal 
land. An attempt will be made next week to cut off debate as 
opponents of the amendment threatened a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department has argued that current royalty  
assessments undercharge oil companies as much as $66 million a year 
for oil taken from federal land. Oil-state lawmakers have argued 
the new rules would amount to an unfair tax on oil producers at a 
time when the industry already is facing troubled economic times. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress for two years has blocked the Clinton administration  
from implementing the royalty change. The amendment offered by Sen. 
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, would extend the moratorium for a 
third year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison's amendment has majority support, but Sen. Barbara  
Boxer, D-Calif., objected repeatedly to the issue coming to a vote. 
Republicans will need 60 votes to cut off debate next week, or the 
amendment will have to be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate took steps as part of the Interior  
spending bill to override two court decisions that have blocked 
already-curtailed timber sales on thousands of acres of federal 
forest in the Northwest and the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The timber sales by the U.S. Forest Service were put on hold  
earlier this year when two federal judges found the government 
failed to adequately assess the potential harm to rare plants and 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The courts, one in Georgia and another in Washington state,  
ordered new, detailed surveys of species before new logging permits 
were to be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	But a provision in the $14 billion Interior Department spending  
bill, being debated this week in the Senate, declares that federal 
agencies -- not the courts -- should have the ``sole discretion'' on 
what surveys should be conducted. It would give the Forest Service 
the go-ahead to proceed with timber sales using a more limited 
species assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	An attempt by Sen. Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., to delete the  
provision failed today by a 45-52 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb said the provision will result ``in costly delays and  
lawsuits with no benefit to the health of public lands'' because 
environmental groups will challenge renewed logging without the 
additional surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said the language ``simply  
authorizes ... (agencies) to conduct their business ... as they 
have in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The logging controversy stems from decisions in which judges  
determined that the Forest Service wasn't adequately surveying 
forests for endangered species prior to issuing logging permits. 
</P>
<P>
	First a judge blocked timber sales in the Chattahoochee National  
Forest in the South. Then, another judge suspended timber sales in 
Oregon and Washington under the compromise Northwest Forest Plan 
forged in 1994 as a way to allow limited cutting and still protect 
the endangered spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sens. Slade Gorton of Washington and Larry Craig of  
Idaho crafted language in the Interior bill aimed at overcoming the 
new court restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig maintained the suspension of already curtailed timber  
sales amounted to a broken promise to loggers, who under the 1994 
agreement were assured some timber harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has estimated that about 550 million board feet of  
timber will not be cut in the Northwest because of the court 
requirement for more detailed forest surveys for sensitive species. 
Logging on 8,000 acres of federal forest in the South also has been 
affected.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Hear Switched Baby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A mother whose baby was switched at birth  
with another child lost her bid Thursday to overturn a financial 
settlement the hospital made on the child's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia Supreme Court rejected Paula Johnson's attempt to  
block the $875,000 settlement for her biological daughter, 
upholding a judge's approval of the settlement for 4-year-old 
Rebecca Chittum and the families raising her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson claimed the settlement is too little and that the  
couple who have been caring for her have no right to any 
compensation. She is suing the University of Virginia Medical 
Center for $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The case made national news when Ms. Johnson discovered the baby  
she had been raising was not her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Her biological baby, Rebecca, had been sent home with Whitney  
Rogers and Kevin Chittum a few days after her 1995 birth, and that 
couple's true daughter was sent home with Ms. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson learned the truth a few days after Chittum and Ms.  
Rogers died in a car crash on July 4, 1998, without ever learning 
of the switch. Since then the parents of Chittum and Ms. Rogers 
have been raising Rebecca. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 5, a judge approved the settlement between the  
hospital, Rebecca and the grandparents who have been sharing 
custody of her. But Ms. Johnson claims she had a right to approve 
or reject any settlement for the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the University of Virginia Medical Center, where the  
switch was made, said the decision confirms ``that the amount of 
the settlement is fair and is in the best interests of this 
child.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the first case of its kind, the Securities  
and Exchange Commission has fined a mutual fund family for 
misleading investors regarding the first-year gains of one of its 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC announced Wednesday it had fined Van Kampen $100,000 for  
failing to accurately disclose how Van Kampen's Growth Fund 
generated huge returns in its first year. In addition, a former Van 
Kampen employee, Alan Sachtleben, was fined $25,000 for his part in 
the effort to mislead investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen and Sachtleben agreed to settle the case without  
admitting or denying the charges. In a statement released after the 
settlement was announced, Van Kampen noted that the Growth Fund 
itself was not under investigation, only the company's failure to 
disclose how the fund had performed so well in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real bucket of ice water that the SEC is throwing on  
the promotion of short-term results,'' said Burt Greenwald, a 
Philadelphia-based mutual fund consultant. ``It's a positive thing 
for investors in that the SEC is acting aggressively, and not 
against a marginal player but one of the major players in the 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case grew out of Van Kampen's efforts to market its Growth  
Fund in late 1996 and early 1997. Mutual fund companies often use 
first-year gains to promote a new fund to the public, and this was 
no exception: The company claimed the fund grew 62 percent in 1996, 
its first year in existence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Van Kampen failed to disclose that much of that return was  
prompted by investments in initial public offerings. IPO shares 
tend to perform extremely well in their early days of trading and 
can have a big impact on small mutual funds that include them. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout 1996, Van Kampen's Growth Fund was not open to wide  
public investment because it was an incubator fund -- a small, 
startup fund used to generate a performance track record that can 
be used by a mutual fund company to market the fund to a wide array 
of potential investors. Therefore the fund's assets remained 
relatively small during that year, never containing more than 
$380,000, and were highly susceptible to IPO increases, according 
to the SEC. Larger funds with more assets are less susceptible to 
the IPO surges. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on advertisements that touted the previous year's 62  
percent gain, Van Kampen's growth fund grew to $110 million from 
$1.1 million when it was opened to the public in early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SEC, Sachtleben was aware that the fund's  
growth rate was due primarily to the performance of hot IPOs but 
failed to inform Van Kampen executives. Sachtleben's silence 
allowed the company to advertise the fund using misleading 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said Sachtleben continued to mislead Van Kampen  
officials even after an online investment newsletter raised doubts 
about the fund's performance. In the wake of the newsletter story, 
Sachtleben, according to the SEC, conducted a study that showed the 
disproportionate impact the IPOs had had on the fund, but he kept 
the information to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwald said mutual fund companies that do large amounts of  
business with investment banks can frequently obtain shares of hot 
IPOs from those banks before the shares hit the public market and 
balloon in value. A strong performance by of one of those IPO 
shares can then be used to skew the overall performance of a small 
mutual fund, Greenwald explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC brought the charges against Van Kampen Advisory, the  
advisory unit of Oakbrook, Ill., -based Van Kampen Funds. 
Sachtleben, 57, of Houston, was the unit's chief investment officer 
until he retired in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to track down Sachtleben were unsuccessful. No public  
listing of Sachtleben was available in Houston, and Van Kampen said 
he wasn't available for comment.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his 59th homer Thursday, moving  
within one of becoming the first player in major league history to 
reach 60 twice. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Love May Be Able To Play at Ryder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Doctors have advised Davis Love III not  
to play golf for two weeks because of a pinched nerve in his back, 
although his agent said Thursday he fully expects him to be able to 
play in the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Estes, who finished 11th in the standings and would replace  
Love should he not be fit to play, is leaving nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Estes plans a trip to The Country Club on Monday after the  
Canadian Open because he has never seen the course and doesn't want 
to be at a disadvantage in a worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, Davis will be able to go,'' Estes said Thursday  
after a first-round 71 at Glen Abbey Golf Club. ``He's one of the 
best in the world, and our side needs him. But if he can't play, 
I'm next in line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes missed by one stroke playing his way onto the team in the  
PGA Championship last month. He had bogeys on the two of the last 
three holes for a 69 and a tie for sixth. Ben Crenshaw spent his 
captain's picks on Tom Lehman (No. 12) and Steve Pate (No. 14). 
</P>
<P>
	Love was out of town Thursday and couldn't immediately be  
reached for comment. His agent at Pro's Inc., Vernon Spratley, said 
Love was advised that rest and therapy should be enough to take 
care of a pinched nerve that first surfaced during the Sprint 
International three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is a certainty,'' Vernon Spratley said. ``If he knows  
he can't go, he has told Crenshaw he would let him know. But I 
don't think that will be the case. I think he'll be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite feeling pain in the NEC Invitational at Firestone two  
weeks ago, Love still tied for 10th. Spratley said the plan is for 
Love to start hitting balls next week, but he has withdrawn from 
Jim Furyk's charity tournament in Pennsylvania, the Excelon 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Spratley said Love is being replaced by Sergio Garcia.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Paying $1.9M Over Shawmut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The investment division of Fleet Financial  
Group has agreed to pay $1.9 million to settle charges by federal 
regulators that Shawmut National Bank of Boston, which Fleet later 
acquired, misused brokerage commissions to pay for client 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement  
Thursday. It also filed related fraud charges against East West 
Institutional Services Inc., a Detroit brokerage firm, and eight 
individuals, including Michael J. Rothmeier, the former president 
of Shawmut's investment operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet and two of the individuals agreed to settle the civil  
fraud charges, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. East West, 
Rothmeier and the other five people are contesting the charges, and 
their cases will go before an administrative law judge at the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet already has repaid approximately $1.7 million of the  
settlement amount to former Shawmut clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that beginning in mid-1993, Shawmut Investment  
Advisers Inc. violated its responsibility to its pension fund 
clients by failing to tell them that the brokerage commissions they 
paid went to brokers who referred new clients to Shawmut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Full and fair disclosure to investors is the foundation of the  
federal securities laws,'' Juan Marcel Marcelino, the SEC's 
district administrator in Boston, said in a statement. 
``(Investment) advisers must disclose any and all arrangements 
regarding their use of clients' commissions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, in a statement from its Boston headquarters, noted that  
it ``promptly initiated its own internal investigation of these 
practices'' by the former Shawmut division and ``voluntarily 
disclosed'' their existence to the SEC in May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Andreoff, an attorney representing East West,  
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmeier's lawyer, James Quarles, didn't immediately return a  
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC action follows an investigation by the market watchdog  
agency, the FBI and the Labor Department into allegations that 
brokers and pension managers received kickbacks or gifts in 
exchange for steering investments to Shawmut. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators from the three federal agencies looked into  
allegations that at least two pension funds -- a Teamsters pension 
fund in Chicago and a public fund in Rhode Island -- were bilked of 
millions of dollars in the scheme, The Associated Press reported in 
July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal, legal and labor sources told The AP the investigators  
reviewed union and investment records in at least four states, 
trying to determine whether questionable commissions that Shawmut 
paid to several East West brokers compromised the pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Fleet voluntarily repaid former clients of Shawmut,  
including one of the pension funds, about $1 million for 
questionable commissions. Fleet, which had acquired Shawmut in 
December 1995, became legally liable for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding East West, Fleet said at the time that a review of  
records kept by Shawmut indicated that the commissions paid to the 
brokerage firm may have been improper because it may not have 
performed research for which it had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago attorney had pushed for an explanation of what  
happened with the funds and a closer examination of ties between 
East West, Teamsters officials and alleged associates of organized 
crime in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Fleet voluntarily repaid approximately $700,000  
last spring. The $1.7 million the bank has paid was credited toward 
the settlement announced Thursday with the SEC, and Fleet has 
agreed to pay the remaining $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The two individuals who agreed to settlements with the SEC are  
two former Shawmut traders, Karen Michalski and Christopher D. 
Sargent. They agreed, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to 
refrain from future violations of securities laws, to each pay a 
$5,000 civil fine, and to be barred from the investment advising 
business with a right to reapply after 15 months.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Is Captain of Davis Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By winning seven Grand Slam championships, 77  
career singles titles and 77 career doubles crowns, John McEnroe 
had his share of tennis thrills. 
</P>
<P>
	Right up there, though, was his appointment Wednesday as captain  
of the U.S. Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is one of the proudest moments of my life,'' McEnroe said  
after Judy Levering, president of the United States Tennis 
Association, named him to the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned to Levering.  
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently,'' McEnroe said, ``it took this wonderful lady here  
to show some guts finally, and I appreciate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, one of America's most successful Davis Cup players, has  
staged a long campaign to lead the Davis Cup effort. He has always 
been passionate about the international competition and hopes he 
can bring that same kind of enthusiasm to top players who often 
have been uninspired about the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who came into the U.S. Open  
ranked 1-2 in the world, have passed on Davis Cup play in the past, 
but seemed enthused about McEnroe's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that John has wanted for a long time,''  
Sampras said. ``I know he will do a great job as captain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi was delighted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain yet, by far,'' he  
said. ``John will make a huge difference. Now all we have to do is 
get Pete on board and we're all good. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got the best players. Let's get it done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly McEnroe endorses that approach.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he had not talked with Sampras and Agassi yet but would  
do so at the first opportunity. Both gave him their blessings in 
conversations with Levering, who had pledged to get input from the 
players before deciding ion the next captain. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe succeeds Tom Gullikson, who had been captain of the team  
for six years and remains as director of coaching of the USTA's 
Player Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to John yesterday and congratulated him on his  
appointment and offered him all my best wishes and support in his 
quest to bring the Davis Cup back to the USA,'' Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson took much of the blame for the United States Davis Cup  
loss to Australia in July when Sampras played only doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was asked how he would handle that sort of issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of that,'' he said. ``I prefer not to  
look at the past at this time. That was obviously a position that 
was awkward in some ways. It's easy to be a backseat driver at this 
point. I prefer to look ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking back isn't a bad idea for McEnroe, though. He played on  
12 Davis Cup teams, five of which won championships. He still holds 
six United States Davis Cup records and compiled an overall record 
of 59-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is perhaps the greatest Davis Cup player in the history of  
the sport,'' Levering said. ``I think he can be just as successful 
as captain and bring that same passion and energy he did as a 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the 2000 Davis Cup competition will be conducted  
Oct. 7 in London. At that time the United States will learn its 
first-round opponent for competition Feb. 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was unconcerned about what country his team will face.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bring them all on!'' he said.

<HEADLINE> WWII Carrier Sold to Salvage Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A World War II carrier that survived  
attacks from torpedoes, battleships, submarines and kamikazes was 
unable to avoid a salvage company Thursday, disappointing veterans 
who wanted the vessel spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabe Marine Salvage bid $185,000 at auction for the USS Cabot,  
derailing a nonprofit group's plans to convert the once mighty ship 
into a floating museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Education Council for Space Age Technology,  
whose highest bid was $180,000, declined to say whether the group 
might file an objection to the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing has gone on for years,'' said Stephen O'Neal,  
chairman of the Miami-based nonprofit group known as ECOSTAT. 
``It'll still go on for more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was held by the U.S. Marshal's Service, which sold  
the ship to pay off the debt it had racked up in maintenance and 
pollution cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said the ship, named for explorer John Cabot, is the only  
survivor of nine small-but-fast light carriers used in World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	War correspondent Ernie Pyle filed dispatches from the ship he  
nicknamed the ``Iron Woman.'' It fought in every Pacific battle of 
1944 and 1945, and its pilots shot down 252 planes and sank 49 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabot later was a training carrier, then was used by the  
Spanish Navy as the SNS Dedalo. In 1989, Spain gave the ship to a 
group that planned to make it a museum in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government declared the Cabot a National Historic  
Landmark and contributed $2 million toward the project, but a lack 
of private funds sank the plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get an obsolete ship, as far as your navy is  
concerned, you scrap it,'' said Bill Anderson, past president of 
the USS Cabot Association, a veterans' group, and a pilot on the 
ship from October 1944 to May 1945. ``We've done that with 
airplanes and ships to the point that we have very few historic 
ones (left).''

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 7 Yrs. for Investment Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man who pleaded guilty to running a $20 million  
investment scam was sentenced Thursday to nearly seven years in 
prison and ordered to pay more than $2 million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur F. Good, 51, pleaded guilty in February to 43 counts of  
fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in what investigators called 
a classic Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the ongoing investigation has identified more  
than 100 victims nationwide, including retirees, dentists, 
attorneys and others. They lost sums ranging from $10,000 to almost 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Good, who led a lavish lifestyle, was head of the Quincy-based  
Boston Investment Group, which was known by its initials, 
``B.I.G.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good bilked investors out of at least $7 million by telling them  
that he would invest their money in very safe investments with very 
high rates of return. But, instead of putting the money in safe 
investments, he used much of it to pay off previous investors, and 
divided up most of the rest of it between his partners and himself.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Tracing Fatal E. coli Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The largest E. coli outbreak in state  
history -- and possibly one of the worst nationally -- has sickened 
nearly 300 people who believe they were infected after attending a 
county fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak at the Washington County Fair about 35 miles north  
of Albany has led to one fatality, 3-year old Rachel Aldrich of 
Clifton Park. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday, the number of patients seeking hospital treatment  
rose to 291, said Kristine Smith of the state Department of Health. 
Of those, 49 have been confirmed to have the potentially deadly 
0157:H7 strain of bacteria, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Albany area, eight children have developed hemolytic  
uremic syndrome, or HUS, as a result of the contamination and were 
listed in serious condition, Smith said. HUS attacks the blood 
cells and can result in kidney failure. Five of the children were 
on kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials were still investigating the outbreak's cause,  
but suspected the fair's water supply may have been contaminated 
when rainwater runoff washed cow feces from a nearby farm into an 
underground aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
	If the number of people who have sought treatment turn out to  
have E. coli poisoning, as is strongly suspected, it would make the 
outbreak one of the largest in the country, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, four children died and more that 500 others became ill  
from eating undercooked hamburgers at a Jack in the Box fast-food 
restaurant in the Pacific Northwest. In 1996, contaminated apple 
juice produced by Odwalla Inc. caused 70 people in several western 
states and Canada to become sick, and a 16-month-old child to die. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli bacteria normally live in the intestines of humans and  
other warm-blooded animals. Most strains are harmless but some, 
including 0157:H7, can be deadly. Symptoms of the infection include 
abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever.

<HEADLINE> True North Combines Two Ad Agenies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- True North Communications, parent company for two  
leading advertising firms, announced Thursday that it had 
consolidated the companies to form the largest U.S. ad agency and 
the fifth-biggest worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The realigned company, FCB Worldwide, combines FCB with a large  
part of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon and Eckhardt Inc., which True North 
bought out in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, approved by True North directors late Wednesday,  
includes Bozell's international offices along with offices in 
Detroit and Costa Mesa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The enlargened FCB Worldwide now has combined estimated billings  
of about $8 billion, making it the largest in the United States. It 
is also will be one of the largest in the world, ranking behind 
such ad agency powerhouses as Dentsu Inc. and Young &AMP; Rubicam in 
terms of billings. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the new FCB, our clients now have a more powerful global  
resource,'' said David Bell, chairman and chief executive officer 
of True North. ``And we're strongly positioned to serve leading 
marketers as they continue to consolidate their advertising and 
communications business worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the company said, FBC was the fourth biggest U.S. ad  
agency in billings and Bozell -- which will remain one of the 20 
largest -- was No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendan Ryan, chairman and chief executive officer of FCB  
Worldwide, will remain CEO at the combined agency. Leo-Arthur 
Kelmenson, formerly chairman and chief executive of Bozell 
Worldwide, was named chairman of the new FCB.

<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Evan Eschmeyer, the New Jersey  
Nets' only draft pick, will be sidelined four months following an 
operation Thursday to repair a ruptured shoulder muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Eschmeyer, 24, had his right pectoralis major muscle reattached  
by Dr. Russell Warren at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New 
York City, the team said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren said the operation was a success and that Eschmeyer will  
have to wait six weeks before beginning rehabilitation. The 34th 
overall pick won't be able to play until at least January, meaning 
he'll miss the first three months of the NBA season.

<HEADLINE> High School Hoops Star Sues To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A high school basketball player who was dropped  
from the team for drinking says he is a recovering alcoholic and is 
suing for reinstatement under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could test the scope of the federal law, which is still  
being deciphered almost a decade after its passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, Rickey Higgins, 17, helped lead his suburban Warren  
Township High School team to second place in the state basketball 
tournament. Then he was arrested for two alcohol-related offenses, 
including drunken driving, and was told his high school sports 
career was over. 
</P>
<P>
	He says that amounts to discrimination under the Americans with  
Disabilities Act, the 1990 law that protects disabled people from 
discrimination. He is suing in federal court for $100,000 in 
damages and a position on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I deserve a second chance,'' he said Thursday. ``Most  
people who are alcoholics think no one will help them, and I'm 
getting that feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett Rodick, the attorney for Warren Township High, said the  
lawsuit is ``clearly an attempt to broaden the ADA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The ADA cannot be used as a shield against the consequences of  
illegal conduct,'' he said. ``I think the school has a right to 
expect of its athletes or anyone involved in extracurricular 
activities that they don't engage in illegal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins, a 5-foot-11 guard, missed much of last season with a  
back injury but returned to lead the team in scoring in its state 
semifinal victory. With his help, the school, located 30 miles 
north of Chicago, had its best finish ever in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The next month, Higgins was cited for being the passenger in a  
car that had an open container of alcohol. In May, after he drove 
into a tree, he was convicted of driving under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials ruled that Higgins violated the school's  
athletic code, which says any athlete involved in two 
alcohol-related incidents loses a year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins' alcoholism was diagnosed by his doctor, and also a  
psychologist and social worker, according to his attorney, Steven 
Glink. Higgins' father and grandfather also are alcoholics, Glink 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid could not control his use of alcohol,'' Glink said.  
``Because he could not control it, it's a disability and he should 
not be punished for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins, now a senior, said he has received recruiting letters  
from colleges and hoped to make an impression on some bigger 
schools this season. He said he was disappointed with the 
district's decision because he reported the incidents to the school 
and then took steps to correct his problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a dream of mine to play college ball,'' he  
said. ``This will definitely hurt that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Decker, executive director of the National Association of  
Protection and Advocacy Systems, which provides legal help to the 
disabled, said the 1990 law covers recovering alcoholics and drug 
abusers but not current users. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he can claim he was discriminated against based  
on those incidents,'' Decker said, though he acknowledged he had 
not seen the lawsuit. ``My guess is we would never touch a case 
like this.''

<HEADLINE> DOT Reviews Marine Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's maritime system runs the risk of  
being swamped by a boom in commercial shipping over the next 20 
years, so the government wants to find new ways to improve, run and 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Thursday, the Transportation Department  
said the nation's economy could suffer if the challenges are not 
met. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much is riding on the results,'' Transportation Secretary  
Rodney Slater told a news conference attended by government and 
private industry leaders. Both sides teamed up since March 1998 to 
produce the report, ``An Assessment of the U.S. Marine 
Transportation System.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation's economic growth could very well outperform our  
marine transportation system's capacity over the next 20 years,'' 
Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	While long on general themes, the 104-page report does lay out  
some specific goals: 
</P>
<P>
	--Coordinate local, state and federal funding sources so port and  
harbor spending has a rationale. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ease access between ports and land distribution channels, such  
as highways and railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase public awareness of the importance of a vibrant marine  
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
	--Protect the network against terrorism and ensuring that it  
remains capable of delivering troops and materiel overseas as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also uses statistics to help define the challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States has more than 1,000 harbor channels and 25,000  
miles of inland, intracoastal and coastal waterways. There are more 
than 3,700 terminals to handle cargo and passenger traffic. The 
waterways and ports link to 152,000 miles of rail, 460,000 miles of 
pipeline and 45,000 miles of interstate highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Waterborne cargo alone contributes more than $742 billion to the  
U.S. gross domestic produce and creates jobs for 13 million people, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its scope, the system is under stress.  
</P>
<P>
	Each year it moves more than 2 billion tons of domestic and  
international freight. It imports 3.3 billion barrels of oil and 
transports 134 million passengers by ferry. Seventy-eight million 
people use the system for recreational boating and more than 5 
million are cruise ship passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 20 years, the total volume of domestic and  
international marine trade is expected to more than double. The 
number of recreational users alone is expected to grow by over 65 
percent to more than 130 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. James Loy, head of the Coast Guard and one of the people  
charged with drafting the report, said he could not estimate the 
cost of the work needed on the system.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules Vs. GM in Atlanta Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The widow of an Atlanta man who died in a fiery  
1997 wreck has won the right to use potentially damaging, 
decades-old General Motors Corp. documents in her wrongful death 
suit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	State Court Judge Gino Brogdon directed GM to produce the  
documents and said they were admissible in the trial of the suit 
scheduled to start Oct. 4. He also called the company's efforts to 
withhold the material ``a shameful scheme by GM to defraud and 
mislead several courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogdon's findings on Tuesday stem from a collection of lawyers'  
notes and memos about a crash-safety report written by GM engineer 
Edward Ivey 26 years ago. GM has withheld the documents from 
plaintiffs, citing attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Ivey's research has already surfaced in several  
trials involving the safety of GM's fuel tanks, including one that 
led a California jury to award a record $4.9 billion in July. A 
judge later reducted that verdict to around $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogdon was harshly critical of GM and its lawyers in his  
ruling, accusing the company of trying to defraud the courts and 
obstruct justice by keeping the documents from plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In certain instances GM, by and through its counsel, toyed  
with and ignored court orders, ethical constraints and legal 
barriers,'' Brogdon wrote. ``Plaintiffs have exposed a shameful 
scheme by GM to defraud and mislead several courts, to thwart and 
obstruct justice and to enjoy the ill-gotten gains of likely 
perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Hill, an attorney for GM, said the company  
``emphatically denies'' any fraud or obstruction in the cases and 
will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia case was filed by the widow of George Yaw  
Bampoe-Parry, who died from burns he suffered when his Chevrolet 
Chevette was clipped in the rear and burst into flames in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens now is that the reckoning begins,'' said lawyer  
Jim Butler, who is representing Bampoe-Parry's widow. ``Two decades 
of concealing the truth and lying are coming to an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Ivey conducted a cost-benefit analysis of fire-related  
deaths in GM vehicles. The study which has been public for years 
and cited in various trials since the early 1980s, calculated that 
fuel-related fatalities cost the company $2.40 for every GM 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
	After interviewing Ivey in 1981 about the analysis, one GM  
lawyer wrote: ``Obviously, Ivey is not an individual whom we would 
ever, in any conceivable situation, want to be identified to the 
plaintiffs in a case and the documents he generated are undoubtedly 
some of the potentially most harmful and most damaging were they 
ever to be produced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has said Ivey's report was an independent intellectual  
exercise riddled with flaws. For this reason, GM has argued, it has 
never been adopted by the company and should not be given to a 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler has contended that former GM lawyer Kenneth Starr, the  
independent counsel who investigated President Clinton, 
participated in concealing documents related to Ivey's findings. He 
used to be a partner at the Kirkland &AMP; Ellis law firm and 
successfully argued that certain Ivey-related documents be shielded 
under the attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland &AMP; Ellis has strongly denied Butler's allegations about  
Starr and GM has said the company's representation by Starr and his 
law firm was ``proper in every respect.'' Brogdon made no mention 
of the independent counsel in his order.

<HEADLINE> Sega Goes High-Tech With Dreamcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sega's powerful new Dreamcast game console  
hit store shelves today, complete with flashy graphics, a computer 
that ``learns'' from its mistakes -- and the company's future quite 
possibly at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have managed to create a big buzz and now they have to  
deliver,'' said John Davison, editor-in-chief of Electronic Gaming 
Monthly, a magazine based in Oakbrook, Ill. ``They can't afford to 
stumble at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the buzz is working. Numerous stores across the country  
stayed open late Wednesday night and early today to give video-game 
fans a chance to be among the first with the new gaming system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be the first one to get the system. It's the  
best,'' said Ryan Ontiveros, 15, who had pitched a tent outside 
Software Etc. in San Jose on Tuesday night just to be sure he could 
get the game today. 
</P>
<P>
	Store employee John Deegan said about 1,500 people were lined up  
early today waiting to buy the console. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Grose, a 21-year-old college student joined a group of 30  
people at the Electronics Boutique store at the King of Prussia 
mall outside Philadelphia to wait in line for his Dreamcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been such a big fan of Sega, but then I saw how  
different the Dreamcast system was compared with everything else,'' 
said Grose. ``It was awe-inspiring. I couldn't believe how real it 
looked on the screen. I knew I had to have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast faces strong foes as the vital holiday selling season  
approaches, especially with industry leader Sony's PlayStation the 
clear leader and rival Nintendo's N64 doing well, 
</P>
<P>
	The Dreamcast retails for $199.99, reasonable for the power and  
features packed into it. But both Sony and Nintendo recently cut 
prices to under $100 -- and with far bigger game libraries, it may 
be hard to keep the momentum going after the first rush of 
excitement fades. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 games are currently available for the PlayStation,  
and new ones come out almost every week. Nintendo's library is 
smaller, but still more substantial than the 16 Dreamcast games, 
priced at about $50 each, available at today's launch. 
</P>
<P>
	With sales already drooping in Japan, industry watchers warn  
that Sega will have to provide a steady stream of new games for 
Dreamcast to make it in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Sega to succeed, they need to reach their goal of 1.5  
million units sold by next March,'' said Dan DeMatteo, president of 
Babage's Etc., a 500-store chain based in Dallas. ``They need to 
keep the third-party developers developing games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One element in Sega's favor: Both companies are planning  
Dreamcast fighters, though PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's ``Dolphin'' 
won't be ready until next year, giving Sega a good head start. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega was an industry leader in the early 1990s with its Genesis  
gaming console. But the replacement, Saturn, bombed when it was 
launched in 1995 and the Tokyo-based company now holds a puny 1 
percent of the U.S. video-game market. 
</P>
<P>
	With a $100 million marketing and advertising campaign, Sega  
hopes to convince consumers that the new 128-bit system -- four 
times as powerful as PlayStation and twice as fast as the N64 -- 
will provide a more exciting gaming experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast is the first home-gaming system to include Internet  
capabilities. With a built-in modem, consumers can e-mail, chat, 
browse the Web and download game enhancements. Starting next year, 
they'll be able to play one another online. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine features advanced 3-D graphics that make the  
on-screen images clear, crisp and marvelously detailed. In the 
Dreamcast football game, NFL2K, select bad weather and a 
spectacularly realistic rain storm begins on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast's computer brain can ``learn'' from mistakes. If your  
quarterback passes repeatedly to a single receiver, the game reacts 
after a handful of throws with a defense designed to counter that 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's not clear whether Dreamcast's high-tech capabilities  
will be enough to maintain momentum into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of good things about Dreamcast. It's price is  
right. It is very powerful,'' DeMatteo said. ``But there is that 
question looming out there over whether it be able to survive a war 
with the other players in the next few years.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Shuns Indonesia Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon suspended relations with the  
Indonesian military Thursday in protest against Indonesia's failure 
to contain the crisis in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was delivered personally to Gen. Wiranto, the chief  
of Indonesia's armed forces, by Navy Adm. Dennis Blair, commander 
of all U.S. forces in the Pacific. The rupture in military 
relations followed days of pleading by the Clinton administration 
for Indonesia to quell the violence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't think that it's appropriate, given the  
circumstances, that that relationship continue at this point,'' 
Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspending U.S. relations with the Indonesian military means an  
indefinite end to planning for any future joint military exercises 
and no further exchanges of liaison officers, Quigley said. He said 
it was not immediately clear whether the decision would interrupt 
U.S. arms sales to Indonesia or result in the expulsion of 
Indonesian military officers attending military academies in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the  
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he spoke to Wiranto by telephone on 
Monday and ``laid out for him in no uncertain terms what I thought 
we needed to see from Indonesia, and specifically from him.'' He 
said Indonesia has sufficient forces in East Timor to restore 
order, although Wiranto indicated he intends to send more troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of risk in terms of future relations with  
Indonesia,'' Shelton told the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
although he did not mention that the Pentagon had suspended 
military relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the committee, said he  
viewed the violence in East Timor as ``virtual genocide,'' although 
he had not decided whether it justified U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence in predominantly Catholic East Timor broke out  
after voters overwhelmingly chose independence from mostly Muslim 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the crisis in East Timor presents no threat to U.S.  
national interests that would justify placing American troops on 
the ground there. He said the Clinton administration had not yet 
ruled out taking an active role in helping resolve the crisis, but 
he said he saw no need to commit U.S. forces. He cited the 
possibility of contributing U.S. military communications, logistics 
or transport aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at East Timor by itself, I cannot see any national  
interest there that would be overwhelming, that would call for us 
to deploy or place U.S. forces on the ground in that area,'' 
Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American military does not have an extensive relationship  
with the Indonesian military, although it has held some joint 
exercises focusing on humanitarian aid operations and civil 
defense, Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has now been suspended in light of the current  
situation,'' the spokesman said. He did not explicitly criticize 
the performance of the Indonesian military in the East Timor 
crisis, but he reiterated the Clinton administration's plea for the 
Indonesians to act quickly to restore order and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said that the Pentagon has offered to provide the  
Australian military with ``planning staff'' from the U.S. Pacific 
Command in Hawaii, but that Australia had not yet requested any 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a top official at the International Monetary Fund  
called the situation in East Timor a ``humanitarian and political 
disaster'' and said Indonesia could lose further IMF support unless 
the violence is brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy IMF Managing Director Stanley Fischer said the crisis and  
a separate investigation into allegations of improper use of 
foreign loans by an Indonesian bank will have to be resolved before 
the IMF provides further loans. The IMF has a $12 billion support 
program to help Indonesia emerge from a severe recession triggered 
by a steep plunge in the value of its currency two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Legislature OKs HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Californians would gain the right to  
sue their health insurers and new insurance benefits under measures 
approved by the Legislature Thursday and sent to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The right to sue, one of the most contentious proposals, won  
Senate approval 22-9. Gov. Gray Davis is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would let consumers who suffer ``substantial''  
physical or financial harm from a health insurer's decision to 
delay or deny treatment to sue for the cost of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to sue over treatment decisions is being pushed by  
President Clinton in the so-called Patient Bill of Rights. 
Republicans advocate a more limited bill that gives patients new 
rights of appeal but no right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients would be guaranteed an independent review of disputed  
decisions by HMOs and other health plans to put off or refuse 
treatment recommended by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the way to Davis is a bill that would require health  
insurers to cover contraceptives. Other health care bills were 
expected to pass before the Legislature adjourns Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough on the health-care bills came Wednesday after  
more than a month of closed-door negotiations between the 
Democratic governor, who stressed a balance between cost and 
expanded patient benefits, and more liberal legislative Democrats, 
who wanted stronger consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature's minority Republicans, who were excluded from  
those negotiations, questioned the cost and effectiveness of each 
proposal, but overwhelmingly voted for most of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Court of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights,  
who criticized the secrecy of the negotiations, said the bill 
giving patients the right to sue ``is the biggest new tool for 
patients, the one that holds the most hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure defines substantial physical harm as ``loss of life,  
loss or significant impairment of limb or bodily function, 
significant disfigurement or severe and chronic physical pain.'' 
Financial harm is defined as the cost of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers could only sue after exhausting all of their rights  
through the independent review process, and could only seek damages 
if they were denied ``medically necessary'' treatment.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Tick Up / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages ticked up to 7.88 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.83 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb. So far this year,  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have ranged from a low of 6.74 
percent set at the end of January and a high of 8.15 percent set in 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.49 percent this week, also up from the average of 7.45 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.21 percent this week, up from 6.18 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage rates were on a roller coaster ride this week and  
Freddie Mac's survey caught the upward swing of that ride,'' said 
Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ``Overall, 
however, rates are almost unchanged from last week and we don't see 
any dramatic fluctuations either way in the near future,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending Sept. 3 
decreased 13.8 percent from the previous week and were down 49.3 
percent compared to the same week last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The association also reported that the rate of overall mortgage  
delinquencies nationwide held steady at 4.13 percent in the second 
quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Receives Chinese Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution is adding more  
than 5,000 art objects -- most from ancient China -- to its 
collection after a bequest by an immigrant from central Europe who 
made a career in the United States both as a collector and a 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	A foretaste of the gift from the late Dr. Paul Singer went on  
exhibit unannounced last month at the Smithsonian's Arthur M. 
Sackler Gallery. The 18 pieces include a bronze bell 3,000 years 
old and a pierced jade disk a millennium older. Scholars are still 
trying to figure out what kind of ceremony the disk was used for.

	``This generous gift ... adds enormous depth and range to the  
832 objects included in Dr. Sackler's original gift and greatly 
expands the opportunities we can offer for the study and exhibition 
of China's unique cultural heritage,'' said Milo Beach, director of 
the Sackler. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer and Sackler, both physicians, became close friends and  
associates. Sackler's children and foundations helped with the 
accumulation of Singer's collection, estimated to be worth about 
$60 million, in the last years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer left Austria in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution. He died  
in 1997 at 92. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singer collection was a museum in itself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Visitors to Singer's house frequently were surprised to find  
that his collection took up virtually every inch of space in each 
of the modestly proportioned rooms,'' Thomas Lawton, a former 
director of the Sackler wrote at the time of Singer's death. 
``Antiquities of every kind were arranged, according to material 
and type, in rows four or five deep on tiered shelves that lined 
all the walls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in what is now Bratislava, Slovakia, Singer began  
collecting East Asian art in nearby Vienna when he was 17. Later, 
he specialized in the southern China state of Chu, founded about 
2,800 years ago. Other experts were skeptical at first, but Lawton 
wrote that due in part to Singer's work ``the art of ... Chu 
emerged as one of the most exciting of all research topics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sackler is putting together a catalog of its new holdings.  
The collection makes it, along with its neighboring sister 
institution, the Freer Gallery, one of the leading centers for the 
study of Chinese art. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, another of the Smithsonian's 16 institutions will  
delve into a different ancient civilization with the help of 
today's technology. The Museum of Natural History will start 
showing, on a screen more than six stories high, the National 
Geographic Society's first large-format film -- ``Mysteries of 
Egypt.''

<HEADLINE> Online Auctions Feature Odd, Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Used, dirty underwear. A healthy human  
kidney. A young man's virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked among the Depression-era sherbet glasses and aging Sonny  
and Cher albums on Internet auction sites are an amazing array of 
items -- some of them illegal, and other simply just cranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for the jokesters and criminals, an online auction  
is one of the least anonymous places to try to pull a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an investigator calls, we tell them don't bother with a  
subpoena. We give them names, addresses, telephone numbers, credit 
card numbers, whatever we can,'' said Robert Chesnut, a former 
federal prosecutor who now works for eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy kidneys can be sold, but real ones are illegal. So are  
babies, child pornography and dirty underwear. Clean underwear, 
however, is legal, Chesnut said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's reporting has led to several fraud prosecutions,  
and eBay has worked with Secret Service agents, postal inspectors, 
New York Police Department detectives and other investigators 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's leading Internet auction site, eBay hosts thousands  
of legitimate auctions daily. It's one of the most popular sites on 
the Internet, with people gathering to bid on assorted items or to 
chat with other members of the personal trading community. 
</P>
<P>
	But eBay's high profile also lends itself to a number of crank  
proposals, which can often generate a few bids before being 
discovered by eBay officials and pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent example: an auction for a young man's virginity. (The  
seller did not respond to an Associated Press e-mail query). 
</P>
<P>
	And earlier this week, more than 75 human kidneys and several  
babies were posted for auction at eBay after one seller's hoax made 
national news. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has suspended all of the kidney and baby dealers  
from their site, and referred them to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there's room for people to be funny on the Internet,  
but I think people need to exercise good judgment. There are 
transplant patients waiting years for a kidney. To them, this is 
not a joking matter,'' said Steve Westly, eBay's vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the would-be kidney sellers contacted by The Associated  
Press said they were joking. However, Ian Thomas of Pass Christian, 
Miss., said he wasn't kidding when he posted an auction that began: 
``Health conscious, fully functional kidney, 30's male with daily 
intakes of springwater, vitamins and exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the buyer must pay hospital and travel expenses and that  
the surgery must take place in a ``top of the line-well known 
hospital.'' He also said that he would need a written legal 
agreement because he does not wish to break any laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this is no joking matter,'' he said. ``I hope more  
people do try to take it more seriously, for ultimately it does 
bring more awareness to this whole donor issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigo Sales, co-founder &AMP; CEO of San Bruno, Calif.-based  
Auctionwatch.com, said the bizarre and illegal sales are affecting 
all online auction sites, but that internal regulators at each site 
can keep them from getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the auction companies and the users themselves take an  
active role in policing their sites,'' he said. ``For the most 
part, the community tends to be very self regulating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, eBay banned the sale of guns and ammunition  
after people tried selling a missile, a bazooka, a Russian-made 
rocket launcher and other military weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing list of prohibited items at eBay also includes  
skulls, human remains, live animals, counterfeit items, false 
identification documents, explosives and police badges. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, there have been dozens of odd items put up for auction  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a group of engineers attempted to auction themselves  
as ``high-priced, professionally trained cybergeeks'' for $3.14 
million. The group unexpectedly stopped its own auction without 
comment, but not before receiving a number of bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Priceman.com, a Houston-based site that  
provides product price comparisons, tried to auction nearly half of 
its equity for at least $10 million before eBay stopped the auction 
over questions of legality. 
</P>
<P>
	Still items do slip through the cracks for a time, including  
this $100,100 item, offered for a short time this week before being 
pulled it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human liver for sale, freshly removed from a healthy 25 year  
old male, on ice at a university, time is of the essence do bid 
quickly, winning bidder will receive confirmation e-mail and 
instructions of payment (although cash in small unmarked bills is 
preferred) Good luck, this is a valuable item for many older folks 
who have been suffering from alcoholism.''

<HEADLINE>  Pickens Signs Deal With Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Wide receiver Carl Pickens ended his walkout  
Thursday and signed a one-year, $3.5 million deal with the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	He could play Sunday in Cincinnati's season opener against the  
Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, the Bengals' career receiving leader, met for three  
hours with Bengals president Mike Brown. The deal was announced 
after the team finished practice and left the Spinney Field 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish that this had been concluded earlier, but it's good  
that it's concluded so Carl can spend his golden years with the 
Bengals instead of in retirement,'' said Brown, who attempted to 
set a lighthearted tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, 29, said he would sit out the season rather than return  
to the Bengals, who tagged him as their franchise player but were 
unable to get a trade offer that included a first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the Bengals were trying to negotiate a long-term deal  
with Pickens, who will receive the average of the top five players 
at his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time changes everything,'' said Pickens, who faced the  
prospect of losing about $200,000 a week if he did not come to 
terms before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Pickens will play when coach Bruce Coslet thinks he  
is ready to contribute. The Bengals lost all of their preseason 
games, and their offense struggled without Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also struggled last season with Pickens as the Bengals  
finished 3-13 for the fourth time this decade. Pickens said he 
wanted out of Cincinnati after seven losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Bengals designated Pickens their franchise  
player, making it tougher for other teams to acquire him. Pickens 
ended up signing for the same amount that was offered earlier, but 
said he was prepared to sit out the season as late as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was prepared to do that 100 percent,'' Pickens said. ``If  
that's what I had to do, that's what I would have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Steve Zucker, apparently persuaded Pickens to meet  
face-to-face with Brown, and called Wednesday to set up a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called Mike, I fully expected nothing to happen,''  
Zucker said. ``But when I heard his voice, I told Carl, `If we go 
in and talk to the Bengals, something could happen.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens leads the Bengals in receptions (473), receiving  
touchdowns (57), single-season touchdowns (17), single-game 
receptions (13) and consecutive games with at least one reception 
(77). 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens has seldom talked to reporters during seven seasons with  
the Bengals, and despite his accomplishments on the field has not 
attempted to endear himself to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	One former Bengals player called Pickens ``a cancer'' in the  
locker room, and Pickens was asked how he thought teammates would 
react to his return. Before he could answer, Coslet leapt to his 
defense with an expletive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one guy, about two years ago, who said that,'' Coslet  
said. ``This guy ... when he practices, he practices 100 percent; 
when he plays, he plays 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's water under the bridge. Leave it alone, all right? That  
is not fair, at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Jack Brennan said the Bengals would have until  
game time Sunday to decide whether to activate Pickens for the 
season opener.

<HEADLINE> PBS Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ervin S. Duggan, president of the Public  
Broadcasting Service, resigned today after shepherding PBS through 
more than five years of ``mission-oriented'' growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``PBS has been significantly strengthened under Ervin Duggan's  
leadership,'' PBS Board Chairman Colin G. Campbell said in a 
statement. ``His efforts have earned the appreciation of our 
colleagues in public broadcasting and of a citizenry that 
recognizes and depends on the excellence he has championed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duggan said he had fulfilled his objectives for the Alexandria,  
Va.-based association of public television stations during his 
5 1/2-year tenure. ``A strategy to create greater financial security 
and enduring value for PBS and its member stations is now in 
place,'' Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have relished serving as a public champion of PBS's unique  
mission of education, culture and citizenship,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Duggan's reign, PBS increased revenues 70 percent -- from  
$182 million in 1995 to a projected $309 million in 2000. PBS, 
which serves 100 million people weekly, also took on new ventures, 
including PBS Online and the PBS Kids channel. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Duggan is not retiring, said PBS spokesman Tom Epstein.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to explore what else is out there,'' Epstein said.  
``He felt he couldn't look for something new while he was still 
full time with PBS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PBS board member John F. Swope will serve as interim chief  
executive when Duggan leaves Oct. 31.

<HEADLINE> Drugmaker Needs Its Own Pain Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products, stung by thousands  
of lawsuits over its once-popular diet drugs and a profusion of 
other product failures, is betting that a handful of new medicines 
will restore the company's flagging finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the drug maker, with $13 billion a year in  
revenues, is big enough to survive the troubles, but uncertainty 
will hang over the maker of Robitussin and Advil for at least 
another year. And that spells trouble for American Home on Wall 
Street, which has seen its stock price drop more than 40 percent 
since April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for them in way because almost every day  
something bad happens,'' said Sally Schaadt, an analyst with 
Fourteen Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's stock tumbled another $2.25, or 5 percent, to  
$40.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, after The Wall 
Street Journal reported the FBI is probing whether the company 
revealed all it knew about dangers of the diet drug Redux prior to 
its approval by the government in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Redux and its older chemical cousin Pondimin were sold by  
American Home with another drug in a combination called fen-phen. 
The treatments were pulled from the market in 1997 after being 
linked to heart valve problems. Thousands of patients have sued the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, which has denied any wrongdoing related to  
fen-phen, said it is unaware of an FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's troubles pushed its sales down by 5 percent last  
year. Its operating profits rose by less than 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's prescription for a turnaround centers on five new  
drugs, including a new sleeping pill, an ulcer and heartburn 
medication and a vaccine to prevent ear infections and pneumonia in 
infants. Sonata, the new sleeping pill, was approved last month. 
The other approvals are expected in the next eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a drug pipeline that rivals the best in the  
industry,'' said Robert Essner, American Home's executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also hopes to expand the use of its top selling  
drug, Premarin, an estrogen therapy that women take to lessen 
symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes and night sweats. 
</P>
<P>
	Essner said the company plans more aggressively market Premarin  
as a drug to prevent osteoporosis, a deteriorating bone disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite these hopes, American Home's problems are mounting.  
</P>
<P>
	This summer a jury awarded a Texas woman who claimed heart valve  
damage from fen-phen $23 million and a judge in Philadelphia 
certified a class-action suit that could require the company to pay 
out millions over years to monitor the health of fen-phen users. 
</P>
<P>
	This July, the company stopped selling its rotavirus vaccine,  
used to prevent serious diarrhea, after it was linked to dangerous 
bowel obstructions in infants. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, it had to recall 600,000 defective allergy kits used  
by people at risk for severe reactions from bee stings, certain 
foods or asthma. The drugs used in the kits weren't potent enough, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last month, the company reportedly agreed to pay $50  
million to settle claims by women that its contraceptive Norplant 
caused headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Home recalled Duract, a painkiller that  
caused fatal liver problems in some long-term users. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with these problems, Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht  
&AMP; Quist, has recommended American Home stock for months. ``Their 
pipeline is exceptionally good and expectations can't get any lower 
for their fen-phen liability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a worst-case scenario, Zisson estimates the company could end  
up paying as much as $10 billion to settle the diet drug suits. 
That's an amount, he said, American Home can afford. 
</P>
<P>
	But others are leery.  
</P>
<P>
	Hemant Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. said American Home can  
overcome some big one-time legal costs, but he worries about suits 
that call for the company to pay for medical monitoring thousands 
of patients for years. ``That can be really dangerous because you 
can't quantify it,'' Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home has been seen as a takeover target for months, but  
analysts say its legal liability could scare away potential 
suitors. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, American Home was poised to merge with Monsanto, a  
life sciences company, but it was called off because of disputes 
between executives of the two companies.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Workers Claim Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty black current and former employees of  
Bell Atlantic Corp. have filed a $50 million lawsuit alleging the 
company retaliates against workers who report discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District  
of Columbia, charges the telecommunications company has harassed 
and denied promotions to employees who complained about 
discrimination on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees involved in a 1996 discrimination suit against the  
company and those who have filed cases with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission are among the targets of retaliation, 
according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs file this suit to challenge and to bring to an  
end Bell Atlantic's practice of retaliation against individuals who 
protest Bell Atlantic's race discrimination and that company's 
unlawful retaliation,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic spokeswoman Joan Rasmussen said the company had  
not seen the complaint. But she said the company has a strong 
record of keeping discrimination out of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Bell Atlantic discrimination of any kind is completely  
unacceptable,'' Rasmussen said. ``We take allegations of 
discrimination very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $500 million suit filed by 48 workers in 1996 alleges the  
company discriminates against black workers in job placement, 
training and promotions. Those claims still may be pursued by 
individual defendants after a judge denied them class action 
status, said John Hermina, lawyer for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Tuesday lists a number of alleged acts of  
retaliation against employees who spoke out about discrimination. 
In one instance cited, a woman who had filed suit against Bell 
Atlantic for discrimination later pursued without success 125 job 
opportunities at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Another worker was monitored by colleagues at both his job and  
his home after charging the company engaged in discriminatory acts, 
according to the suit.

<HEADLINE> MTV Invades the Home of the Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Puff Daddy replaced Pagliacci and the Backstreet  
Boys elbowed out ``La Boheme'' as pop music's annual excuse for 
excess, the MTV Video Awards, invaded the Metropolitan Opera House 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedian Chris Rock, dressed as Rigoletto from the Verdi opera  
in a huge poster in the lobby but all in white on stage, was the 
host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be the first black man in history to take the stage of  
the Met without a mop,'' Rock quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the program where awards are less remembered than wardrobes  
or attempts to shock the censor. For the record, the rock band Korn 
had nine nominations, while Ricky Martin, TLC and Will Smith each 
had six. 
</P>
<P>
	After Rock poked fun at white rappers, Kid Rock offered raucous  
history lesson of the rock-rap collaboration by performing with 
members of Run-DMC and Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin invited his choreographer onstage to celebrate his best  
dance video award for ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' Leather-clad TLC 
members slapped hands with the audience before picking up a trophy 
for ``No Scrubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the award ceremony's usual home, Radio City Music Hall,  
under renovation, MTV went uptown for a new venue this year. The 
clash between high and low culture gave producers a rich vein of 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	In the venerable hall's lobby, the display cases stuffed with  
opera costumes were cleaned out in favor of moments from MTV's 
past: the hip-hugger pants Madonna wore to the 1995 video awards, 
Busta Rhymes' red crushed velvet ensemble from his appearance at 
the podium with Martha Stewart two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in gowns, a chorale group opened the show with an a  
capella version of Kid Rock's ``Bawitdaba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys were featured  
prominently in the nominations, as MTV reflected pop music's 
embrace of Latin rhythms and perky teen-age pop. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn's ``Freak on a Leash'' video, with its depiction of an  
animated bullet moving in slow motion through several scenes, was 
perhaps the most arresting image in a year of slickly produced 
music clips. 
</P>
<P>
	It competed for video of the year with Martin's ``Livin' La Vida  
Loca,'' the Backstreet Boys' ``I Want It That Way,'' Lauryn Hill's 
``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' and Smith's ``Wild Wild West.''

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Natalie Williams had 23 points and 15 rebounds  
and Lisa Leslie added 19 points as the U.S. women's national 
basketball team bolted to a 14-0 lead on the way to a 86-67 victory 
over Brazil in the opening round of the U.S. Olympic Cup on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the United States beat Brazil 111-87 in the  
Olympic gold medal game at Atlanta. Leslie scored 29 points in that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's game drew an estimated 200 to the 3,800-seat RIMAC  
Arena at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's other game, 18-year-old center-forward Lauren  
Jackson scored 31 points, including her team's first 11 points, as 
Australia beat Poland 80-64. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which took the Olympic bronze in 1996, will play the  
United States Friday night. Brazil will play Poland in an earlier 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-team, round-robin tournament will conclude with the  
medal games on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-sport Olympic Cup is a smaller version of the U.S.  
Olympic Festival, last held in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who plays for the WNBA's Utah Starzz, and Leslie, with  
the Los Angeles Sparks, helped the Americas take leads of 14-0 
after five minutes and 50-32 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with how we ran our motion offense,'' U.S. coach  
Nell Fortner said. ``We don't run that type of offense against the 
zone, and we hadn't practiced against the zone, but that's what we 
faced today and we handled it well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claudia Neves, who plays for the WNBA's Detroit Shock, led  
Brazil with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In a boxing semifinal, U.S. light flyweight Brian Viloria, in  
his first bout since winning the world championship, avenged two 
recent losses to Mexico's Liborio Romero. 
</P>
<P>
	Viloria recorded a 12-8 decision in the four-round bout,  
highlighted by second-round knockdown of Romero after taking a hard 
right to the face. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old winner from Honolulu advanced into Friday's  
final in the 106-pound division against Russia's Ali Omarov, who 
scored a 21-5 decision over the Ukraine's Oleksiy Malko. 
</P>
<P>
	Four countries are entered in the two-day event, which is  
limited to the eight lighter weight classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Viloria claimed his world crown in the Amateur Boxing  
Championships, Aug. 20-27 in Houston, when the United States also 
took the team title. He lost to Romero 16-14 earlier this year and 
3-0 in late 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. bantamweight Clarence Vinson, also from the American world  
team, recorded a 15-7 decision over Russia's Shafedin Allakhverdiev 
to advance into the final against the Ukraine's Eduard Lutsker in 
the 119-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel Elizondo of San Antonio, Texas, scored a 19-9 decision  
over Russia's Anatoli Lebedev in the flyweight division. In the 
125-pound featherweight class, Mexico's Luis Arceo recorded an 11-8 
decision over American Aaron Torres.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Court Addresses 'Shield Law' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state Supreme Court appeared divided on  
whether California's ``shield law'' allows journalists to withhold 
unpublished notes and television outtakes from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for a Sacramento television station and a Stockton  
prosecutor argued Wednesday over a judge's order that would send a 
news director to jail until she surrenders the entire videotape of 
an interview with a murder defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the court's first look in nearly a decade at the shield  
law, which protects reporters from being held in contempt for 
refusing to disclose confidential sources or unpublished material. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty other states have some type of law that allows  
journalists to withhold information sought in court cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the court ruled that reporters must turn over such  
evidence if it is vitally needed by criminal defendants, who have a 
constitutional right to a fair trial. That case left unanswered the 
question posed Wednesday: whether prosecutors are entitled to equal 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	Charity Kenyon, lawyer for KOVR-TV and news director Ellen  
Miller, argued that allowing prosecutors to penetrate the shield 
law and see unpublished material would make the media ``a direct 
conduit of information to the government.'' She also said 
prosecutors weren't entitled to the same constitutional protection 
as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamental purpose of the Bill of Rights ... is to  
protect individuals, citizens, from the excesses of government ... 
not to protect government,'' Kenyon said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Deputy Attorney General Susan Orton said barring disclosure  
to prosecutors in all cases would allow ``media domination of what 
shall be released to the prosecutor, whose obligation is to 
determine the truth.'' She said disclosure would be required only 
in exceptional cases, when the evidence couldn't be found 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Joyce Kennard told Orton she seemed to be calling for a  
rewriting of the state Constitution to protect the government from 
individuals. Justice Ming Chin told the state lawyer that 
journalists, as well as prosecutors, seek the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar said the  
shield law in this case would be used to protect material that the 
trial court described as neither confidential nor sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape contained a jailhouse interview with a man who  
allegedly tortured and murdered a cellmate. His description of some 
of the events of the killing was paraphrased by a KOVR reporter in 
a voice-over. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney sought the entire tape, but KOVR provided  
only the part that was broadcast, arguing that the shield law 
protected the outtakes.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bill Lets Patients Sue HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Patients in California who suffer  
substantial harm from a health insurer's decision to modify, delay 
or deny treatment would have the right to sue their HMO under a 
bill awaiting final legislative approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Assembly on Wednesday passed the measure, which now  
goes to the Senate for review. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would also give patients the right to have an  
independent physician review decisions by health plans that put off 
or refuse treatment recommended by patients' physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers would be allowed to sue only after exhausting all of  
their rights through the independent review process, and could only 
seek damages if they were denied ``medically necessary'' treatment, 
rather than a broader ``medically appropriate'' standard sought by 
some consumer advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend for the independent review process to resolve the  
vast majority of disputes with only a very, very narrow doorway for 
litigation,'' said Democratic Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, a 
co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehl said the compromise allows suits by patients to recover  
the cost of needed care they received from other doctors after 
being wrongfully turned down by their HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	While the proposal allows suits against HMOs for delaying or  
denying treatment, it would not allow medical malpractice suits 
against HMOs for an attending physician's actions. That would 
remain a legal issue between the patient and the physician or 
physician group providing care.

<HEADLINE> Ex-College Coach Raveling Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Former college coach George Raveling was  
hospitalized in Thursday after passing out while putting the Nike 
NBA All-Star team through a workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at the Asepeyo clinic at Sant Cugat, just outside  
Barcelona, said Raveling would be kept overnight for observation. 
He was said to be in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, it was feared Raveling had suffered a heart attack,  
but doctors ruled that out and said the illness was more likely due 
to something the coach had eaten. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Nike said Raveling had passed out because of  
stress from a busy schedule in recent months. The company said it 
expected him to be ready to coach the All Stars, which include 
Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen, for a game Friday against FC 
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	Raveling, in his 31 years as coach, took three teams to NCAA  
Tournaments, Washington State, Iowa and Southern Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the Olympic team and was voted national coach of the  
year.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates Brown Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury spent six hours Thursday deliberating  
in football Hall of Famer Jim Brown's domestic violence case 
without reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of eight men and four women sent no messages, asked no  
questions and retired for the day without giving any indication of 
whether they were close to a decision. They were scheduled to 
resume deliberations Friday morning at Hollywood Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, is charged with making a terrorist threat against his  
25-year-old wife and vandalizing her car by smashing the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The football great has a history of domestic violence charges,  
but never has been convicted. Jurors heard testimony during the 
seven-day trial about his relationship with Monique Brown and her 
911 call on the night of June 15 reporting that her husband had 
threatened her life and there was a gun in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown later recanted her allegations against her  
husband, but the city attorney's office decided to prosecute 
without her cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, defense lawyers portrayed Monique Brown as  
mentally unstable. Prosecutors said she was an abuse victim who was 
browbeaten into recanting her story.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Missing Girl Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The parents of a 5-month-old girl reported  
missing nearly two years ago were charged Thursday with conspiracy 
and lying to investigators. The federal indictment against them 
said they discussed the girl's death and possible stories to tell 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven and Marlene Aisenberg allegedly lied about the  
disappearance of their daughter, Sabrina. Although prosecutors said 
she was not kidnapped, authorities still do not know what happened 
to the girl after her mother reported her missing from their 
suburban home in Brandon on Nov. 24, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said the parents provided a fake picture of the  
girl, solicited money for a bank account for her then used the 
money to pay credit cards and schemed to wrongly blame a Michigan 
man for the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs were arrested near Baltimore where they now live.  
Their lawyer did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment detailed a conversation in which Mrs. Aisenberg  
blamed her husband for the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baby's dead and buried. It was found dead because you did  
it,'' Mrs. Aisenberg told her husband less than a month after the 
reported disappearance. ``The baby's dead no matter what you say -- 
you just did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He replied: ``Honey, there was nothing I could do about it. We  
need to discuss the way that we can beat the charge. I would never 
break from the family pact and our story even if the police were to 
hold me down. We will do what we have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another conversation, Aisenberg was quoted as telling his  
wife: ``I wish I hadn't harmed her.'' And Mrs. Aisenberg replied: 
``I just can't take the rap for this,'' according to the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents would not disclose the source of the  
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillsborough County Sheriff Cal Henderson, whose office led an  
exhaustive kidnapping investigation that covered 49 states and six 
countries, said the indictment indicates ``the child is not 
alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we just don't know,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Aisenberg, 35, is charged in five counts; Mrs. Aisenberg, 36, is  
charged in six counts. If convicted he would face a maximum of 25 
years in prison and a $1.25 million fine; she would face up to 30 
years and a $1.5 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	When reporting the baby's disappearance, Mrs. Aisenberg said she  
last saw her daughter around midnight and that her crib was empty 
when she returned to the girl's room at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	A month after Sabrina's disappearance, the Aisenbergs publicly  
pleaded for her safe return. Mrs. Aisenberg spoke through sobs, 
asking whoever had the baby to drop her off at a safe place and 
notify authorities.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Shatters Moscow Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Authorities searched for survivors and clues after  
a massive explosion tore apart a nine-story apartment building 
today, killing at least 23 people and leaving dozens more feared 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers said more than 150 people were hospitalized with  
serious injuries after being pulled from the wreckage. Up to 100 
people could be buried under the mounds of smoking debris, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov visited the blast site and said a  
``terrorist act'' appeared to be the most likely cause of the 
explosion on the southeast fringes of the capital, near the Moscow 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	Other officials said the blast was caused by a gas leak or  
explosives possibly stored in the building -- which could bring the 
mayor under fire for negligence in enforcing building regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin originally pointed to a gas leak  
as the cause of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day wore on, however, Luzhkov and some other officials  
said evidence pointed to a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nature of the damage and the number of casualties''  
suggests an explosive device was placed in the building, the 
Federal Security Service, the country's main intelligence agency, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Stavitsky, the deputy press chief for the security  
service, said the blast had been centered in a store on the first 
floor. He said industrial explosives equivalent to 660-880 pounds 
of TNT or a great quantity of fireworks had caused the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Bogdanov, press officer of the Moscow branch of the  
security service, said the blast may have been caused by explosives 
stored in the building. He said that no scenarios have been ruled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous caller told the Interfax news agency that the  
Moscow explosion and a Saturday night bomb blast in southern Russia 
were in response to Russia's military campaign against Islamic 
rebels in the southern territory of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no way to determine the authenticity of the claim, and  
the Federal Security Service said it had not received any claims of 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful explosion shook the southeast Moscow neighborhood  
shortly after midnight. Early today, more than 100 rescuers were 
combing the wreckage for survivors. Fire and choking smoke made it 
unlikely that anyone trapped in the rubble had survived, rescue 
workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing's for sure, there are a lot more people in there.  
It's really unlikely there are any left alive,'' said Nikolai 
Vavkhenin, an emergency worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast completely collapsed all nine stories in the center  
section of the block-long building, but it left apartments standing 
on either side. The building is part of a huge complex of apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people living in neighboring buildings were injured by  
flying glass and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching television and suddenly there was a huge  
explosion. It was very quick and very strong,'' said a resident of 
the building who gave his name only as Marif. ``Our rooms filled 
with smoke, and the glass blew out of the windows. We ran onto the 
street as fast as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue teams used cranes, bulldozers and dump trucks to remove  
mangled trees and huge slabs of shattered masonry. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion shattered windows in buildings hundreds of yards  
from the blast and flipped over cars in surrounding streets. 
Several bodies were hurled more than 30 yards from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was around midnight when there was such a powerful  
explosion and all the windows in my apartment were blown out. My 
balcony door was closed at the time, and it felt like the whole 
apartment was exploding,'' said a woman who lived in an adjacent 
building. She declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty ambulances and 45 fire trucks were at the scene along with  
Luzhkov and other senior officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like something flew overhead and then exploded.  
We even joked at the time that it was a UFO,'' said another 
neighbor, who would only give her name as Marina. 
</P>
<P>
	Echo of Moscow, a radio station, said authorities were searching  
for a car that had been seen shortly before the explosion. The 
report did not say why the car was being sought. 
</P>
<P>
	A huge bomb blamed on Islamic radicals destroyed a military  
housing complex Saturday in the southern republic of Dagestan. The 
militants, who are fighting for a separate Islamic state, had 
threatened to strike targets in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb in a shopping center in central Moscow last week killed  
one person. Authorities were trying to determine who was 
responsible for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has experienced natural gas explosions in the past  
because of the city's crumbling infrastructure, including a blast 
in July 1998 that killed six people.

<HEADLINE> Governor's Feather May Be Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis received an eagle feather  
from a tribal representative last week, but it may be illegal for 
him to keep it, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of the highest honors among American Indians to be  
presented with an eagle feather since the plume symbolizes success 
and spiritual power. But unless a person has a government permit to 
possess eagle parts, it's a misdemeanor punishable by six months in 
jail or a $1,000 fine. Indians are issued such permits to use eagle 
parts in religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in his office,'' Davis spokesman Michael Bustamente said  
Wednesday. ``As I understand it, it is a very high privilege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A California Department of Fish and Game spokesman told the  
newspaper that a person ``can't possess any raptor feather under 
state or federal law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the unidentified spokesman said there is an exemption that  
allows the state to own eagle feathers. Since Davis is the state's 
governor, the spokesman suggested, it may be legal for Davis to 
retain the feather. 
</P>
<P>
	Bustamente told the paper that Davis accepted the feather on  
behalf of the state, not himself. The governor's lawyers are 
looking at obtaining the necessary permits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was presented the feather by Mark Nichols, chief executive  
of the Cabazon band of Mission Indians, during negotiations on the 
issue of gambling on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Schoonover, director of legal affairs for the Cabazon band,  
said the tribe did not ``give'' the feather to Davis, but he was 
``entrusted'' with it. He said Indians believe no one can own an 
animal, expect for the creator. 
</P>
<P>
	Californians had approved a voter initiative to expand Indian  
gambling, but the state Supreme Court last month invalidated the 
measure. The tribes have until early October to reach an agreement 
with Davis to avoid having thousands of video slot machines shut 
down by federal authorities.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Touts Train Despite Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak is continuing with a roughly $7 million  
advertising campaign for its new ``Acela'' service, even though 
equipment problems have delayed the start of high-speed train 
service in the Northeast until the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were supposed to generate interest before the train's  
scheduled introduction late this year. Amtrak officials said the 
campaign would stay on course, despite Acela's delay, because the 
ads not only will promote the new train but also service upgrades 
on other trains in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not about the high-speed train; it's about the  
rebranding of the service,'' said Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington. 
``It's getting the name out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the ads, all of which were bought before Amtrak  
announced the delay last week, feature the new train -- a 
silver-and-turqoise bullet train that will eventually run at 160 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The new signs are part of a $20 million overall ad campaign by  
Amtrak this year. They are appearing on buses, billboards and other 
outdoor sites in Boston, New York, Washington, Philadelphia, 
Providence, R.I., and New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year Amtrak rolled out the Acela name in move  
theater ads shown before films such as ``Star Wars'' and ``Notting 
Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new train's builder, Montreal-based Bombardier-Alstom, faces  
fines for not delivering the high-speed cars on time. But Amtrak 
said it has no plans to seek reimbursement for the ad campaign. The 
ads ``are getting people's attention and that's the whole 
purpose,'' Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak and Bombardier-Alstom announced last week that premature  
wear on the new train's wheels would delay its rollout until next 
spring at the earliest. The discovery was made while testing one of 
20 new eight-car train sets at a site in Pueblo, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a set of wheels has been modified and shipped to  
Philadelphia, where it has been placed on a second test train. That 
train, which has already run at 90 mph, will begin runs with the 
new wheels next week. Eventually it will speed up to 165 mph, 5 mph 
over its service speed but the train's actual design speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acela Express'' will be the name on the new trains, which will  
run in the Boston-New York-Washington corridor. Amtrak also plans 
to rename services from Newport News, Va., to Buffalo, N.Y., as 
either ``Acela Regional'' or ``Acela Commuter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regional and commuter lines will offer 333 completely  
refurbished passenger cars and 52 redesigned cafe cars. The 
regional service will start in January with two daily roundtrips 
between Boston, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On each segment, the travel time will be less than four hours --  
not the 2 1/2 to 3 hours that will be provided by the new train. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak also is investing in new stations and a new reservation  
system, and has retrained 10,000 employees to give passengers 
better service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the train itself isn't going to cut it,'' Remington said.  
``Most likely, people would ride it once and then not come back. 
You've got to upgrade all aspects of your service.''

<HEADLINE> Dreamcast 1st Day Sales Seem Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sega's powerful new Dreamcast system flew  
out of stores Thursday as fans, eager for the latest in video 
gaming, snapped up machines the struggling company hopes will 
return it to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	First-day sales figures will not be available until Friday. But  
the company, which laid off about 1,000 employees and lost $400 
million in its last fiscal year, says it is happy with early 
reports from retailers. More than 300,000 systems were presold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judging by last night, things are going phenomenal,'' said  
Sega spokesman Chase, who uses only his last name. 
</P>
<P>
	A dramatic turnaround will not be easy. Dreamcast's two rivals,  
Sony and Nintendo, have entrenched systems on the market, and offer 
far more games than the 16 on shelves so far for the CD-based 
Dreamcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Things don't get any easier. Both rivals will release  
next-generation systems next year. Although Nintendo must come up 
with all new games for its switch from the N64's cartridge format 
to a CD-based system, Sony will continue to use CDs for PlayStation 
II, allowing existing games to work with the upcoming machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The early word on Dreamcast from retailers was mostly positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's selling very strong, extremely strong,'' said Noah  
Garden, director of product marketing for online retailer 
Outpost.com. ``They're moving out like fire, way above and beyond 
our expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We got 176 units, and all of them were reserved,'' said  
Roseanne Disandro, director of a Toys R Us store in Redwood City, 
20 miles south of San Francisco. ``The disappointment level was 
pretty high'' for those tried to buy without a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The picture wasn't all rosy for Sega.  
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jones, manager of Funcoland in Issaquah, Wash., a Seattle  
suburb, said the store took 50 to 60 reservations, less than the 
100 to 150 he hoped for. The store opened at midnight and sold 13 
more, plus another couple after opening for business Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales are good on it, but they're not as good as for the  
(Sony) PlayStation,'' Jones said. ``People are not as convinced 
that it's a good product yet, so they're kind of reluctant to buy 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dreamcast retails for $199.99, while both Sony and Nintendo  
recently cut system prices to under $100. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 games are available for the PlayStation. The N64  
has about 165. Sega promises to have about 20 Dreamcast games on 
the market by Christmas, priced at about $50 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega was at the top of its game in the early 1990s with the  
Genesis console. But replacement Saturn, launched in 1995, was a 
turkey, and the Tokyo-based company now has a measly 1 percent of 
the U.S. video-game market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega is spending $100 million to market and advertise Dreamcast,  
focusing on its fabulous graphics and power. The 128-bit 
microprocessor is four times as powerful as PlayStation and twice 
as fast as the N64. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast also is the first console with a modem for Internet  
access. When the network is in place starting next year, you'll be 
able to play other gamers online. 
</P>
<P>
	Some gamers seemed happy to spend half the night for a crack at  
one of the new consoles. 
</P>
<P>
	At Software Etc. in San Jose, Calif., as many as 500 systems  
sold overnight, said senior salesman Matt Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,500 people lined up outside the store early Thursday.  
Among them was Ryan Ontiveros, 15, who pitched a tent outside the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be the first one to get the system,'' he said  
excitedly. ``It's the best.''

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Stresses Independent Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bill Bradley emphasized today his  
appeal among independents and Republicans and suggested it makes 
him more electable than Vice President Al Gore in a general 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm out campaigning in restaurants and hotels, in  
airports, people come up to me and say, 'I'm Independent. Or, I'm a 
Republican. I will vote for you. I would never vote for him,''' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it to mean that in a general election, it's important  
to get independents and Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential hopeful's remarks at a press  
conference under the backyard basketball hoop of his boyhood home 
spoke to fears among some Democrats that Gore, the party 
establishment's favorite for the nomination, is not a sure bet 
against Republican frontrunner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears are backed up by national polls showing Bush would  
trounce Gore in a head-to-head matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who launched his intensified fall campaign with a  
hometown rally here on Wednesday, is grappling for ways to 
distinguish himself from Gore -- and offer voters a clear choice -- 
despite the fact that they have similar records on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	His Wednesday address sounded a call to renew traditional  
Democratic commitments to the poor and disadvantaged. It also 
emphasized themes of trust and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Bradley thrice declined direct opportunities to question  
the integrity of the Clinton-Gore administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was asked if the latest allegations of an administration  
coverup over Waco signaled a crisis of confidence in the 
administration. He replied only that it was ``a good sign'' that 
former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, a Republican, was picked to 
investigate the FBI's involvement in the deadly Branch Davidian 
standoff in Waco, Texas, six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more I choose to say today other than that''  
about the Clinton-Gore administration's integrity, Bradley 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator was carrying his call for a  
``deeper prosperity'' than that achieved under Gore and President 
Clinton from his sleepy hometown to a black fraternity in St. 
Louis, through the Mississippi River home of Mark Twain and through 
to Iowa, where winter nominating caucuses will launch the 2000 
presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to  
improve the well-being of all our citizens,'' Bradley said at his 
Wednesday kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised a Bradley White House that would pursue big,  
essential goals, with strict gun control, campaign finance reform, 
universal health insurance and the eradication of child poverty 
topping his list. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview taped earlier and broadcast this morning,  
Bradley signaled out gun control and the differences he sees 
between Gore and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the vice president, Bradley told NBC's ``Today'' show, ``I  
think we'd be very different presidents. ... I had a life before I 
got into politics and after I left the Senate. I think the vice 
president has had a life based mostly in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he is a stronger advocate of gun control than is  
Gore. ``We're at a time where we need registration of all handguns 
in America ... and he has not supported that,'' Bradley said. 
``Registration is the key. ... If we can do it for automobiles we 
can do it for handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dramatic upheaval, such as that needed to topple Gore as the

<HEADLINE> McVeigh Lawyer Speaks Out on Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Timothy McVeigh's trial lawyer says he  
believes full disclosure of the FBI's actions in the Branch 
Davidian standoff would have eliminated the motive for the Oklahoma 
City bombing two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Jones said he agrees with prosecutors who believed  
McVeigh was angry about the outcome of the government's attempt to 
arrest David Koresh at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, 
in 1993. The ensuing 51-day standoff ended in a fire that killed 
Koresh and about 80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the wheels of justice worked and there been an independent  
investigation and the responsibility assessed, there would have 
been no reason for an attack on the federal government in Oklahoma 
City,'' Jones said in a Tulsa World story published today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oklahoma City was a retaliation for what happened at Waco and  
the cover-up,'' Jones said. ``Much of what has come out in the last 
10 days we knew in 1996 and 1997.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was sentenced to die for setting the bomb that killed  
168 people at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 
1995 -- two years to the day after the fire at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	After previous denials, the FBI recently acknowledged using  
pyrotechnic devices -- combustible tear gas canisters -- during the 
standoff. Officials still say the devices could not have started 
the fire, though. Former Republican Sen. John Danforth today was 
named to head an independent inquiry into the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch would not let him  
use information about Waco at McVeigh's sentencing because the 
judge did not want the government's actions in the standoff to be 
on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to say to a jury, if it found McVeigh guilty, that  
means they have to accept the government's motives -- he did it 
because of Waco,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Frank Keating, a former federal lawyer and FBI agent, said  
the new information doesn't change the conclusion that ``Koresh was 
a maniac who murdered his own people'' but does damage the 
government's credibility.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. Looks for Rebound Vs. UCLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With most marquee matchups still a week away, the second full  
week of the college football season still offers some interesting 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time ACC champion and top-ranked Florida State opens  
defense of its conference title against No. 10 Georgia Tech, and 
No. 16 Notre Dame looks to rebound from a loss to Michigan at No. 
20 Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season, UCLA's visit to Ohio State Saturday night  
figured to be one of the best early matchups. Now both teams are 
just trying to save face. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 14 UCLA (1-0) hopes to distance itself from the humiliation  
of having 16 current and former players accused of illegally 
obtaining and displaying handicapped-parking permits. Seven 
starters and four backups were suspended for the Bruins' first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Toledo said his team isn't in nothing-to-lose mode  
because of all the reserves on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're UCLA. We're going there to play our hearts out and to  
win,'' he said. ``I want our players to feel good about themselves 
and I want them to play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 13th-ranked Ohio State is still smarting from a  
lethargic 23-12 loss to Miami in the Kickoff Classic two weeks ago. 
The Buckeyes played ``like they didn't want to be there,'' coach 
John Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way we can start 0-2,'' quarterback Austin Moherman said.  
``So it's definitely a must-win situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State hasn't lost its first two games since 1986 and hasn't  
dropped a home opener in 21 years. The Buckeyes have won 32 of 33 
non-conference games at Ohio Stadium since a 23-20 loss to Stanford 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a streak going,'' Toledo said. ``Ohio State didn't  
want to lose to Miami and they don't want to lose to us, so you'll 
have two teams out there fighting hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA could be without receiver Danny Farmer, who caught 58  
passes for 1,274 yards and nine TDs a year ago from Cade McNown. 
Farmer is recovering from an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games Saturday, No. 2 Penn State is home against  
Pittsburgh; No. 4 Florida meets Central Florida; California is at 
No. 5 Nebraska; No. 6 Michigan entertains Rice; Ball State is at 
No. 9 Wisconsin; Alabama-Birmingham is at No. 11 Virginia Tech; 
South Carolina faces No. 12 Georgia; Temple is at No. 17 Kansas 
State; Middle Tennessee visits No. 19 Arizona; No. 21 Alabama is 
home to Houston; No. 22 Virginia visits Clemson; No. 23 North 
Carolina State faces William &AMP; Mary; and Nevada is at No. 24 
Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (1-0) is a 16 1/2-point favorite at home against the  
Yellow Jackets (1-0), who haven't beaten the Seminoles in seven 
tries, including a 34-7 loss last season. Florida State has won 41 
straight home games and last lost at home in 1991, 17-16 to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles fullback William McCray is out for the season with a  
broken ankle. Senior QB-turned-FB Dan Kendra will start in his 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fighting Irish (1-1) beat Purdue 31-30 last season, but the  
Boilermakers have won seven consecutive games overall, the longest 
streak in the Big Ten. They haven't won eight straight since 
1966-67, but are 11-1 at home under coach Joe Tiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame will key on keeping Purdue's strong-armed quarterback  
Drew Brees off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to control the football to try to keep them off the  
field with their offense,'' Irish coach Bob Davie said. ``But they 
are such a quick-strike offense that they are going to score 
points, so you can't just button it up and say you are going to 
just run the football. You are going to have to create some plays 
to score some points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame's Jarious Jackson threw for a career-high 302 yards  
against Michigan, but had five errant option pitches, fumbled as he 
was sacked near the goal line and was sacked three other times. 
He's also thrown four interceptions already. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback missed several practices this week with a turf  
toe injury, but is expected to play.

<HEADLINE>  Bradley Stresses Independent Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bill Bradley emphasized today his  
appeal among independents and Republicans and suggested it makes 
him more electable than Vice President Al Gore in a general 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm out campaigning in restaurants and hotels, in  
airports, people come up to me and say, 'I'm Independent. Or, I'm a 
Republican. I will vote for you. I would never vote for him,''' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it to mean that in a general election, it's important  
to get independents and Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential hopeful's remarks at a press  
conference under the backyard basketball hoop of his boyhood home 
spoke to fears among some Democrats that Gore, the party 
establishment's favorite for the nomination, is not a sure bet 
against Republican frontrunner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears are backed up by national polls showing Bush would  
trounce Gore in a head-to-head matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who launched his intensified fall campaign with a  
hometown rally here on Wednesday, is grappling for ways to 
distinguish himself from Gore -- and offer voters a clear choice -- 
despite the fact that they have similar records on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	His Wednesday address sounded a call to renew traditional  
Democratic commitments to the poor and disadvantaged. It also 
emphasized themes of trust and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Bradley thrice declined direct opportunities to question  
the integrity of the Clinton-Gore administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was asked if the latest allegations of an administration  
coverup over Waco signaled a crisis of confidence in the 
administration. He replied only that it was ``a good sign'' that 
former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, a Republican, was picked to 
investigate the FBI's involvement in the deadly Branch Davidian 
standoff in Waco, Texas, six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more I choose to say today other than that''  
about the Clinton-Gore administration's integrity, Bradley 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator was carrying his call for a  
``deeper prosperity'' than that achieved under Gore and President 
Clinton from his sleepy hometown to a black fraternity in St. 
Louis, through the Mississippi River home of Mark Twain and through 
to Iowa, where winter nominating caucuses will launch the 2000 
presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to  
improve the well-being of all our citizens,'' Bradley said at his 
Wednesday kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised a Bradley White House that would pursue big,  
essential goals, with strict gun control, campaign finance reform, 
universal health insurance and the eradication of child poverty 
topping his list. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview taped earlier and broadcast this morning,  
Bradley signaled out gun control and the differences he sees 
between Gore and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the vice president, Bradley told NBC's ``Today'' show, ``I  
think we'd be very different presidents. ... I had a life before I 
got into politics and after I left the Senate. I think the vice 
president has had a life based mostly in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he is a stronger advocate of gun control than is  
Gore. ``We're at a time where we need registration of all handguns 
in America ... and he has not supported that,'' Bradley said. 
``Registration is the key. ... If we can do it for automobiles we 
can do it for handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dramatic upheaval, such as that needed to topple Gore as the  
establishment Democrats' favorite for their party's presidential 
nomination, seemed to be on Bradley's mind Wednesday as he led a 
gaggle of reporters on a sunset tour of his boyhood haunts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a field of weeds and grass bearing no trace of the Pittsburgh  
Plate Glass factory that once gave this small town an audible hum -- 
not to mention jobs for its 4,000 residents -- Bradley said he was 
reminded of ``how life has unknown terms and how change is all 
around us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator and pro-basketball star is  
focusing this post-Labor-Day stretch on introducing himself and his 
personal ethos to a broader audience than he has yet reached in 
some seven months of low-profile campaigning. 
</P>

Post-ABC poll putting Bradley far behind Gore, 29 percent to 64 
percent among those who lean toward voting Democratic.

</P>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The immensely popular Pokemon trading  
cards are joining G.I. Joe and Monopoly in the toy lineup of Hasbro 
Inc. The nation's second-largest toy maker said today it is buying 
Wizards of the Coast, a games company that not only sells Pokemon 
cards but also owns the best-selling game Magic: The Gathering as 
well as Dungeons &AMP; Dragons. The $325 million deal is the latest 
acquisition in Hasbro's steady expansion into the games industry. 
Hasbro will also get dozens of shops in the deal with the potential 
to sell more of its goods. Shares in Hasbro closed down 5/16 at 
24 1/2.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher today as a late rally  
lifted a market that had sputtered for much of the day amid worries 
about a sinking dollar and rising interest rates. At the close of 
trading on Wall Street, the Dow industrials were up 43.06 at 
11,079.40. Broader stock indicators also ended higher. Internet and 
technology companies were the strongest performers. IBM helped the 
Dow contain its losses. Yahoo rose after Lehman Brothers raised its

World Market launched coverage with a ``strong buy'' 
recommendation.

on television.'' The ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC begins 
Sunday and continues through Sept. 25. The National Council of La 
Raza counts just one Hispanic -- Martin Sheen, on NBC's ``The West 
Wing'' -- among the lead characters in the 38 new series premiering

more than $25 million in TiVo and will become one of the company's

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar jumped against the yen Friday morning  
after Japan's central bank repeatedly intervened to stem the U.S. 
currency's slide. Tokyo stock prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.92 yen at late morning, up 1.08 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its level of 107.78 yen 
in New York. The dollar had traded at 107.65 yen before the 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 138.96 points, or 0.79 percent,  
to 17,816.52 at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, the 
average closed up 36.18 points, or 0.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially sank further against  
the yen in early Asian trading, extending its three-year low hit in 
New York on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bank of Japan intervened, buying dollars in an attempt  
to stop the yen's rapid rise, lifting the U.S. currency above 109 
yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa confirmed  
later that Japanese authorities stepped into foreign exchange 
markets to weaken the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the BOJ chose today to intervene ... on worries that  
standing to the sidelines would create a vicious circle of a strong 
yen and stock losses,'' said Shuji Takano of ABN AMRO bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the central bank intervened intermittently,  
purchasing an estimated $1 billion in an attempt to push the 
currency above 110 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu  
Nonaka said an excessive strengthening of the yen could damage 
Japan's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the dollar plunged to its lowest level  
against the Japanese currency since August 1996 after Japan 
reported that the nation's economy grew at an annualized rate of

<HEADLINE> Swede Sued for Web Music Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A Swedish teen-ager is awaiting a  
verdict on charges of Internet music piracy in a case that a 
recording industry lawyer said is the first of its kind in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint against Tommy Olsson was brought by the Swedish  
branch of the International Federation of the Phonographic 
Industry, which represents 53 record companies. A hearing was held 
Wednesday at a court in Skoevde, about 175 miles southwest of 
Stockholm, and a verdict is to be announced next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsson, 17, allegedly made copyright-protected recordings  
available for free via a page he created on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsson's Web page posted links to files that contained  
recordings, including pop hits such as Madonna's ``Ray of Light.'' 
Anyone accessing the files could record the music. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsson did not create the files, copy them or send them to  
others, ``he just spread information about where to find them,'' 
said his attorney Per Olof Almer. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the first of its kind in Europe, said Magnus  
Maartensson, attorney for Swedish IFPI, which over the past two 
years has moved against about 1,000 Swedish Web pages in copyright 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsson's case is the first to reach the courts.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the entire record industry against a lone  
17-year-old,'' said Maartensson. ``If one person buys a single and 
posts it on the Internet, the entire world can access it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olsson made only a few hundred dollars by posting ads on the  
page, Maartensson said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olsson is convicted, he'll likely face a fine of $150-$250.  
</P>
<P>
	That amount probably won't deter others, Maartensson said. ``But  
if he's convicted, we have the right to demand damages, and that 
will be a much larger amount.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Wary on N. Korea, Iran Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the next 15 years, North Korea and Iran  
are likely to develop missiles potentially capable of killing 
millions of Americans, the CIA said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an intelligence report with major implications for the  
Pentagon's efforts to develop defenses against ballistic missiles, 
the CIA said Iraq posed an additional -- though somewhat more 
distant -- threat. It said it was questionable whether Iraq could 
test a missile with enough range to reach the United States before 
2015, although the likelihood depends heavily on how much foreign 
assistance Iraq gets. 
</P>
<P>
	The report characterized the prospect of North Korea acquiring a  
long-range missile by 2015 as ``most likely,'' Iran's prospect was 
judged to be ``probable'' and Iraq was labeled a ``possible'' 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	These emerging missile forces ``potentially can kill tens of  
thousands, or even millions, of Americans,'' depending on their 
accuracy and whether they are armed with nuclear, chemical or 
biological warheads, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has no means of shooting down long-range  
ballistic missiles, although the Pentagon is spending billions of 
dollars to develop anti-missile missiles to shield the United 
States against a limited attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia already has about 1,000 long-range missiles with about  
4,500 nuclear warheads. China has about 20 missiles capable of 
reaching the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA report said short-range ballistic missiles, such as  
Iran's Shahab-3 and North Korea's No Dong, pose an ``immediate, 
serious and growing threat to U.S. forces, interests and allies'' 
in the Middle East and Asia. Those missiles do not have the range 
to reach U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said the countries developing ballistic missiles  
also are probably working on ``countermeasures,'' or ways of 
enabling their missiles to overcome U.S. defenses. Russia and 
China, which already have developed numerous countermeasures, 
probably are willing to sell these technologies, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is a summary of a classified National Intelligence  
Estimate, the first the CIA has done on ballistic missile threats 
since 1995. In an October 1998 update of its assessment, the CIA 
told Congress that the United States was facing a growing threat 
from the spread of ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The report released Thursday portrayed the threat from North  
Korea, Iran and Iraq as somewhat less immediate than did the 
bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission, which told Congress in a July 1998 
report that North Korea and Iran could field a missile capable of 
striking U.S. territory in as little as five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rumsfeld Commission also concluded that the CIA's ability to  
provide timely and accurate estimates of ballistic missile threats 
to the United States is eroding, and that warning times are being 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. intelligence official said Thursday the CIA has  
changed the way it assesses missile threats. Reflecting its Cold 
War-era practice, the CIA used to wait until a country deployed a 
missile for the first time before declaring it a threat. Now it 
will declare a threat as soon as a country successfully 
test-launches a missile, the official said. He discussed the new 
report on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	He said intelligence analysts expect North Korea to flight-test  
its Taepo Dong 2 missile this year unless the North Koreans decide 
to heed U.S. warnings against such a test. The issue is high on the 
agenda of talks between the North and the United States that opened 
Tuesday in Berlin. The CIA believes the Taepo Dong 2 is designed to 
carry a nuclear weapon, although it may be tested initially as an 
unarmed space launch vehicle. It is not known for certain whether 
North Korea has a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has long posed a major nuclear threat to the United  
States, although Washington and Moscow are attempting to implement 
a second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to greatly reduce the size 
of their arsenals. Defense Secretary William Cohen is traveling to 
Moscow next week to discuss the prospects for going even further in 
nuclear weapons cuts, and to discuss future missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian threat, although significantly reduced, will  
continue to be the most robust and lethal, considerably more so 
than that posed by China, and orders of magnitude more than that 
potentially posed by other nations,'' the CIA report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said China, which now has about 20 long-range nuclear  
missiles, is likely to increase its arsenal by ``a few tens'' of 
missiles, including some with warheads ``influenced'' in part by 
U.S. technology gained through espionage -- a reference to 
allegations that China stole technology from the W-88 warhead that 
is used on U.S. strategic nuclear missiles carried aboard Trident 
submarines.

	Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter Dies  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter died  
today at the age of 53 after battling the muscle disease named 
after Lou Gehrig, another New York Yankees great. Hunter died at 
his home in Hertford, N.C., according to the Swindell Funeral Home 
in Hertford. He fell and hit his head on concrete steps at his home 
on Aug. 8 and was unconscious for several days, but he had improved 
enough to be sent home Saturday. During 15 seasons (1965-79), 
Hunter earned five World Series rings with the Oakland Athletics 
and the Yankees. The right-hander had five straight 20-victory 
seasons, pitched a perfect game and won a Cy Young Award. He went 
224-166 with a 3.26 ERA.

	GOP Leaders Won't OK Budget Summit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top congressional Republicans said today they  
will not engage President Clinton in budget summit talks this year 
because he would insist on higher spending in exchange for the 
GOP's cherished tax cuts. ``We're just not prepared to trade with 
the president with the American people's money, a spending buck for 
me, a tax reduction for you,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, said. Armey renewed the GOP's pledge to use Social 
Security surpluses solely to reduce the $5.6 trillion national 
debt.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today introduced a $15  
million federal plan to buy back guns. The new program will give 
local police departments up to $500,000 to buy guns in and around 
public housing projects for a ``suggested price'' of $50. The guns 
will be destroyed. Clinton said American children under 15 are nine 
times more likely to die by accidental shooting than children in 
the other 25 industrialized nations combined.

the decision was made jointly by Defense Secretary William Cohen 
and Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dreaded high-tech date 9-9-99 arrived today  
with no immediate reports of major Y2K-like computer trouble, 
boosting the confidence of the year 2000 programming experts. There 
had been fears that the string of nines for Sept. 9, 1999, might 
cause some computers to misread the date as an old command to end a 
program. But those concerns appeared to be largely unfounded, as 
most experts predicted after months of tests. Computers abroad also

in Washington.

at Wrigley Field. Sosa is eight games ahead of his 66-homer pace of 
a year ago, when Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals 
established a major-league record 70. Sosa's homer gave him a 
five-homer lead over McGwire, whose Cardinals were idle.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announcement Irks Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore announced last week $5  
million in emergency funds for New England fishermen. But some 
observers had a sense of been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the aid had been announced last fall by  
congressional representatives who spent much of the year putting 
the package together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really stinks of cheap, election-year politics,'' Paul  
Cohane, head of the Gulf of Maine Fisherman's Association, told The 
Boston Globe. ``Mr. Gore had very little to do with this, and yet 
he came and took all the glory. He stole the limelight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Cohane, it was Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., who did  
much of the work to get the funding from the Senate Appropriations 
Committee last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry declined to comment on Gore's announcement or on reports  
that Gore had called him to apologize after the Boston 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's spokesman, David Wade, said that Kerry ``really  
appreciates the vice president drawing national attention to a 
pressing regional problem that has long been a top priority to New 
Englanders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president simply made  
a formal announcement so the money could be made available. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president was extremely pleased to be able to make  
the formal official announcement on behalf of the administration to 
make available emergency relief,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fishermen said they were angry that the money, first  
announced last October, has not yet materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the fishermen care who gets credit for it. But  
they are concerned because they certainly need assistance. And most 
of their problems stem not from any shortage of fish but from this 
administration's policies,'' said Stephen Ouellette, an attorney 
for the association. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency funds are supposed to provide some fishermen with  
up to $1,500 for each day their fishing grounds in the Gulf of 
Maine were closed by federal officials last spring. In return for 
the money, fishermen may be required to work with scientists 
conducting research on the health of the fish stocks.

<HEADLINE> More Budget Cuts for SLOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers have once again revised  
their budget -- and said today they have found a way to cut $190 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Salt Lake Organizing Committee already trimmed the  
$1.45 billion budget approved in April for the 2002 Winter Games 
down to $1.33 billion, recent calculations showed a few spots for 
correction and adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, said SLOC chief operating officer Fraser  
Bullock, the group defined a $74 million wish list of things that 
will only get bought if the revenue comes in to cover them. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, SLOC has cut $10 million from its budget for hiring  
workers. But another $20 million will go into a category of 
``tiered expenses'' that will add to the $116 million in definite 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But because a detailed examination found $67 million in new  
costs, mostly due to errors, there are only about $7 million in new 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``tiered'' plan is part of SLOC's new mantra of putting on  
the best possible games without going overboard. Only $1.15 billion 
in funding has been secured or semi-secured, leaving a gap of $179 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to do it bigger and better,'' Bullock told the  
SLOC board today before members went into closed session to discuss 
the budget in further detail and vote on it. ``We're focused on 
delivering what we have to deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney said that might mean occasionally  
going over budget to protect the integrity of the athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Romney said, it turns out that the ice on the new  
bobsled run at the Utah Winter Sports Park melts in some patches 
because of variations in sun and shadow. Thus SLOC will have to 
shell out extra money to provide more shade along the course to 
make competition fair. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romney also said that like a private corporation, SLOC will  
have to be responsible for such unforeseen expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a popular conception in the community that we  
have the ability to spend lots of money and go into debt and leave 
the taxpayers to pay the bills,'' he said. But that is not the 
case, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The new budget does have $140 million built in for  
contingencies. But Bullock insisted most of that money will likely 
be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members voted to automatically close all meetings of the  
ethics committee, unless the group votes to open portions. The 
ethics board members now vote before each meeting whether to close 
the proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Classes Finally Begin in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's teachers ended a nine-day strike and  
finally welcomed back 180,000 students from summer vacation 
Thursday, starting the first school year under a board appointed to 
turn the struggling district around. 
</P>
<P>
	The students lost six days of school to the strike by the  
11,500-member union. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers agreed on Wednesday to go back to work after the  
union and the school board reached a tentative contract over the 
Labor Day weekend. The teachers defeated, for the time being at 
least, such reform measures proposed by the board as merit pay and 
a longer school day. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were relieved to have their children back in class.  
</P>
<P>
	Alice Martin, a 42-year-old mother of nine, had been relying on  
her 18-year-old daughter to baby sit while Ms. Martin was at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been a lifesaver for me, actually, because I was trying  
to get my other kids into day care. I don't know what I would've 
done without her,'' she said as she dropped off some of her 
children at a spruced-up Joy Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	The clean-up was among reforms sought by district chief  
executive David Adamany, who pushed through $80 million worth of 
renovations to most of the district's 270 school buildings over the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The paint was chipping outside. They didn't have the flowers  
or the shrubs, the tennis court was overgrown, the toilets didn't 
work and some of the toilets didn't have doors,'' said 
administrative unit head Barbara Pitts. ``Now, all the plumbing 
works. Everything looks great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renaissance High School teacher Jacob Ishakis said he had hoped  
to return to school because he didn't like picketing. ``It's not 
what a teacher is supposed to do,'' he said. ``It's degrading, and 
it's demeaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany was named to his post by Mayor Dennis Archer, who took  
over the school styem this spring and replaced the elected board 
with an appointed one to help turn around a district plagued by low 
test scores, graduation rates and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers still must ratify the contract. Ballots will be mailed  
out later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Johnson, the union's chief negotiator, said that rejection  
of the contract could send teachers back to picket lines, but that 
he doesn't think that is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamany said he still intends to create a merit pay system.  
``We're going to implement it this year,'' he said. ``It'll be up 
to the union to challenge it.''

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Pa. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy accused of killing a teacher  
at a school dance last year may have spared himself life in prison 
without parole by pleading guilty to a lesser murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Wurst pleaded guilty to third-degree murder Thursday in  
the shooting death of 48-year-old teacher John Gillette, who was 
killed when Wurst opened fire at a dance for his eighth-grade class 
at a banquet hall in Edinboro. He was also accused of wounding two 
students and holding a gun to the principal's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Erie County Judge Michael Palmisano sentenced Wurst to 30 to 60  
years in prison on the murder charge and for attempted homicide, 
assault and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst must serve at least 30 years before he is eligible for  
parole. His attorneys said he would have received a mandatory life 
sentence if convicted as an adult of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst was scheduled to go to trial Oct. 25.  
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager's attorneys had planned an insanity defense, but  
encouraged their client to agree to the guilty plea for fear jurors 
would not accept that Wurst was mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way he would have done better is if the jury would  
have found him insane, and insanity is a very difficult defense, 
especially in the tenor of today's times with these shootings 
around the country,'' defense attorney Philip Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A month before the killing, Wurst told classmates at James W.  
Parker Middle School that he wanted to kill people and commit 
suicide. Another classmate noticed that Wurst was becoming curt and 
unfriendly in weeks before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting -- which occurred within months of those involving  
students in Jonesboro, Ark., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss. -- 
stunned residents of Edinboro, a town of 7,000 in northwestern 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Conti said the victims had approved of the plea agreement.  
Gillette's wife, Debbie, and the other victims were in court. None 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gillette's attorney, Charles Longo, said he plans to sue  
the Wurst family and a landscaping business owned by the boy's 
father, Jerome Wurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Longo said the Gillette family was neither happy about, nor  
satisfied by Wurst's guilty plea. ``They're able to accept it,'' he 
said.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In an unusual expression of unity,  
Conservative and Reform Jews are helping an Orthodox community 
create an eruv. 
</P>
<P>
	From sundown Friday until sundown Saturday, traditionally  
observant Jews are not allowed to carry anything outside their 
homes. But religious law allows creation of an eruv, a physical 
enclosure that expands the definition of ``home'' beyond the four 
walls. Thus, they may move about, for example, with their children 
in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest eruvim in the United States is in the Boston  
area; it stretches over several miles south of the Massachusetts 
Turnpike and was completed in January 1993, after eight years of 
planning and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	An eruv can be anything from a wall to a wire. The Orthodox  
alone generally create these costly and labor-intensive projects. 
Many use utility lines as boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Young Israel congregation of Elkins Park has received  
permission from PECO Energy Co. to put plastic strips on power 
lines. Those strips, known as ``lechi,'' serve as symbolic poles 
under the wire, making the boundary conform with Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
	Few non-Orthodox congregations observe the Sabbath in a manner  
so strict as to require an eruv. But those in Elkins Park have 
joined Young Israel in an effort to complete the 5-mile, $50,000 
project in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it as a gesture of community support,'' said Rabbi  
Seymour Rosenbloom of Congregation Adath Jeshurun, a Conservative 
synagogue. ``This is one small area where we were able to show that 
the things that unite us are more important than the things that 
divide us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Jerome M. Epstein of the United Synagogue of Conservative  
Judaism, the New York-based group linking Conservative 
congregations, said he knew of no other such cooperative effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't the usual situation,'' he said, ``so I would say that  
it is special.''

 *Cohabiting couples and Catholicism    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Catholic bishops' committee on  
marriage and family has issued a report on cohabiting couples, 
which many priests consider the most troublesome issue in 
premarital counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 nationwide survey by Creighton University showed 43.6  
percent of Catholic couples were living together when they began 
premarital counseling. The report terms this ``a fairly recent 
phenomenon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which does not set policy, notes that living  
together out of wedlock violates church teaching. It emphasizes 
that cohabiting couples have a higher risk of divorce. Citing two 
dozen scholarly studies, the report advises priests to help couples 
confront the reasons behind increased risks of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Many dioceses ask priests to urge cohabiting couples to live  
apart before the wedding, the report says, but under canon law a 
couple cannot be denied a church ceremony even if they refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, Catholicism worried that public weddings for  
cohabiting couples would scandalize the community. But the report 
says the social stigma has lessened. 
</P>

 *Patriarch sees 'winter of ecumenism'    	
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the  
world leader of Eastern Orthodoxy, says stalled efforts toward 
Christian unity have ``caused many, perhaps rightly so, to proclaim 
this period to be the winter of ecumenism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks were made in a welcoming address when presiding  
Bishop Frank T. Griswold of America's Episcopal Church visited in 
mid-July. They were made public Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew noted that Eastern Orthodoxy was a founding member  
of the World Council of Churches in 1948 and participates in other 
such organizations, as does the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite progress in some theological discussions, the patriarch  
noted a recent ``cooling off of relations, a loss of our initial 
drive'' and said Christians must ``recognize and contend with the 
current ecumenical malaise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that some Orthodox had withdrawn from ecumenism to  
express ``uneasiness over particular issues.'' The Russian Orthodox 
Church has suspended activity in the World Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The patriarch said there are legitimate concerns, including the  
incursion of non-Orthodox missionaries into Orthodox lands and the 
``changing criteria for ordination to holy orders,'' an apparent 
reference to Protestants' ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew said that despite difficulties, the church ``is  
dedicated and will continue to promote the cause of Christian 
unity.'' 
</P>
<P>

 *Leader for religious freedom commission    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steven McFarland, director of the Center for  
Law and Religious Freedom, has been named executive director of the 
U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. The commission 
was established by Congress last year to monitor American policy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center, McFarland was the strategist on public issues for  
the Christian Legal Society, an organization of evangelical 
Protestant lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a leader in interfaith coalitions working toward the  
commission where he now works; the 1993 Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act, later overturned by the Supreme Court; and the 
Religious Liberty Protection Act, now pending in the Senate.

<HEADLINE>  Danforth To Head Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Republican Sen. John Danforth today  
took the reins of an independent inquiry into the fiery end of the 
1993 Branch Davidian siege, pledging to answer the ``dark 
questions'' of whether the government killed people and covered it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country can survive bad judgment. But the thing that  
really undermines the integrity of government is whether there were 
bad acts -- whether the government killed people,'' the ex-Missouri 
lawmaker said in a news conference convened by Attorney General 
Janet Reno. Congressional leaders said they would prefer 
congressional probes be much more broad than Danforth's. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has been under attack since the revelations that the FBI,  
contradicting a position it took for six years, had used some 
incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff, which 
ended in a fire and deaths of cult leader David Koresh and 80 
followers. Both Reno and the FBI maintain that the devices did not 
cause the deadly fire, which they insist was set by the cult 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth will hold the title special counsel and is empowered to  
use a federal grand jury for his investigation. He said he hoped to 
get voluntary cooperation for what will start as an administrative, 
and not a criminal, inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno announced she is recusing herself from the matter because  
``I will obviously be a witness'' in the investigation. Before the 
Waco assault, Reno said, she directed that only non-incendiary tear 
gas be used to avoid the possibility of triggering a fire that 
might endanger lives. With Reno's recusal, Deputy Attorney General 
Eric Holder would be the top person Danforth consults with at 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said he won't focus on poor judgment by federal  
officials ``even if those judgments led to the ultimate result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my job is to answer the dark questions: Was there a  
cover-up? That's a dark question. Did the government kill people? 
How did the fire start? Were there shootings?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Danforth also will investigate whether there ``was any  
illegal use of the armed forces'' in the final assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said he has authority to question both Reno and FBI  
Director Louis Freeh. He did not say whether he will. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department press release quoted Freeh as saying, ``I  
welcome the attorney general's selection of Senator Danforth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Danforth is a man of impeccable credentials, a record of  
integrity and a determination to get to the truth,'' Reno said. 
``Questions have been raised, and he is the perfect person to find 
the answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the facts. That's order No. 1,'' Danforth said. ``It  
is clear to me that the quality of the product that we hope to 
produce is going to depend upon the quality of the people we get to 
produce it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I see at stake the beginning of the Declaration of  
Independence, the point of which was to protect the life and 
liberty and pursuit of happiness of the American people,'' Danforth 
said. ``And if government doesn't do that, if government cover 
things up and the government kills people, if that is what happened 
-- and I don't prejudge that -- then that is what Jefferson talked 
about as being the first foundation of government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd of St. Louis will be his  
deputy, describing Dowd as ``a person who is very highly regarded 
in our community, a very respected prosecutor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd, a lifelong Democrat, was recommended for the U.S.  
attorney's job by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. Dowd's 
father was the Democratic nominee for Missouri governor in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	A defiant Reno said she had no plans to resign, despite calls  
from some Republicans to do so. ``I don't run from controversy,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said he had accepted the job with some misgivings but  
is eager to get the work under way. He said he will try not to rely 
on FBI agents to do the legwork of the inquiry. ``My basic thought 
is the FBI should not be investigating the FBI,'' said Danforth, 
who will remain in his home state of Missouri but will open an 
office here. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth was asked about plans on Capitol Hill for a series of  
committee inquiries. ``I am not going to try to tell Congress what 
to do or what not to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,said they would prefer congressional 
probes assume a much broader focus than Danforth's, and thoroughly 
re-examine the entire 51-day siege. Armey said the FBI's new 
revelations have tainted the credibility of all testimony and 
conclusions derived from the House's 1995 hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know it all,'' Armey told reporters, starting with  
asking the FBI why it ``needed to come to this area and investigate 
these people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that they would do it in the broadest possible  
way,'' Lott said after disclosing that he has spoken to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; the 
Governmental Affairs Committee chairman, Sen. Fred Thompson, 
R-Tenn.; and the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. 
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., about conducting one or more investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Congress should not defer to the executive branch  
because ``after all, Congress was misled by the executive branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Lott said he now has doubts about who started the  
fire that ended the Waco siege and believes it is time for Reno to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth left the Senate in 1995 and is respected by members of  
both parties for his stubborn independence and reputation for 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, 63, is an Episcopal priest with solid Republican  
credentials. He successfully shepherded the troubled nomination of 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas through a tough confirmation 
process. Before entering the Senate, he served as attorney general 
in Missouri for eight years.

<HEADLINE> First-Round Pick Signs With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- First-round draft pick John Tait ended  
his holdout and had his first workout with the Kansas City Chiefs 
on Thursday, 
</P>
<P>
	Tait, 24, an offensive tackle from BYU, signed a five-year  
contract, but neither the Chiefs, Tait or his agent would comment 
on the contract details. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait, 6-feet-6 and 311 pounds, was the first offensive lineman  
taken in the draft. He missed training camp when the sides could 
not agree on a contract. Then, after it was reported they were 
close to terms, he came to Kansas City last week only to storm out 
of Arrowhead Stadium saying he had been cursed and badgered during 
negotiations. He said Thursday that it wasn't language that ended 
the talks then, but the intensity of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be able to handle it. That's part of the game,''  
Tait said after his first 90-minute workout with the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	When practice was over, Tait was one of the first players to the  
locker room. ``I'm pretty tired,'' he told reporters, adding that 
he had been conditioning himself and running in the heat of the day 
near his Arizona home to stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gunther Cunningham said the Chiefs would place Tait on a  
two-week exemption list, meaning he would not be able to play in 
games at Chicago this weekend or the home opener Sept. 19 against 
Denver. Cunningham said he was confident Tait would be able to get 
in some time with the Chiefs after two weeks of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of the other principals in the talks that broke down  
last week was at the stadium Thursday. Chiefs president and general 
manager Carl Peterson was reported to be attending a meeting in New 
York. Tait's agent, Ethan Lock, did not accompany Tait to Kansas 
City, at the request of the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad that we were able to finally conclude this  
negotiation. The obvious is that it took far too long,'' Peterson 
said in a statement released by the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Lock said the contract wasn't everything Tait wanted, ``but it  
was better than it was initially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John struggled with this. People can say we were bluffing. But  
he was within inches of just waiting until next April and going 
back in the draft,'' Lock said. ``He decided in the end this was 
the better thing for him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lock accused the Chiefs' general manager of using vulgar  
language and trying to intimidate the deeply religious Mormon 
during the negotiations last week. The talks broke down primarily 
over the Chiefs' insistence on a clause that would allow them to 
get back all of his signing bonus of about $4 million if he did not 
play the entire length of the contract for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson later called Alan Tait, the player's father, and  
apologized for his language. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rift developed last week when Cunningham was quoted as  
saying that, because of his inactivity, Tait would be ``like a 
jellyfish'' and that defensive players were ``drooling to take a 
smack at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tait said he met with Cunningham on Thursday and ``we're on the  
same level. I want to play football and get better. He wants to 
coach me.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Has Organ Transplant Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The network that coordinates organ transplant  
policy unveiled an Internet system Thursday that it hopes will make 
it easier for patients to get information about hospitals that 
perform transplants. They also introduced a system meant to help 
doctors find the right recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Network for Organ Sharing introduced Transplant  
Living, an Internet program located on its Web site, which offers 
consolidated information for transplant patients, including how 
long patients usually wait for transplants at specific centers and 
average survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become for patients a single comprehensive place to  
find information they need for details about what it is going to be 
like after the doctor has said you need an organ transplant,'' said 
Margo L. Akerman, the network's vice president. ``This is first 
Internet-based health-care site to provide this depth of 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But skeptics say the network, which has come under fire for  
resisting requests for data, is still not providing what patients 
really need. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to be more current, more timely and more complete so  
people can get more information about their procedures,'' said Jon 
Nelson, who oversees transplant policy at the Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Irwin, president of the National Transplant Action  
Committee, said anything to ``improve the process is a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Transplant Living will make it easier for  
patients and their families to ``shop around'' for health care 
centers that provide organs quickly and successfully, Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many, that information won't affect their care.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a large segment of the population that, regardless of  
the information, has no choice,'' Irwin said. ``They are covered by 
Medicaid or managed care programs (and) their choices are 
limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network says the program is designed to help everyone by  
providing a reliable source of information for patients to open a 
discussion with their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this month, the network will also provide doctors and the

<HEADLINE> Missed Field Goal Haunts Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Gary Anderson is still dealing with  
the biggest letdown of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure you ever forget those kinds of things,'' said  
Anderson, who missed the field goal that would have sent the 
Minnesota Vikings to the Super Bowl. ``It's part of life, 
unfortunately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had been perfect all season long, kicking on grass and  
turf, indoors and outdoors, reliable from all distances. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit 39 straight field goals and made all 67 extra points,  
becoming the first kicker in NFL history to go an entire regular 
season without a miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the biggest kick of his career.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who has more field goals than any kicker in NFL  
history, hooked one barely wide left from 38 yards out in the NFC 
championship game. Given new life, the Atlanta Falcons drove for 
the tying touchdown with less than a minute to play, then won it in 
overtime, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
	All week, Anderson was reminded of his monumental miss as the  
Vikings prepare to face the Falcons in Sunday's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a field goal kicker, one of the abilities that you have to  
learn over the years, especially as long as I've played, is to 
always focus on what's coming up next,'' Anderson said. ``If you 
dwell on the past, that's the kiss of death, even more so in this 
particular situation that I had to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an unpleasant offseason for the 18-year veteran who is  
158 points shy of being the NFL's career scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly wasn't fun,'' Anderson said. ``But it's a new  
year now and I have to concentrate on the upcoming season. Our 
business is always about what you're going to do this upcoming 
season, or, in my case, it's even clearer that you've got to make 
the next kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you devote all your attention and energy to.''  
</P>
<P>
	Although it hasn't been easy to reminisce about his perfect  
season in light of his big miss, Anderson said his 1998 season 
``was beyond my wildest dreams and I dream pretty high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the NFL's new kicking rules, however, in which fresh  
footballs are brought in for field goals, Anderson predicted nobody 
will ever be infallible for an entire season again. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfection isn't what's on his mind, anyway. Redemption is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing longer than anybody here. I've done  
everything but win a Super Bowl and I've been close a number of 
times,'' Anderson said. ``That's my main goal. That's why I still 
play football. It's disappointing any time you come close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's mood brightened Thursday when veteran long snapper  
and locker room cutup Mike Morris returned to the Vikings for 
$400,000 after coach Dennis Green decided rookie Jay Humphrey 
wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and punter Mitch Berger were thrilled the Vikings could  
afford Morris. ``It's not like he's making $2 million,'' Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson recently restructured his contract to give the Vikings  
room to re-sign Morris, one of the league's best long snappers. But 
Morris was waived Sunday because of salary-cap concerns and numbers 
crunches at other positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey, however, had a bad day at practice Wednesday and Green  
decided Morris would give the Vikings a better shot at making a 
Super Bowl run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a little overwhelming, actually, to sit back and  
kind of watch your own funeral on the television and in the 
newspaper and then have the chance to come back from the 
out-of-body experience,'' Morris said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy Grows 0.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy confounded expectations and jumped  
0.2 percent in the second quarter -- a further sign that it may be 
on the path to a stable recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy grew 0.2 percent in the April-June quarter from the  
previous three months, or at an annualized rate of 0.9 percent, the 
Economic Planning Agency announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second quarter in a row of growth after 2.0  
percent in the period from January through March. The economy 
shrank 0.7 percent in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had expected the economy to shrink from the previous  
quarter, which posted startling annualized growth of 8.1 percent, 
as the effect of massive government spending wore thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The figures were definitely stronger than expected,'' said  
Masaaki Kanno, an economist with J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen soared against the dollar as traders raised their  
expectations for Japan's economic outlook. The dollar fell more 
than 2 yen against the Japanese currency to 108.84 yen in late 
Tokyo trading, and continued to fall in New York. By midday today, 
the dollar was trading at 107.60 yen in New York, its lowest level 
since August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said one of the brightest spots of the data was the  
rise in private-sector spending, which was up 0.8 percent in the 
second quarter, showing that battered consumer confidence -- a major 
cause of Japan's economic downturn -- may be reviving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was expecting personal consumption and housing investment to  
be strong, but (the numbers) were even better than expected,'' said 
Jun Ishii, chief market economist at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ordinary consumers are finally beginning to spend  
more on nonessential goods like computers and electronic products. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy has been in the dumps ever since the end of the  
potlatch years of the 1980s, when unbridled speculation left banks 
and corporations saddled with huge debts. Fears of being laid off 
have caused workers to squirrel away savings more than ever before, 
and banks have stopped lending as they struggle to write off bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the growth rush that started with the beginning of 1999,  
Japan's economy had been in a two-year tailspin -- the country's 
worst recession since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Top economic officials appeared to take today's data in stride,  
and still urged caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was within the high end of the strike zone,'' said Japan's  
chief economic planner, Taiichi Sakaiya. ``We will have to be very 
careful in our economic policies from now on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya declined to comment on the size of an expected  
supplementary budget designed to keep economic growth on track. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was confident the economy would achieve the  
government's growth target of 0.5 percent, but economists were 
already saying GDP would likely grow by more than twice that much 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing investment rose 16.1 percent in the second quarter -- an  
unprecedented pace in Japan on a quarterly basis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kanno said the rise in housing investment was mainly  
due to government policies like tax breaks and artificially low 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not going to last forever,'' Kanno said.  
</P>
<P>
	Private capital investment declined as big corporations continue  
to tighten their purse strings, said an EPA official, briefing 
reporters on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Public investment also fell, but that was due to the massive  
government spending of the previous quarter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of investment was still high,'' the official said.  
``It was a nominal decline, reflecting an extraordinary increase in 
public investment in the previous quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who took office in July  
last year, has promised to put Japan's economy on a recovery path, 
with at least 0.5 percent annual growth. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been other bright signs in the economy. The  
government announced earlier this week that increasing demand from 
Asian countries was behind recent growth in Japan's industrial 
output. 
</P>
<P>
	A closely watched government business survey showed that  
Japanese corporate sentiment improved sharply in the April-June 
quarter and is expected to rise further in the next two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, joblessness has been rising steadily amid attempts by  
corporations to aggressively reorganize. In June, the unemployment 
rate hit a record high 4.9 percent, and many think it will climb 
further as restructuring accelerates. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that although the economy would probably grow  
again in the third quarter, it was likely to shrink in the fourth 
as public spending measures run dry.

<HEADLINE> Handicapping the Emmys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What makes for an exciting Emmy Awards show?  
Your favorite star winning a trophy can do the trick. Or watching a 
deserving series set a record, as ``Frasier'' did when it snared 
its fifth consecutive best comedy Emmy last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it's guessing the winners and picking up $20 in the  
office pool. With the goal of public service in mind (disclaimer: 
no gambling endorsement implied), Emmy expert Thomas O'Neil and I 
huddled over predictions in the top categories. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neil, author of ``The Emmys,'' notes there are important  
elements to consider before making an educated forecast for 
Sunday's ceremony (airing 8 p.m. EDT on Fox). 
</P>
<P>
	An Emmy Award reflects a specific episode or episodes submitted  
for judging, not a show's or a performer's entire body of work for 
a season. Actors tender one episode; a series vying for best comedy 
or drama submits eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing them are peer panels made up of members of the Academy  
of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences. Actors judge acting nominees, 
directors review their colleagues and so on during marathon viewing 
sessions in August. 
</P>
<P>
	That approach tends to assure that the quality of the work,  
rather than industry buzz, helps determine the winner, O'Neil said. 
It also can result in surprises, particularly in the acting 
categories in which performers often kill their own chance with a 
weak episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year you wonder what goes through these actors' heads,''  
said O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
	Having the most nominations or critical support also doesn't  
guarantee a glorious outcome. HBO's suburban mob drama ``The 
Sopranos,'' with 16 nominations, is facing what O'Neil has deemed 
``the frontrunner's curse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unique to television. When it comes to the Academy Awards,  
the film with the most bids took best picture nine out of the last 
10 years. During the same period, Emmy frontrunners were tripped up 
six times, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	With that back story in mind, here are O'Neil's predictions in  
six categories, along with my take. 

</P>
<P>
	--Best actor in a comedy series: Kelsey Grammer, last year's  
winner, chose a ``dud'' with a Christmas-theme episode that failed 
to showcase his talent and may have put himself out of the running, 
O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Lithgow of ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' on the other hand, is  
big and outrageous in a smartly performed piece of comedy, O'Neil 
said, naming him the likely winner. O'Neil's dark horse: Paul 
Reiser for the tearjerker final episode of ``Mad About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: Don't count out Grammer. Even when the material falls  
short, he is the ultimate in sitcom savoir-faire. 

</P>
<P>
	--Best actress in a comedy series: O'Neil is putting all his  
chips on Helen Hunt of ``Mad About You,'' who submitted the 
sitcom's emotional hour-long finale. The victory would be her 
fourth in a row, tying a record set in 1988 by John Larroquette of 
``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: Calista Flockhart, your Emmy is ready. Yes, Emmy voters  
are awed by the Oscar-winning Hunt, but the ``Ally McBeal'' star 
was a state-of-the-art emotional roller coaster in the episode in 
which she and former beau Billy share a kiss. 

</P>
<P>
	Best actor in a drama series: He's stumped, O'Neil admits,  
willing to rule out only Jimmy Smits. The ex-''NYPD Blue'' star 
submitted his deathbed episode, in which Smits is upstaged by 
co-star and fellow nominee Dennis Franz. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Franz rages in that 90-minute episode and then smolders  
quietly in the season finale he turned in, the range may sway 
voters, O'Neil said. He picks Dylan McDermott of ``The Practice'' 
as a deserving upset winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Our choice: The trophy goes to the mobster you hate to love in  
``The Sopranos.'' James Gandolfini's compelling character lacks the 
sympathetic edge O'Neil says Emmy voters favor, but I believe he'll 
muscle in on chutzpah. 

</P>
<P>
	Best actress in a drama series: Last year's winner Christine  
Lahti could take the trophy again for ``Chicago Hope,'' but the 
character's unlovable nature may undercut her big, explosive 
performance, O'Neil said. Edie Falco, the mob wife in ``The 
Sopranos,'' turned in a wonderful example of her work and has a 
serious shot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: Falco, a gutsy actress who doesn't play it safe and  
whose character is as close to a moral center as ``The Sopranos'' 
can have, is a winner. 

</P>
<P>
	Best comedy series: A weak season rules out a sixth victory for  
``Frasier'' and opens the door for ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' the 
kind of family comedy that gives Emmy voters a warm feeling, O'Neil 
said. But he suggests keeping an eye on the hour-long ``Ally 
McBeal,'' which combines comedy and emotional heft. 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' has grown into a worthy  
contender and is the likely winner. But in a more perfect world 
voters wouldn't be afraid to admit that the brazen and outrageously 
funny ``Sex and the City'' had won their hearts -- and their 
ballots. 

</P>
<P>
	Best drama series: ``The Practice,'' which had a strong year  
both in stories and in showcasing its appealing cast of lawyers, is 
invincible, O'Neil maintains. If there is a surprise winner, he 
tags ``NYPD Blue'' for its emotionally complex year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' simply faces too many hurdles, O'Neil said: The  
difficult characters, an intricate storyline that must be seen in 
its entirety to be fully appreciated and a macho nature that may 
repel some female voters. 
</P>
<P>
	My pick: ``NYPD Blue'' is a series of depth and unrelenting  
emotional clout that had a classic season. And ``The Sopranos,'' 
easily one of the best dramatic series TV has ever produced, is 
just too dark to take home the gold. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	CELEBRITIES GO WILD: ``In the Wild,'' the PBS series in which  
celebrities schmooze with animals, marks its third season with 
episodes airing on six consecutive Sundays beginning this weekend. 
``Orangutans With Julia Roberts,'' one of four repeats, airs this 
Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT. The rest of the lineup: Christopher Reeve and 
gray whales, Sept. 19; Richard Dreyfuss in the Galapagos Islands, 
Sept. 26; new episodes with Whoopi Goldberg and zoo babies on Oct. 
3 and John Cleese and lemurs on Oct. 10; Goldie Hawn and Indian 
elephants, Oct. 17.

<HEADLINE> Fan Selling McGwire's 500th HR Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Shearer, the 28-year-old architect who  
caught Mark McGwire's 500th home run ball, has decided to sell it 
during an Oct. 30 auction in Las Vegas that also will include 
Mickey Mantle's 500th home run ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to a lot of people,'' Shearer said Thursday. ``We  
talked a lot to my wife's family and my family. The more we talked 
about it, we started to feel better about selling it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's ball, along with Mantle's, is the highlight of the  
auction, arranged by Michael Barnes, president of One-of-a-Kind 
Auctions in Festus, Mo. Last season, Barnes helped Phil Ozersky, a 
26-year-old researcher at Washington University, sell McGwire's 
70th home run ball. Canadian comic book tycoon Todd McFarlane paid 
$3,005,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the market is strongly weighted for current  
players: McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.,'' Barnes said. 
``At this sale, what you have is the power hitter of the past, and 
the power hitter of today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season began, Barnes offered $100,000 to whoever  
caught McGwire's 500th. The $100,000, however, was just an advance 
on what the ball might bring at an auction. Eddie Murray's 500th 
home run ball sold for $200,000, money that the seller put in a 
20-year annuity that eventually will be worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been making sure that we're sure it will sell for more  
than $100,000,'' Barnes said. ``We feel it's a very strong 
six-figure ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no definite plans for what Shearer and his wife  
Jennifer will do with the money, although Jim mentioned his student 
loan debt. And after paying his alma maters back, he's ready to 
give them some more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be disappointed if I don't get enough to share with the  
high school and colleges that we went to,'' Shearer said. Donations 
to other charities are in their plans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball has been resting safely in a safe deposit box since  
McGwire hit it Aug. 5. Shearer hasn't made any trips to the bank 
``just to look at it,'' but said he's shown it off quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sit there and look at it, and it's just a baseball,'' he  
said. ``But then, you remember sitting in the stands and watching 
it sail toward your seat, and it gets kind of exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting his 500th home run, McGwire said the bat he used  
to hit it would be donated to the Hall of Fame, and he'd like to 
see the ball join it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a true believer that anything that's historical, or that  
anytime somebody reaches a milestone, that it belongs in the hall 
of fame,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen players have hit 500 homers and the Hall of Fame has  
four of the balls. Shearer said he has been in contact with the 
Hall, and hopes to reach an arrangement to display the ball there 
until the auction.

                            *Lenon Hoyte    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lenon Hoyte, an art teacher who shared her dream  
of a doll museum with Harlem children and collectors from around 
the world, died Aug. 1. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hoyte officially opened her collection of dolls in 1974 in a  
three-story brownstone. The collection of Aunt Len's Doll and Toy 
Museum once numbered 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were a dozen versions of Shirley Temple, Barbie,  
Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives and black dolls, which are 
now highly sought by collectors because so few were made before the 
20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	After paying a modest entrance fee that never exceeded $2,  
visitors would encounter mannequins ranging from the length of a 
thumb to the height of a small child. The museum remained open 
until the early 1990s when Ms. Hoyte was no longer able to care for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at  
Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hoyte taught art at a Bronx public high school for 41 years.

</P>
<P>
	HERTFORD, N.C. (AP) -- Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter died  
Thursday, one year after learning Lou Gehrig's disease was the 
reason he could barely toss a baseball with an arm once famous for 
pinpoint control. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, baseball's first big-money free agent, died at home.  
</P>
<P>
	As a pitcher with the Oakland Athletics and later the New York  
Yankees, Hunter won 224 games, produced five straight 20-victory 
seasons, a perfect game and a Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came up with the A's in 1965 and punctuated the team's  
move from Kansas City to Oakland by pitching the seventh perfect 
game in modern baseball history on May 8, 1968, against the 
Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Yankees in 1974 for a landmark $3.75 million,  
five-year contract. He led the team to its first pennant in 12 
seasons and three straight pennants from 1976-78. He retired to 
Hertford when his contract ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was the second Yankees Hall of Famer to die this year.  
Joe DiMaggio died March 8 at age 84.

professional football player who spent 30 years as head baseball 
coach at Central Connecticut State University, died Wednesday. He 
was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Majlinger compiled a 351-166 record as a coach from 1949-1978  
and was later inducted into the American Association of College 
Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He also coached the CCSU football team from 1953-1958.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in Licensing Ploy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former manager of a suburban driver's licensing  
facility pleaded guilty today to fixing tests for truck drivers in 
exchange for payoffs and political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	George Velasco, 50, entered his plea one day after prosecutors  
said he had given a special oral exam to Ricardo Guzman, the driver 
involved in a 1994 crash near Milwaukee that killed six children in 
one family. 
</P>
<P>
	Velasco and another former supervisor at the McCook licensing  
facility were among six people charged in April with selling 
commercial drivers' licenses to hundreds of unqualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said from 1991 to 1998, the six conspired to  
make sure certain applicants passed licensing tests at the office 
of the Illinois secretary of state, taking bribes of up to $1,200 
per license. The secretary of state at the time was George Ryan, 
who is now governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed Wednesday, prosecutors suggested for the  
first time that Guzman's license came as a result of illegal 
payoffs, but stopped short of saying specifically he bought his 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Before U.S. District Judge Joan Gottschall, Velasco acknowledged  
raising more than $25,000 in campaign funds as part of a conspiracy 
with Marion Seibel, the other McCook manager, who already has 
pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for an unspecified break when he is sentenced Feb.  
11, Velasco will cooperate with prosecutors at the Oct. 12 trial of 
trucking company operative Gonzalo Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendoza, who arranged to have Guzman tested, is charged with  
making payoffs and contributions to Ryan's fund to get licenses. 
Guzman himself has not been charged with wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Duane and Janet Willis, whose six children died in the  
1994 accident, recently settled a lawsuit against five corporations 
and two individuals, including Guzman, for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan says he knows nothing about using truck drivers licenses to  
raise thousands of dollars for his campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of whether Guzman got his license through  
corruption became central to the 1998 race for governor. Democrat 
Glenn Poshard even ran a television ad that showed the charred hulk 
of the Willis van. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said when the initial charges were  
announced that Ryan was not a target of the investigation. Since 
then, however, prosecutors have said they will not comment on who 
might or might not be a target.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 500 Sick in E.coli Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Nearly 500 people have been sickened and one  
child died in the largest E. coli outbreak in state history -- and 
possibly one of the worst nationally -- health officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak of the deadly bacteria at the Washington County  
Fair, about 35 miles north of Albany, was likely caused by the 
contamination of the fair's water. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said the water supply may have been tainted  
when rainwater washed over cow feces from a cattle barn on the fair 
grounds and ran into an underground aquifer tapped by the fair's 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, officials were worried that the contamination may  
have spread beyond the Greenwich fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A fair worker who sold sausages might have taken three gallons  
of tainted water with her to use for coffee, lemonade and frozen 
treats at the Rensselaer County Fair in Schaghticoke, state Health 
Commissioner Antonia Novello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Novello said no cases of E. coli had been connected to the  
Rensselaer fair, one county to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, 497 people had been treated at hospitals for E.  
coli symptoms, Novello said. Eighty-five case have been confirmed 
as E. coli poisoning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A child, 3-year old Rachel Aldrich of Clifton Park, succumbed to  
the Greenwich outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed that one of the wells at the Washington County Fair  
was infected with E. Coli bacteria. Health officials also think 
that a deadly strain of E. Coli, 0157:H7, also came from that well, 
but they have yet to find any traces of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The well is near a cattle barn and the ground around it had been  
dug up for the installation of two new wells. Heavy rains in late 
August could have driven E. coli contaminated cattle manure into 
the well, Novello said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that health officials will never find the deadly  
strain since the first tests for E. coli were done Sept. 3, four 
days after the fair ended, said Donald Dixon Despommier, a 
microbiology professor at Columbia University's School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like closing the barn door after the horses are already  
gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on the well in June showed no contamination, health  
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Pa. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy accused of killing a teacher  
at a junior high school dance last year pleaded guilty to a reduced 
murder charge Thursday, sparing himself the possibility of spending 
the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Michael Palmisano sentenced Andrew Wurst to 30 to 60 years  
in prison on the third-degree murder charge and for attempted 
homicide, assault and weapons charges. Wurst must serve at least 30 
years before becoming eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	He would have faced a mandatory life sentence if convicted of  
first-degree murder for the April 1998 death of teacher John 
Gillette, 48. Wurst could not have been sentenced to death because 
he was younger than 16 at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette was killed when Wurst, then 14, opened fire at a dance  
for his eighth-grade class at a banquet hall in Edinboro. He also 
wounded two students and held a gun to the principal's head. 
</P>
<P>
	A month before the killing, Wurst told classmates he wanted to  
kill people and commit suicide. Another classmate noticed that 
Wurst was becoming curt and unfriendly in weeks before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst was scheduled to go to trial Oct. 25 as an adult. His  
lawyers planned an insanity defense but encouraged him to agree to 
the guilty plea out of fear jurors would not accept that Wurst was 
mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way he would have done better is if the jury would  
have found him insane, and insanity is a very difficult defense, 
especially in the tenor of today's times with these shootings 
around the country,'' defense attorney Philip Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Joe Conti said the victims approved the plea  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's wife, Debbie, and the other victims were in court.  
None would comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Charles Longo, who represented Ms. Gillette since  
shortly after the shooting, said she planned to file a civil 
lawsuit against the Wurst family and a landscaping business owned 
by the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting -- which occurred within months of those involving  
students in Jonesboro, Ark., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss. -- 
stunned tiny Edinboro, a town of 7,000 in northwestern 
Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Airline Complaints Hit 11-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines led all major U.S.  
airlines in passenger complaints in July as complaints against all 
carriers hit an 11-year high, according to new U.S. Department of 
Transportation figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest Airlines had the fewest complaints and  
the best on-time performance, while America West Airlines, based in 
Tempe, Ariz., ranked last in on-time performance, the agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled,'' said Melanie Jones, a spokeswoman for  
Southwest. ``It's gratifying to see our emphasis on service 
reflected in the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers filed 2,111 complaints against U.S. carriers in the  
month, and American, the nation's second-largest carrier, had about 
50 percent more complaints than the largest carrier, United 
Airlines. An additional 374 complaints were lodged against foreign 
carriers, tour operators, travel agents and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the complaints lodged against American, half were for  
``flight problems,'' the federal agency said. Other frequent 
complaints were for customer service and baggage problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing we're happy about, but most of the complaints  
were associated with severe air-traffic control, and spring weather 
problems we encounted in April, May and June'' led to complaints in 
July, said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American. About a third of 
American's July complaints covered incidents in earlier months, the 
Transportation Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said American was hit hardest of any airline by Federal  
Aviation Administration computer upgrades that slowed air-traffic 
control operations in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and Cleveland. He 
said the airline has taken steps, such as more-timely boarding, to 
improve on-time performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,485 overall complaints nearly doubled the June total of  
1,332 and marked the highest number since March 1988. Nearly half 
dealt with flight problems, including delays, missed connections 
and canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest had the fewest number of baggage complaints per 1,000  
passengers among the largest 10 carriers, followed by Northwest, 
Delta and Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	The same 10 improved their on-time performance slightly from  
June, with just over 71 percent of flights arriving on time. 
Southwest was on time about 78 percent of the time.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Floyd Gains Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Floyd whirled in the Atlantic at  
near-hurricane strength Thursday, putting several Caribbean 
countries on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center said that if the  
storm were to threaten the East Coast of the United States, it 
would not be for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, the sixth tropical storm of the season, had sustained  
winds increasing to nearly 70 mph, just 4 mph shy of hurricane 
strength. Forecaster James Franklin said Floyd probably would 
become a hurricane by Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, the storm was centered about 265 miles east of  
Barbuda in the Leeward Islands. It moved slowly westward through 
much of the evening, but was forecast to resume its earlier 
west-northwest course, at about 10 mph, early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to pass to the north of the Leeward  
Islands, but it could threaten the northeastern Caribbean if it 
shifts to the south. The governments of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, 
St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy issued tropical storm watches.

<HEADLINE> Schools Sued for Holiday Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A suburban school district's practice of  
closing for the Jewish High Holy Days is being challenged in 
federal court as a violation of the constitutional separation of 
religion and state. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit in U.S.  
District Court against Sycamore School District on Aug. 25, the 
first day of school in the district that serves the towns of 
Montgomery and Blue Ash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The true motivation for the board's calendar decision to close  
on the Jewish high holidays, but not the holy days of other faiths, 
was the defendants' desire to favor Judaism over other religious 
faiths,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Public schools may close on religious holidays only if they have  
a religiously neutral reason for doing so, said Gino Scarselli, 
associate legal director for the ACLU of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	But School Superintendent Bruce Armstrong said high absenteeism,  
rather than religion, is the reason for closing schools on Rosh 
Hashana and Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
	He said about 12 percent of the students were absent during  
those holidays, compared with only 2 percent on Muslim holy days. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any faith, any reason, causes us high absenteeism on any  
day, I would recommend closing on that day,'' Armstrong said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that when he became superintendent in 1994, the district  
had a policy of not giving tests or introducing new material on the 
Jewish High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly what we were doing was not working. It was not  
in the kids' best educational interests,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU lawsuit asks that the district be prohibited from  
taking future actions that favor one religious denomination over 
any other. It is not seeking to keep schools open on the Jewish 
holidays this year. Schools would be closed this year for Rosh 
Hashana regardless of the policy because it begins at sundown 
Friday and ends Sunday night. Yom Kippur is Sept. 20, a Monday.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Persecution Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Iraq: ``Saddam Hussein has for decades conducted a brutal  
campaign of murder, summary execution and protracted arbitrary 
detention against the religious leaders and adherents of the Shiite 
Muslim population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Afghanistan: Shiite Muslims suffered persecution and killing at  
the hands of the Taliban-led government in Kabul. Afghan police 
also impose ``severe physical punishment and imprisonment'' for 
deviations from codes of worship and dress. 
</P>
<P>
	--Iran: The government is intent on eradicating the Baha'is  
through prolonged detention and imprisonment, confiscation and 
desecration of holy places and graveyards. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pakistan: Discriminatory legislation has encouraged an  
atmosphere of ``religious intolerance, which has led to acts of 
violence by extremists against members of religious minorities, 
including Christians, Hindus, Ahmadis and Zikris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Saudi Arabia: There were instances of arbitrary detention of  
members of the Shiite sect. Non-Muslims are required to worship 
privately and any attempt to convert a Muslim to another faith is 
subject to criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sudan: The ongoing civil war provided the basis for severe  
persecution of Christians and of Muslims who deviate from 
officially approved practices. Punishment can include ``killing, 
prolonged arbitrary detention or imprisonment, threats, violence 
and forced conversion to Islam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Serbia: Hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Kosovo province  
were killed or forced from their homes by the country's security 
forces, dominated by Orthodox Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	--Burma: Security forces destroyed or looted churches and  
mosques, mostly in areas where anti-government rebels are active. 
Also, the government continued to systematically arrest and 
imprison Buddhist monks who promoted political and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Israel: The country's 20 percent Arab population does not  
receive the same quality of education, housing, employment 
opportunities and social services as Jews. In addition, 
``government spending and financial support are proportionally far 
lower in predominantly non-Jewish areas than in Jewish areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Turkey: The government has imposed some restrictions on  
religious minorities and religious expression in government offices 
and state-run universities. Turkey's ``military and judiciary, with 
the support of the country's secular elite, continued to wage a 
private and public campaign against Islamic fundamentalism, which 
they view as a threat to the secular republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Cuba: The government monitors and and controls religious  
institutions, including surveillance, infiltration and harassment 
of clergy and members, evictions from and confiscations of places 
of worship and preventive detention of religious activists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Vietnam: The government uses a registration process to control  
and monitor religious activity, severely restricting any practice 
by groups other than officially sanctioned organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nepal: Conversion and proselytizing are constitutionally  
prohibited and punishable by fines or imprisonment or, in the case 
of foreigners, expulsion from the country.

<HEADLINE> Danforth To Investigate Waco Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vowing to pursue the ``dark questions'' of the  
Waco siege, former Republican Sen. John Danforth opened an 
independent inquiry Thursday into whether the FBI started the 
deadly fire and later tried to cover its actions. Danforth pledged 
a thorough inquiry that could include questioning of Attorney 
General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in the Justice Department, where Reno  
announced she had appointed him, Danforth said the country can 
survive bad judgment, ``but the thing that really undermines the 
integrity of government is whether there were bad acts, whether 
there was a cover-up and whether the government killed people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth  
said. ``How did the fire start? Were there shootings?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his inquiry would include whether false statements were  
made to Congress and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, who said he has authority to question both Reno and  
Freeh, will hold the title special counsel and is empowered to use 
a federal grand jury for his investigation. He said he hoped to get 
voluntary cooperation for what will start as an administrative, not 
a criminal, inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Danforth also will investigate whether there ``was any  
illegal use of the armed forces'' in the final assault. Members of 
the Pentagon's Delta Force commandoes were at Waco the day of the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, who spoke with Danforth briefly this week, said in a  
statement that he welcomed the selection, and Reno called Danforth 
``a man of impeccable credentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the former senator made a round of courtesy calls on Capitol  
Hill, congressional leaders said they envision Congress' own Waco 
investigations will be more wide-ranging than Danforth's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know it all,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she herself had no plans to resign, despite calls from  
some Republicans to do so. ``I don't run from controversy,'' she 
said, removing herself entirely from the Waco matter from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will obviously be a witness'' in the investigation, Reno  
explained. With that, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder would be 
the top person Danforth consults at Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has said that before the April 19, 1993, FBI assault on the  
Branch Davidian compound, she directed that only non-incendiary 
tear gas be used, to avoid the possibility of triggering a fire 
that might endanger lives. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been under renewed criticism since revelations that the  
FBI, contradicting a position it had taken for six years, had used 
some incendiary devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff, 
which ended in a fire and the deaths of David Koresh and about 80 
followers. Reno and the FBI maintain that the devices did not cause 
the deadly fire, which they insist was set by the cult members. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
Congress should not defer to the executive branch in delving into 
Waco because ``after all, Congress was misled by the executive 
branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that they would do it in the broadest possible  
way,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions Danforth said he would leave for Congress:  
whether it was a good idea for the FBI to have assaulted the 
compound on the final day and for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms to have raided it three months earlier, beginning the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth chose as his deputy the U.S. attorney in St. Louis,  
Edward Dowd, a Clinton appointee who is joining the St. Louis law 
firm where Danforth is a partner. A lifelong Democrat, Dowd was 
recommended for the U.S. attorney's job by House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. Dowd's father was the Democratic nominee for 
Missouri governor in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said the investigative legwork in his inquiry would be  
done by private investigators ``to the maximum extent'' possible 
and by ``some government investigators'' from agencies other than 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe the FBI should be investigating the FBI,''  
said Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``I can't say that under no circumstances would I  
call on any help at all from the FBI, because I don't know how the 
course of this will proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth will remain at his law firm in St. Louis but probably  
will open an office in Washington. Dowd will be full time on the 
probe, and Danforth will devote most of his time to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said some family members and friends advised him not to  
take the job, with one telling him it would not be a good career 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, hey, I'm 63'' and ``at this point in your life. ...''  
Danforth joked with reporters. He said the gravity of the questions 
surrounding Waco compelled him to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth said he wants to present as many of the facts as he can  
to the American people -- a goal that could be difficult if his 
inquiry turns into a criminal investigation and he starts using a 
grand jury to question witnesses under oath. Grand jury testimony 
is secret.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Shrouds Sanders' Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders remained on the sidelines  
Thursday during the Dallas Cowboys' last big practice of the week, 
and coach Chan Gailey is not expecting him for Sunday's season 
opener in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders practiced on Monday, then sat out Tuesday's drills  
because a toe that he injured last November continued to bother 
him. Gailey said Thursday's practice would be the litmus test for 
whether Sanders could play against the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sanders wasn't even in his pads Thursday. He jogged up and  
down the field several times, tossed a medicine ball briefly, then 
sat on the sidelines, huddled in conversation with owner Jerry 
Jones during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We listed him as doubtful all along, and I think that will  
probably continue,'' Gailey said. ``It is a long shot that he will 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said: ``It will still be a game-time decision. You've got  
to really be confident and trust you can rely on that foot, and 
he's not there yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said Thursday afternoon: ``It's a long shot, but I've  
shot long before. I know it's getting better. It's hard to believe 
that today, but it's getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the toe injury, Sanders has missed five full games and  
parts of two others. He came back for the Cowboys' playoff loss to 
Arizona, but underwent surgery on April 28. 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't play Sunday, Sanders could return eight days later  
in a Monday night game at home against the Atlanta Falcons, one of 
the teams he formerly played for. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, he's going to be the judge of how much pain he can  
tolerate, how much pain there is and whether he can do further 
damage,'' Gailey said earlier this week. ``If we can't do further 
damage, then it's a question of whether it's too painful to do the 
things he needs to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders didn't practice at all on Tuesday because of soreness  
after a half-practice on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old star said he wants no limitations when he  
returns, meaning he would play cornerback and return punts. He was 
a Pro Bowl selection at both spots last season and played in the 
February game despite the toe problem.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed in early trading today, with  
Internet shares posting solid gains while most shares languished. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 7.60 at 11,028.74. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 1.86 at 1,342.29, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 14.29 at 2,823.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were held back by the dollar's continuing decline against  
the Japanese yen. After the Japanese government released a 
stronger-than-expected report on the nation's economic growth, the 
dollar fell to 108.84 yen today from 111.22 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report and the rising value of the yen helped push  
Japan's Nikkei stock average 0.2 percent higher. Weakness in the 
dollar has been a persistent undercurrent in the U.S. stock market 
in recent weeks, as improving economies in Asia and Europe attract 
investors who previously sought out U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet companies provided pockets of strength today. Yahoo  
rose 6 9/16 to 160 after Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the 
stock to ``outperform'' from ``neutral.'' And online auctioneer 
eBay rose 5 1/16 to 139 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products dropped 2 13/16 to 39 1/2 amid reports that  
the company is facing a federal investigation involving the 
government's 1996 approval of the drug Redux. American Home 
Products has already seen its share price battered as the company 
faces thousands of civil lawsuits over its diet drugs, which have 
been linked to heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 90.8 million 
shares, behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.80 to 436.70.  
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.2 percent,  
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Receive Anonymous Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The umpires are at it again.  
</P>
<P>
	National League umpire Steve Rippley has decided against  
retirement, and members of the group trying to oust union leader 
Richie Phillips have received an anonymous letter, accusing each of 
them of being ``a cowardly, selfish scab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How could you jump out of the foxhole in the midst of battle  
and desert your friends for your own selfishness?'' said the 
letter, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. ``How could you 
pledge your allegience to the `intelligence' of Joe Brinkman and 
John Hirschbeck?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, who hasn't worked since his colleagues lost their jobs,  
called the National League office last Thursday, intending to 
retire, but was told to take several days off to think it over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rippley, in all likelihood, will resume active umpiring on  
Friday in Cincinnati,'' Phillips said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The handwritten letter, postmarked in Santa Ana, Calif., on Aug.  
31, was received by about 25 umpires who oppose the union 
leadership, one member of the anti-Phillips faction said, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips engineered the failed strategy of mass resignations,  
which cost 22 umpires their jobs Sept. 2. Phillips' supporters in 
the union say the resignation strategy would have been successful 
had they all stuck with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, you abandoned the ship! You sunk the ship!'' said  
the letter, which contained misspellings and had several words 
underlined for emphasis. ``Now you have to look at yourself in the 
mirror every day forever and see the reflection of a cowardly, 
selfish scab! You can change. You can return your allegience to 
where it belongs!'' 
</P>
<P>
	To form a new union or decertify the current union, 30 percent  
of umpires must file a petition with the National Labor Relations 
Board, which would then hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty gutless person that would write something and  
send out letters and not put their signature to it,'' Hirschbeck 
said. ``I've never not signed a letter in my life. I would assume 
it's from a current umpire or one of the 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on whether the 22 umpires who were let go last week  
count as part of the bargaining unit, there are either 71 or 93 
major league umpires eligible to vote. Fourteen umpires issued a 
statement in July condemning Phillips, and the group now thinks it 
has the support of about 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction is led by three AL umpires: Brinkman,  
Hirschbeck and Davey Phillips. Working with agent Ron Shapiro, who 
has been advising them, the group drafted a response to the 
anonymous letter and was in the process Wednesday of sending it out 
to all umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not have trouble looking at ourselves in the mirror,''  
the group said. ``As for the cowardly comment, we have and will 
continue to stand tall when it comes to our decisions. We will not 
be swayed by the peer pressure, name calling, threats ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips announced July 14 that more than 50 umpires were  
resigning en masse, effective Sept. 2, with umpires saying they 
wanted to prod baseball into an early start of negotiations for a 
labor contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when more than two dozen umps -- nearly  
all in the American League -- either refused to resign or quickly 
withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 umps from the minor leagues and accepted  
the resignations of 22 veterans. Umpires sued to stop baseball from 
letting the 22 go, and in a deal worked out last week in federal 
court, the matter will go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that with a different negotiation approach  
for our association, we will ... save some of the jobs that Richie 
Phillips lost with his flawed and ridiculous strategy,'' the 
anti-Phillips group said. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman on July 29  
warned umpires against making threats or attempting to intimidate 
their colleagues. That statement came as Hirschbeck's wife received 
a letter from Ed Montague's wife, calling her husband a ``Judas'' 
for opposing the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for umpires and the leagues held a telephone conference  
call Wednesday to discuss selecting an arbitrator from among the 15 
on a list provided by the American Arbitration Association's 
Philadelphia office. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sides can't agree on arbitrator, they will take turns  
striking names until one remains. That process could begin today or 
Friday, one lawyer said on the condition he not be identified.

<HEADLINE> Test May Help Detect Breast Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Doctors have a better chance of detecting and  
treating hidden tumors in breast cancer patients using a relatively 
new method of testing tissue from underarm lymph nodes, new 
research shows. 
</P>
<P>
	A study found that the method -- first used in the 1970s -- was  
almost three times as likely to detect hidden lymph-node tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Using conventional tests, researchers discovered hidden tumors  
in 7 percent of 736 former breast cancer patients whose lymph nodes 
had been classified as ``disease free.'' Using the newer method, 
called ``immunohistochemical testing,'' hidden tumors were found in 
20 percent of the same 736 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is published in this week's issue of Lancet, a  
British medical journal. Its authors include experts from the 
University of Southern California, the European Institute of 
Oncology in Milan and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Alexander Neville, of the Ludwig Institute said the tests  
can help doctors predict whether cancer is likely to recur, and 
allow them to identify patients who could benefit from early 
chemotherapy treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immunohistochemical testing started in the 1970s but it's  
taken a long time for it to be adopted,'' he said. ``This is so 
simple anyone can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the method, researchers add a color stain to the lymph  
node tissue being examined. The stain highlights the cancer cells, 
which allows doctors to isolate them more quickly, Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said similar tests are available for colon cancer, lung  
cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Research laboratories commonly use the immunohistochemical tests  
for patients considered at risk of recurring cancer, but rarely for 
patients who have been declared disease-free, said Dr. Tim Perrenn, 
breast cancer specialist with the Cancer Medicine Research Unit in 
Leeds, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon McVie, director general of the London charity Cancer  
Research Campaign, said he hoped the study would push doctors to 
increase the use of new testing methods. 
</P>
<P>
	If women who died of breast cancer ``had the benefit of the new  
technology, their lymph nodes would have been reported by the 
pathologist as having cancer cells in them, and they would then 
have gotten chemotherapy and they would have been alive,'' McVie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrenn classified the study results as ``potentially quite  
exciting.'' But, he said, he was cautious because the research was 
only part of a larger study on chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would like to see a wider, specific investigation  
into the findings to verify the results.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Studies Religious Persecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A State Department report Thursday pointed to  
evidence of widespread religious persecution in Iraq, Iran and 
Afghanistan, all under varying degrees of authoritarian rule, and 
to discrimination in some democratic countries as well, including 
Israel and India. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, covering 194 countries and territories, is the first  
of what will become an annual assessment of the state of religious 
freedom around the world. The most serious violators could 
eventually face economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The study stressed that religious persecution is not confined to  
a particular faith. ``Throughout the world, Buddhists, Christians, 
Hindus, Jews, Muslims and other believers continue to suffer for 
their faith,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report did not rank the countries based on the degree  
to which they limit freedom, the excesses attributed to the Iraqi 
government stood out. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi leader ``Saddam Hussein has for decades conducted a brutal  
campaign of murder, summary execution and protracted arbitrary 
detention against the religious leaders and adherents of the Shiite 
Muslim population,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Iraqi security forces ``have murdered senior Shiite  
clerics, desecrated mosques and holy sites, arrested tens of 
thousands of Shiites and forcibly prevented Shiites from practicing 
their religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shiites in Afghanistan also suffered persecution and killing at  
the hands of the Taliban-led government in Kabul. Afghan police 
impose ``severe physical punishment and imprisonment'' for 
deviations from codes of worship and dress,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Iran is intent on eradicating the Baha'is through  
prolonged detention and imprisonment, confiscation and desecration 
of graveyards and holy places. It added that other religious 
minorities in Iran also suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the report made clear that democratic countries are  
far more tolerant of religious diversity than are countries run by 
totalitarian or authoritarian regimes. The report credits India, 
for example, for respecting constitutional provisions guaranteeing 
freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said, tensions between Muslims and Hindus in India, and  
to a lesser extent between Hindus and Christians, ``continue to 
pose a challenge to the concepts of secularism, tolerance and 
diversity on which the state was founded.'' It added that state and 
local governments only partially respect religious freedom. The 
report also said there have been numerous reports of human rights 
abuses carried out by the mostly Hindu security forces against the 
predominantly Muslim population in the region of Kashmir controlled 
by India. 
</P>
<P>
	As for India's rival, Pakistan, the report said discriminatory  
legislation has encouraged an atmosphere of ``religious 
intolerance, which has led to acts of violence by extremists 
against members of religious minorities, including Christians, 
Hindus, Ahmadis and Zikris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In democratic Israel, the report said the country's 20 percent  
Arab population does not receive the same quality of education, 
housing, employment opportunities and social services as Jews. In 
addition, it said, ``government spending and financial support are 
proportionally far lower in predominantly non-Jewish areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On China, the report said Chinese citizens can face harassment  
or prolonged detention in labor camps if they practice religion 
outside officially sponsored churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also cited credible reports of abuse against Buddhist  
monks and nuns in China, including Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, a Chinese spokesman rejected the allegations as  
malicious interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has been arrested or detained because of religious  
beliefs,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said. ``If religious 
believers are arrested, it is not because of their religious 
beliefs but because they have taken part in criminal activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to meet this weekend with Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin at the Asia-Pacific summit in Auckland, New 
Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: I Didn't Discuss Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he did not  
talk with his wife about his clemency offer to 16 Puerto Rican 
nationalists, while Hillary Rodham Clinton said she hopes opposing 
that clemency won't sully her possible Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and some law enforcement officials have accused  
Clinton of making the clemency offer to curry favor for Mrs. 
Clinton among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. Two more 
militants accepted the clemency Thursday -- bringing the total to 14 
-- even as the House of Representatives overwhelmingly condemned the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources in Puerto Rico close to the prisoners said they will be  
freed Friday, without specifying whether that included all 11 
eligible for release immediately after accepting Clinton's 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer allowed for the immediate release of 11  
prisoners, a release later for two others and forgiving fines for 
three other nationalists who are not in prison. White House 
officials said Thursday night that once clemency was granted, the 
timing on when the 11 prisoners would be freed was up to the Bureau 
of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters on the lawn just outside the Oval Office,  
the president said the political ramifications for the first lady 
played ``absolutely'' no role in his decision to free the 
nationalists. He said Mrs. Clinton wasn't aware of his offer until 
one of her aides asked her to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not discuss it with her,'' Clinton said. ``I have not  
discussed other clemency issues with her, and I didn't think I 
should discuss this one. It was up to her, and entirely appropriate 
for her, to say whatever she wanted to about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he doesn't believe his wife has flip-flopped on  
this issue, and it is up to New York voters to ``evaluate that as 
they please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her part, Mrs. Clinton -- who was in New York City --  
reiterated her opposition and said she understood ``the really 
strong feelings that my friends in the Puerto Rican community have 
on this issue.'' She appealed to them to understand her decision as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope by the time this election comes around in 14 or so  
months -- assuming that I'm on the ballot -- that I will have the 
support of as many New Yorkers as I can possibly reach,'' including 
``elected representatives of the Puerto Rican community,'' she told 
reporters outside a Queens junior high school where she was 
principal for a day last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., a native of Puerto Rico, said  
Mrs. Clinton now has a serious credibility problem, and he is not 
interested in endorsing her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still upset. I'm still hurt. I'm still angry and I've  
heard nothing to change my mind,'' Serrano said. ``If that campaign 
can be so insensitive to something that means so much to Puerto 
Ricans, how sensitive can they be to issues that affect blacks in 
my community? That affect Dominicans in my community? That affect 
Mexicans moving into my community?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those eligible for clemency were members of the  
ultranationalist FALN, responsible for some 130 bombings in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s that left six dead and scores wounded. 
None of those offered clemency were directly responsible for deaths 
or injuries, officials say. The original prison sentences ranged 
from 35 years to 90 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House of Representatives condemned the clemency  
offer on a 311-41 vote that was little more than a symbolic 
gesture, since Clinton holds exclusive power over clemency. But in 
a rebuke, 93 Democrats crossed party lines to side with Republicans 
pushing the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the absolutely wrong signal we can be sending to the  
American people and the absolutely wrong signal to be sending to 
terrorists around the world contemplating violence,'' said Rep. 
Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., the resolution's lead sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, two more of the Puerto Rican nationalists  
agreed to go along with the president's conditions -- which include 
renouncing violence and limiting involvement in the independence 
movement -- bringing the total accepting the clemency deal to 14, 
said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy. The two accepting on 
Thursday will have fines reduced and are not currently in prison, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the militants have rejected the clemency offer, Kennedy  
said.

<HEADLINE> Topless Woman Causes Traffic Jam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- It wasn't your standard weekday traffic jam when  
drivers slowed to watch a fire-spitting woman dancing topless atop 
a high-voltage electrical tower beside a freeway bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't meant to be.  
</P>
<P>
	Ara Tripp, 38, of Olympia, told The Seattle Times she planned  
the stunt for weeks to protest discrimination against women and 
laws that allow men to take their shirts off but not women. Tripp 
was a man before undergoing a sex-change operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp climbed the 180-foot tower Wednesday morning, took off her  
shirt and began dancing, occasionally taking swigs from a vodka 
bottle, spitting out the liquor and setting it aflame. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic on a nearby interstate bridge over the Lake Washington  
Ship Canal slowed to a near-standstill during the hour or so Tripp 
remained on the tower. 
</P>
<P>
	She had made a practice climb of the tower several nights  
earlier. Still, it was ``an extremely dangerous, hazardous 
situation,'' said Larry Vogel, spokesman for Seattle City Light. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility cut electricity to 5,000 homes and businesses to  
protect Tripp from being zapped by the 120,000 volts of juice 
flowing through the lines the tower supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp was arrested for investigation of criminal trespass and  
indecent exposure, each carrying a maximum penalty of a year in 
jail and a $5,000 fine, Best said. She was released after posting 
$690 bail and faces a Sept. 22 court date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll plead guilty,'' she said. ``It's pretty obvious.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tripp has a wife -- whom she married when she was still a man --  
strongly disapproved of the plan but was out of town Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not going to be happy,'' Tripp said. ``I'm going to be  
grounded.''

<HEADLINE> Tribe Takes 5th Straight AL Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians were 20,000 feet somewhere above  
the Central time zone when they clinched their fifth straight AL 
Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Cleveland's players didn't find out they were  
officially champs until they walked off their plane in Chicago 
early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Needless to say, there wasn't any champagne popped near the  
baggage carousel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shook hands and that was about it,'' Indians manager Mike  
Hargrove said from his hotel room Thursday. ``It was very 
subdued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, perhaps, very fitting.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was expected to win its division again this year  
without much of a struggle. But the Indians could never have 
imagined the route they would take to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has been ravaged by major injuries almost since opening  
day, and only in the past week have All-Stars Travis Fryman and 
Sandy Alomar returned. Even now, Hargrove has only been able to 
field his opening day lineup four times -- not at all since April 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	At moments this season, Cleveland's lineup had as many Buffalo  
Bisons as Indians. On Wednesday night, Hargrove used his 101st 
different batting order and the team has placed 15 players on the 
disabled list a total of 21 times. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the Indians failed to clinch Wednesday night by losing  
3-0 at Texas, they were forced to pack their champagne back in ice. 
Packed in ice is how many of Cleveland's players spent their time 
healing bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I expected to win our division, and I don't want to  
come off as arrogant,'' Hargrove said. ``That was one of the goals 
that we set before the season and one that was very attainable. But 
I can't say I thought we would clinch the division as early as we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With another regular seemingly injured every day, the Indians  
turned to their youngsters at Triple-A Buffalo for help. And the 
kids came through. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, rookie Einar Diaz became the starting catcher when Sandy  
Alomar underwent another surgery on his left knee. After some early 
struggles, Diaz improved defensively and became the team's unsung 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland also got major contributions from rookies Jacob Cruz,  
Jolbert Cabrera, Dave Roberts and Alex Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys we have are very good players,'' Hargrove said. ``And  
the guys who came in like Einar Diaz, stepped in and came up very, 
very big for us. That's been nice to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians' pitching staff has also had major problems of its  
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was counting on Jaret Wright to have a breakthrough  
year following an inconsistent '98. But Wright's confidence was 
severely shaken when allegations he was a headhunter prompted AL 
president Gene Budig to call the young right-hander into his office 
in New York in May for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright then hid an injury from the Indians, and has spent two  
different stints on the disabled list. He'll be activated this 
weekend for a Sunday start against the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Karsay, arguably the Indians' MVP in the first half of the  
season, also became a pitching casualty when Hargrove and Cleveland 
GM John Hart tried to convert him from long reliever to starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Gooden has also shuffled between the minors and the  
Indians as he battled injuries and inconsistency. And Cleveland's 
bullpen, considered the team's strength, has been shaky at best. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the turmoil, the Indians have managed to keep  
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Starters Bartolo Colon, Charles Nagy and Dave Burba have also  
had solid years, backed by the majors' most potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Manny Ramirez and Roberto Alomar are each having MVP-caliber  
years, and shortstop Omar Vizquel (.331 average) has become as 
valuable batting in the No. 2 slot as he is at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome, Richie Sexson, David Justice, and newly added Harold  
Baines may all drive in 100 runs, and as the Indians get healthier 
-- Wil Cordero came back from a broken wrist Wednesday -- their 
chances of winning their first World Series since 1948 get better. 
</P>
<P>
	During spring training, Hargrove set two goals: 100 wins and a  
Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Central crown was more of a checkpoint than a goal, but  
one Hargrove, who has done his finest managing job, is nonetheless 
proud of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never go into a season with any preconceived notions about  
how we might do,'' he said. ``But this is nice.''

<HEADLINE> Korean War Adoptees Come Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Susan Soon-Keum Cox walked through the Korean  
War memorial, with its chilling sculptures of tired, pained 
soldiers, and couldn't help wondering, ``Could one of those men be 
my father?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adopted by an American family in the aftermath of the Korean  
War, Cox longed to join with other Korean adoptees, to share 
stories of growing up before international adoptions became 
accepted, even popular. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, her vision becomes reality, as more than 400  
Korean adoptees gather for the first time, many of them the 
abandoned children of U.S. servicemen and Korean women. 
</P>
<P>
	They were raised in the United States in the 1950s and '60s,  
before there were books explaining adoption and before special 
culture camps helped kids born in foreign lands connect with each 
other. They constantly had to explain why they looked so different 
from their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference offers a chance to talk with those who  
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have children of our own, those questions of identity  
and balance become increasingly important,'' said Cox, who was 
adopted in 1956 after her Korean mother concluded she could not 
raise a child of mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of people attending the conference, which is open to  
all adult Korean adoptees, found many of them did not connect with 
their Korean identities until adulthood. Fewer than one-third 
thought of themselves as Korean-American while growing up, with 
about a third calling themselves Caucasian. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, two in three see themselves as Korean-American, with  
just one-tenth of them considering themselves Caucasian. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift is due partly to maturity, researchers say. As  
children grow up, they want to learn more about themselves and 
where they came from. It's also due to changing times, with more 
interest and acceptance of different ethnicities, which helps fuel 
their search for identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a society, we are much more interested in our  
individuality,'' said Cox, who was adopted through and now works 
for Holt International Children's Services, which pioneered 
international adoptions in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, international adoptions have exploded. Last year,  
nearly 16,000 children were adopted from other countries -- a number 
that's doubled in just 10 years -- and parents have many more 
resources to teach their children about their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wasn't always the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Paula Johnstone was adopted in 1958 and had a typical American  
childhood, growing up in Portland, Ore., and never thinking much 
about Korea. Then, in 1993, her mother died, and she started to 
think about who she was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked in the mirror and said, `I'm not white,''' she said.  
``It was almost like a midlife crisis. Now I'm soul-searching for 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming to the conference meant saving hundreds of dollars for  
the plane fare and other expenses; she says it's the first time she 
has saved for something she really wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought maybe I would find out more about myself, about who  
I am,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soul-searching is on the agenda. Participants will be divided  
into groups by age and asked to talk about their roots and 
childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up, I was the American kid, going to the local  
schools, doing what every American girl would do,'' said Anne Hai 
Ja Curtis, who was adopted in 1973 and grew up in Quincy, Mass. 
``It wasn't until a few years back that I began to look more into 
my identity, who I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of attendees, answered by 167 people, is not  
representative of all Korean adoptees, though it offers some 
insight into their experiences. Many reported racial discrimination 
growing up, and many said they were now interested in learning 
about their birth families and about Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 100,000 Korean children have been adopted by U.S.  
families since 1955, a trend that began with war children and grew 
through the years, fueled by Korean stigmas against out-of-wedlock 
births and adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, who came up with the idea of the conference while walking  
through the Korean War Veterans Memorial, is looking forward most 
of all to Sunday morning, when the entire group will rise at dawn 
and travel to the memorial together. 
</P>
<P>
	She remembers staring into the reflective black granite, with  
its sandblasted etchings of United Nations troops and Korean 
civilians. Nearby, statues depict infantrymen as they slog through 
a field, fatigue and pain etched into their detailed faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what angle you're at, they look at you and they look  
so scared,'' Cox said. ``It brings back all the questions, and 
there are no answers.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Dealers Facing Tough Times / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- The slump in crop prices hurting Pacific  
Northwest farmers is spilling over into other sectors of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales are down at farm implement dealerships -- prompting layoffs  
and branch closings for some -- and growers are becoming stingier 
when it comes to applying farm chemicals, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty much the first on the food chain,'' said Kirk  
Smith of Smith Truck &AMP; Tractor in Pasco. ``Even the better growers, 
rather than purchase (new), they're rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He worries the effects will spread throughout the rural economy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how far down the food chain you are in this;  
it'll hit fertilizer sales, auto dealers, department stores, 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new combine costs at least $150,000, and low interest rates  
aren't enough to entice budget-conscious farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said several of his regional competitors are laying off  
workers or have closed branches. And the slump has prompted a few 
employees at Smith's store to leave voluntarily, including a sales 
associate on commission and a mechanic looking for more hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The family business has survived other lean years when commodity  
prices nose-dived. But usually, it's only one or two commodities, 
not ``the whole spectrum,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat growers have been particularly hard hit. The soft white  
wheat typically grown in the Northwest costs about $3 per bushel to 
produce, but prices have been running about $2.73 per bushel -- 
about $2 less than the price four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Other crops -- including apples -- are experiencing similarly  
depressed prices due to a range of factors including overproduction 
and the slow recovery of the Asian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Othello, Larry Hawley of B&AMP;H Ag Chem said sales have slowed  
and profit margins have shrunk as growers opt for fewer 
applications of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time of year, we have a lot of money out that's yet to  
come in from the growers,'' Hawley said. ``We have to wait for 
their harvest. Hopefully, we're up high on their list to get paid 
when they get paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickup truck and car sales have slowed dramatically as regional  
agriculture-based economies struggle and farmers rein in 
discretionary spending, said Wyatt Tone, finance director of a 
Walla Walla Ford dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling about half of what we did this last year,'' Tone  
said. ``It's down, down all over in Eastern Oregon, Eastern 
Washington, Northern Idaho and in Montana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Mackay, chief financial operator for Kennewick-based  
AgriNorthwest, said the large, privately owned farming operation is 
still replacing vital, worn-out equipment and is continuing minor 
development projects started more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``anything discretionary as far as equipment goes, we're  
cutting back,'' Mackay said. ``We need to be frugal with every 
dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawley said many farmers are justifiably worried about their  
financial survival in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an interesting fall and spring, because the  
commodity markets are so far down, these guys are penciling this 
deal out,'' he said. ``A lot of them went in this year on nip and 
tuck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part about it is, we're losing more of the small  
farms, the family farms. I hate to see those things go. ... The 
family farm is what the nation was built on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Golden, a spokesman for Deere &AMP; Co., the Illinois-based farm  
equipment giant, said despite the slump, he's optimistic for the 
farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry will work through this,'' he said. ``Overall, the  
farmer is better equipped to handle this downturn than he was in 
the 1980s ...''

<HEADLINE> Drivers License Manager Admits Fix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former manager of a suburban Chicago driver  
licensing center pleaded guilty Thursday to rigging exams for truck 
drivers, bringing to a dozen the number of people convicted in an 
ongoing federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	George Velasco, 50, admitted taking payoffs and using his  
position to raise more than $25,000 in political contributions, 
including contributions to Illinois Gov. George Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was secretary of state at the time and in charge of driver  
licensing. Prosecutors have said that Ryan was not a target of the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 drivers illegally obtained licenses from 1991 to  
1998, U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar said. The drivers were told the 
answers to test questions, illegally coached and in some cases were 
given previously filled out forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Velasco refused to answer reporters' questions after the  
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	In pleading guilty, Velasco agreed to cooperate with federal  
prosecutors and could testify against others implicated in the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted in federal court that he conspired to rig the tests  
for money with a former trucking company employee, Gonzalo Mendoza, 
and Marion Seibel, another former manager of the driver licensing 
center who has pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendoza goes on trial Oct. 12 on charges he made thousands of  
dollars in payoffs and contributions to Ryan's campaign in exchange 
for passing scores on license tests for drivers he referred.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Suffer More Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Despite the extensive use of air  
power and artillery, Russian troops suffered heavy losses in their 
battles with Islamic rebels in southern Russia, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels in central Dagestan shot down a Russian Su-25 ground  
attack aircraft today -- the first jet lost since the beginning of 
fighting. The pilot ejected to safety, the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The military wouldn't say how the plane was shot down. The  
rebels have previously hit several helicopters with gunfire and 
ground-to-ground rockets, but there have been no reports of the 
rebels firing anti-aircraft missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian forces seized the heights overlooking two villages  
held by militants in central Dagestan on Wednesday. But in fighting 
there and elsewhere, 10 Russian troops were killed and 50 were 
wounded, said Mikhail Arkhipov, a spokesman for the Russian joint 
command in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll for the Russian troops in Dagestan has reached  
149 since the fighting began in early August, with 522 wounded, the 
Interfax news agency reported, quoting a senior Russian military 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The figures don't 
include casualties among the local police and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians say hundreds of rebels have been killed, though the  
militants say the claim is exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Khattab, an Arab who leads Chechen militants in western  
Dagestan, said in an interview that eight of his fighters have been 
killed and 12 wounded in fighting since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian forces needed more than two weeks of fighting in  
August to drive out militants who came from breakaway Chechnya. But 
the rebels returned Sunday, crossing the border at a different 
point and seizing a large swath of land in western Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the government troops are also trying to  
uproot a separate stronghold of Islamic militants in two villages 
in central Dagestan. Fighting continued for a 12th day today. 
</P>
<P>
	The villages of Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi have been contested  
throughout the fighting. The military has repeatedly claimed full 
control of the villages, but the militants continue to put up 
fierce resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have been fortifying positions and establishing  
protected supply lines to ferry ammunition and reinforcements into 
Dagestan, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday scolded the military for its  
``sloppiness,'' and many Dagestanis have expressed a growing 
exasperation with the military's failure to defeat the militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian artillery pummeled clay houses clustered in the valleys  
and combat jets shrieked overhead, firing rockets on suspected 
rebel positions. But Russian troops attempting to seize ground have 
encountered rebels emerging from their hideouts to repel the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it doesn't want to repeat the mistakes  
made in the disastrous 1994-96 war with Chechnya, in which Russian 
forces launched an all-out military assault that resulted in heavy 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in Chechnya, Russian troops have received support from  
civilians in Dagestan, where the region's leaders and ordinary 
residents oppose Islamic militants. Some 25,000 Dagestanis have 
enlisted as volunteers to combat the rebels, but the authorities 
have been able to arm only 5,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo told FBI Director  
Louis Freeh in a telephone conversation Wednesday that Osama bin 
Laden, the accused mastermind of the bombings last year against the 
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was behind the militants' 
offensive in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushailo said his ministry had information that bin Laden was  
the inspiration of the Islamic fighters, sending millions of 
dollars in financial aid to several Chechen warlords leading the 
Dagestan offensive.

<HEADLINE> Woman Gets 20 Years for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A woman was sentenced Thursday to 20 years  
in prison for beating to death her 6-year-old niece for getting off 
at the wrong school bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Smith pleaded guilty to homicide by child abuse in the  
October 1998 death of Charnell Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Charnell and her two young sisters were placed in the home of  
their aunt after the state removed them from their mother's home. 
Charnell's two older sisters already were living with Smith and 
Smiths three sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Charnell intentionally got off the bus at the  
wrong stop because of the way she was treated at Smith's home. 
</P>
<P>
	As punishment, Smith beat Charnell with an electrical cord, then  
ordered her to strip. When she didn't respond, Smith told her 13- 
and 11-year-old sons to strip the girl, and the boys joined in the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith then told the boys to ``crack'' Charnell's neck, which  
knocked her unconscious. She died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Smith said she simply spanked Charnell and would not  
have allowed her sons to beat the girl. But she accepted 
responsibility for the death. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year-old boy pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting child  
abuse and was sentenced in February to juvenile custody. No trial 
date has been set for the 11-year-old boy.

<HEADLINE> Rents At Military Housing Too High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rents at new apartments built under a  
government experiment to improve family housing for the military 
are too high for some sailors. So 60 units have been rented to 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	The garden-style apartments built by private developers near  
Corpus Christi, Texas, range in rent from $525 to $835 a month. 
That's more than what some junior-ranking Navy personnel stationed 
at three nearby bases receive in monthly housing allowances. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty Officer 1st class John Turner's $698 housing allowance  
doesn't cover his $750-a-month rent and $200 in monthly utility 
expenses. Turner said he took a four-bedroom apartment at the 
Corpus Christi complex a year ago because he had only a week to 
find a place for his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked that we had to pay so much,'' said his wife,  
Angela. To conserve money, she's cut back on groceries and keeps 
the blinds drawn all day to save on air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy families received preference from the developer and 85  
percent of the 404 available units were leased to military people. 
But because the rents were high and some Navy families prefer to 
live on base, the complexes didn't fill up with military renters. 
The remaining units were leased to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says it has a solution to the rent problem.  
Starting this fall, it plans to pay the developer the difference 
between each sailor's housing allowance and rent, so sailors won't 
have to dip into their base pay, which can be as little as $887 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a way to work out the difference, and that is the  
differential lease payments,'' Joe Sikes, director of the Defense 
Department's competitive sourcing and privatization office, said 
this week. Funds for differential payments will be released this 
month, unless Congress objects, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turners, whose rent rises to $835 in October, say they'll  
have to move if the differentialpayments don't come through. 
</P>
<P>
	The rent problem is the latest snag in a slow-starting Defense  
Department project aimed at replacing tens of thousands of 
dilapidated military homes with new or renovated units built by 
private developers. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding housing for the growing number of military personnel  
with families has become a serious problem. Two-thirds of the 
300,000 family homes owned by the Pentagon either need extensive 
renovations or are in such bad shape they should be replaced, a 
Pentagon study showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials convinced Congress that private developers  
could build homes faster and cheaper. Lawmakers gave the Defense 
Department the go-ahead in 1996 to provide loan guarantees, land 
leases and commercial incentives to developers, who could own and 
operate military housing units. 
</P>
<P>
	The department pledged that contracts for eight to 10 projects  
totaling 2,000 new units would be awarded within a year, but legal 
and bureaucratic delays slowed the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, just the two apartment developments near Corpus  
Christi and a third Navy privatization project in Washington state 
have been built, and they were in the works before the 
privatization program began. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials now say contracts for 14 projects totaling  
17,475 units will be awarded by August 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is part-owner of the two complexes near Corpus Christi,  
having contributed $9.5 million, one-third of their cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilians who rent there pay the same rate as military  
personnel, are subject to the same lease durations as military 
renters and can renew their leases even if military families are on 
a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Washington state apartments are rented to families  
from Naval Station Everett. 
</P>
<P>
	Sikes said renewal policies for civilian renters will vary at  
each project, but military families will always have preference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department has asked Congress to extend the program  
-- set to expire in early 2001 -- for five more years. 
</P>
<P>
	A skeptical Congress in August approved just $2 million for the  
housing privatization office for next year and directed $76 million 
towards traditional military housing construction. The Pentagon can 
use these funds for privatization projects if it chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dave Hobson, R-Ohio, chairman of the House military  
construction appropriations subcommittee, said privatization should 
``benefit those it's intended to benefit: our troops and their 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The program is still in its preliminary stages, so it is  
unclear whether privatization is an efficient means to get families 
new housing,'' Hobson said.

<HEADLINE> Mother Gets 21 Years For Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman accused of suffocating her 7-week-old  
daughter so she could get $200,000 in insurance money was sentenced 
to 21 years in prison, less than the maximum sought by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dina Abdelhaq was convicted in February of insurance fraud for  
deliberately suffocating her daughter and trying to pass off the 
cause as sudden infant death syndrome. Authorities said she planned 
to use the money to gamble on riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they were stunned that Ms. Abdelhaq did not get  
the maximum 35-year term at sentencing on Wednesday, an emotional 
hearing at which Ms. Abdelhaq's mother twice leapt out of her seat 
and shouted at the judge and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abdelhaq, 35, tearfully admitted that she bounced checks and  
stole jewelry from her mother to get gambling money while she was 
on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But she denied killing her daughter. She said her ex-husband had  
once asked her to get an abortion but she couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could feel a life growing in me,'' she sobbed. ``If I  
couldn't hurt a life inside me, how could I hurt a life outside 
me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors scoffed at her claim.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hasbro Buying Pokemon Cards Seller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Pokemon trading cards, so popular that  
stores are finding it hard to keep them in stock, are joining G.I. 
Joe and Monopoly in the toy lineup of Hasbro Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest toy maker said Thursday it is buying  
Wizards of the Coast, a games company that not only sells Pokemon 
cards but also owns the best-selling game Magic: The Gathering as 
well as Dungeons &AMP; Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	The $325 million deal is the latest acquisition in Hasbro's  
steady expansion into the games industry. This time, Hasbro also is 
getting dozens of shops with the potential to sell more of its 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pokemon trading card game is probably the hottest card on  
the market right now, so it's great timing to buy Wizards of the 
Coast,'' said Cliff Annicelli, the managing editor of Playthings 
magazine, a monthly trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their hands in basically every toy category that  
there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Byrne, a toy consultant, said Hasbro is reshaping itself  
into a children's entertainment industry that can more effectively 
compete with video stores and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's really cool about what Hasbro is doing is they are not  
walking away from their basic board games ... but they are walking 
aggressively into the new kind of gaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro's brands include Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Parker  
Brothers, Tiger and Milton Bradley. The company had $3.3 billion in 
sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards is expected to generate $400 million in sales this year,  
compared with $150 million last year, according to an analysis by 
Salomon Smith Barney. The investment firm estimates Pokemon cards 
will account for about $225 million in sales in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Pokemon (pronounced po-KEE-mon) is an inexpensive card game that  
debuted as a low-tech video game and burgeoned into an empire. It 
was started in Japan by Nintendo as a Game Boy video game in which 
players find, capture, collect and train 150 pet monsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hasbro obtained rights from Nintendo to make and  
market toys based on the Pokemon cartoon TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Pokemon made headlines in December when nearly 700 Japanese,  
mostly children, suffered blackouts, convulsions and nausea after 
watching one 30-minute episode of the TV series. A TV Tokyo 
investigation found that flashy special effects may have caused the 
illnesses. Programmers say the problem has been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Kneeland, owner of The Toy Shop, Ltd., a specialty store  
in Bristol, R.I., said he doesn't normally buy mainstream toy 
products because he can't compete with the mass market. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the case of Pokemon, he felt he had no choice ``because  
every other phone call was, 'Do you have Pokeman cards?' For 
Pokemon cards now, we're probably getting 20 calls a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is sold out of them.''  
</P>
<P>
	About a week ago, he put in an emergency call to a California  
distributor and ordered 144 booster packs. They sold out in two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing to me,'' Kneeland said.  
</P>
<P>
	A Wizards spokeswoman said with or without the acquisition, the  
company can't immediately increase Pokemon production. ``The 
popularity of the product is so strong that it has been very 
difficult to keep up with the demand. If we could beef up 
production, we certainly would. Our printers have been working at 
full capacity and have been for several months,'' said Charlotte T. 
Skeel. 
</P>
<P>
	It's premature to say whether the purchase will allow Wizards to  
expand its printing operation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to game cards, Wizards also is a leading publisher  
of fantasy and science fiction literature and owns almost 70 game 
stores. Wizards also hosts thousands of tournaments and owns a 
3,800-square foot entertainment center in Seattle, complete with a 
video and pinball arcade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro says it didn't intend to embark on a retail trend with  
the purchase, but simply wanted to broaden the gaming market. ``We 
bought the company that happened to have retail stores,'' said 
Wayne S. Charness, Hasbro's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what really got us going ... is it expanded our  
opportunities in games, which is a cornerstone of our growth 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro also announced this week that its subsidiary, Hasbro  
Interactive Inc., will now be developing products for Sega's new 
Dreamcast, the first home-gaming system to include Internet 
capabilities. That could mean a new world of interactive games 
where children play Dungeons &AMP; Dragons with other children in 
different parts of the world, Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Adkison, who founded Wizards in 1990 and is president and  
CEO of the company, will continue to run the business, which will 
remain Seattle-based. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., said an antitrust  
review already has been completed. It said the shareholders who 
control more than two-thirds of Wizards have agreed to approve the 
deal, which it expects to conclude by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said the acquisition will begin adding to Hasbro's  
earnings next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Hasbro was  
down 31 1/4 cents at $24.50 a share.

<HEADLINE> Hasty Returns to Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City cornerback James Hasty took  
Wednesday off to ponder retirement. On Thursday, he went back to 
work with the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasty said in a statement that his ``intentions were  
misconstrued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year veteran said he never intended for the matter to  
become public. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice Thursday, Hasty said nothing about his absence  
the day before, declining to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gunther Cunningham said he wasn't worried about Hasty's  
desire to play or how he would perform against the Bears on Sunday 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Hasty and I have a tremendous understanding,''  
Cunningham said. ``I'll tell you one thing, I'm not concerned with 
him playing the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said Hasty would not be disciplined for his absence.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasty is in the second year of a four-year contract with the  
Chiefs. He is the lone returning starter at cornerback after Dale 
Carter signed with Denver in the offseason.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Gun Buyback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is ready to hand over $15  
million in federal money to help communities take some of the 
nation's 200 million guns out of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which has had some success in several cities, will  
allow mayors to tailor the program to meet local needs, Andrew 
Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, said today. He 
suggested $50 be paid for each gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brady law and other gun-control laws are having success in  
keeping new guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them, 
Cuomo said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 200 million guns in this country. We have to reduce  
that number,'' Cuomo said. Buying back the guns -- people who have 
guns in the home who don't want them ... is one way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia bought 2,306 guns from their owners in  
a two-day buyback last month.

<HEADLINE> Pickens Signs Deal With Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Wide receiver Carl Pickens ended his walkout  
Thursday and signed a one-year, $3.5 million deal with the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	He could play Sunday in Cincinnati's season opener against the  
Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, the Bengals' career receiving leader, met for three  
hours with Bengals president Mike Brown. The deal was announced 
after the team finished practice and left the Spinney Field 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish that this had been concluded earlier, but it's good  
that it's concluded so Carl can spend his golden years with the 
Bengals instead of in retirement,'' said Brown, who attempted to 
set a lighthearted tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, 29, said he would sit out the season rather than return  
to the Bengals, who tagged him as their franchise player but were 
unable to get a trade offer that included a first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the Bengals were trying to negotiate a long-term deal  
with Pickens, who will receive the average of the top five players 
at his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time changes everything,'' said Pickens, who faced the  
prospect of losing about $200,000 a week if he did not come to 
terms before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Pickens will play when coach Bruce Coslet thinks he  
is ready to contribute. The Bengals lost all of their preseason 
games, and their offense struggled without Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also struggled last season with Pickens as the Bengals  
finished 3-13 for the fourth time this decade. Pickens said he 
wanted out of Cincinnati after seven losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Bengals designated Pickens their franchise  
player, making it tougher for other teams to acquire him. Pickens 
ended up signing for the same amount that was offered earlier, but 
said he was prepared to sit out the season as late as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was prepared to do that 100 percent,'' Pickens said. ``If  
that's what I had to do, that's what I would have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Steve Zucker, apparently persuaded Pickens to meet  
face-to-face with Brown, and called Wednesday to set up a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called Mike, I fully expected nothing to happen,''  
Zucker said. ``But when I heard his voice, I told Carl, `If we go 
in and talk to the Bengals, something could happen.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens leads the Bengals in receptions (473), receiving  
touchdowns (57), single-season touchdowns (17), single-game 
receptions (13) and consecutive games with at least one reception 
(77). 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens has seldom talked to reporters during seven seasons with  
the Bengals, and despite his accomplishments on the field has not 
attempted to endear himself to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	One former Bengals player called Pickens ``a cancer'' in the  
locker room, and Pickens was asked how he thought teammates would 
react to his return. Before he could answer, Coslet leapt to his 
defense with an expletive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one guy, about two years ago, who said that,'' Coslet  
said. ``This guy ... when he practices, he practices 100 percent; 
when he plays, he plays 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's water under the bridge. Leave it alone, all right? That  
is not fair, at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Jack Brennan said the Bengals would have until  
game time Sunday to decide whether to activate Pickens for the 
season opener.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank held  
interest rates steady Thursday at a regular meeting of its 
governing council. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 nations  
using the euro currency, said it will keep its key refinancing rate 
at 2.5 percent, in line with analysts' expectations. That rate is 
the interest the ECB charges commercial banks for buying back 
short-term securities when the banks need cash 
</P>
<P>
	It also kept its overnight deposit rate at 1.5 percent and its  
marginal lending rate at 3.5 percent.	   The deposit rate is the interest banks earn on overnight 
deposits with the central bank and the marginal lending rate is the 
interest on overnight loans to banks by the ECB. 
</P>
<P>
	The two benchmarks represent the floor and ceiling for  
money-market rates in the euro area. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank's decision to leave rates unchanged  
followed Wednesday's surprise move by the Bank of England to raise 
its base lending rate to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. The base rate 
is the interest Britain's central bank charges commercial banks for 
loans and last was raised in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain has yet to adopt the euro.

<HEADLINE> Owners To Donate Balitmore Eatery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The owners of beloved Haussner's Restaurant,  
which offered a rich taste of European cuisine and art for 73 
years, are getting out of the business and auctioning off their art 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 1, the restaurant will be donated to the Baltimore  
International College, a culinary school. The school said it will 
use the fully equipped building to train students. It was not clear 
whether the students would serve meals to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Haussner's was founded as a modest lunchroom in 1926 by German  
immigrants William and Frances Haussner. The restaurant was famous 
for its hearty, high-calorie menu, which included crab imperial, 
sour beef, potato pancakes and fried eggplant. Its waitresses were 
impeccably dressed and known for their long years of service. 
</P>
<P>
	The current owner, Frances Haussner George, the founders'  
daughter, said that Haussner's remains profitable but that ``it's 
the right time'' to close the institution, situated in the city's 
Highlandtown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something you can't explain to anybody,'' she said. She  
said her mother approved of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Haussner's has a staff of 95, down from 210 at its peak. Nearly  
a quarter of the workers have been there for 20 or more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all going to feel like women without a country,'' said  
Milly Aristidou, who started work as a waitress om 1957. ``Life 
will never be the same without Haussner's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The art and sculpture that decorated the restaurant walls are  
now receiving attention from experts. 
</P>
<P>
	A set of 160 paintings from the restaurant's collection of 19th  
century art will be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings are expected to bring nearly $8 million, said  
Sotheby's senior vice president Nancy Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. and Mrs. Haussner's collection is one of the great private  
collections of 19th-century European paintings in America,'' Ms. 
Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	But no single painting cost the Haussners more than $3,200.  
</P>
<P>
	Buses from a wide swath of the East Coast continue to deposit  
tourists for dinners selected from a 112-item menu. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of its popularity, Haussner's served 1,600 meals  
on Saturdays, and patrons waited an hour outside in a line 
stretching around the corner. It still serves 900 diners on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a magnificent and extraordinary gift,'' said George  
Piendak, chairman of the Baltimore International College board.

<HEADLINE> Horse-Shooting Suspects Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Two ex-Marines and a former high  
school buddy were ordered Thursday to stand trial in the killings 
of more than two dozen wild horses shot with rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	A justice of the peace ruled there was enough evidence to order  
all three to trial on charges of maiming or killing another 
person's animal. Four other charges, including theft and grand 
larceny, were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged are former Lance Crpls. Scott Brendle, 22, and Darien  
Brock, 21, and Anthony Merlino, 20, a construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The free-roaming horses were shot multiple times within a  
three-day period beginning on Christmas Day. They included young 
colts, pregnant mares and wounded mustangs that wandered for days 
before authorities chased them down and destroyed them.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Groups Launch TV Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A coalition of Hispanic organizations is calling  
for a boycott of the four major networks during the first two weeks 
of the TV season to protest ``the continued invisibility of Latinos 
on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC begins Sunday and  
continues through Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of La Raza, which is coordinating the  
boycott, counts just one Hispanic -- Martin Sheen, on NBC's ``The 
West Wing'' -- among the lead characters in the 38 new series 
premiering this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others continue on returning series: Bruno Campos (NBC's  
``Jesse''), and, on CBS, Hector Elizondo (``Chicago Hope'') and 
Cheech Marin (``Nash Bridges''). 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they make up less than 2 percent of all characters on prime-time 
shows, according to Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the boycott will not be measured by ratings, she  
said. ``If we can educate a large proportion of the community and 
others who are interested in this issue, then we've succeeded,'' 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the planned boycott, CBS spokesman Chris Ender  
said, ``We have talented Latinos in leading roles, but we recognize 
that there needs to be more representation both in front of the 
camera and behind the camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making improvements and understand that we need to do  
more,'' ABC said in a statement. ``This is an ongoing process and 
ABC is deeply committed to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox declined to comment on the boycott, and NBC had no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Targeting the ``big four'' networks for the boycott doesn't  
imply endorsement of UPN and WB, Navarrete said. ``And it's not to 
say that cable or film are doing that much better. We're starting 
with these four networks, because they are what everybody has in 
common.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP has similarly criticized network TV over a dearth of  
blacks on screen. At its national conference in July, that 
organization, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group, 
said it was going to monitor how network shows incorporate minority 
roles in their programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, the ``brownout'' was announced at the annual  
convention of La Raza, an Hispanic coordinating organization whose 
240 affiliate groups claim a membership of 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some networks have already made cast changes, though executives  
insisted they were in the works even before the outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	In their original form, none of the 27 new comedies and dramas  
set to premiere on the top four networks had minorities in a 
leading role and few had them in supporting roles. But more than a 
dozen minority characters have been added to new and returning 
series, including a Hispanic woman in ABC's sitcom ``Sabrina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly welcome the addition of characters,'' Navarrete  
said, ``but there's a bigger problem.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges More Welfare Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is failing to measure the  
ramifications of welfare reform adequately, particularly the fate 
of people who remain on the rolls, an expert panel concluded in a 
report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services must take a more  
active role in evaluating the dramatic changes to the welfare 
system so Congress and other policy makers will understand what 
changes are needed, the National Research Council said. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS officials responded that welfare is now run by the states,  
and they don't have the authority to tell states how to evaluate 
their programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really aren't in a position to tell the states they have to  
do anything,'' said Patricia Ruggles, who directs research on 
welfare reform for HHS. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the expert panel said, it's important that HHS try.  
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is in the midst of a major social experiment  
with its social welfare and safety net programs for the poor,'' the 
report said. ``There is tremendous interest among federal and state 
officials, policy analysts, and the public in knowing the 
consequences of this experiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, three years after the federal law was enacted, studies  
under way are inadequate, the panel concluded in a report funded by 
HHS. 
</P>
<P>
	Most state studies track those who leave the welfare rolls, but  
the panel said it is also important to study those who continue to 
collect assistance and those who are discouraged from applying in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, states, which have been designing their own  
studies independently, should be pushed to work together so data 
will be comparable across the country, the council recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS officials noted that the 1996 federal welfare overhaul  
turned the program over to the states, giving them responsibility 
to set their own welfare policies -- and to evaluate them. And the 
law requires very little data collection or program evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the academy feels we ought to be out there telling the  
states what to do, but we would meet resistance from the states if 
we tried that, and that isn't the intention of the act,'' Ruggles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department only has $5 million each year to use for  
evaluations -- only enough to fund a few projects, officials said. 
Hoping to facilitate cooperation, HHS has sponsored conferences and 
a computer discussion group for state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS has tried to balance federal leadership with the need to  
allow for state experimentation, said Michael Kharfen, a department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge of studying welfare reform is that it's no  
longer one program,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NL Ump Rippley Returning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- National League umpire Steve Rippley said  
Thursday he has decided against retirement and will resume work 
this weekend at Cincinnati, where the Reds play the Florida 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley has not worked in more than a week, unsure of his future  
after 22 of his colleagues were let go by baseball on Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, a company controlled by Richie Phillips, the head  
of the umpires' union, disclosed it has been receiving about 
$350,000 annually from the American and National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Air Freight Inc. has moved 2,000 tons of baseball  
equipment among 30 cities for more than 13 years, according to 
Richard Morris, the company's chief operating officer. The company 
also has worked with baseball-related charities, such as the Jackie 
Robinson Foundation, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris denied an allegation by Davey Phillips, a dissident  
umpire who is not related to the union leader, that it has several 
umpires on its payroll. Davey Phillips said last month the payments 
created a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pilot has engaged umpires for public relations purposes for  
nearly 15 years and currently has only two umpires who perform 
services for Pilot Air Freight,'' Morris said, adding that Davey 
Phillips ``had indicated a desire to join the Pilot staff in an 
ongoing capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Davey Phillips: ``I never pursued them, they pursued  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie Phillips steered me to an executive in my hometown of  
St. Louis. I worked for them two times -- I was not on the umpires' 
union board of directors at the time -- and that was the extent of 
it. I decided I did not want to do it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Phillips, along with Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck, has  
been organizing opponents to the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips is the chief executive officer of Pilot. Morris  
said its baseball-related revenue was less than 0.25 percent of the 
company's annual total. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Rippley, he had called the NL office last week, saying he  
wanted to retire because he was angry that he would have to work 
with many of the newly hired umpires, whom he said were too 
inexperienced to work in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	NL officials told him to take the weekend off and think about  
his decision before making it final. He then went to North Carolina 
for the funeral of the wife of AL umpire Drew Coble and informed 
the NL office on Wednesday that he would stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, 45, is a 16-year veteran and a crew chief. Gary Darling  
and Larry Poncino, who had been on Rippley's crew, were among the 
22 umpires whose resignations were accepted. Rippley's new crew 
includes Wally Bell, Jerry Meals and Hunter Wendelstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who is in his seventh season, was one of three NL umpires  
who broke with the union leadership. Meals is in his third NL 
season and Wendelstedt is among the 25 newly hired umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley said he did not want to speak publicly about his reasons  
for changing his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the selection of an arbitrator who will determine  
whether the 22 umps were legally let go was postponed until next 
week, union lawyer Pat Campbell and management lawyer Howard Gans 
decided during a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an agreement forged last week at federal court in  
Philadelphia, the sides agreed the umpires could file a grievance 
claiming the 22 should have been allowed to withdraw their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Arbitration Association's Philadelphia office  
provided a list of 15 arbitrators. The sides will take turns 
striking names until one remains, and he will be the arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners intend to argue the arbitrator shouldn't hear the case,  
claiming the collective bargaining agreement leaves decisions on 
terminating umpires to the sole discretion of league presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires submitted their mass resignations in July, all effective  
Sept. 2, hoping to spur an early start to bargaining for a labor 
contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when about two dozen umpires refused to  
go along, and baseball then hired 25 replacements and accepted the 
22 resignations.

<HEADLINE> Plane's Landing Gear Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Part of the landing gear on a DC-9  
collapsed as the plane touched down Thursday at the airport, 
causing the left wing to scrape the runway as the pilot brought the 
aircraft to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 48 people on board the TWA flight from St. Louis was  
seriously hurt. Three people were taken to a hospital with back 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching the sparks fly off the wing. Everyone was  
pretty scared. We could see fuel,'' said passenger Virgil Whetsell 
of Watertown, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters converged on the plane and doused it with foam.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane was landing around noon when there was ``a slow  
collapse'' of the left rear landing gear, TWA spokesman Jim Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Terry Pierce of Sioux City, Iowa, said when the wing  
touched the runway he began thinking of the 1989 crash of a United 
Airlines flight in his hometown. That plane cartwheeled down the 
runway, killing 112. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid the wing would catch and we would just flip,'' he  
said. ``The pilot did a nice job to keep it square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce said after the plane stopped, the pilot, John Hulett, 39,  
apologized for the ``flat tire.'' The passengers laughed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said it was unclear what caused the accident. TWA  
mechanics were sent to examine the plane, and the National 
Transportation Safety Board was investigating.

<HEADLINE> Sun Micro Tries 'Dumb' Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Corporate computer buyers were hesitant  
Wednesday about using a new bare-bones machine from Sun 
Microsystems that never needs a software upgrade and is far simpler 
than conventional desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial reservations about the new Sun Ray machine were  
reminiscent of the weak response to an earlier stripped-down 
machine from Sun that failed to loosen the Microsoft's grip on the 
computing world with its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun is promoting Sun Ray as a niche product for repetitive tasks  
such as entering and retrieving computer data or handling customer 
service phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The new machine is little more than a small box that transmits  
images to a screen, and therefore doesn't have to be replaced every 
few years. Departing modestly from Sun's network computer of a few 
years ago, the Sun Ray has no processing power at all. Instead, it 
relies on software running on a central computer server. 
</P>
<P>
	Some organizations have already ordered the device, which is  
targeted to major corporations and costs $10 a month. The Bank of 
Nova Scotia plans to use 300 of the Sun Ray terminals by the end of 
the year. The Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, happy with its tests 
using eight of the terminals for online catalog and general 
Internet searches, plans to replace 1,200 personal computers with 
Sun Ray terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer buyers at some major companies said the product  
wasn't mainstream enough to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just not sure this is a solution that will be embraced on  
a widespread basis,'' said Rich Walsh, director of information 
technology for the Honeywell-Measurex, a unit of Honeywell Inc. 
that makes equipment for the pulp and paper industry and has 1,100 
desktop and laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pepsi Bottling Group, chief information officer Jim Milde  
said, ``We're always looking at emerging technologies, but at this 
point I don't think we'll be changing our direction from where we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those doubts were eerily similar to those that confronted Sun  
when it joined with Oracle Corp. several years ago, touting 
``network computers'' as a replacement for the Windows machines 
that dominate the world's desktops. 
</P>
<P>
	Those computers never really took off, in part because users  
favored the flexibility of desktops that let them store software 
and information on their computer hard drives. Meanwhile, the 
prices of PCs have plunged in recent years, negating most of the 
cost savings of buying a network computer. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Sun insists Sun Ray can succeed as an alternative to  
the increasing complexity of today's desktop computers, which 
despite impressive advances often seem frustratingly difficult to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun also is trying to exploit the frustration of corporations at  
the escalating costs of upgrading computer software, which can cost 
hundreds of dollars per machine each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine, also available for an undiscounted price of $499,  
doesn't include the monitor, which can cost several hundred dollars 
more. It also requires a network that transfers data at a speed of 
at least 10 megabits per second, as well as a Sun server computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun Ray also addresses a gripe of many computer users,  
turning on very rapidly. A demonstrator pulled its plug Wednesday, 
then put it back in, and within 20 seconds all the original 
information was back on the screen. In a conventional desktop, 
unsaved information probably would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are limits to the kinds of software that the Sun Ray  
can handle well. A central server may not be able to handle too 
many users trying to simultaneously run applications that require 
lots of processing power, including software for manipulating and 
touching up photos, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the (network computer), if and when it finds success, it  
will do it in a limited way,'' said Joe Barkan, an analyst for the 
Gartner Group consulting group, based in Stamford, Conn. ``It isn't 
going to be a replacement across all desktops.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa State Announces $80M Gift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa State University's College of Agriculture  
has received a record $80 million donation, at least some of which 
may literally be seed money. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said Thursday the gift came from two donors who  
died earlier this year and wished to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	But The Des Moines Register said at least part of the donation  
came from the estate of Raymond and Mary Baker of Des Moines. Baker 
graduated from ISU in 1935 with a degree in agronomy and went on to 
become director of research at Pioneer Hi-Bred International, an 
Iowa seed company. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift is the largest to a U.S. college of agriculture, and  
the 26th-largest to higher education in the country, the university 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the gift with fireworks, confetti and student cheers,  
University President Martin Jischke praised the donors as 
hard-working Iowans who put their families first, valued their 
state and credited some of their success to ISU. They were ``rich 
in generosity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university hopes to use the gift to make the college's  
agronomy program a national leader, with emphasis on such things as 
plant breeding and farm profitability. The college has about 3,600 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tom Vilsack said programs and research conducted at the  
school as a result of the donation will lead to new opportunities 
and markets for farmers and new manufacturing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey Kunde, a senior and president of the undergraduate  
agronomy club, said she was overwhelmed when she learned of the 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost wish I didn't have to graduate so I could see the  
exciting things they do with this money,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Serbs March on Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A crowd of angry Kosovo Serb refugees  
swelled to 700 today, and police set up new roadblocks to try to 
prevent them from marching on Belgrade to protest what they feel is 
government indifference to their plight. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the crowd was evicted Wednesday from a school near  
the central town of Kraljevo. They moved into the school after 
fleeing Kosovo in June, following the withdrawal of the Yugoslav 
army from the southern province. 
</P>
<P>
	The families were forced from the school building 80 miles south  
of Belgrade after the government ruled they could no longer stay 
because of the Sept. 1 start of school. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending most of the day in the open, the refugees were  
offered a windowless, roofless ruin with no electricity or water as 
alternative shelter. They refused and embarked instead on a protest 
march to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Police then stopped the column of tractors and refugees at an  
overpass leading to the highway to Belgrade and ordered them to 
stay within Kraljevo city limits, the radio report said. After dark 
and in heavy rain, the refugees continued their march early today, 
ignoring police roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, about 350 other refugees from Kraljevo and neighboring  
villages joined them. By early this afternoon, police and 
government officials at new barriers near Cacak, 80 miles southwest 
of Belgrade, were negotiating with march leaders, as the rest of 
the refugees -- many of them women and children -- waited, cramped in 
tarp-covered trailers pulled by tractors under a pouring rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Government negotiator Milovan Nenadovic offered accommodations  
for the group in several towns and villages in the area, adding: 
``You are in no position to set any demands.'' But the protesters 
turned him down, demanding instead to be allowed to march on the 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are they terrorizing us, why are they setting up  
barricades,'' said Mirka Ribac, 60, from the Kosovo town of Klina. 
``We are sick of this, it would be better if they started shooting 
and killing us all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs fled the Albanian-majority  
province in June, afraid of reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians. 
Kraljevo registered some 20,000 Serb refugees from Kosovo but 
10,000 more than that are believed to be in the central Serbian 
town.

<HEADLINE> Report: Indian Tribes Need Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian tribes get only a third of the  
money they need from the federal government for basic services such 
as child welfare and care for the elderly, the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs says. 
</P>
<P>
	While about one in 10 tribes makes casino profits worth more  
than $10,000 per tribal member a year, the rest need hundreds of 
millions of dollars more each year to provide basic services, a BIA 
report said. In the 1998 fiscal year, federal funding fell short by 
about $1.2 billion in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Of more than 550 tribes, 166 had casinos in 1996, with 28 tribes  
losing money and only 54 tribes making casino profits worth more 
than $10,000 per tribal member. The basic BIA funding to those 
tribes is only about $10 million a year, or about $185,000 per 
tribe, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of shifting federal Indian policies, coupled with  
limited resources and investments in Indian communities and Indian 
people, cannot quickly be reversed by a few good years of casino 
revenues,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday and  
was to be released at a news conference today by Kevin Gover, the 
head of the BIA, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress had asked for the report -- due in April -- amid debate  
over whether the BIA should shift funding from successful casino 
tribes to more poverty-stricken tribes. A study by Congress' 
General Accounting Office found that some smaller and relatively 
affluent tribes got much more funding per person from the BIA than 
larger, poorer tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has criticized the disparity for  
years and made several attempts to force the BIA to shift funding 
from richer tribes to poorer ones. Gorton's spokeswoman, Cynthia 
Bergman, said the new BIA report was disappointing because it 
offered few recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so frustrating,'' Bergman said. ``It sounds like they  
waited six months to opt for the status quo, and the rich tribes 
will continue getting richer and the poor tribes will continue to 
get poorer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes have opposed proposals to redirect the BIA funding,  
arguing that they do not get enough money to begin with and that 
such funding is part of the federal government's constitutional and 
treaty obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tribes hold a firm position that it's not your money, the  
money was there for the benefit of our people,'' said Ron Allen, 
president of the National Congress of American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The BIA report agrees that the tribal funding should not be  
reallocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The predominant view (among tribal leaders) is that all tribes  
are underfunded, and to take from one tribe and give to another is 
only trying to equalize the poverty,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Indian Affairs Committee will probably hold a hearing  
on the issue either later this year or early next year, said Chris 
Changery, spokesman for committee Chairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell, 
R-Colo.
