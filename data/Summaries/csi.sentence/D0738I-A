Gold production in 1995 stood at between 53 and 55 tons, and gold export amounted to 600 million dollars last year.
The increase in gold production, which put Mexico in the 17th place worldwide, was due to an increase in demand for exports and to the investments that were made during the past two years in the mining industry, mainly in the north of the country.
This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
Participants from mining sectors of 14 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Brazil, the United States, Peru, Colombia
