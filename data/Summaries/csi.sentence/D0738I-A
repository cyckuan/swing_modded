Six of the country's 50 biggest exporting companies are gold mining companies.
--Peru will rank seventh largest gold producer this year, an official from the Mining.
This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
The increase in gold production, which put Mexico in the 17th place worldwide, was due to an increase in demand for exports and to the investments that were made during the past two years in the mining industry, mainly in the north of the country.
--Peru's mining production is expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent
