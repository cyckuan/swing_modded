(AP) -- Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day trading offices. ``We have no way of knowing if he had paid them back or whether he was going to pay them,'. In the days leading up to the gunfire, he killed his wife and his two children in Stockbridge. Also one week after Barton's rampage, there was more workplace violence. In Pelham, Ala., a man shot two people to death at his company's office and then killed a third at a business where he used to work.
