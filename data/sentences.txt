ONONDAGA NATION _ Irving Powless Jr.
, the 69-year-old chief of the Onondaga Indian Nation, longs to see the day when his people enjoy economic stability and independence _ and not from the revenues of a casino or a bingo hall.
Rather, Powless, whose tribe opposes gambling, hopes that a settlement with the state of New York over ancient land claims will bring his brethren the assets they desperately need to upgrade their 7,300-acre reservation south of Syracuse.
``We have lived in this area for 1,200 years,'' said Powless, a robust man who recalls with pride when, a generation ago, he competed against football great Jim Brown in a lacrosse match and knocked the powerful All-American and Hall of Fame fullback off his feet.
``There was fresh water, fresh air, no pollution''.
Today, the Onondagas are neither financially wealthy nor land rich.
Pollution, from a dump and from a petroleum spill at a cigarette shop, has fouled the Indian territory.
``We're considered poor,'' Powless said.
``How do you measure that?...
How many homeless people do you have in your city?
We have zero''.
Members of the tribe have a right to live on the reservation, but many survive on low-wage jobs and welfare _ the consequence of a people ``living in abject poverty'' for 200 years, according to Robert Coulter, a lawyer with the Indian Law Resource Center, a nonprofit group that is helping the Onondagas on their proposed claim.
The Onondagas haven't yet gone to court to stake their land claim, but the nation is building a case against the state of New York that would follow suits filed by other Iroquois nations _ the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida and Seneca _ with the federal government as co-plaintiff.
Several Indian law and history experts believe the Onondaga case would be very strong.
The tribe has identified a 10-mile-square section of Onondaga County as an area to which it lays claim.
The land includes a mile surrounding Onondaga Lake and most of Syracuse, a city of 163,000 in upstate New York.
That represents a fraction of the acreage that the Onondagas controlled more than two centuries ago.
Powless said he has been hearing about land claims since he was a boy growing up on the reservation, where his father, Irving Powless Sr.
, also served as chief.
Powless views the reservation as an island representing the hundreds of thousands of acres wrongfully taken by and poorly used by ``the Europeans'' who obtained Indian properties illegally.
He smiles as he talks about his boyhood on the Onondaga territory, where he learned to fish, hunt and play sports.
One of the top three officers among the 14 chiefs of the Onondagas, Powless has proven to have a tough side to him.
And some Onondaga members feel Powless is too powerful.
``No one can have anything unless you go through him,'' says Alice Thompson, 64, who lives on the reservation.
Thompson, according to Powless, was part of an insurgent group that wanted to overthrow his government.
A land-claim settlement would be a way to ease some of the tensions that remain.
It could pump up the tribal government's popularity, pay for toxic cleanups and help the Onondaga government afford better educational, cultural and social programs.
Powless said the Onondaga people want to work with the community outside the reservation to improve the economy of the region, perhaps creating tourism destinations that might include Indian culture, or setting up a free-trade zone at unused manufacturing sites.
The Onondagas say they don't intend to threaten eviction of property owners in whatever suit they file, unlike the Cayugas and Oneidas.
But they have not ruled out governmental and commercial property holders as targets for eviction.
``Maybe they should be subjected to some of the things we were subjected to _ such as taking your land away from you for 200 years,'' Powless said .
PHOENIX _ Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers to stop asking how she spends that money.
Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because there's only enough money for one meal a day.
Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear apart a computer and put it back together.
It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult and indifference.
It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from welfare to work.
White Mountain Apache community's welfare program started in April.
Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996 federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.
Most of the 16 Indian-run programs across the nation are designed to emphasize education and soften the punitive nature of many state programs.
And most are in need of more money.
The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're training their own.
By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce, welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for their elders in exchange for their benefits.
``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo, a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis' program and the state-run program.
``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
``These people have always been on the fringes''.
Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S.
Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.
Indian leaders were invited to report their welfare reform progress and problems to Arizona's Congressman J.D.
Hayworth and Rep.
Clay Shaw of Florida, chairman of the U.S.
House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing in the state capital.
Most Arizona tribes are grappling with the opportunity to cushion their members from the harsher blows of the state's welfare reform and to refocus their own bureaucracies to aid their neediest families.
``It's a unique opportunity the state can't begin to do because they have thousands of people,'' said Lillia Castaneda, who is in charge of putting the Salt River community's 250 to 400 adults now receiving benefits to work.
``They're not numbers to us, they're people.
They're families''.
But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown, Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at Washington University in St.
Louis, Mo.
He also isn't sure that the federal government is ready to pay the price of putting people to work on the nation's poorest reservations.
Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family limit on welfare benefits.
That limit is pressuring states to move quickly with reform.
Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown.
Expensive problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to pay for solving those complicated problems.
The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program, are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to prepare for work, some are older with more children and less education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have waiting lists.
There is little money and staff to help find families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems _ families Garcia is unwilling to let go.
As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and distribute cash benefits for their members.
The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of cash benefits.
It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working with three different federal regional offices.
While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a little more than two years.
The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on welfare.
While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.
The tribe has 350 welfare families, or about 10 percent of its membership, some of whom live in in Scottsdale and Guadalupe.
This tiny, small-town program can provide face to face encouragement.
Molina and her other classmates only agreed to commit to the two-year computer course after people they knew knocked on their doors, tapped them on the shoulder, gave them a little push and took them by the hand to prove to them they could compete.
``Jorge (Garcia) came to my house,'' said Molina.
``I was cleaning.
I told him, `I'm not even dressed'.
He said, `Just go like you are'.
'' Garcia drove the nervous Molina to the tribal offices to interview for the program.
``I was scared,'' Molina said.
``I've just been having kids and staying home and didn't feel I had the knowledge to learn anything''.
Molina's classmates and teacher said she's now the first to volunteer to wrestle the insides of a computer she was once afraid to touch.
But it's Molina's children who keep her coming every day.
She renewed her friendship with her distant 13-year-old daughter with conversations about computers.
``They're telling everybody `My mom's in computer class.
My mom's building computers'.

SYRACUSE, N.Y.
(AP) - New York acted honorably in acquiring Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to protect the Iroquois tribe, a Canadian anthropologist testified Wednesday.
After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied, bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre reservation, U.S.
District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different historical perspective from the state's first witness, Alexander von Gernet.
McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which required Congressional approval for all Indian land transactions.
Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral lands.
The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to understand New York's behavior dealing with Native Americans after that time, said von Gernet, a Native American expert from the University of Toronto.
It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said.
Historical documents show that as early as 1684, the colonial governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes, he said.
That policy was carried forward in other treaties, laws and proclamations enacted over the next century, von Gernet testified.
It was a policy also included in the state constitution, he said.
''Congress was a newfangled institution.
Colonial New York had a longrunning relationship with the tribes,'' von Gernet said.
''The idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in New York.
It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary War''.
The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a conquered people and make them wards of the state, von Gernet said.
However, then Gov.
George Clinton ignored the warnings and instead decided to broker a treaty with them, von Gernet testified.
Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership of Indian lands, the treaty also ensured reservation land would be set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land, he said.
Von Gernet also testified: -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for 22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about buying their reservation land.
-That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the Revolutionary War, leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each follow its own course.
The Cayugas' witnesses have testified that in agreeing to the 1795 treaty, New York knowingly ignored Iroquois tradition, which required the Grand Council's consensus to make the treaty binding.
Additionally, von Gernet said, following the war, the Cayugas split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position through achievement as opposed to inheriting them.
''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in diplomatic discourse,'' von Gernet told McCurn.
He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal by state lawmakers.
The minority faction, led by Steel Trap, returned to the Cayuga Lake area, where faced with an onslaught of settlers, it eventually worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe's lands to New York except for the 64,000-acre reservation.
BERNALILLO, N.M.
_ With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation.
Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled shores and face north from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in the sky to the east.
Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is a giant neon star bearing the words ``Star Casino''.
Next to the casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole championship course.
And just beyond that, construction is under way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course.
After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations.
But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts, gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these people have for generations cherished and protected from outside intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.
``It's like a leisure virus,'' said Jose Lucero, a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe located about 60 miles north of here.
His tribe is divided over whether they, too, should develop a casino resort.
``We're trading our souls for money,'' he said.
``Some tribe members say `Hey, it's OK.
It's glamorous'.
But that's not what we are supposed to be.
We are supposed to be stewards of this land.
And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this stuff to take over''.
With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations.
But a once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder.
Critics worry that tourists will trample across what they consider to be religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes are forming are increasingly being operated by outside professionals and managers.
``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe.
But the medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and culture, he added, ``are getting pushed aside in a way''.
Leon, who voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed emotions.
``Things seemed OK at first,'' he said.
``But then more of the Las Vegas types started moving in''.
Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what appears to be progress.
Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than $350 million a year in gambling revenues.
And although there is still poverty on the reservations, jobs are plentiful, recreation centers and libraries have been built, and major investments are being made to augment the success of gambling.
Several tribes are expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts, and the tribe that is leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo.
Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt Hotels Corp.
to build what is being billed as ``New Mexico's first major golf and spa resort''.
The 350-room resort hotel will occupy a picturesque section of the 61,000-acre reservation, which is located 15 miles north of Albuquerque.
The tribe will own the resort and Hyatt will manage it.
Additionally, the tribe is doubling the size of its adobe-style Star Casino and adding a Las Vegas-style theater.
A retail shopping center is proposed for a nearby section of the reservation.
Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana Pueblo tribe is operating a gourmet restaurant on the reservation, next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse.
This year, the tribe will host major golf tournaments, including the U.S.
Women's Amateur Public Links Championship and the PGA Western Club Championship.
nn As the tribal members who are leading the development boom see it, they are doing more than investing the casino's profits to increase economic opportunities.
With pending lawsuits and other initiatives that could shut down their casinos or lead to heavy taxes on their revenues, they say they are creating an industry that can survive even if the casinos do not.
``There are so many attacks on Indian casinos,'' said Roy Montoya, who as chief administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business development.
``What the new resort represents is another step toward self-sufficiency''.
Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils comprised of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to private business has created two camps.
The traditionalists are leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the business leaders like Montoya are pushing to expand.
As the profits from gambling began to add up, ``we considered two approaches,'' Montoya said during an interview in his plain but comfortable office on the reservation.
``Some people said stash the money.
Don't do anything with it.
But we chose to put these different ventures in place''.
The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by the economic growth.
``Our culture and religion was very strong when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the reservation,'' he said.
``Then when the economy started changing and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak.
But with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with your family and in 15 to 20 years the religion and culture will become stronger again''.
The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning.
When the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from ``The Snake Head,'' one of the reservation's many ancient religious sites.
``But the business types said they needed that site next to the river, overlooking the mountains,'' said Leon, whose grandfather held the revered religious title of medicine man.
The business interests prevailed.
As a result, Leon lamented: ``The religious people are upset with us.
They worry that the public will wander over the reservation''.
One planned aspect of the Hyatt resort that might appease the religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the tribe's history.
Such museums are becoming a common element in casino and resort developments on reservations.
&QL; Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's reservation.
But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the growth.
Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values and customs.
``I've noticed a complete lack of participation in ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with diversions like the casino,'' he said.
Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in the opportunities that have been created.
One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member, was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across Highway 47 from the tribe's casino.
Although he has been playing golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap _ better than most golfers will ever play _ and the golf professionals operating the course have high hopes for him.
``The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business enterprises and train their people,'' said Brent Townsley, a teaching professional at the course.
``But our goal is to see someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro''.
Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers, accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl around the reservation is unnerving to some.
``They're taking a lot of the control of the economic development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe itself,'' said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe.
``I'm amazed that many of the tribes have turned into what they've deplored all their lives.
They're bureaucracies and they're being run by attorneys and accountants _ white attorneys and accountants''.
But if appearances count for anything, Roy Montoya appears to be in control at Santa Ana.
One day recently, he walked into a closed-door meeting of casino executives because he wanted to have a word with the casino's general manager, a Las Vegas transplant.
Minutes later, he was at the reservation's planning offices, interrupting another meeting of architects and developers who were huddled around a conference table.
When Montoya entered, they all popped to their feet, smiling broadly.
``We own everything 100 percent,'' Montoya said.
``All of these people are on contract, just like out in the rest of the world''.
Montoya oversees a staff of more than 400 employees, and in two years, when current development projects are complete, that number is projected to reach 700 _ more employees than tribal members.
``When I started this job in '84 I had nine employees and I was just called Roy,'' said the 58-year-old Montoya.
``Now people call me sir.
But I'm still Roy.
I get uncomfortable with sir.''

SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.
_ The road leading into the Shinnecock Indian reservation is not a welcoming one: The sign marking the way reads, ``Trespassers will be arrested''.
Some uninvited people _ drug dealers and government workers _ have been reportedly fired upon after crossing onto tribal lands.
Tourists are simply asked to leave.
The Indians are an insular lot.
The world outside their 800-acre reservation here on the Shinnecock Peninsula knows little about them, and for 350 years, that's the way they have preferred it.
Their dealings with society, they say, have never been good.
``It seems every time we've dealt with the white man, we've come out the worse for it,'' said Harriet Gumbs, a 79-year-old elder and a tribal historian.
The reservation is a postage stamp of marshland swamped by poverty and unemployment.
For years, the Indians watched as land that was once theirs was transformed into housing subdivisions.
Although they complained, there were few sympathetic ears at the local courthouse and Town Hall.
After all, they had signed treaties and land-swap agreements, officials say.
``They built on our ancestors' bones, and we never really did anything to stop it,'' said Elizabeth Haile, 69, a member of the Thunderbird clan who watched over the years as houses and other buildings sprouted up around the reservation.
``That's changing with the young people''.
East End power brokers on Long Island have taken notice as this new breed of Shinnecock have lain in front of bulldozers, marched on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the state Capitol in Albany to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to the north of the Montauk Highway, the road that separates the reservation from the rest of Southampton.
The news of the protests has spread from Indian-run radio in Canada to the editorial pages of The News From Indian Country, a newspaper.
The young Shinnecock have been radicalized by the success of tribes that were once destitute, like the Oneida Indians.
The Oneida reservation was once a tumble-down 32 acres in upstate New York, but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the return of 250,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica.
As a result, the young group of Shinnecock are talking aggressively about claiming 3,600 acres of prime Southampton real estate that includes three golf courses _ among them the renowned Shinnecock Hills, site of the U.S.
Open in 2004 _ and Southampton College of Long Island University.
It is land that once belonged to the Shinnecock.
It is land they want back.
The tribe filed a petition with the federal government three years ago seeking recognition and has since raised the specter of casinos on the East End.
``A lot of my people are scared about what we're doing,'' said Becky Genia, 43, who left the reservation as a teen-ager in the mid-1970s and learned the politics of protest with the American Indian Movement.
``We're surrounded by very rich people.
The folks on the res think that raising Cain about broken promises and miserable living conditions means they're going to take what little land we got left.
I got news: they aren't going to touch another acre of it''.
Developers say that they hold a title to the disputed 62 acres that dates back more than a century, and their claim to the property is built on firm legal ground.
``The homes are being built as we speak,'' said John Bennet, a lawyer for the developers, Parrish Pond Associates.
``The Indians' lawsuit was thrown out of court''.
The Indians have stopped short of laying formal claim to the 62 acres, but say the wooded site is a small but sacred portion of their heritage that should be preserved.
The Shinnecock are a state-recognized tribe, but one of more than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government.
They have no access to federal education and health money and run no gambling operations.
More important, they receive no legal assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, so their land claims hang in limbo.
According to records, in the early 18th century, the town of Southampton paid the tribe $20 for its land and gave it a 1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres.
In 1859, town officials convinced the state legislature that the Shinnecock were willing to break that lease to allow the Long Island Rail Road to go through in exchange for outright title to the current reservation on Shinnecock Neck.
John Strong, a professor emeritus of history at Southampton College, said he believes the Shinnecock were pressured into the deal and that the signatures on the document were faked.
If a court should ever rule in the Shinnecock's favor, the tribe would hold legal title to billions of dollars in property.
``This new group of Indians have got people's attention,'' said state Sen.
Kenneth LaValle, a Republican who represents the area.
``The buzzword is casino.
Right now, the Indians don't have a friend in the world, but if they get the feds on board, imagine the fight.
The Hamptons are the playground of the powerful.
You think they'll stand for rabble coming out from the city to play cards, get drunk and urinate on their hedgerows''?
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) New homes are being built on the reservation by retirees who, after living in black society in cities like Washington and Los Angeles, have returned to the reservation, where they pay no property taxes.
The income disparity on the reservation has widened.
The main employers are the smoke shops and hot dog stands that line the highway and serve the weekend tourists.
The tribal schoolhouse has been closed and Indian children attend public schools.
The Shinnecock, for the most part, take a hostile view of politics, whether they are federal, state, town or tribal.
But it is especially the tribal politics that tie the community in knots.
Without a coherent voice of resistance for the tribe, the bulldozers continue to clear trees.
``Those old dogs, they're in it for themselves,'' said Ruben Bess Valdez, 45, a university-trained environmentalist, speaking of the tribal trustees.
He said the leaders have in the past made land-use and right-of-way deals with the state, kept the money for themselves and kept the tribe in the dark.
``If you're in it for yourself, how can you fight for anyone else''?
With little money for court battles, the tribe remains divided over the more aggressive tactics.
On one side are the tribal trustees who hold nearly all the decision-making power in the lives of the 500 people on the reservation.
On the other side are the brash group of college- and street-educated Indians who want a settlement now.
``We need changes now,'' said Chuck Quinn, who has been arrested for sitting on the 18th green at Shinnecock Hills in protest.
``No more selling us out, no more backdoor deals with the whites''.
So the Indians await word of their application for federal recognition.
Such status would give the tribe the right to negotiate gambling deals with the state.
The application process can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to respond to a 1998 letter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs requesting more application materials.
Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to draft a new constitution and set up a new government.
``The truth of the matter is that we need to come together on the reservation before we can make our demands to the general public,'' said Harold Dent, a Shinnecock and an adviser to the tribal trustees.
``I am trying to make this point to the trustees.
But people running around shouting willy-nilly isn't going to help our situation''.
The reservation is a world apart from the rest of the Hamptons.
Cancer rates among the Shinnecock are among the highest on Long Island.
In a town where a pool-side bungalow rents for $30,000 for the summer, the median per capita income on the reservation hovers around $6,000.
The reservation, in addition, has yet to be hooked up to the Suffolk County water supply.
The Indians drink from an aquifer that is contaminated with the pesticide Temik at levels seven times the amount considered safe for human consumption, according to the county health department.
``The water authority simply won't run them pipes,'' said the Southampton town supervisor, Vincent Cannuscio.
``Somebody has to pay for it.
And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock''.
The Indians also cannot get home-improvement loans because the land is held in common and they have no mortgages.
What is more, no Indian holds any meaningful elected or appointed town position.
``Their situation is the dirty little secret of Southampton,'' said Bob Zellner, a civil rights activist and adjunct professor of history at Southampton College.
WINDOW ROCK, Ariz.
_ The tranquil shore of Wheatfields Lake, a high-country fishing hole set among the ponderosa and sandstone here on the Navajo Reservation, would seem an unlikely place to encounter violence.
But a 26-year-old Navajo man who called himself Bam Bam was prepared for the worst, filling his battered pickup truck with gas before setting off with his brother to catch some trout.
Too many times, Bam Bam said, gang rivals had beaten him while he was walking home in the dark.
In a few other instances, said Bam Bam, speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his nickname, he had done the attacking and had served time in jail for assault.
``It's gotten almost like the inner city here,'' said Bam Bam, unzipping his jacket to show a pistol hidden inside.
The spread of violent crime here on the Navajo Reservation, a vast territory of dry plains and red rock mesas in the Four Corners region of the Southwest, reflects problems on dozens of the nation's Indian reservations.
While homicide and assault rates have declined across much of the nation in recent years, they have soared in Indian country to rival that of the nation's cities.
As the influences of the modern world grow, many reservations _ especially those in the West _ suffer from problems with gangs and drugs.
The situation is compounded by the poverty that has afflicted many Indian reservations for generations.
``Our kids have satellite TV and are influenced by things going on in Chicago and New York,'' said Leonard Butler, chief of the Navajo Nation Police Department of 280 for the reservation's 200,000 residents.
``They go to Los Angeles and bring back the way of life of the city, like drive-by shootings, graffiti and tattoos''.
In response to the surge in violent crime on reservations, President Clinton proposed increasing the 1999 law-enforcement budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs by $25 million, to $100 million.
That total was reduced significantly in recent House and Senate votes, and by time the appropriation bill emerges from a conference committee the increase could be below $10 million.
Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the law-enforcement division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
One option _ criticized by some tribes and praised by others _ would be to transfer the responsibility for law enforcement to the Justice Department.
To be sure, the Navajo Reservation has always had its share of violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s.
Homicides went from an average of 35 a year at the beginning of the decade to 67 in 1996, and 57 the year after.
In the first half of 1998, 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade.
In 1997, Washington had a murder rate of 55 per 100,000 population, Baltimore and Detroit had rates of 46 while Chicago had a murder rate of 27.
The picture is similar on some smaller reservations, like the Fort Peck Reservation in eastern Montana.
There, the murder rate of 1 for 675 residents in 1995 was twice that of New Orleans, according to a federal report last year on Indian law enforcement.
New Orleans, with 1 murder per 1,350 residents in 1995, has one of the highest homicide rates in the country.
Combating the crime wave is proving especially difficult because of a lack of police officers on many reservations in the West, experts say.
For example, there are 1.4 officers per thousand Navajo residents, compared with 2.9 per thousand for other small communities, the federal report said.
The Navajo Reservation is primarily dependent on federal money.
The shortage of officers was apparent here over two recent nights, when the officers intervened in drunken domestic fights, hospitalized a man who drank antifreeze and arrested about a half-dozen people on charges of public intoxication.
Because only three officers are on duty for evening shifts in a district of 3,055 square miles that includes Window Rock, where the reservation's government is based, some calls for assistance went unanswered for hours.
There are seven police districts on the reservation.
``We know we need more police officers,'' said Officer Roanna Buck, ``but that's up to the politicians.
The tribal leadership is overlooking the crime because they don't want to admit that it's happening''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Another disparity frequently cited by the police is the lack of equipment, such as helicopters and computers mounted in squad cars, commonly found in police departments of comparable size to the reservation.
Many reservation residents are frustrated.
Seated in a round hogan, a traditional Navajo home built with logs that has a red dirt floor, Lorraine Nelson, 60, a teacher from Window Rock, recalled an earlier era when children spent their days herding sheep and assisting the tribe rather than getting in trouble.
``Today's kids have lost respect for their parents and their neighbors,'' she said.
``I don't know how to turn it around''.
A dilapidated housing project in Fort Defiance, a few miles north of Window Rock, is considered by many residents to be one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on the reservation.
The barren lots and graffiti-covered houses are the territory of the Cobras, a gang of young men whose members battle their rivals, the Dragons, with baseball bats.
``To stay strong we had to band together,'' said a 24-year-old Navajo gang member who uses the name Strange.
``It was more for fun at first, but then people took it to the next level''.
But gang violence does not fully explain the reservation's predicament.
Often, people are killed by family members or friends in petty disputes, often involving alcohol.
Over the past few years, the Navajo police force has implemented programs intended to curtail crime.
For example, 45 officers were added to the force.
Their salaries were paid with new federal grants, though the police chief complained that the money did not supply the uniforms and patrol cars needed for them.
The department also has a gang unit, a community policing program and school programs intended to discourage children from using illegal drugs.
The tribal leadership and other community leaders have begun summer work programs for young people and, in some cases, are evicting problem families from public housing.
But if such efforts are to succeed, the police say, they will have to reach boys like the three, ages 13 and 14, who were relaxing on a housing project porch on a recent afternoon.
As one of their mothers sewed inside the house, the boys spoke admiringly of drug dealing and violence by two older relatives who are gang members and contemplated joining the gang one day themselves.

CROW AGENCY, Mont.
_ First the Crow were bullied by the Sioux from these red cliffs and rolling yellow hills of buffalo grass.
Later they struck an alliance with the United States and fell here alongside Custer.
In time, Washington force-fed treaties to the Crow, bunching them on the reservation while inviting in white settlers as models of how to run a store or farm the land.
Prosperity has yet to reach the undulating horizon of south-central Montana's Indian country, but the Crow have caught on to that most loathed of European imports _ the tax.
Aimed at the tourist trade, a tribe-levied surcharge sets white fishing guides, shopkeepers and service station owners to griping about taxation without representation.
To those whites who feel unwelcome on the 2.5 million-acre reservation, who feel officially less than Indians living under the same huge sky, the Crow say tough.
``If you don't like it,'' said Carl Venne, the Crow's director of public safety, ``then get the hell out of here''.
Like the Crow, tribes throughout the country move with new resolve to exercise an old asset: sovereignty.
It is that dominion that makes them not just another census category, but hundreds of nations within a nation.
This peculiar status stems from a time when Indians controlled more than three-fourths of what would become the United States, prompting the writers of the Constitution to place tribes on an equal footing with foreign nations.
The ``white fathers'' in Washington underlined that status in 371 treaties that followed.
Since 1830 the Supreme Court has affirmed that although tribes are domestic and dependent, they are still part of an American family of governments entitled to self-rule.
That sovereignty opens the way for casinos, guarantees American Indians extraordinary fishing and hunting rights, allows them to sell gasoline and cigarettes on Indian territory free of state taxes.
Those Indians-only enterprises, in turn, give new resources to some of the poorest Americans in the United States.
That money also serves as life support for hundreds of dying languages and offers a sliver of hope for the survival of customs overwhelmed by European-bred culture.
Yet the show of treaty-backed authority cues wails of protest from non-Indians.
``I can't participate in their government,'' said Gordon Rose, a former lawyer who runs an outfitters shop and a small group of cabins near the Bighorn River.
The Crow have put a lien on his business for not paying the sales tax they first imposed in 1995.
``Why should I be subject to their control''?
That argument, say tribes, overlooks history and the law.
``You hear people talking about special rights that are anachronistic or ancient,'' said Steven Tullberg, who directs the Washington, D.C., office of the Indian Law Resource Center, based in Helena, Mont.
``Most of those rights are younger than our Constitution.
We don't disparage the Constitution by saying it's ancient''.
Assigning different rights to one group based on bloodlines may seem anomalous in this republic born of a declaration that ``all men are created equal''.
But sovereignty clearly means recognizing Indians as not only Native Americans but also as special Americans.
Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay federal income and Social Security taxes.
They can vote in local, state and federal elections _ a right that didn't exist for them in New Mexico, for instance, until 1948.
But a non-Indian resident of a reservation has no say in tribal government.
An Indian who commits a crime outside a reservation is destined for the usual federal, state or local courts.
Indian authorities deal with tribal members for minor crimes on reservations but turn to the FBI or the U.S.
Bureau of Indian Affairs police to deal with murders, armed robberies or organized crime.
That can get confusing when, for instance, a non-Indian is burglarized on a reservation.
If the burglar is a member of the tribe, then tribal police handle the case.
If the burglar is white, then a county sheriff might step in.
But who's in charge until you catch the thief?
It isn't always clear, either, what constitutes Indian country.
Treaties dating sometimes to the 18th century often contradict each other.
But on land that is theirs, tribes can decide whether to set zoning, to ban alcohol or to open casinos.
``Without (reservations), and the claim to separate government they represent, Indians would, for all practical purposes, be no different from other ethnic minorities in the United States,'' wrote Fergus Bordewich in ``Killing the White Man's Indian''.
Along with granting tribes self-rule and reserving them land, the federal government still pays for vast territory taken from tribes with a promise of sustenance.
Mostly that takes the form of services _ clinics, schools, welfare _ like those provided to poor people elsewhere.
Some tribes, such as the Cherokee in Oklahoma, have worked to wean themselves from federal dependency as funding for Indian programs has waned.
The Cherokee, for instance, generate more than half their tribal income from enterprises that include a ranch, a lumber company and several plants that manufacture wire for corporations and the military.
``Sometimes I really feel discouraged when I imagine our ancestors hearing us saying that we can't live without the (Bureau of Indian Affairs),'' said then-Cherokee Chief Wilma Mankiller to other Indian leaders in 1992.
Indians account for less than 1 percent of the U.S. population today, spread mostly across the West on 314 reservations.
The differences in culture and prosperity among the Hopi, the Mohawks, the Seminoles are as varied as those among the British, the Italians, the Russians.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, gambling has reversed the fortunes of only a few tribes.
Congress' General Accounting Office estimates that 40 percent of Indian gambling revenue comes from eight of 184 tribal casinos.
The country's largest tribe, the Navajo, twice rejected gambling.
Poverty among the Sioux on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota makes theirs the poorest county in the country.
Less than a day's drive to the east finds Minnesota's Mille Lacs band of Chippewa awash in casino profits.
Despite those differences a new Indian movement grows that sees salvation in sovereignty and its foundations in U.S. law.
Thirty years ago, up to three dozen Indians practiced law.
Now most estimates put that number at more than 1,000 _ still small compared with the rest of the population, but a dramatic increase.
``Tribes are trying to come into the modern world,'' said Lawrence Baca, president-elect of the Native American Bar Association.
``Using the law is something just to get the tribes out of a situation of poverty''.
The tribes' new pragmatism also shows in more than $2 million in political donations made in the 1996 election cycle.
Their assertiveness is seen in different ways in different places: The Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut used their location near large eastern cities to build the country's largest casino _ Indian or otherwise _ and now can guarantee each tribal member a job worth upward of $50,000 a year.
The success of those Pequots and a few other tribes in the gambling business has prompted competitors, most vocally developer Donald Trump, to complain that Indians hold an unfair advantage because they pay no taxes on their profits and enjoy different standards of regulation.
Neighbors to a new prison in south-central Missouri battled mightily, but unsuccessfully, to stop the $73 million project.
But the Iowa tribe of Oklahoma was able to halt construction last month.
The tribe said excavation could upset the remains of their ancestors _ some of the 70,000 American Indians forced to move cross-country by the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
Navajo leaders prompted outrage for briefly considering blocking all the roads into their expansive lands in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah as a declaration of their rule.
The Omaha tribe in Macy, Neb.
, has converted its failed bingo hall into a cigarette manufacturing plant and is marketing its cigarettes on reservations throughout the country.
An Indian-made product sold on Indian land is exempt from state taxes.
Consequently, full flavor, menthol, light and ultra-light Omahas can undercut the non-tribal competition.
A U.S.
Supreme Court case soon will decide whether eight Chippewa tribes may continue hunting and fishing free of any state regulation in Minnesota.
While state officials worry that ruling with the tribes could lead to a plundering of Minnesota's wild game, the tribes insist they've held the right to hunt and fish at will for 150 years.
And at a time when states fight bitterly to keep out nuclear waste, the Skull Valley band of Goshutes, barely 100 strong, is inviting the country's radioactive spent fuel rods onto its small and barren reservation southwest of Salt Lake City.
Taking in the nuclear trash could create an annuity for members of the tribe.
Although Utah hasn't explicitly conceded that the tribe can legally store the waste, the governor and the Legislature have chosen to point their efforts at the transportation of radioactive material over public lands rather than challenge outright what the Goshutes can do on their reservation.
Neighbors, meantime, feel frustrated.
``It's tough fighting somebody like the Goshutes who have that authority,'' said Chip Ward of nearby Grantsville, Utah.
So often, reservations appeared all but worthless until oil or some other bonanza was discovered.
Today, sovereignty and the power to govern a patch of land is the great find.
Consider the Coeur d'Alene tribe in northern Idaho and the lake that bears its name.
Treaties made between the tribe and federal government in 1887 and 1889 reduced the reservation's boundaries but granted the lake to the Coeur d'Alenes.
When Idaho was admitted to the union in 1890, however, it became entitled to the Constitution's promise that new states are granted all the beds, banks and waters of navigable lakes or rivers within their boundaries.
Congress didn't get around to ratifying the 1887 and 1889 treaties until 1891, a year after Idaho became a state.
To complicate things further, a presidential executive order in 1873 promised the lake to tribes, but that action never sought or gained congressional approval.
So far the Supreme Court has said that the northern two-thirds of the lake belongs to Idaho, but the tribe is still pressing a claim on the southern third.
Why does it matter?
``If the tribe owns a portion of the lake, you could have competing water quality standards, disputes over fishing seasons, questions over easements for docks and power lines,'' said Clive Strong of the Idaho attorney general's office.
Likewise, logs floated to sawmills would need to pass through tribe-controlled water.
The tribe, meantime, jealously defends the exercise of sovereignty it credits for turning around the prospects of its members in recent years.
Five years ago, before the Coeur d'Alene tribe opened a casino, unemployment among its 1,600 members was nearly 65 percent.
Now, despite legal challenges from attorneys general in Missouri and other states, the tribe is operating an on-line worldwide lottery at http:
PEACH SPRINGS, Ariz.
(AP) - When American Indians began embracing gambling as an economic development tool in the 1990s, the Hualapai tribe in northern Arizona moved quickly to open a casino at its Grand Canyon West tourist site.
Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in poverty for years.
But they forgot that most of the 100,000 visitors to Grand Canyon West each year come directly from Las Vegas.
''Those people weren't coming to a casino,'' said Louise Benson, tribal chairman.
''They were coming to see the Grand Canyon''.
Less than a year after opening the casino, the Hualapai shut it down.
Instead of providing an economic boom to tribal members, it left them $1 million in debt.
''There were high hopes for that casino, but the reality of it was that we were too isolated,'' said Alex Cabillo, the tribe's director of public works.
The Hualapai tribe is one of only two whose casinos failed during the Indian gambling boom of the past decade, when revenues exploded from $100 million in 1988 to $8.26 billion in 1998.
But an Associated Press computer analysis of federal unemployment, poverty and public assistance records indicates that the vast majority of American Indians, like the Hualapai, have not realized the early ''high hopes'' of the casino boom.
Two-thirds of the American Indian population belong to poverty-stricken tribes that still don't have Las Vegas-style casinos.
Some, like the Navajo, culturally oppose gambling, while others, like the Hualapai, are too far away from major population centers to benefit.
Among the 130 tribes with Las Vegas-style casinos, those near major cities have thrived, while most others have little left after paying the bills, the AP analysis found.
Despite new gambling jobs, unemployment on reservations with established casinos held steady around 54 percent between 1991 and 1997, according to data the tribes reported to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Many of the casino jobs were filled with non-Indians.
''Everybody thinks that tribes are getting rich from gaming and very few of them are,'' Benson said.
Of the 500,000 Indians whose tribes operate casinos, only about 80,000 belong to tribes with gambling operations that generate more than $100 million a year.
Some of the 23 tribes with the most successful casinos - like the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Tribe in Minnesota - pay each member hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
In Scott County, which includes the Shakopee reservation south of Minneapolis, the poverty rate declined from 4.1 percent in 1989 to 3.5 percent six years later.
The reservation's unemployment rate also plummeted from 70 percent in 1991 to just 4 percent in 1997.
Such success stories belong mostly to tribes with casinos near major population centers.
The tiny Mashantucket Pequot tribe of Connecticut reported more than $300 million in revenue in the first five months of this year from its Foxwoods Casino, located between New York and Boston.
And the Seminole Tribe's Hollywood Gaming Center on Miami's Gold Coast generates more than $100 million a year with pull-tab slot machines.
The unemployment rate on that reservation, however, still was 45 percent in 1997, and the average poverty rate in the two counties it touches rose from 10.4 percent in 1989 to 12.1 percent in 1995.
For many tribes with Las Vegas-style casinos, like the San Carlos Apaches in eastern Arizona, gambling revenues pay for casino operations and debt service, with little left to upgrade the quality of life.
In counties that include reservations with casinos, the average poverty rate declined only slightly between 1989 and 1995, from 17.7 percent to 15.5 percent, the AP analysis founds.
Counties that include reservations without casinos saw their poverty rate remain steady at slightly more than 18 percent.
Nationally, the poverty rate hovered around 13 percent during the period.
In California, the Tachi Yokut Tribe in the San Joaquin Valley brags on its Web site that its Palace Gaming Center has provided employment for tribal members, helped raise education levels and upgraded housing.
But the poverty rate in Kings County, which includes the tribe's small reservation, climbed from 18.2 percent in 1989 to 22.3 percent in 1995.
The reservation's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 49.2 percent in 1997.
Jonathan Taylor, a research fellow at the Harvard University Project on American Indian Economic Development, said many investments gaming tribes have made in social and economic infrastructure don't translate into immediate improvements in quality-of-life indicators like poverty.
''You see investments arising out of gaming taking hold slowly in greater educational success, greater family integrity, greater personal health, greater crime prevention,'' he said.
There are some optimistic signs that tribes hope to build on as they begin paying off their casino construction loans.
The analysis indicates casino gambling has slowed, though not reversed, the growth of tribal members on public assistance.
Participation in the Agriculture Department's Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations increased 8.2 percent from 1990 to 1997 among tribes with casinos, compared with 57.3 percent among tribes without them.
And economic development has been spurred in communities near tribal casinos, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's County Business Patterns for 1990 and 1997.
The Oneida Indian Nation in central New York, for example, has become the largest employer in Oneida and Madison counties, thanks to a casino that's generating more than $100 million in annual revenues.
A championship golf course and convention center are under construction.
But overall, the new jobs have not reduced unemployment for Indians.
Tribes with established casinos saw their overall unemployment rate actually rise four-tenths of a point to 54.4 percent between 1991 and 1997, the AP analysis found.
Jacob Coin, former executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association, said that's because 75 percent of jobs in tribal casinos are held by non-Indians.
At the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation along the California-Arizona-Nevada border, the unemployment rate climbed from 27.2 percent in 1991 to 74.2 percent in 1997.
Tribal administrator Gary Goforth acknowledged few of the 675 jobs at the tribe's two financially troubled casinos are filled by tribal members.
''Not everybody wants to be a dealer, or a housekeeper or even a manager in the restaurant,'' he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Seeking to get a more accurate count of the country's American Indian population, the Census Bureau is turning to tribal leaders and residents on reservations to help overcome long-standing feelings of wariness or anger toward the federal government.
The relationship hasn't been stress-free, tribal leaders say, but there has been marked improvement from 1990, when Census officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American Indian population.
The national undercount rate was 1.6 percent.
For instance, on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in eight Navajos were not counted in 1990.
The tribe is determined not to let that happen again.
''We've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the Navajo nation has profound control over the count, by way of hiring our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate, and the maps for enumeration were created by Navajo chapters,'' said Mellor Willie, spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye.
More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians governmental affairs director Jack Jackson, Jr.
is that an estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on reservations were missed.
Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may have been unaware of tribal customs, Jackson said.
The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos today.
Willie said the Navajos missed out on $110 million in federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount.
''I don't think a lot of Navajo people within the last census count knew this was helping in their communities,'' Willie said.
To counter that, the Census Bureau sought more input from tribal governments five years ago, said Tom Beavers, partnership specialist for the regional census center in Kansas City, Mo.
''When we hire now, we want to hire people who live in their own communities to work in their own communities, and we have told Indian leaders in our communities that,'' said Beavers, himself an American Indian, who in his job works with tribes in Oklahoma and Minnesota.
Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs, grants to local education agencies for Indian education, and family violence prevention and services.
Not everything has gone smoothly though.
Earlier this month, leaders on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana threatened to arrest census workers after complaints that local census managers failed to keep him informed of hiring decisions and other business on the reservation.
The order has since been rescinded.
Others like Brenda Boyd, census liaison for the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa in Onamia, Minn.
, complain that at times, there is too much red tape in getting simple answers from regional census officials.
Everyone agrees, though, that they are better off than in 1990.
''This census is much better,'' Boyd said.
''Last time, the count was way off''.

HIGHLAND, Calif.
_ A century after Indian wars roiled the West, another battle is raging here over a ballot measure that would expand the state's $1.4 billion Indian gambling industry.
It pits California's gaming tribes against an unlikely coalition of Nevada casinos, unions, church groups and other businesses in what may become the most expensive fight in California political history.
A visit to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino on a patch of tribal land 60 miles east of Los Angeles makes the stakes clear.
The afternoon sun is still high, but the parking lot is filling fast, and inside the smoky 90,000-square-foot gambling hall, the hopeful already sit glued to most of the 1,000 video slot machines and to row after row of bingo tables.
This 24-hour no-frills casino is an economic miracle for the tiny San Manuel tribe, which once scratched out an income raising apricots and lived in shacks and trailers on a dusty 648-acre reservation.
Now, 40 landscaped houses dot the hillsides behind the casino's walls, and security officers on bicycles patrol newly paved roads.
But the San Manuel Indians have a problem: They and about 40 other tribes began installing slot machines over the last decade without first reaching compacts with the state, as required by federal law.
So Gov.
Pete Wilson and federal prosecutors consider their casinos illegal and have moved to shut them down.
In response, the gaming tribes are sponsoring a hotly contested ballot measure in the Nov.
3 election that would allow broad expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands statewide.
In a potent illustration of the power of gambling money in politics, it seems likely to set a new record for spending on a ballot initiative here.
Already, the two sides have raised at least $60 million and spent about $53 million, mostly for a barrage of competing television commercials.
About $43 million has been raised by tribes, $22 million of it from the San Manuel tribe alone, while opponents, led by the casino operators at Hilton Hotels Corp.
and Mirage Resorts Inc.
, who fear untaxed Indian competition, have raised $15.5 million and spent $1 million more.
The previous spending record for a single measure was $57.5 million on a securities fraud proposal two years ago; $84 million was spent on a group of competing insurance reform measures in 1988.
Public polls have shown the gambling measure, Proposition 5, winning majority, but not overwhelming, support among voters, many of whom are sympathetic to decades of Indian privation in a state that paid bounties for Indian body parts in the 1850s.
The gaming tribes contend that nothing less than their historic sovereignty and economic survival is at stake, and their advertisements feature members attesting that Indian gaming has broken the cycle of poverty.
``This is our livelihood,'' said Ken Ramirez, 38, vice-chairman of the San Manuel tribe, who grew up on the reservation when it held only a handful of families, with water too fetid to drink.
He declined to disclose the tribe's revenues from gaming, but noted that about 110 people now live on the reservation, where, with gambling proceeds, the tribe has drilled 16 deep wells and plans to market bottled water commercially.
But opponents of Proposition 5 accuse the gaming tribes of scare tactics.
They say the tribes' campaign exaggerates the threat to Indian welfare and obscures the real menace of a measure that would allow the spread of gambling throughout the state, divert business from privately operated theme parks, racetracks and card rooms and yet provide few economic benefits over all, because Indian casinos pay no taxes on their profits, though gamblers pay income taxes on their winnings.
``Frankly, I think it's an incredible con game,'' said Frank Schubert, who is managing the ``No on 5'' campaign for the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling, which has run ads in which a jogging couple is stunned by a volcanic eruption of garish casino signs in their neighborhood.
``We've had millions and millions in TV ads bombarding the state for months now about reservations getting electricity and being able to be linoleum on a dirt floor, when in fact it's a handful of tribes spending a fortune to keep a special deal''.
About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation, including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer some form of gambling.
The 1988 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act affirmed tribes' rights to offer bingo, and, subject to negotiated compacts with individual states, slot machine games.
But some governors have complained about vagaries in the law and Congress has debated making clarifications.
In other states where Indians are either seeking gambling compacts or negotiating the renewal of existing ones, the California debate is being closely watched.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn ``From a national perspective, many states and tribes have already resolved this,'' said John Dossett, general counsel of the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, which represents 250 tribes.
``If this issue were to be resolved in California, there'd be less pressure in Congress''.
But resolution here seems unlikely any time soon.
Opponents of Proposition 5 warn that if it passes, it will immediately be tied up in years of litigation, and could well violate the California State Constitution's ban on ``Nevada or New Jersey-type casinos''.
``We're in for a long battle here instead of a politically negotiated solution in which both sides say, `Let's make this work,''' said Cathy Christian, counsel to the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling.
The gaming tribes say they are prepared to fight.
They complain that they have been caught in an impossible situation because, eager for revenue, they began offering gambling while their right to do so was still being litigated.
Since then Wilson, a Republican and a foe of gambling in general, has refused to negotiate a compact with any tribe that was already gambling.
``Without Proposition 5, the gaming that currently exists on Indian lands in California could be taken away from the tribes,'' said Waltona Manion, a spokeswoman for the tribal alliance known as Californians for Indian Self-Reliance.
``Why remove something that's working, and that's proven to have taken these tribes off of welfare dependency and put them on the road to self-sufficiency''?
But Wilson has offered a clear alternative.
Last spring, he reached an agreement with the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San Diego County that would allow a new form of video slot machine but outlaw those now used by gambling tribes.
In the months since, 10 more tribes, some of them under threat of federal action, have signed the Pala compact, which limits each tribe to 199 of the new machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to other tribes, up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe, with a statewide cap of 19,900.
The State Legislature ratified the agreements in August.
Most of the gaming tribes contend that Wilson, who is barred from seeking a third term this year, refused to negotiate in good faith, as required by the 1988 federal law.
So Proposition 5 leaves little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted them, though, as is now the case, the measure would only allow games in which players bet against a pool of other players' money, not against the casino house itself, as in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to protect Indian gambling, and to hammer home the point, they are now running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo, head of the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, which signed the Pala compact and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of Sacramento.
``We're doing all this without Prop.
5,'' Ms.
Lorenzo says in the 30-second commercial as she walks through the construction site.
``No tribe needs Prop.
5 to operate casinos''.
For their part, supporters of the measure have accused their fellow tribes of being turncoats recruited by ``the big Nevada casinos,'' to oppose the proposition, in an echo of internecine betrayals of the past.
At the San Manuel Casino, which draws 3,000 to 4,000 gamblers a day and where the card dealers now wear bold ``No on 5'' T-shirts, players said they supported the measure.
``What's going to happen to these people if Proposition 5 doesn't go through''? asked Ruth Kennedy, a retired nurse who comes every day to play bingo and the slots from late afternoon until the wee hours of the morning, and who once won a $40,000 jackpot.
``Why is Vegas and them so upset with the Indian halls?
You can't tell me this place doesn't do things for the community''.
In fact, according to Steven Lengel, the casino's customer services director, it sponsors a range of school and community programs in Highland and the neighboring towns of San Bernardino and Redlands, and its uniformed security force of 250 is bigger than those of the three local cities combined.
It sells no alcohol, allows none on the premises and employs more than 1,400 people, the vast majority of them local residents.
But opponents of the measure, including the California Labor Federation AFL-CIO and the United Farm Workers, complain that it would exempt the Indian casinos from environmental and worker health and safety laws, and calls for distributing a maximum of 2 percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling machines to non-gaming tribes.
``This idea that they're somehow spending all of their money to help their poor brothers is just not true,'' Ms.
Christian said. &QL;
ETHETE, Wyo.
_ In the face of cutbacks brought about by the overhaul of welfare programs, members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe on the Wind River Reservation have started a seven-acre community garden with donated land, seeds and equipment to grow vegetables for themselves and for the elderly and disabled who cannot work.
``We were concerned that when time runs out, when they are no longer eligible for government assistance, what are they going to do for food''? said Glen Revere, a nutritionist with the Indian Health Services on the 2.8 million-acre Wind River Reservation, about 100 miles east of Jackson, Wyo.
``Then we came up with the idea for this community garden, and it's been bigger than we ever expected in so many ways''.
At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when potatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil, and five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and white kernels ripening inside.
The conditions on these wide plains near the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with high winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season to 90 days.
Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the Northern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed produce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.
Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people were stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.
``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this'''? she recalled.
``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy.
Many of them didn't have food in their house when I showed up''.
Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather of nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks.
We dried some things, boiled some.
Just ate all of it''.
Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one daughter and one grandchild.
They receive food stamps for a $300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often fed members of their family who stopped by.
Soldierwolf estimated they saved $70 with the free vegetables.
Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom 49 percent are unemployed.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty.
Soldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.
``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all right,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps.
``It's worse than in the Depression''.
Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded, with tears in her eyes.
The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern Arapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare cases in Wyoming.
The reservation population of 12,000 _ including 6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal members and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent of the state's population of 480,000.
Revere and Ms.
Houser say the community garden can help reduce dependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops, traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be planted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the garden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service requirement.
``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use here or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal member and nutritionist with Indian Health Services.
``Indians are not horticulturists.
They were hunters and gatherers who were forced to garden when they were put on the reservations.
There is a lack of knowledge about how to plant and water crops''.
In Ethete (pronounced EE-tha-tee), the school is adding horticulture to its natural science curriculum, and students take field trips to the community garden for hands-on experience growing their own food.
Howard Lujan, a father of four, used seeds Ms.
Houser gave him to grow ceremonial Indian corn in a little garden on the side of his house.
``I will give this corn to anyone who wants some, because it is part of our religion,'' he said.
Lujan, an Arapaho tribal member, said he would use all parts of the corn, including the husk to wrap tamales he plans to make the staple of a catering business he is starting.
He is also growing pumpkins, onions and cucumbers.
``I'm pretty sure we're going to save a lot of money this year with what we've grown,'' he said. &QL;
NEW YORK _ Nancy Smith, 28, croaks about the cold weather with a smoked-out voice.
Dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans, her puffy eyes tell a story of chronic alcoholism, an all-too-common syndrome among Native Americans like her.
After returning from a cigarette break in sub-zero temperatures, Smith flops down on a couch, curls herself into a ball and falls asleep.
One of New York City's homeless, she has come for the treatment of her drinking problem.
Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New York area.
``Where else can I go for help''? she asks.
``Any place else, they don't understand you like they do here''.
Native Americans around the country are leaving reservations and relocating in urban areas at a dizzying rate.
With economic opportunities on reservations lagging behind those available in big cities, and with the unemployment rate among Native Americans at three times the national average, thousands of poor, often unskilled Native Americans are rushing off their reservations.
Many find their new urban locales strange and forbidding and often turn to drugs and alcohol.
Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City metropolitan area.
Of that number, nearly 7,000 come to the Community House each year for drug and alcohol rehabilitation, health counseling or for job training, according to Rosemary Richmond, executive director.
This is up from around 3,000 just seven years ago.
With the vast majority of its $1.5 million annual budget, mostly federal funds, going to substance abuse treatment and job training, the Community House finds itself at risk of losing the attendance of those in need of cultural support.
As a result, some urban Native Americans feel driven away.
Richmond and her 30-member staff have been inundated with work, but less and less of it involves cultural activities.
``I used to go there all the time and hang out, meet new people,'' says Carlos Rodriguez, 48, a Navajo who works as a librarian at Columbia University.
``Now most of the people there have drug problems, so they don't even let you in without an appointment''.
The Community House, established in 1969, relies on volunteers like Rodriguez to participate in rallies, organize religious events and educate the public about Native American culture.
In recent years, problems of illiteracy and addiction have become the major part of the organization's workload.
The social problems faced by Richmond and her staff are not unique to New York City.
From 1980 to 2000, the urban Native American population has more than doubled.
With this drastic increase came a surge in urban Native Americans in need of substance abuse treatment.
In 1980, approximately 4,000 Native Americans sought treatment for substance abuse in the San Francisco area, according to the Indian Health Service, a branch of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
Today, that number has more than doubled, to 9,200.
In Seattle over the same period, addiction cases rose from 3,500 to 7,300.
Over all, the rate of substance abuse among Native American adults is over 20 percent nationwide.
And the migration from the reservations continues.
``Mostly, it's economics,'' says Joanne Dunne, a spokeswoman for the Boston Indian Council, a nonprofit cultural group.
``The reservation typically doesn't provide you with any real opportunities''.
Also, many Native Americans travel between the reservation and urban areas.
``Some tribes traditionally go from one place to another,'' says Dunne.
``The Micmacs always crossed the border from Canada to come from time immemorial''.
In other cities, city and state governments have created agencies to specifically deal with the Native American population.
In Detroit, for example, the municipal government runs the Detroit American Indian Health Center, while the state of Michigan runs the Bureau of Urban Indian Affairs.
``There's also American Indian Health, which is nonprofit and state supported,'' adds Alycia Atkinson, an administrator at Urban Indian Affairs.
``They do youth programs, alcohol, tobacco and drug intervention, and other health services.
Then there's American Indian Services, which does mental health, and also has a youth program, and they're run by the city.
And the state also supports the National American Indian Association here''.
As the state and city governments slice up their services, Detroit Native Americans, already a small group at 20,000, find themselves without a cultural or political center.
In Boston, at Dunne's Boston Indian Council, attendance lags because it does not provide substance abuse treatment, legal services or on-site training programs.
Still, it creates a sense of community among members of 36 tribes from all over the nation.
``Indians are drawn together the same way as everyone else,'' she explains.
``You look for people who look like you''.

WASHINGTON (AP) --American Indian reservations would get an infusion of $1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said.
Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded programs in nearly all federal agencies.
``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
Clinton announced the spending initiative in his State of the Union address last week, but did not mention any specifics.
Those will be included in his 2001 budget proposal, to be announced next week.
Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't address all the problems.
``In all, I don't think it's anything to have a party over, because the needs in Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to head the BIA in 1997.
Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical.
``Senator Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does wonder why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a look at Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado Republican.
The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the estimated $4 billion backlog of needed repairs.
And, according to an Interior Department report issued last year, $1.2 billion is needed to repair or replace 170 Indian schools.
``I know half-a-dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's a drop,'' Cutler said.
Reservations are home to some of the gravest poverty and worst health care in the country.
The unemployment rate on reservations is about 10 times the national average and only about two-thirds of Indian adults have a high school diploma, compared to three-quarters of the general population.
The Indian Health Service reports the Indian death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the population.
Clinton will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31 tribal colleges, Cutler said.
The colleges, which serve 26,000 students in 12 states, are a vital part of efforts to improve education and economic opportunities on reservations, she said.
A report to be released today says tribal colleges have created jobs and helped increase education levels on the reservations where they operate.
The report from the Institute for Higher Education Policy and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium said median incomes for women on reservations with tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster between 1980 and 1990 than for women on reservations without colleges.
Cutler said other details of Clinton's proposal include: --$6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of Indian students.
--$5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
--$5 million for a Treasury Department program aimed at attracting companies to reservation areas.
PINE RIDGE, S.D.
(AP) --President Clinton turned the attention of his national poverty tour today to arguably the poorest, most forgotten U.S. citizens of them all: American Indians.
Clinton was going to the Pine Ridge Reservation for a visit with the Oglala Sioux nation and to participate in a conference on Native American homeownership and economic development.
He also was touring a housing facility and signing a pact with Oglala leaders establishing an empowerment zone for Pine Ridge.
But the main purpose of the visit --the first to a reservation by a president since Franklin Roosevelt -- was simply to pay attention to American Indians, who are so raked by grinding poverty that Clinton's own advisers suggested he come up with special proposals geared specifically to the Indians' plight.
At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official attention: ``Welcome President Clinton.
Remember Our Treaties,'' the sign read.
According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near reservations.
Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races combined.
Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school graduates.
Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in substandard housing.
Twenty percent of Indian households on reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority --53.4 percent -- do not have telephones.
The per capita income for Indians is $21,619, one-third less than the national per capita income of $35,225.
An estimated 50 percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the problem is even more chronic --73 percent of the people do not have jobs.
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who visited the reservation last August, said Pine Ridge is a metaphor for the poverty tour, for it sits in Shannon County, the poorest census tract in the nation.
``This is generations of poverty on the Pine Ridge reservation, with very, very little progress,'' Cuomo said.
``We didn't get into this situation in a couple of weeks and we're not going to get out of it in a couple of weeks.
It's going to take years''.
To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing a partnership between the Treasury Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next three years --a small number that nonetheless would double the number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands.
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help streamline the mortgage lending process.
Cuomo said special steps were needed to help Indians create and own houses because the nature of the land on which they live effectively shuts them out of conventional home loan processes.
``The land is held in trust.
The bank doesn't want to take it as collateral because it's in trust,'' Cuomo said.
``So the main asset on the reservation --the land -- can't even be used''.
Also, two of the country's largest municipal securities underwriters, Banc One Capital Markets and George K.
Baum &AMP; Co.
, were committing to underwriting $300 million in bonds annually for five years to create a market for reservation mortgages.
Those bonds would help raise $1.5 billion that could then be lent to tribes, tribal housing authorities and individuals for buying homes.
The announcement was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner cities and rural areas.
NEAH BAY, Wash.
_ Micah McCarty rises with the sun and slips into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream from the untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest.
With each stroke, he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes to slay this fall with a hand-carved wooden harpoon.
And he prays that the gray whale will be ``a kind brother or sister''.
McCarty is preparing himself for the Makah tribe's first whale hunt in more than seven decades.
He hopes it will renew the Olympic Peninsula tribe's spirit and traditions.
Opponents call the hunt butchery, saying it has no place in a modern world where whales are protected by international law.
McCarty wants to be the ``chosen one''.
The harpooner will stand in a dugout canoe, steady himself against 10-foot Pacific swells, heft the barbed lance, take aim and plunge it into the back of a 38-foot leviathan.
The kill will be a sacred moment for the Makah, honoring the great whale.
But the eight men in the canoe _ keepers of a ritual dating back at least 100 generations _ will be encircled by an armada of outraged animal rights activists, a swarm of international media and a thin phalanx of security.
The hunt's notoriety stems from a controversial decision by the International Whaling Commission that granted the Makah the right to kill up to 20 whales through 2002.
Animal rights activists fear the hunt will spark a wholesale return to commercial whaling, presently banned by the commission.
But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach, he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800 people living in his fishing village.
Instead, he meditates and prays to make his spirit pure to receive the whale, ``an honored guest of the village''.
He anchors his feet in the sand of the beach and heaves hunks of driftwood in hopes of being chosen the harpooner.
McCarty is one of 16 men selected by Makah families to compete for eight spots on the first tribal whaling crew since the 1920s.
He feels the excitement building on this 44-square-mile reservation of heavily logged rain forest and spectacular wilderness beach located at the extreme northwest tip of the contiguous United States.
The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the Makah, whose real name _ which cannot be written in English _ means ``people who live by the rocks and the seagulls''.
McCarty comes from a long line of whalers.
His grandfather and great-grandfather participated in the last hunts before whaling was suspended, because gray whales had been stalked almost to extinction by non-Indian whalers.
McCarty's father, John, until recently was executive director of the tribe's whaling commission.
After graduating from high school in Olympia, Micah McCarty came home to Neah Bay and immersed himself in the maritime life, working with his father as a commercial fisherman.
``It became a passionate connection with the waters my ancestors plied,'' McCarty said.
Like the Makah whalers before him, McCarty prepares by purifying himself in frigid streams such as the Waatch River.
``We look upon the water as its own being,'' he said.
While bathing, McCarty said he ``thinks about the whale moving gracefully through the water, and I swim as gracefully as I can.
... And I pray that our whale crew will be one mind, one body, one spirit''.
Historically, secrecy guarded every aspect of Makah whaling from the hunt to the communal butchering and feasting, according to anthropological texts.
Tribal members today remain guarded about saying too much about the hunt to outsiders.
``It is usually taboo to even talk about,'' McCarty said.
``Usually, you just prepare yourself and go whaling''.
McCarty, like his father and the rest of the tribe, is acutely aware of the international controversy surrounding this fall's hunt.
``In this day and age, it's important to say something about it,'' McCarty said.
To illustrate that whaling still defines the fabric of Makah life, McCarty shares a few words from sacred whaling songs that have been passed down from generation to generation and are still sung today.
One song says ``my canoe travels with killer whales as an escort,'' and another says ``my canoe travels with lightning''.
``I might get in trouble for telling you that, but it's not a direct translation,'' he said.
McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time, long before they became news to the outside world.
An accomplished carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont, McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to whaling and the sea.
``As I learned about our oral history, some of the songs and dances we do, my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and where we come from''.
The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called the Hummingbird.
``The songs keep your mind off the pain'' of paddling for hours, said Don Swan, a powerfully built man who, like McCarty, would like to be the ``chosen one'' to heft the harpoon.
Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide inspiration and a new focus for the community.
``It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example,'' he said.
Whaling ``involves so much concentration, so much preparation, that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle (substance abuse or violence) would have to drop it''.
On a rare sunny spring day, McCarty and seven other members of the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice.
A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie Hunter trailed the canoe.
Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr.
sat near Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern.
In the background, a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting, two-note tune.
Eric would like to be a whaler someday.
``Yeah, I'm thinking about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights,'' he said, becoming very serious.
``I think I would want to be the harpooner.
If you're the harpooner, you have to have a lot of strength so you can stick it in the whale''.
``I really want to take after my ancestors,'' said Eric, one small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of unemployment or Jim Beam.
Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came alongside.
The men passed little Eric between boats.
As he scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe, a luminous smile transformed his serious face.
Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a.50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor.
It will deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned, explained Johnson, hefting the weapon.
The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by the Makah.
The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick kill.
Says McCarty: ``They want us to do a humane kill.
That necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to the next world.
I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a sacred way of life''.
But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the gun, but also of the hunt itself.
``What are we building our culture on by going after something we don't want to eat''? she asked.
That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly opposed the tribe's return to whaling has been used by opponents of the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not representing the will of the people.
But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American communities do not have a single, monolithic viewpoint any more than other communities.
John McCarty also notes that in December's tribal council election, two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson Jr.
and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office.
But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more than 70 years is a daunting challenge.
So the Makah are turning for advice to other indigenous whalers.
Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew traveled this winter to Barrow, Alaska, for the native whaling captains convention.
They attended seminars on topics such as effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission.
The tribe is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber, said Keith Johnson, president of the tribal whaling commission.
The whaling crew members are also training together.
They run together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they built behind Arnie Hunter's trailer.
The young men are learning to function as a team, said rifleman Wayne Johnson.
The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice ``sneaking up and backing off'' whales, said McCarty.
But many training methods will not be shared with the outside world.
For example, beginning with the first day of a new moon, the nascent whalers will do a ``special type of training,'' said McCarty.
``Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown,'' said McCarty without offering further explanation.
A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is the bridge it creates between generations.
For example, John McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son Micah.
``In Makah Bay, they harpooned this whale, a big bull,'' said John McCarty, recounting the tale he heard from his father.
``He was big enough and strong enough that they couldn't get close enough to give him another harpoon.
He went straight out to sea (dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether).
``It was one fierce ride.
The whale was relentless; the toughest whale they had ever seen.
They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just a tiny bump.
They gave up, cut him loose, lost their harpoon and floats.
Fortunately, there was a west wind, so they set sail and headed home.
The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the bottom of the canoe''.
It is the telling of such stories across the generations that defines the Makah.
When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed when the men passed him into the whaling canoe, Keith Johnson said: ``These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth.
How can we describe that to the world?''
LAS VEGAS _ As legalized gambling spreads, industry lines are starting to blur.
Marriages of tribal and corporate casinos, slot machines and racetracks, the Internet and everybody come at a time when the nation's gambling laws have never been murkier or more misunderstood.
State and federal lawmakers' plates are heaped with hot-potato gambling issues, and none is hotter for Congress than deciding whether to ignore, regulate or outlaw the explosion of Internet gambling.
Federal lawmakers also soon must sort out the muddled state of American Indian gambling, which has pitted tribes desperate for casino revenue against state governments resistant to gambling.
Both topics were discussed last week at the World Gaming Congress convention, along with the National Gambling Impact Study Commission report, which was issued in June.
The commission, after spending $5 million and two years researching the state of gambling in America, cooked up a casserole of 76 recommendations that ranged from criminalization of Internet gambling to the need for more research and public education.
But it did not answer the big question of whether America's infatuation with wagering had become a malignant obsession.
Instead it called for a nationwide ``pause'' in gambling expansion while states and gambling-host communities conduct their own economic- and social-impact studies and then reach their own hard decisions on whether to expand, contract or even abolish regional gambling activity.
That was hardly what the gambling industry _ or its opponents _ wanted to hear.
``People are taking whatever they want out of it to advance their own position,'' said Rick Hill, chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, which represents 168 of the 195 U.S. tribes that offer legal casino or bingo gambling.
Even one of the commission's own members acknowledges a lack of interest by the American public and the news media.
``I think the report will disappear,'' J.
Terrence Lanni, chairman and chief executive of MGM Grand Inc.
, said last week in remarks to delegates at the international gambling industry's largest annual trade show.
But at its heart, Lanni added, the commission's work did reflect the mood of the American public _ compassion for addicted gamblers but a demand for legalized gambling.
Even if the report fades away, those paramount issues will not.
As wagering becomes ever more widespread, Congress must resolve the profound issue of Internet gambling and the politically touchy matter of tribal gambling.
More than 30 nations, mostly in the Third World, license and tax online gambling enterprises that operate through 700 sites on the World Wide Web.
The number grows almost daily.
At the moment, however, the most watched developments are in Australia, which recently permitted its states and territories to individually license and regulate sports and racetrack betting on the Internet.
U.S. gamblers are beginning to discover these legal bookies Down Under who gladly accept wagers from anywhere in the world _ seemingly daring legal retaliation from Uncle Sam.
In fact, sports book American Wagering Inc.
of Nevada holds one of the Australian licenses.
American is the only online Australian operator not accepting U.S. bets, but only because that action could jeopardize its U.S. licenses.
That doesn't bother American's CEO, Vic Salerno, who said he was convinced that his company had taken the Internet plunge in the right nation and at the right time.
And if the United States never joins the global cyber party, Salerno said, so what?
``There's enough money left out there outside of the United States,'' he said.
Robust international betting on events such as World Cup soccer, Formula I auto racing, cricket and rugby ``makes the NFL (sports books) look like child's play,'' he said.
Brian Gordon, an Australian territorial government gambling regulator, predicted at one World Gaming Congress seminar last week that Australian regulatory and consumer protection statutes would become the model as other rich nations, one by one, accept the inevitability of worldwide cyber gambling.
Meanwhile, the First World's foremost society debates whether to ban Internet gambling and almost certainly usher in a new Prohibition era _ this time featuring bootleg e-commerce sports bookies and slot machines.
Current U.S. law on gambling by ``wire'' communications was written in the 1960s, tying the hands of federal prosecutors with statutes that never imagined the legal complexities of offshore cyber casinos and bookies with toll-free phone lines, and bank accounts that can afford huge U.S. advertising budgets and platoons of silk-tie lawyers.
Sen. Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona, for two years has been pushing for outright prohibition of such high-tech gambling, and his Senate Bill 692 is heading toward a floor vote this fall.
House action is not expected until 2000.
Republican Sen.
Kit Bond of Missouri is a co-sponsor of the Kyl bill.
In a recent interview, Bond spokesman Dan Hubbard acknowledged the technological challenge of enforcing a nationwide ban.
``But that's no reason to throw up your hands,'' he said.
Bond has concerns about the spread of gambling that defies international boundaries.
``Most of these are based offshore,'' Hubbard said.
``You can't regulate it''.
Earlier failed versions of the Kyl bill would have made criminals of Internet casino executives and their customers.
In the latest version the public is let off the hook, as are fantasy-sports players and some pari-mutuel wagering operations.
The national commission bolstered Kyl with its own call for a ban, criminal prosecution and even diplomatic pressure from the United States on nations that ``harbor Internet gambling organizations that prey on U.S. citizens''.
The problem is enforcement.
``I have serious doubts the Internet can be controlled by the federal government,'' Lanni said.
One idea out there would make cyber-gambling police of the U.S. banking industry, whose plastic accounts are the currency of choice for many in the online betting industry.
Barring the use of U.S. credit cards for Internet wagering would certainly put a damper on casual gamblers, but such legislation could be difficult to pass and would be a nightmare for the banking industry to implement.
And for serious gamblers, there still would be many ways around a credit block _ money orders and Australian or European bank-issued credit cards, for instance.
Domestically, commercial casino companies such as Station Casinos Inc.
are aggressively positioning themselves for the cyber-gambling era by teaming up with online operators.
Indian tribes are in court fighting for the right to establish multistate bingo, lottery and casino games that offer big jackpots.
One such tribal Internet lottery case is scheduled to be argued Thursday in a Kansas City federal courtroom.
``It's so un-American to back away from a challenge,'' said Jacob L.
Coin, executive director of the tribal gaming association.
``They (in Congress) fear the Internet because they don't understand it.
So they are just going to ban it...
run and hide.
``Let's look to what Australia is doing.
Let's learn from them.
Let's find a way to benefit from it''.
Bowing to a court ruling, Congress in 1988 laid out a statutory framework allowing American Indian tribes to offer high-stakes bingo games and casino-style gambling on their historic reservation lands.
In the decade since, almost no one is satisfied with how those laws have played out.
A congressional revision of the law seems inevitable in the next year or so.
The problems are tangled ones.
Few states receive taxes or significant revenue from what has blossomed into an $8 billion-a-year industry.
The states' regulatory role is often minimal.
Worse, governors _ Kansas' Bill Graves among them _ increasingly argue that states' rights have been trampled in a headlong rush to nurture needy tribes with this ``new buffalo'' of tribal sustenance.
The tribes, meanwhile, interpret assertion of states' rights as an assault on their sovereignty as legally independent nations.
That stance irritates the commercial casino industry, which competes with the tribes but must pay taxes and conform to tight state regulation.
By and large, each tribe regulates itself in conformance with broad federal rules that demand very little public accountability.
``Native American tribes need to be a little less geared to using sovereignty to protect themselves,'' said MGM's Lanni.
``They should have to disclose information like the rest of us.
Native Americans should come into the (gaming industry) mainstream''.
Such talk also rankles.
``Tribes feel under attack,'' Coin said.
``Instead of applauding the early successes of Indian gaming, there are those who are trying to undermine it''.
The bottom line, Coin said, ``is that the quality of life on tribal reservations is improving'' solely because of gambling dollars.
Tribal law expert and Minnesota lawyer Tom Foley told World Gaming Congress delegates that Indian gambling was entering a new era.
``This is a game of politics now,'' he said.
``Tremendous dollars are at stake''.
The commercial casino industry and state officials will push Congress to level the playing field with tribal gambling.
The tribes will resist.
Coin stated the tribes' case eloquently last week in Las Vegas in remarks that defiantly recalled centuries of injustice: ``When our children are as healthy as yours, when our futures are as bright as yours, then we can talk about a level playing field.''
SPARTA, Ga.
_ By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning, Hancock County is almost deserted.
A few children play in overgrown backyards full of junk cars and rotting timbers, and older people fan themselves on sagging porches.
But almost anyone who works has left the county hours before, because there are virtually no jobs in Hancock.
The term ``pocket of poverty'' cannot begin to describe the overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and overgrown.
Every employer of any size has left, and new ones seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics _ more than half the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to unwed mothers _ and say no thanks.
Unspoken in most of those decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in the nation.
Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month.
But only 80 miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7 percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is a third less than the rest of the state.
The county's leaders have begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants, a landfill, a waste incinerator.
Everything has fallen through except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's 9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire.
So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the South these days, that Hancock County would place its hopes for an economic future on the ultimate last resort _ an Indian gambling casino.
For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents have talked of nothing else.
``It's the last chance for our county,'' said Lesley James Roberts, Hancock's special projects director, who is spending almost all his time on the casino project.
``Think about what all those tourists could do for us.
We'd have the money to restore all those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts in town and maybe do historical re-enactments.
It would give our people a chance to become independent''.
The casino is a long way from becoming a reality.
Among other hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact for a reservation, and Gov.
Roy E.
Barnes has said he was opposed to casino gambling, although the state runs a lottery.
(The federal government could approve the project if the state refuses).
But in the meantime, an instant bond has been formed between two groups of impoverished people, each of whom is relying on the other to achieve a dream of prosperity.
The Kialegees, numbering about 450, are a landless tribe, sharing space in Wetumka, Okla.
, with the much larger Creek Nation, to whom they are related.
Along with several other Creek tribes, they trace their origin to northern and central Georgia, from which they were forcibly resettled 160 years ago along the Trail of Tears.
The tribe has tried several times to build casinos elsewhere but has been rebuffed, most recently in Carroll County, Ga.
, on the Alabama border west of Atlanta.
Carroll County residents, close enough to Atlanta to benefit from its boom, said they feared crime and disruption from the casino, but the reception has been very different in Hancock.
Most residents here are descendants of slaves who once worked the plantations in the area, and Hancock is one of a string of largely black counties stretching from Virginia to East Texas known as the Black Belt.
Most of those counties are significantly more impoverished than their neighbors, even in a time of national bounty.
In May, after R.
Allen Haywood, the editor and publisher of the weekly Sparta Ishmaelite, noticed an article about Carroll County's rejection, he suggested to Hancock County officials that they contact the tribe.
Kialegee leaders were immediately interested, and received a warm reception at an overflowing town meeting here last week.
They were even more intrigued when they learned that there are several large Indian mounds in Hancock County, of unknown origin and dating back hundreds of years.
``There was an almost instant camaraderie between the tribal members and the citizens of the county,'' said Kenneth R.
Baldwin, who runs an investment group in McAlester, Okla.
, that is representing the Kialegees.
``They both have an understanding of what it means to have to struggle, to not have the opportunities you'd like to have.
The tribe felt more welcome there than anywhere else they have been''.
Residents of the county have heard all of society's warnings about gambling, and are aware that it is not always a pathway out of distress.
But they have also seen marketing studies showing that there is no other full-fledged casino in Georgia, Florida or the Carolinas, and are convinced gamblers will make their way to this nearly abandoned county once the lights flash on the proposed casino, hotel and golf course.
Considering Hancock's current situation _ in which the largest employer is its public school system _ the county's leaders say they could hardly do worse.
``This is a place where people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs,'' Roberts said.
``Our history hasn't put us in a position to be very selective about what we want.''
TOPPENISH, Wash.
(AP) --At Tiny's Tavern, bartender Nena Garcia wonders how much longer she'll be employed.
The Yakama Nation, which already bans liquor sales on tribal land, has imposed a new tax on alcohol sold on private land within the reservation and a $5,000 license fee on liquor distributors.
The move has been criticized by the governor and it raises legal questions about the authority of tribes to tax non-Indians.
Indian tribes across the country have taken various steps to curb alcohol-related problems.
Last July, the Blackfeet Tribal Council banned liquor sales on its Montana reservation for five days and suggested it could be the forerunner of year-round prohibition.
Activist Russell Means in October suggested opening a liquor store near South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which is officially dry, and using the profits to treat alcoholism.
Stores in Whiteclay, Neb.
--just two miles from the reservation -- sell millions of dollars worth of beer each year, most of it to Oglala Sioux.
The Yakama tribe's moves affect some 50 businesses.
At least two major distributors already have refused to deliver to the central Washington reservation, and that means Tiny's, in nearby Wapato, hasn't been able to get any beer.
"We're stocked for a little bit, maybe a month or so.
After that I don't know," Ms.
Garcia said.
"I'm afraid I might lose my job".
Gov. Gary Locke, who opposes the Yakama tax, did announce this week that the state is closing the two privately operated state liquor store franchises in Wapato and Toppenish "out of respect for the Yakama Nation's desire to reduce consumption of alcohol on the reservation".
Richard Paddock owns the Wapato franchise.
He hopes to move his business to Union Gap, a few miles north and off the reservation.
Paddock said several people stand to lose their livelihoods because of the new wholesale tax, which raises the price of a six-pack of beer by about $2.40.
Restaurants and lounges could be hurt, too.
When the Yakama Tribal Council adopted the tax ordinance in November, leaders said the money would be used for alcoholism treatment and education and for drunken-driving enforcement.
"We share their concerns about alcoholism and the illegal overuse of alcohol," Locke said after meeting with tribal leaders and area mayors.
However, he said the tax is "the wrong way to go" in trying to fight problems such as chronic alcohol abuse, teen-age drinking and fetal alcohol syndrome.
State Attorney General Christine Gregoire has said the tax may be illegal because it is imposed on non-tribal members.
Tribal Council Chairman Lonnie Selam, however, said he believed the tax would withstand legal challenge.
The governor said negotiations over the issue will continue and urged businesses to hang on.
At least one of three private clubs is considering allowing members to bring in their own liquor, and then charging them a fee for glasses and mixers.
At the Double D Saloon and several other businesses, petitions are being circulated urging Locke to fight the tax.
David Meyers, owner of The 88-Cent Store across the street from the Double D, doesn't sell alcohol but he's opposed to the tax.
"I believe it's too radical, and that Toppenish residents will end up going out of town to buy their alcohol, thus causing major problems with drinking and driving," he said.
Esther Serna, who owns the El Paso Cafe, said she was neutral on the tax.
"I don't sell a lot of beer," she said.
"But I do feel sorry for the people (it) will make go out of business."
CHICAGO _ A tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern Nebraska found itself Friday at the forefront of an increasingly heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty ends and state control begins.
The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its reservation.
Friday that little casino nearly led a U.S.
District Court judge in Omaha, Neb.
, to take an unprecedented step: the jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling.
Although the judge, William Cambridge, ultimately decided against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive victory.
Cambridge suggested that federal prosecutors might want to pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal because it had lacked state approval ever since opening 3 1/2 years ago.
The lack of such approval violates a federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which requires an Indian tribe to strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its reservation lies if it wants to open a casino.
There are now about 145 such compacts between states and various tribes.
But Nebraska, opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate one with the Santee Sioux, the tribe with a stake in the proceeding Friday.
That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be exempt from state regulation and taxation.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Only Monday, the California Supreme Court overturned a ballot measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian reservations.
The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes' ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with Las Vegas.
The tribes' position was supported by Gov.
Gray Davis, but the court ruled that it conflicted with the state constitution's ban on casino-style games like blackjack and 21.
In addition, Florida, Kansas and Alabama, trying to block the opening of Indian casinos within their borders, have sued the U.S.
Interior Department with the aim of overturning new rules that allow the federal government to license tribal casinos in cases where states are reluctant to negotiate compacts.
And Wisconsin Gov.
Tommy Thompson refused to renew one-year gambling agreements with that state's 11 tribes until they agreed to pay $22 million in lieu of taxes, up from $350,000 under the old one-year agreements.
``Before, when we didn't have any pie, nobody bothered with us,'' said Sheila Morago, a spokeswoman for the National Indian Gaming Association.
``Now that we have a small piece of the pie, they want our filling.
It's just a constant intrusion on the treaties that were signed long ago, on the tribes' sovereign rights.
Every time you get a little farther, you take one step forward and two steps back''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) David Rocchio, deputy legal counsel to Vermont Gov.
Howard Dean, who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the National Governors' Association, said that ``the concern that governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes''.
Rather, Rocchio said, ``the concern is with the carve-out from state regulation, such as land use, police power and other ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos _ and the impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on other lands in the state''.
Like gambling venues everywhere, casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers.
The reservation of the Santee Sioux, the tribe involved in the court showdown in Nebraska on Friday, lies on the Missouri River just across the border with South Dakota, and is home to about 1,000 tribal members.
In February 1996, the Santee Sioux opened the Ohiya Casino on reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a 7-Eleven store.
It has 71 video gambling and slot machines, and attracts mostly elderly people from nearby farming communities.
It takes in just $900,000 or so a year and employs only 23 people, but tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with 74 percent unemployment.
Tribe chairman Arthur Denny said the casino actually supports about four relatives of each employee and has brought a decline in alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
But Nebraska, which does not allow casino gambling anywhere in the state, has refused to negotiate a compact with the Santee Sioux.
Almost from the beginning, the U.S. attorney's office in Omaha has tried to get the casino shut down.
A federal appeals court found the casino illegal in 1998, and the Supreme Court, without comment, let that ruling stand.
This February, Cambridge began fining the tribe $3,000 a day, and in June he doubled the fine, to $6,000 a day.
None of the debt, now totaling $726,000, has been paid by the Santee Sioux, and the purpose of the hearing Friday was for Cambridge to consider whether to put the 11 members of the tribal council in jail for contempt.
In the end, he decided against doing so, saying that because the tribe voted in a referendum this month to keep the casino open, the leaders no longer had the authority to close it.
He told the federal prosecutors that to get the casino closed, they would have to pursue the case as a criminal matter, not a civil one.
Why that would make any difference in a practical sense was not entirely clear.
In any event, the judge was hardly sympathetic to the Santee Sioux, saying the fines would continue.
It was not certain where the case would proceed from here.
U.S. Attorney Thomas Monaghan said his office had several options, but he would not elaborate.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) After the hearing, tribal members who had made the 160-mile trip to Omaha erupted in cheers and sang tribal songs, celebrating the judge's decision not to jail the leaders.
The tribe is hoping that the new Interior Department rules will allow it to work out a legitimate means of running the casino, but that process, even if successful, could take years.
``We're not trying to break anybody's laws,'' said Thelma Thomas, the casino's manager.
``We're just trying to make life better for our people.''
American Indians are the victims of violent crimes at more than twice the national average and, unlike the situation among whites and blacks where the large majority of crime victims are of the same race as the perpetrators, 70 percent of those committing crimes against Indians are of a different race, according to the first comprehensive study of crimes involving Indians, which was released Sunday by the Justice Department.
The study found that the nation's 2.3 million Indians were far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than members of any other racial group, and that the rate of violent crime experienced by Indian women is nearly 50 percent higher than that by black males.
A full 60 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against Indians were whites, according to the victims, while 29 percent of the offenders were other Indians and 10 percent were described as black, the report said.
By contrast, other studies have shown that 69 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against whites are also white, and 81 percent of those committing violent crimes against blacks are themselves black.
``This highlights what has been going on out there for 130 years, since the beginning of the reservation system,'' said Sidney Harring, a professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert on Indian crime and criminal law.
Harring said much of the violence against Indians by other racial groups was attributable to racism and alcohol, ``with Indians being victimized by poor, drunken whites, people on the margins hurting each other''.
There are still high levels of prejudice against Indians in the West, where most Indians live, he said, and a culture that lives on the edges of Indian reservations ``that tolerates this violence,'' even among law enforcement officials.
Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute, an Indians' rights advocacy group in Washington, took an even more sweeping position, saying, ``This may actually represent a downturn in violence over the centuries since we first encountered Europeans.
``At least it's not genocidal,'' said Ms.
Harjo, who is part Cheyenee and part Muscogee.
``Now they are taking Indians out one by one''.
The study was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical branch of the Justice Department, using data gathered from 1992 to 1996 by the National Crime Victimization Survey, which asks a sample of American households each year about crimes they have experienced.
The survey measures the violent crimes of rape, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault.
To supplement the survey, the justice department added data on homicides gathered by the FBI from local police reports.
The victimization survey is considered a reliable measure of crime by criminologists.
According to the survey, the average annual rate at which Indians were victims of crimes _ 124 per 1,000 people, ages 12 or older _ is about two and a half times the national average of 50 crimes per 1,000 people who are above the age of 12.
The average for whites was 49 per 1,000 people; for blacks, 61 per 1,000; and for Asians, 29 per 1,000.
Alcohol played a major part in violent crimes against Indians, both those committed by Indians against each other and those committed by people of other racial groups, the report found.
Indian victims reported that the perpetrator had been drinking in 46 percent of violent crimes against them, the highest of any racial group, while 70 percent of Indians convicted of violence who were in jail said they had been drinking at the time of their offense.
In addition, the survey found that the arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among Indians (including drunken driving, liquor law violations and public drunkenness) was more than double that for the total population during 1996, though the arrest rate for drug offenses was lower than for other races.
The four states with the most Indian residents were; Oklahoma, with 252,000, followed by California, Arizona and New Mexico.
Peter Iverson, a professor of history at Arizona State University, said that there had been a significant shift in Indian population over the past 20 years, with a majority of Indians now living in urban areas.
But those Indians in cities form a small part of the metropolitan area and do not live in segregated areas, so they are much more likely to come in contact with people of other groups.
Residential segregation is often part of the explanation for the tendency of whites to commit violence against whites, and blacks against other blacks.
Iverson said that in rural areas bordering Indian reservations, ``you still have significant prejudice against Indian people providing traditional justification for violence''.
Historically, he said, Indians entered these communities to shop, or to buy alcohol or for entertainment, and though whites in these towns made money off the Indians, ``there has long been an uneasy relationship, even resentment''.
In this situation, arguments, fueled by alcohol, could quickly become violent, he said.
Separately, the report said that the murder rate by Indians in 1996 was 4 per 100,000, below the national average of 7.9 per 100,000, and less than the white rate of 4.9 per 100,000.
From 1991 to 1996, the murder rate by Indians fell 20 percent, faster than the overall national decline of 15 percent.
WASHINGTON (AP) --They come into Elaine Newton's court by the dozens, charged with underage drinking, using marijuana, fighting.
Some are as young as 11.
They are children without a childhood, being sucked into the vortex of drinking and despair that destroys too many people on Colorado's remote Southern Ute Indian reservation.
Newton, the tribe's chief judge, sees more of them every year.
Many, Newton said, are victims themselves, either of abuse or what she calls ''emotional incest''.
''That's where children basically are left to feel responsible for their parents' own emotional needs,'' Newton said.
''They feel it's their fault that mom is drinking or dad leaves, when it's really not their fault.
''I think we forget they are children''.
As crime rates fall nationwide, they are rising in American Indian communities, especially among the 43 percent of Indians under age 20.
Indian youth are far more likely to be arrested for alcohol-related crimes than their non-Indian counterparts, according to a report released Thursday by a government advisory panel.
The Coalition for Juvenile Justice report said 3 percent of juveniles arrested for liquor law violations are Indian, though Indians make up just 1 percent of all juveniles.
The coalition, a nonprofit group of state advisory boards created under a federal juvenile justice law, recommends expanding programs to fight Indian alcoholism, depression and gangs.
''In states with significant American Indian communities, American Indian youth are found far too frequently in the back of squad cars, rather than in the front of classrooms,'' the report said.
Juvenile crime is one strand in the web of social problems facing urban and reservation Indian communities, the report said.
High reservation unemployment is one factor.
''There are limited opportunities on the reservation, especially those in rural areas,'' said Kevin Shendoe, a member of New Mexico's Jemez Pueblo who started a group to help youths develop leadership skills.
''Given that and the history of alcoholism and poverty, I think it all plays into students getting depressed and frustrated --and in certain serious cases, violent''.
Another factor is abuse passed down from generation to generation, often starting with Indian children forced into government or religious boarding schools where tribal culture was suppressed and abuse and neglect were commonplace.
''Cultural oppression has taken a heavy toll on Native Americans for years,'' Newton said.
''There's been a lack of parenting because of boarding schools.
Parents don't know how to be parents.
... In society today, you're in between two cultures.
They lost their Indian culture and they're struggling with trying to figure out where they fit''.
Indians have some of the worst health care and highest death rates from alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicide in the nation.
That means many young Indians are repeatedly traumatized by deaths of friends and relatives, said Sandi Ernst, a psychologist who ran the White Mountain Apache Tribe's child mental health programs from 1993 to 1999.
A large number of children affected by alcohol in their mothers' wombs also contributes to the crime problem, said Ernst, who now practices in Phoenix.
People exposed to alcohol in the womb are more impulsive and often cannot understand consequences of their behavior, she said.
''That increases the likelihood they're going to do stupid things,'' Ernst said.
Tribal programs, which must rely on federal funding, are too often shortchanged, the report said.
Newton said getting enough money to help the children she sentences is a constant problem.
Children who have enough Indian heritage to qualify for some federal programs but are not enrolled members of the tribe often fall through the cracks, she said.
''It often seems like there's no funding available to help us,'' Newton said.
''If we need treatment for sexual abuse or domestic violence or alcohol treatment, there's no one to help us.
It's kind of like these problems never get resolved''.
Newton also thinks that Indian communities must take responsibility for ending the cycle of abuse and alcohol.
''A lot of us are in denial about what has happened,'' Newton said.
''We cover up things or say nothing's wrong in our families.
We don't make our families accountable for the wrongs we may have done.
''My sense is we need to validate what has happened, grieve and then move on.
Until you can do that, you just don't resolve anything''.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.
(AP) --At Mesa Elementary School in far northwest New Mexico, Navajo children line up to use the few computers connected to the Internet.
Their time online must be short for everyone to get a chance.
''The Internet's not really available to me,'' said sixth-grader Altie Altieyazzie.
President Clinton was scheduled to visit the youngster's community of Shiprock on Monday as part of his New Markets Initiative to encourage economic development in depressed areas, a tour that focuses on the so-called ''digital divide'' that is leaving minority communities like Altie's behind.
Many in Shiprock hope Clinton's presence will spotlight conditions on the Navajo reservation that have kept most of its 8,000 residents from participating in the Internet information age.
Poverty and the extremely rural nature of the sprawling reservation mean many homes don't have telephone connections, let alone computers.
''We have a lot of needs, on any Native American reservation, and the Navajo Reservation is the same,'' said sixth-grade teacher Fannie L.
Atcitty. ''We're still behind, which is affecting our schools, our students''.
Officials at Mesa Elementary estimate that fewer than half of the families with children who attend the school have phone lines to their homes, a problem for emergencies as well as Internet access.
Altie, 12, said his family has a phone but no computer.
''For some people it's probably too expensive,'' he said.
The students have access to the school's computers on some days after classes, but many have long bus rides home and can't stay, said Principal Glojean Todacheene.
The limited time they get in school on the computers doesn't allow them to get comfortable enough to be considered computer literate, Atcitty said.
''Every child should be computer literate,'' she said, ''but it's not really happening here''.
There has been some progress over the past few months.
Tachyon Inc.
, a California-based company that provides wireless Internet service, gave the Lake Valley Navajo School a $30,000 satellite system last week to connect the school's computers to the Internet.
School officials tried accessing the Internet by telephone line, but the connection was so poor it took as long as 40 minutes to find a Web site.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs hopes to eventually get satellite systems to all remote schools in the Navajo Nation.
A donation earlier this year from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, started by the founder of Microsoft, created a program to provide grants for computers and software for American Indian tribes in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah.
A computer that is expected to be delivered to the Navajo Nation's Hogback chapter in August will be used by everyone from elementary school students to business people, said Anita Hayes, community services coordinator for the chapter, about four miles east of Shiprock.
Hayes said the Internet connection will provide information on jobs, education and other opportunities to members, and she hopes Clinton's visit will make it easier to get grants for more equipment.
''There are a lot of reasons to have this access,'' she said, though not everyone is racing toward the Internet age.
''Among the elderly, it's foreign to them,'' Hayes said.
''They're not saying too much about it.
They're just observing, watching the children''.
Clinton's plans Monday including speaking at Shiprock Boys/Girls Club, then joining an evening Webcast at Dine Tribal College in Shiprock that will involve high school student online at Lake Valley Navajo School, about 55 miles away.

MACY, Neb.
_ There was no Christmas vacation this year at the Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either.
Instead, the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first week of May.
This was his attempt to stem a chronically high truancy rate that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in school.
It was not entirely successful.
In the math class taught by Chessmore, for example, only five of the 36 registered students were showing up by mid-April.
Even in a country used to stories about struggling public schools, many of those in Indian country stand out.
Last year, the average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th percentile.
Fewer than half the students in grades three through 12 came to take the test, Chessmore said.
And while this year's graduating class of nine is bigger than those of a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade.
The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country.
On average, 36 percent to 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any ethnic group.
Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to college, and most do not finish.
``We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of entering college,'' said Dean Chavers, director of the Native American Scholarship Fund.
``Whatever test you're looking at, Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th percentile.
The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent.
Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 _ no geometry, no trig _ and people wonder why they're failing out of college''.
Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve.
The effort reflects the Indians' increasing ability to assert itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos.
But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
Some reservation schools have done well and others, including the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago.
But many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the relationship between being academically rigorous and being successful on the reservation.
These difficulties only compound the isolation and poverty of reservation life.
``I worry about the future of the tribe,'' said Denine Parker, an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy, where 60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed.
``I see too many kids not getting an education.
What happens to them?
All you have to do is walk Main Street and then you know''.
To some degree, state and federal officials are responding.
President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs _ $1.2 billion _ which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.
The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers.
Currently, most teachers in reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are extremely high, and many believe the teachers do not understand Indian culture and learning styles.
And in August, a task force Clinton created will present plans to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90 percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.
``What's important is that what the government is doing says it's OK to be an Indian,'' said David Cournoyer, director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund.
``Before the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person.
Now there's a recognition that the Indian's background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students''.
Dr. David Beaulieu, the Education Department's director of Indian education, called the effort unprecedented.
``We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children,'' Beaulieu said.
``In the 1990s we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before''.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In Nebraska, the efforts of Chessmore and others got the state to hold an Indian education summit meeting and appoint a task force to improve state policy.
The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so tribes, which have very little taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they cannot raise the required amount from property taxes.
The bill was vetoed by Nebraska's governor, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state.
Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Gov.
Mike Johanns, said that while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he also believed ``it is time for the state and federal government to step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding''.
And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.
``We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation communities,'' said Christensen.
``In two of our reservation schools there are 44 kindergartners but only two seniors, and in one case those two kids should not be graduating.
They are two 18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save their soul''.
Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north of Macy, said ``some parents see formal education as important, others see just being with the family as education.
We have parents who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a haircut in the middle of the day''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) nn &UR; &QL; &LR; Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher who regularly sees only 15 out of 26 students in her largest class, sent her daughter to sixth grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa.
Recently, her daughter returned to Omaha Nation school to find she was ``way ahead of the sixth graders here,'' Parker said.
``If I never would have sent her away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work''.
Still, at Omaha Nation, Chessmore has made many improvements, from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help girls who have babies stay in school.
He started a training program for Indian teachers that will increase their numbers from 4 to 20, made the curriculum more culturally relevant, and has applied for money for a social services center with probation officers and a mental health counselor.
He received a grant for a reading program for elementary students, which has produced ``fourth graders who are reading better than half our high school''.
And he is lobbying the telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students' families without them.
To build trust, Chessmore, unlike most superintendents and teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his seven children at Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students.
He and his wife also raise four Indian students from troubled families.
He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell from 31 percent to about 15 percent.
One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member, scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school.
In a Buick with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Oldman visited one boy's father and the trailer where the other boy lived with his grandmother.
He scaled a chalky ridge called Million Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees, scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an algae-choked creek strewn with old tires..
The truants were nowhere to be seen.
``The kids are smart _ they arrange tree branches so they can scoot underneath but we have to work to get through,'' Oldman said.
He said tribal court has begun fining parents whose children were chronically truant, and the school sometimes tried to get their welfare benefits cut.
``Some parents are really concerned, but some of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the kids to school''.
One chronic truant was Janice &UR; &LR; Baxter's 16-year-old son.
She would take him to school in the morning, but said that ``in the afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends''.
Baxter said he kept ``coming home drunk'' and she sent him to a treatment center.
Some students show promise but don't follow through.
This year, it looked like Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season ended.
``I didn't really want to come to school no more,'' said Jason, 18.
But there have been successes.
One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate.
But a few weeks ago, Chessmore refused to let his daughter double date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate.
She did.
And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was left back in ninth grade and was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks, turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her she would have to help pay the bills if she wasn't in school.
Now she'll graduate and plans to attend college.
``I finally realized what I should be doing,'' Adrienne wrote in a class essay, ``getting my education.''
SEATTLE _ The national dairy industry is using Mark McGwire to promote the health benefits of drinking milk.
Meanwhile, a rebel sneaker company called And1 has signed Latrell Sprewell to promote the misguided notion that it is OK to do whatever you want, including choke your coach, and you'll still be glorified.
The sports images in advertising are certainly eye-opening these days, even with Dennis Rodman out of the picture.
Let's start with McGwire.
The other day while driving on Aurora Avenue through Seattle, I was twice stopped at a red light long enough to realize how crazy it was to have McGwire towering over the road, his image plastered on a billboard _ bat in hand, sleeveless shirt revealing his sapling-sized biceps _ a veritable poster-boy for the health benefits of drinking milk.
Milk mustache in full view, McGwire's pitch (which you can find on the Web at www.whymilk.com) is simple: ``Going, going, gone.
Time for milk.
It's got stuff leading sports drinks don't _ like protein, potassium and calcium.
That's why I always have an ice cold glass...
as soon as I get home''.
Which prompts any rational sports fan to pose the next logical question: Does McGwire drink the milk before or after he pops the steroid-producing substance androstenedione?
He may have clobbered Maris and Ruth and ignited an entire summer, but McGwire stands for something else, too.
Ever since McGwire's andro use became public knowledge during last season's great home-run chase, McGwire has been generally unabashed in admitting his andro use.
He says it ensures better workouts in order for him to pump up his massive body, which in turn probably allowed McGwire to have one of his most injury-free seasons in the dramatic 1998.
Despite all the incredibly generous things McGwire has done for abused kids and for the game of baseball, his blind spot and failing on this issue is significant.
In Washington, D.C., earlier this month, President Bill Clinton's drug policy advisor, Gen.
Barry R.
McCaffrey, called for the federal government to study the health effects of androstenedione.
The over-the-counter supplement's popularity soared last year, even among school-aged children, soon after McGwire acknowledged using the substance for at least one year as part of his training regimen.
In an article he wrote for The New York Times last Sunday, former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses said he supports McCaffrey's leadership on this issue.
And Moses was not afraid to point the finger at McGwire.
``Androstenedione, better known as andro, is a steroid.
Despite all the misinformation to the contrary, it is neither merely a food supplement nor is it innocuous,'' Moses said.
A long-standing anti-doping crusader, Moses is alarmed at the influence athletes like McGwire have over the behavior of children.
``The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 175,000 teenage girls and 325,000 teen-age boys _ that's 500,000 children _ have reported using steroids during the past year,'' Moses said.
``The alarming numbers are not the only story.
Drug use in sport is also a fraud on the public, which is promised a product _ clean competition _ that is not ultimately delivered ...
``The problem of drug use by elite athletes must continue to be addressed on the federal level by General McCaffrey and others who are responsible for children and public welfare,'' Moses said.
Milk mustaches are one thing, but the taint of andro use still lingers with McGwire, whose bat speed and ability made him a natural anyway to set a new standard for home runs.
What might have been unnatural were McGwire's workouts, aided by the quick-recovery time andro allowed his muscles.
That is what makes you look up at McGwire's billboard and his innocent milk mustache and wish like heck the guy had simply depended on the natural goodness of milk, not the controversial substance now under serious scrutiny.
On a different front, a similar sort of head-scratching took place this NBA playoff season.
It happened when I looked into Latrell Sprewell's eyes during his ill-advised sneaker ad _ the one that is set to air 200 times before the NBA Finals.
Sprewell, who was suspended by the NBA for most of the 1997-98 season and who later sued everyone from the league to his agent to Converse sneakers because of his physical assault of Golden State coach P.J.
Carlesimo, was certainly aware that his new ad was made to shock.
``People say I'm what's wrong with sports.
I say I'm a three-time NBA All-Star.
People say I'm America's worst nightmare.
I say I'm the American dream,'' the sneering Spree says into the camera close-up.
The new ad was predicted by the national trade magazine Brandweek to be the most controversial sneaker endorsement since Nike made Charles Barkley say he was no role model.
Well, turns out Spree's ad isn't controversial.
It's just pathetic, which is what happens when you don't know any better than to go ahead and send the wrong message.

NEW YORK _ In 1970, two years into the open-tennis era and two years before Title IX, a pair of relatively obscure female players walked around the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills with a questionnaire.
Their objective: to determine tennis trends and, in particular, whether spectators attending the U.S.
Open would pay to watch a tournament with only female players.
The remarkably positive response of that informal survey by Ceci Martinez and Esme Emanuel was a declaration of independence for women's sports.
And if Title IX became the bill of rights for female athletes, this summer has emerged as the exclamation point for any equal-rights amendment.
From Women's World Cup soccer to U.S.
Open tennis, from the world track and field championships to the Pan-Pacific swimming meet, the message has been unmistakably clear: Women can hold their own on any stage, with or without men.
Teresa Weatherspoon's game-winning shot in the Women's National Basketball Association finals last week was as mind-boggling and riveting as was Jerry West's dramatic heave decades earlier.
And the Houston Comets' three-peat earned them a legacy alongside other basketball dynasties.
But the women have also stolen the show.
Even minus Steffi Graf's majestic presence and Anna Kournikova's photogenic tease, Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and others have created enough competitive subplots to justify an equal-pay mantra.
Davenport's bold backhand winner against Mary Pierce from match point down in their compelling quarterfinal three-setter was the gutsy shot of the tournament.
The notion that the women must play best-of-five sets to earn singles parity at Grand Slam events (not so at the U.S.
Open, which is the only equal-opportunity employer) is as outmoded as trying to equate the price of a Broadway show ticket to the length of a performance.
Substance always prevails over style (as Andre Agassi has learned), even if you need personalities for box-office bait.
Thirty years ago, only Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and a handful of others understood what really mattered.
Now the Williams sisters have rewritten the rules of the road for junior tennis, and Jong Song Ok's victory for North Korea in the women's marathon at the world track championships may have opened yet another door into a closed society just as Tegla Loroupe brought African women out of obscurity with her New York City Marathon victories.
Even Brandi Chastain's celebrated stripdown at the Women's World Cup final will be analyzed by the Associated Press Sports Editors in a newsletter.
Ceci Martinez says she is fascinated by the current crop of female athletes.
``We players were unhappy with the status quo,'' she said the other day by phone from her home in San Mateo, Calif.
, where she works in real estate.
``And like all reformers, we were considered radical in our time, chided for our feminist views simply because we wanted equal opportunity in all its ramifications''.
The positive results of that study, coupled with an early sponsorship commitment from Philip Morris, gave women's tennis its first financial cushion.
Now sponsors are using today's pros and even a former great, Althea Gibson, to sell themselves and this year's Open.
But the bright lights have also brought murkier, less romantic overtones to women's sports.
At the world track championships in Spain, Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a 39-year-old sprinter who had won 14 medals during a venerable career, was forced to withdraw from the meet after traces of the banned steroid nandrolone were found in one of her urine samples.
And lost amid the flurry of world swim records set by South African Penny Heyns at the Pan-Pacifics in Sydney's Olympic pool was her disclosure that creatine was an integral part of her training regimen.
Although legal as a nutritional supplement, creatine has been associated with bulking up male bodies for football, baseball and the beach more than female swimmers.
``I'd be swimming pretty well whether I was on it or not,'' said Heyns, who set an astonishing seven world records in her last 10 races.
``But I have the attitude that I don't want to get on the blocks during my career and know that I`ve trained and swum as hard as I could but that there was a nutritional side that I didn't do the best I could in.
I want to cover all the bases''.
These words are a far cry from the days when pasta, carbo-loading and electrolyte solutions were considered new-age nutritional training tools.
But Heyns' times will almost certainly resonate around the world on the road to Sydney next September just as many coaches have finally moved beyond East Germany's systematic steroid scandal of the '70s.
Free from current doping control procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality as the next battle ground for women.
``Title IX has certainly helped,'' Martinez said, of what awaits women, ``but looking beyond the sports arena, women are still struggling to break through the glass ceiling in all facets of life, especially in business, politics and the mass media.''
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) --Russian 400-meter runner Svetlana Pospelova tested positive for banned drugs in an out-of- competition test, International Olympic Committee officials said Saturday.
Pospelova was found to have steroid stanozolol in her system, according to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical commission.
Pospelova, who won the European Cup at Gateshead, England, on July 15, was not a medalist in Sydney.
The IOC Executive Board meets on Sunday.
However since she has left the country and is not expected to compete again, the matter is expected to be turned over to the international federation to consider the case and possible sanctions.
Pospelova would be the seventh athlete to test positive at the Games, which have been enveloped in doping cases since well before the start two weeks ago.
She had already returned to Russia when the medical commission received the drug test result, de Merode said.
Full details will be available after the IOC executive board meeting.
BOSTON _ Since the day she sailed her way into this city's heart by finishing a sparkling second in the 1990 Boston Marathon, her US debut after leaving East Germany, marathoning brought Uta Pippig little but joy and success.
Even the setbacks _ the worst being forced to drop out of the 1996 Olympics with a leg injury _ seemed temporary, a brief chop on life's ocean that soon would calm again as Pippig resumed her voyage toward immortality in the sport.
After all, how could anything swamp an athlete who earned her third straight Boston Marathon victory, as she did at the 100th running in 1996, by coming from nowhere in the last miles while suffering from stomach cramps and relentless diarrhea?
Then, last October, the 33-year-old Pippig was suspended by the German athletic federation for failing a routine out-of-competition drug test.
Unable to compete during the suspension and facing a two-year ban if found guilty, Pippig suddenly finds herself looking for a lifeline to save her career.
``I don't wish any person on earth this,'' said Pippig last fall, shortly after the suspension.
``I know I didn't do anything.
It's hard.
It's just not fair''.
But Pippig's forced exile from the roads hasn't kept the longtime Boston favorite out of town this weekend.
On Saturday, looking fit and relaxed, she smiled for photos at the Boston Athletic Association's annual breakfast for past champions.
Monday, as she did last year while taking what she thought would be a short break from marathoning, she will be doing television commentary for Channel 4.
Despite her uncertain situation, Pippig said recently that she was looking forward to race day.
``I can't miss it, you know,'' she said.
``It's too special''.
The same goes for the city: ``You should go where you feel supported''.
Still, she sighed, ``I wish I could run''.
Meanwhile, Pippig's contract with Nike expired in December and has not been renewed.
(``Given that she's not racing and not able to actually compete, there is no reason to sit down and discuss a contract at this point,'' said Dave Mingey, a company spokesman, who nonetheless added, ``We of course stand by Uta until her appeal process has been exhausted'').
She is paying her own legal fees, and already has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance fees and likely prize money.
And, there is no immediate end in sight.
Six months after the suspension was handed down, the commission in Germany that is investigating her case still has not set a hearing date.
If found guilty, the three-time Boston champion and two-time Olympian could be banned from competition for up to two years.
``I am very often asking my people what is going on,'' said Helmut Digel, president of the German federation, the Deutscher Leichtathletik Verband, ``because this situation is for both parties not a good one.
It is very important the period of suspension shouldn't last too long''.
The delays may be due to questions about both science and procedure.
As in the nearly three-year-old Mary Slaney case, it is unclear whether the test is even valid in women.
(Slaney was cleared by a USA Track &AMP; Field panel of a similar doping violation, and filed a lawsuit last Tuesday against the United States Olympic Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation, charging negligence in handling the case).
In Pippig's case, matters have been complicated by an unexplained switch in her two urine samples.
For years, rumors have swirled inside the running community about Pippig's high training mileage and rapid recovery after races; a training routine some fellow runners in Boulder, where she now lives, viewed as excessively private; and her East German background.
But until last fall, Pippig never had failed any of the dozens of drug tests in her career.
(She does acknowledge that, while still living in East Germany in 1984, she briefly took ``some kind of drug'' that her trainer told her was vitamins, but stopped within a few weeks after her parents, both physicians, investigated and told her to stop).
``I think it's kind of a sad thing,'' Pippig said of the accusations.
``But I feel sorry for them.
People who say this can be jealous''.
The test Pippig did fail, which showed an abnormal ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone in her urine, is by no means universally trusted.
The accepted ratio of testosterone, the male sex hormone, to epitestosterone, an inactive metabolite that is used as a marker, is 6 to 1; anything above that is considered to indicate the possible use of testosterone as a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid.
But because the test cannot distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
At the same time, a ratio up to 10 to 1 still is considered to be in a gray area.
According to Pippig, not only was her ratio 9.2 to 1, but the abnormality was not due to high testosterone but rather to low epitestosterone, perhaps resulting from a number of conditions specific to gender and health issues that she has been battling since her epic run in 1996.
``I'm skeptical about the validity of the test, especially in women,'' said Dr.
Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who has sent a letter to the German federation on Pippig's behalf.
``This test has been most widely used in male athletes, and then it's been applied to females kind of by analogy.
In my mind, when we finally work out the details we will abandon it as a test for women''.
Especially in question, Barbieri believes, are the effects on the t/e ratio of oral contraceptives _ which Pippig was taking at the time _ and medical conditions involving the bowel, through which the hormones are cycled.
Pippig was hospitalized for tests after the episode during the 1996 Marathon, and said that intestinal problems, including diarrhea, and a severe hormone imbalance persisted even up to the time of the drug test last April.
``It's obvious I had a lot of problems with my intestinal tract during the last years,'' she said.
In Pippig's case, questions of procedure also have arisen.
When urine is collected for testing, samples are placed in two bottles, marked ``A'' and ``B,'' and then placed into containers also marked ``A'' and ``B''.
After her test last April 23, said Pippig, she placed the correct bottles into the matching containers herself, and then she, her coach and companion Dieter Hogen, and the test controller all signed to confirm the protocol was done correctly.
But when the ``A'' container was opened April 29 in a German laboratory, said Pippig, the ``B'' sample was found inside, leaking.
``The federation said, `It must have been you,' '' said Pippig.
``But. . . when a controller comes you do everything very clear and slow.
Six eyes who look to the same bottle, the same container, the same paper . . . '' ``There was no mistake in our home,'' insisted Hogen.
And none by the federation, insisted Digel.
``We got the information that the test was positive, and that is why we made our decision to suspend,'' he said.
``We are not responsible for the collection of the sample, not responsible for the containers, not responsible for the transportation''.
If mistakes were made in the lab, Digel said, it is the lab's responsibility, not the federation's.
Where does this leave Pippig?
``If this (the reversal of the samples and the subsequent testing of them in the wrong order, according to international rules) is fact, it would be very hard to prosecute this case,'' said Dr.
Gary I.
Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and lead author of the textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete''.
``If all these things can be proved, case closed''.
Yet the case is not yet closed, and so at noon Monday Pippig will be on TV rather than the starting line.
Still, she remains optimistic.
``The evidence shows I'm not guilty,'' she said.
``I will run again.
Nothing will change for me.''
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) --The human aspect should be taken into account when dealing with the doping incident, Jose Joaquin Puello, president of the 14th Pan Am Games Organization Committee said Saturday.
At a press conference which was meant to showcase Santo Domingo of the Dominican Republic, the city to host the next Pan American Games in four years, Puello went out of his way to comment on the doping incident invovling a Dominican athlete who had won the women's high jump gold medal before testing positive at the Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
The 20-year-old high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped of the Pan Am gold medal four days ago after she tested positive for steroid.
"Athletes are not machines.
They are human beings, and every human makes mistake, " Puello said.
"The importance is not to avoid making mistakes, but to acknowledge that you made mistakes".
Puello went on emotionally appealing the world athletics governing body, International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), to be merciful when considering sanctioning Arrendel, who was called by him as "an athlete who yet to reach her summit".
"Juana should be allowed to continue her athletic life, " he said".
She is a great athlete, a great woman, completely clean in every aspect of her life".
The media also has an important role to play, he said, they should protect her instead of crucifying her.
Arrendel took what was called "Ben substance" to post a personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's sole gold medal since the beginning of the Games.
"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big mistake," Dr.
Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medican Commission said.
"This is the substance Ben Johnson has taken.
It's exetremely important for us to know where she got it".
Stonozolol, which was found in Arrendel's urine sample, is an anabolic steroid to increase power in speed, especially in the competitions of high jump and 100-meter race.
Gottschalt recalled that in 1981, when she was 15, she left the swimming school and returned home to hear friends and family remark about how the little girl had developed into a muscle-bound woman with a deep voice.
Other problems ensued: liver ailments, a hardening of back muscles.
In 1984 she gave birth to a son with a clubfoot.
Gottschalt believes her baby's deformity was a result of her being given drugs.
As years passed and her anger grew, she wondered exactly what the little blue pills had contained.
``I didn't think anyone cared enough about what happened to me to take any interest,'' she said.
``I gave up thinking anything might happen''.
Hope was restored last year when Gottschalt received a call from Michael Lehner, a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related lawsuits.
Lehner brought the criminal case against Kipke, and with the public prosecutor helped try it.
Lehner represented Gottschalt in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said, also had children with birth defects.
Having read files kept by the swimming federation, Lehner learned that Gottschalt was a member of the B group of swimmers, young hopefuls who, according to the Stasi files, were to receive ``supporting means'' to improve their performance.
``Supporting means'' was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid manufactured in East Germany.
Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had also been administered the little blue pills and who would be willing to testify.
Court cases involving doping to that point had involved only swimmers from programs in the former East Berlin.
Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz, Halle, Rostock, Leipzig and Dresden who had been similarly doped.
Lehner spoke to Ute Krause, also a product of the Magdeburg program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to Gottschalt's.
After Krause left the swimming school in 1981, her voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled depression.
Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in Magdeburg, Krause learned more about Oral-Turinabol.
Certain patients were being prescribed the drug to help regain muscle loss because of illness.
In a medical textbook, she read of the link between anabolic steroids and chronic depression.
She made no additional efforts to find out more about what had happened to her until Lehner called.
``I suppressed what happened to me for so long,'' Krause said recently in Magdeburg.
``I am still searching for my biography''.
In early January, Gottschalt, 34, Krause, 37, and three other former East German swimmers were present in a Berlin courtroom for the trial of Lothar Kipke.
During his testimony, Kipke admitted that he had distributed anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a deepening of the voice.
According to Kipke, as research increased in the 1980s, he began administering the steroids in lower dosages and only in pill form.
Ten feet from Kipke, Gottschalt listened to the doctor rationalize his actions.
When she heard his lawyer explain that Kipke had only been following orders, Gottschalt exclaimed, ``Say that to my son's face''!
Daniel, her 14-year-old disabled son, sat beside her.
Krause seized the chance to address Kipke directly near the end of the trial.
``He avoided making a direct apology,'' Krause said.
Lehner called Kipke a ``monster''.
``What gives a doctor that right to treat young girls like guinea pigs''?
Lehner said.
At the end of the one-day trial, Judge Peter Faust ruled that Kipke had acted with ``willful malevolence'' in overseeing doping of the swimmers during his tenure as head doctor.
Faust gave Kipke a 15-month suspended jail sentence, the most severe doping-related punishment meted out to a former East German official.
The verdict provided little solace for Gottschalt, who had hoped that the link between doping and birth defects would be addressed at the trial.
Faust declined Lehner's motion that the women whose children had birth defects receive financial compensation.
``We are going to pursue this further,'' Lehner said.
``I am representing nine clients who gave birth to children with birth defects''.
A member of the Berlin program, Barbara Krause, who won a gold medal on the East German freestyle relay team in the 1980 Olympics, has given birth to two children with clubfeet, according to Lehner.
She has been unwilling to testify at the doping trials, however, because of her marriage to Lutz Wanja, a former swimming coach in Potsdam.
Since the Kipke trial, Lehner has learned that a former swimmer in Leipzig has a 19-year-old daughter with a clubfoot.
In the next trial, for which no date has been set, Lehner plans to refer again to evidence yielded by the Stasi files, which show that East German doctors ordered female athletes to take birth control or have abortions because they feared Oral-Turinabol could damage fetuses.
Kipke, 72, is the 26th East German sports official to be convicted on charges of doping.
They were involved in swimming as well as other sports.
In May, several months before the statute of limitations runs out on the prosecution of middle-level East German criminals, Manfred Ewald and Manfred Hoeppner will have their day in court.
Hoeppner, head doctor of the East German sports medicine service, oversaw an unofficial group that the prosecution contends was the committee for all doping programs.
Ewald, former president of the East German Athletics Association, wrote a book chronicling his control over East German sports.
Gottschalt said she would be in the courtroom once again.
And to current swimmers caught up in the latest controversy over the use of dietary supplements like creatine to improve performance, Gottschalt offers her own sobering advice.
``Just leave it,'' she said.
``It's not worth it.
Let your body perform on its own.''
BERLIN (AP) _ Two medical experts testifying Wednesday in the doping trial of a former East German sports doctor said the female swimmers they examined showed health damage linked to performance-enhancing drugs, including liver damage and excessive facial hair.
The two professors said they examined 11 swimmers, all of whom were witnesses in the trial.
Five of the women had changes in their voices, they said.
One had heavy facial hair that was either caused or worsened by taking anabolic steroids, they said.
Two women were diagnosed with liver damage, they said, and another had a liver tumor that could be traced back to taking a combination of contraceptive pills and steroids for eight years.
Such side-effects of anabolic steroids have been generally known since 1977, they said.
Horst Luebbert, a professor of clinical gynecology, cautioned, however that while the health damage was ``with all probability'' linked to doping, ``we can't offer (absolute) security''.
Luebbert and pharmacology professor Norbert Rietbrock testified in the trial against Dr.
Dieter Binus.
His case was severed from five other defendants _ four coaches and another doctor _ after he made a partial confession last month.
The six were charged with causing bodily harm by administering performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers without informing the athletes or their parents.
Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects.
The next court date for his case was set for Aug.
24, when a verdict could be handed down.
The five other defendants have not made any statements.
Their trial resumes Monday.

SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) --Two positive doping tests were announced on Wednesday, just two days before the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games.
The cheaters were strongman Chen Po-pu of Chinese Taipei, and woman triple jumper Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria.
Chen became the first athlete to be expelled from the Olympics for a positive test of methandienone, and Prandzheva tested positive for the steroid nandrolone.
Prandzheva, a silver medallist at the 1995 world championships, was caught for taking drugs at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
She was banned for two years for taking methandienone.
Chen, who took silver and bronze medals at world junior competitions in 1997 and 1998, had been due to compete in the 62 kg category.
BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with coaches and doctors confessing they systematically administered performance-enhancing drugs to female swimmers.
All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had thought they were were reversible.
``I believed that,'' he said in testimony echoed by his co-defendants.
Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989.
One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by the steroids, which she started taking at 13.
Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair growth.
Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs _ without telling the minors or their parents what they were taking _ as part of communist East Germany's state-sponsored push to create Olympic champions.
Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests.
But since German unification, evidence of the systematic use of steroids to enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German government files.
On Tuesday, Suender, 58, testified that he had no reservations about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors, which was part of his responsibility.
He denied ever giving steroid injections, as prosecutors have charged.
Former team doctor Dorit Roesler, 50, said she passed them on to the coaches, who admitted giving them to the swimmers.
Coaches Peter Mattonet, 48; Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic endurance.
However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance firm, insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids.
Former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is a co-plaintiff in the case, at one point asked Roesler why she never checked for ill effects from the steroids.
Roesler insisted the athletes had regular medical exams and nothing worrying was found.
Suender said only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the steroids of causing a health problem, when a girl came to him with acute liver problems.
He and the others also insisted they were sworn to secrecy about the doping, even when it came to the athletes themselves or their parents.
Because all five made statements before the court, no other witnesses were likely to be called.
A verdict could come as early as Thursday.
Although they could get up to three years in prison, the defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin swim team.
Only one, Dr.
Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession.
He admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be handed down.
The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no verdict was expected.
BERLIN (AP) --East Germany's former sports chief and his medical director were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a top secret doping program in the former communist country that turned promising young female athletes into souped-up Olympic champions.
Manfred Ewald, 74, and Manfred Hoeppner, 65, were each convicted of 20 counts of being accessories to causing bodily harm for secretly administering steroids to the athletes.
The men allegedly told the athletes they were giving them vitamins.
Ewald was sentenced to 22 months probation; Hoeppner was given 18 months.
The court found them innocent of more serious charges that could have brought jail time.
Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and Hoeppner knew of the potential danger.
''Those responsible have been called to account,'' said Michael Lehner, the attorney for the women.
Defense lawyers said they were considering an appeal.
A member of the communist party's central committee, Ewald was president of East Germany's sports federation from 1961-88 and of its National Olympics Committee from 1973 until the country ceased to exist in 1990.
In its verdict, the court said Ewald was the ''driving force'' behind the doping program and kept it going with ''merciless hardness''.
Hoeppner, as the country's top sports doctor, worked out the details of the doping program --including the secrecy rules -- and distributed the steroids to the sports doctors and coaches, the court found.
Both shared responsibility for the ''systematic and overall doping in (East German) competitive sports,'' from 1974 until the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the court found.
The court said it handed down a lesser sentence to Hoeppner because he had apologized to the athletes and cooperated with prosecutors in other doping cases.
Ewald never made a direct apology.
Former track star Brigitte Michel, who was in court Tuesday, said she ''can live with'' the verdict even though the men most likely won't have to serve any time behind bars.
They faced a maximum of two years.
''There's no verdict anyway that can make up for the damage suffered,'' she said.
The athletes were seeking a conviction on a more serious charge.
They say the drugs caused them to develop excessive body hair and deep voices and also caused gynecological problems.
The baby of one former athlete was born with deformities allegedly linked to the drugs.
But the court said a direct connection could not be established between the steroids and each individual's specific illness.
The results of the steroid program were dramatic: East Germany, with fewer than 17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972 to 40 in 1976.
East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's swimming in 1976 and again in 1980.
About 20 former East German coaches, doctors and others have been convicted and given fines, suspended sentences or both.
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) --The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) has pressed for the national federations of Cuba and Jamaica to impose ban on high jumper Javier Sotomayor and sprinter Merlene Ottey for doping failures.
"It is a normal procedure and we do that in every doping case as soon as the B samples prove positive too, regardless of the athlete's fame or celebrity," IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
The urge came as Cuban authorities repeatedly said they would stand by Sotomayor, the world record holder, who failed a dope test for cocaine at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
The athletics' world ruling body also prompted the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) to take action against Ottey, whose second urine sample had just been tested positive.
The JAAA will conduct a hearing by November to determine whether it will suspend Ottey from competitions for two years.
Ottey tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland in July and the IAAF disclosed Thursday that the 39-year-old sprinter's "B" sample on September 2, the second urine test, also has tested positive for the drug.
"There are international rules regarding athletes who have had positive dope tests and they should be applied by all national federations.
"But it is up to the national federation to make a decision".
said Reineri.

SYDNEY, Australia _ As yet another drug scandal struck the Olympic track and field competition on Wednesday, Marion Jones sprinted for the first time since the public announcement that her husband had tested positive for steroids, easily winning her opening heat in the 200 meters.
Minutes before Jones's heat, the gold medal favorite in the women's hammer throw was told while on the track that she was ineligible to compete because she had failed a drug test for the steroid nandrolone.
Mihaela Melinte of Romania, a two-time world champion in the hammer throw, became the seventh person suspended at the Sydney Games for failed drug tests.
She tested positive June 7 at a meet in Milan, track and field's world governing body said.
This was the third drug scandal involving Romanians in Sydney.
Tuesday, the 16-year-old gymnastics all-around champion, Adreea Raducan, was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the stimulant ephedrine.
Earlier, the entire Romanian weight-lifting team was expelled after two athletes had tested positive for nandrolone before the Games.
The lifters who had not tested positive were allowed back in after Romanian Olympic officials paid a $50,000 fine.
More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses, confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is widespread.
This morning Melinte was preparing to warm up for the hammer throw qualifying round when ``she was informed of the reason why she could not compete,'' said Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for track and field's world governing body, known as the IAAF ``She said she didn't know''.
Nandrolone is the steroid for which the shot-putter C.
&UR; &LR; J.
Hunter, Jones's husband, tested positive for four times this summer, the IAAF said.
Hunter has said that he believed he ingested the substance from taking improperly labeled and contaminated nutritional supplements.
Jones did not refer to her husband's troubles after she won her heat of the women's 200 meters in 22.75 seconds.
She spoke only of her race, saying she was simply trying to conserve energy in the first heat because she had another round of the 200 scheduled for Wednesday night, as well as qualifying for the long jump.
Her awkward form in that event figures to be her biggest impediment to becoming the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.
``I stated all along that this day was going to be the most difficult for me because I had two heats of the 200 and the long jump,'' Jones said.
Withdrawing from the 200 was Inger Miller, the 1999 world champion and the only real threat to Jones in the event.
Miller earlier withdrew from the 100 meters, which Jones won last Saturday, after suffering a strained hamstring in training before the Sydney Games.
Miller is still hoping she can run on the American 4x100-meter relay, which is scheduled for Saturday, her agent, Emanuel Hudson, said this morning.
Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the U.S. track and field federation, said specifically that Miller did not fail a drug test and was eligible to compete in Sydney.
Suzy Favor Hamilton had the fastest time in the preliminary heats of the women's 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 8.08 seconds and is an inviting position now to win the gold medal.
The American champion, Regina Jacobs, withdrew before the Games with a respiratory viral infection.
And on Wednesday, the defending Olympic champion at 800 and 1,500 meters, Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, did not complete her heat of the 1,500.
Masterkova has had surgery on both Achilles' tendons in the past year, and her return to form has been uncertain.
She had dropped any intention of defending her 800-meter title and she had avoided the European racing circuit as she tried to regain her fitness.
She pulled up during on Wednesday's heat and burst into tears as she hobbled off the track.
The other American entrant in the women's 1,500, Marla Runyan, struggled through the first round but qualified for the semifinals in 4:10.83.
Runyan is the first legally blind athlete to make the American team in any sport. &QL;
MADRID, February 17 (Xinhua) --Spanish pole vaulter Dana Cervantes was tested positive in August for the banned steroid nandrolone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) said on Wednesday.
The Spaniard tested positive at the European Championships in Budapest on August 16, an IAAF spokesman said, adding "but all the business is currently in the hands of the Spanish federation".
A source close to the Spanish federation said that there were a number of discrepancies surrounding Cervantes' positive sample.
Cervantes took the test at her own request after she was not randomly selected in the qualifying rounds of the championship where she set a Spanish national record and eventually finished 11 th in the finals.
"They (the Spanish federation) asked us to respect the athlete' s confidentiality in this case, which would have been broken if we published her name, although we have been assured by the Spanish federation that she will not compete until the case is clarified," the IAAF spokesman added.
If Cervantes' positive test is confirmed, she could be banned from the sport for two years.
SYDNEY, Australia _ Forty of China's 300 Olympic athletes have withdrawn from the Summer Games, seven of them rowers who failed blood tests at home indicating that they were using performance-enhancing drugs, Olympic officials said Wednesday.
Favored to become the host city for the 2008 Summer Games, Beijing is apparently being extremely careful to avoid another doping scandal like those that tarnished the accomplishments of its swimmers in recent years.
There has also been skepticism about the stunning achievements of China's distance runners in the early 1990s.
It was not known whether the other 33 withdrawals were related to drugs, Sydney Olympic officials stressed.
Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee, said the withdrawals came after a request that countries pare down their teams or find other housing because the 10,400 available beds could not accommodate every athlete in the Olympic village.
The withdrawal of the seven rowers appears to indicate that the implementation of blood-testing procedures for the first time at these Sydney Games is having some deterrent effect on athletes in endurance sports who may look to cheat by illicitly trying to increase their oxygen-carrying capacity.
The International Olympic Committee last week approved testing for erythropoietin, or EPO, a synthetic version of a naturally-occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells and is believed to be widely used in such endurance sports as distance running, cycling, swimming and rowing.
``People are now convinced there is a test, that the IOC is prepared to apply it and nobody wants to send athletes to the Games that are going to get caught and disgraced,'' said Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Montreal who is head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, created by the IOC in the wake of the EPO scandal at the 1998 Tour de France.
Extensive drug use will certainly occur at the Sydney Games, IOC officials concede, considering there will be no tests for such performance-enhancers as human growth hormone, insulin growth hormone and artificial blood products.
Steroid use is also so sophisticated that topical gels can be flushed from the system in a matter of hours.
However, the EPO test may deter cheaters and encourage athletes who do not cheat that the playing field is being made more level, Pound said.
``I don't want to be too superlative, but this is a terrific sign,'' Pound said in an interview Wednesday morning.
``You end up with a double benefit''.
The IOC is conducting 2,100 out-of-competition tests in Sydney, including 300 tests for EPO.
Unannounced, out-of-competition tests are considered the only reliable way to catch cheaters.
The EPO test is a combination of a French urine test that can detect direct use of the drug for 2 or 3 days and an Australian blood test that detects indirect use.
Privately, IOC scientists say they are concerned about whether the tests will withstand legal scrutiny.
But the test can be just as valuable if it discourages athletes from using EPO for fear they might be caught, Pound said.
The Chinese rowers, who included Zhang Xiuyun, a gold medalist in the women's single scull at a World Cup race in Zurich, Switzerland, last June, were presumably subjected in China to a hematocrit test that showed high red-blood cell counts, an indirect measure of the use of EPO, Pound said.
Liu Jianyong, secretary general of the Chinese rowing federation, said the rowers had withdrawn to ``protect their health'' _ a euphemism used in drug cases _ and to ``uphold the fairness of the Olympics''.
China has publicly stated its determination to conduct more vigilant drug-testing procedures after being embarrassed repeatedly in recent years.
Unlike the former East Germany, which operated a state-sponsored system of doping, China's doping appears to be conducted largely by individual coaches, according to American coaches and drug experts.
Its female swimmers and distance runners have been far less dominant since the mid-1990s.
More than 30 Chinese swimmers were caught using drugs in the last decade, including seven at the 1994 Asian Games.
One swimmer, Yuan Yuan, was caught with 13 vials of human growth hormone, a steroid, in her luggage at the 1998 world swimming championships in Perth, Australia and four other Chinese women tested positive.
Two months ago, another female swimmer, Wu Yanyan, the world champion in the 200-meter individual medley, failed a drug test at the Chinese national championships and was banned for four years.
ATLANTA _ It's no longer a secret.
Many male athletes are supplementing their fitness techniques of chugging milk and lifting weights with performance-enhancing drugs.
The temptation also is becoming too great for some female athletes to resist.
Substances such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger boost.
_ According to the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.4 percent of female high-school students acknowledged using the illegal steroids, compared with 4.9 percent of males.
_ A survey of youngsters at four Massachusetts middle schools, published this spring in the journal Pediatrics, found that 2.6 percent of girls were users, barely behind the 2.8 percent rate for boys.
_ In his book, ``The Steroids Game,'' Penn State professor Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college athletes at 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball and 10 percent in track and field.
``When there is increased competition and more at stake,'' Yesalis said, ``potential pro outlets and potential scholarships because of Title IX, you're going to see more people willing to cheat to gain an advantage over their opponent.
``You're seeing an increased number of parents, similar with teenage boys, that get carried away.
They don't provide their kids with a moral and ethical foundation, where they know there are certain boundaries you shall not cross in pursuit of victory''.
There is no mistaking the dangers of steroids for women, with documentation provided by recent trials involving trainers and coaches from the former East German sports empire.
Heidi Krieger, 1986 European shot put champion, was given mysterious blue pills that she thought were vitamins.
She developed facial hair and a dramatically enlarged Adam's apple.
Krieger recently announced plans to sue the coaches and trainers for allegedly force-feeding her steroids without her knowledge.
Krieger had a sex-change operation and changed her first name to Andreas.
``I trusted them, but they took advantage of me,'' Krieger testified at a trial of East German officials, some of whom admitted to supplying drugs to athletes.
Some sports leaders in the former Soviet Union and, more recently, China also have incorporated steroids into building strong women's programs.
The carrot dangling in front of them is the relative newness of women's sports, which allows countries to make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics.
``We think it is easier for the women to shoot into international fame,'' said professor Tian Maijiu, vice president of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education.
Chinese officials adamantly deny existence of a state-run doping program, claiming instead that individual coaches push too hard.
The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have tested positive for steroids since 1990.
When the Chinese women's swim team arrived in Australia for the world championships in January, customs officials uncovered 13 vials labeled ``growth hormone'' in an athlete's luggage.
Four of those swimmers were banned this summer for two years.
A case study on the striking influence of steroids on women is the East German runner Marita Koch, whose 47.60 seconds for the 400 meters in 1985 is a world mark that still stands.
It turns out that Koch had been doping with Oral-Turinabol, a testosterone-based steroid, for at least four years leading up to her record run.
``Women have relatively little (testosterone) and now, with testosterone-based anabolic steroids, you can double, triple, even increase by 10 times the amount (in their bodies),'' said Jaci Van Heest, director of exercise physiology for U.S.
Swimming. ``The bang for the buck is much greater than doing it to a guy because they already have the natural amount.
``Then, you have the huge growth in women's sports, and there are a lot of issues that make it fertile ground for any kind of cheating''.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.
The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors, follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of drugs.
The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities.
And there is some doubt whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings.
``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise''.
``All of this is interwined.
The drug scandals are not separate from the bribes.
This is the modus operandi of this organization.
``It's a business, and drug use is bad for business.
So you cover it up.
You put in place a system that would hoodwink the public, hoodwink the journalists and not really catch anybody, but you can say you have a system.
The problem is, people have become wise to the PR scam''.
As Yesalis and others see it, the Olympic business is that of producing heroes and selling dreams, not exposing drug users and cheats.
Unwittingly, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch hammered home the point last summer with words to a Spanish newspaper he later had to retract.
Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful to athletes.
He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed had harmful side effects.
Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50 million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the ground.
This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an international doping agency and to commit $25 million to anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping offenders.
Former IOC member Robert Helmick said if Samaranch wanted to get rid of the drug problem he would commit at least $200 million to research.
``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert attention,'' Helmick said.
Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the independence of the agency.
On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of ``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some first-time offenders.
The suspicion has lingered for years that the IOC more inclined toward a passive tolerance of doping, with a scant few athletes testing positive, rather than a drug-free Olympics.
Under the Samaranch regime, one-tenth of 1 percent of the athletes tested positive at an Olympiad.
Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned strength-builders.
An arbitration panel threw out the disqualifications of five other athletes who tested positive for using a stimulant.
The disputed steroid samples were tested by a device known as a high-resolution mass spectrometer, which the IOC asked Atlanta Olympic organizers to purchase just months before the Games, at $500,000 each.
De Merode said the tests were declared invalid because the newness of the equipment resulted in ``technical difficulties,'' but the decision still rankles some members of the IOC medical commission.
``The medical commitee never heard any of this,'' Arne Ljungqvist said.
``Of course, it concerns me''.
Questionable drug-testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
Don Catlin, who assisted in the Atlanta lab and oversaw drug testing in LA, said that nine positive tests turned up ``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games.
Those athletes' initial ``A'' samples proved positive, but there were no tests performed on their ``B'' samples as required to ultimately confirm a positive.
The athletes were never identified.
De Merode has acknowledged that paperwork on the ``A'' tests mysteriously was removed from his room in Los Angeles at the close of the Games.
History reads that the Los Angeles Games produced 10 positive tests, not 19.
``We expected we would be doing 'B' confirmations in the ensuing months, which was the way it had been in Montreal (at the 1976 Olympics),'' Catlin said.
``That never came to pass.
Then, it came out that the codes (numbers assigned in order to conceal the athlete's identity) were somehow shredded or lost.
I don't know where they went.
All I know is there were some cases that did not go to 'B' confirmation''.
Former U.S.
Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the (U.S).
women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime in their preparation for the Games''.
None of the Americans tested positive, but the most famous drug case did break in Seoul in 1988 _ Canadian gold-medal sprinter Ben Johnson flunking a test for steroids.
In retrospect, he often is cast not just as a cheater but someone careless enough in his drug use to get caught.
In Seoul, IOC drug testers were aware of Russian sports officials operating a drug lab in a docked ship to monitor their athletes and make sure they would not be shamed by a positive test.
Catlin, who worked in the Seoul lab, said he heard about the Russian ship near the close of the Games.
He later confirmed the story in speaking with two Russian scientists who operated the lab.
``If there is shame in it, it's why the Soviets found it necessary to have a boat to check their athletes at the last minute,'' Catlin said.
``But that is not unlike the situation being revealed during the East German trials.
They did the exact same thing, and the Soviet bloc was very sensitive to these things.
.. . ``Every country, including our own, tests athletes before leaving for the Games.
But there is a difference between the practice and what is done with the results.
If you don't do anything with the positives, and the athletes go to the Games, that is wrong''.
Even in the U.S., testing is embroiled in controversy.
The U.S.
Olympic Commitee administers its own drug-testing program rather than contracting with an independent agency.
Its own advisory panel concluded that the current arrangement is a conflict because the USOC supports the same athletes financially.
Only about half of the 150-200 athletes targeted each month for random tests wind up being checked, a USOC drug-testing official acknowledged.

An over-the-counter supplement called ``andro,'' made popular when baseball slugger Mark McGwire admitted using it in 1998, raises testosterone and estrogen above normal levels and could be dangerous, according to a Harvard study financed by Major League Baseball and its players union.
However, hormone levels receded after its use was stopped.
The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels.
However, the trial lasted just one week, and did not measure whether the dietary supplement can do what its producers say it can: increase muscle size and mass.
Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement has long-term side effects.
Androstenedione is naturally produced in both men and women, and converts to either testosterone or to an estrogen.
Testosterone is the body's major muscle builder.
The pill, legal and sold over-the-counter, is banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League has no restriction regarding its use.
Little is known about andro, which became available in the United States several years ago even though it was developed in the 1970s by the East Germans to enhance their athletes' Olympic performance.
Dr. Benjamin Z.
Leder, an endocrinologist at the Harvard-affliated Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who led the study, said men showed increased testosterone levels when andro was taken for seven days in a single daily 300 milligram dose.
On the Internet, pills available are in doses of 50 to 300 milligrams.
The 42 subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily.
In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal by the following day.
Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Leder noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects.
Side effects include stunted growth for young people, increased aggressiveness, and lower levels of ``good'' cholesterol, which could increase risk of heart disease.
Men with elevated estrogen levels sometimes grow breasts and suffer shrunken testicles, while women with elevated testosterone can develop masculine traits, such as deepening of voice and extra hair.
In a eight-week study by Douglas King at Iowa State University published in JAMA last June, King found that andro caused none of the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced strength.
However, the 300 mg dosages were given in 100 mg increments three times a day.
Leder said that their study also found that 100 milligrams is too small a dose to increase testosterone levels.
``I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to take it,'' said King, associate professor of health and human performance at Iowa State.
And King warned that because the testosterone levels do not stay elevated for very long, people may take it several times a day to keep levels elevated, which could be dangerous.
For now, Major League Baseball does not plan to change its policy.
``That androstenedione, when taken in higher than suggested doses, elevates testosterone levels, appears to be a significant contribution to the science surrounding its use,'' said Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.
But he and Don Fehr, director of the players union, said that more research is needed.
Mark McGwire of the St.
Louis Cardinals has said that he has since stopped using the supplement.
While some of the professional sports leagues are still waiting for more data, their team doctors have come out against the supplement.
The Association of Professional Team Physicians, an organization comprised of team physicians of the NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL said in 1998 that it recommended androstenedione be taken off the consumer market, reclassified as a controlled substance available only by prescription, and it urged the drug be banned from competitive sports.
``The study fortifies our position,'' said Dr.
William Straw, who is the team physician for the San Jose Sharks, a National Hockey League team, and was the team physician for baseball's San Francisco Giants for 13 years.
``From a medical point of view, the study justifies physicians' concern that andro is potentially harmful, like any other anabolic steroid,'' said Straw.
``By its chemical composition, it is an anabolic steroid''.
Straw criticized drug deregulation laws in 1994 for allowing such easy access to supplements like andro.
``These things are out of control,'' said Straw.
John Brennan, spokesman of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the federal government is studying if androstenedione ``fits all the elements of a steroid, which is a banned substance''.
If andro does, then it would probably be reclassified so that it could not be taken without a doctor's prescription, said Brennan.
When Samantha Reeves, a well-regarded amateur finding her way through her freshman season on the women's professional tennis circuit, wanted to hustle herself back into shape after sustaining an ankle injury late in 1997, she said she decided to experiment with a newfangled ``all-natural'' dietary supplement, apparently on the recommendation of a friend.
The product promised to help her burn fat and build muscle, and it was readily available over the counter at health-food stores.
It sounded like the answer to her prayers: a training and diet aid that would help her get fit fast and get back to the business of cracking the top 100 in women's tennis.
Instead, Reeves' decision to use the product backfired badly.
Required to submit a urine sample at an event last December as part of tennis' effort to detect improper drug use, Reeves failed the test.
The dietary product, it turned out, had contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport.
And so Reeves, despite her argument that she had no intention of taking anything aimed at improperly aiding her performance, became the first female tennis player ever to have tested positive for steroids.
``I have never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis career,'' Reeves said in a statement that her family released after her test result was made public this summer.
The International Tennis Federation, which governs the sport, ultimately did not suspend or otherwise discipline Reeves, who was ranked No.
1 in the U.S.
Girls 18's in 1996, is currently ranked 106th in the world, and is undecided about whether to accept a college scholarship or turn pro.
Citing her age _ she turned 19 earlier this year _ and inexperience, and apparently accepting her claim that she was unaware of the presence of steroids in the product, the ITF instead called the long and embarrassing ordeal of testing, investigation and public disclosure ``a sanction in itself''.
ITF spokesman Alun James said the investigation ``proved Reeves guilty of taking the banned substance and, although the decision against any further punishment is arguably lenient, if caught again, she could face a life ban as a second offender''.
Reeves' case highlights a little discussed but troubling question for tennis: With the easy availability of illicit steroids, and the simultaneous explosion of fitness and muscle-building products that are sold legally but often with little warning about what they contain, how many players are trying to gain an inappropriate edge?
Only one other player, Ignacio Truyol of Spain, has ever been formally detected of having used steroids.
Can tennis fairly and effectively police such use and the cheating _ either brazen or accidental _ that results?
``Tennis is a sport I would not have thought would be steroid-involved, but there's tons of steroids out there these days, and they're not all coming from the black market,'' said Dr.
Alan Jones, a pharmaceutics professor at the University of Mississippi who acts as the toxicology consultant for the company that administers drug testing for the men's ATP and women's WTA tours and for the ITF.
Jones said numerous high-tech or nouveau steroids are being marketed as simple food supplements and training aids and sold everywhere from the Internet to health-food stores.
``It's conceivable that a player could be oblivious to the fact that they're using something that contains an anabolic substance,'' Jones said.
``They think: It's natural, it's pure, it's good for me.
And that is an absolute fallacy''.
Considering the plethora of legal products, such as creatine, available to athletes looking to boost their endurance, maximize their workouts and stave off flab, athletes subject to drug testing evidently cannot be too careful about what they ingest.
Whether in the guise of vitamins, hormone supplements or food additives, there is apparently a synthetically engineered anabolic look-alike out there for everyone, whether the athletes are looking to raise a barbell or their tennis ranking.
While less invasive than the EPO-type injectables that recently tarnished cycling's Tour de France, or the substances currently muddying the reputation of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruin, anabolics such as norandrolone, which is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, are far from benign.
And once these legal additives break down in the system, a steroid by any other name tends to turn into a steroid.
The Nor-Andro 19 in the supplement Reeves chose is a product that, according to Jones, ``is the new kid on the block, the popular one right now.
It's not a testosterone type of steroid, and the labs originally weren't testing for it.
It's offered as a food supplement and marketed as a performance and training enhancer that increases muscle strength, mass and endurance''.
Jones did say he was unaware of the product's ever having been marketed as a weight-loss product.
Tennis has stepped up its testing and the detection efforts of its anti-doping program, which is modeled on the one used by the International Olympic Committee.
The ITF, in conjunction with the WTA and ATP tours, conducts roughly 1,000 tests each year, all of them random and 10 percent of them in locations other than the site of tournaments.
The cost to the three tennis organizations is approximately $500,000 per year, and so far, the only other player found guilty of using steroids is the 23-year-old Truyol, who said he took them on the advice of his physician when recovering from an injury.
``No sport is immune anymore,'' said Dr.
Donna Smith of Substance Abuse Management, the company that administers tennis' anti-doping program.
``Wherever you have issues of injury recovery and athletes intent on maximizing their training, you're going to see this stuff.
``Our window of detection is small, because most of these products clear the system within five days, and although we'd like to do more off-site testing, it's prohibitively expensive.
You always feel like you're one step behind''.
nn According to the Reeves family, Samantha's use of the steroid was purely accidental.
The only people more surprised than the player herself were her parents, Jack and Jill Reeves.
Their teen-age daughter was fixated on losing weight, Jack Reeves said, and, unbeknownst to him and his wife, bought the supplement.
When the family was notified, by fax, of the positive test and was asked to provide a record of every medication Samantha had ingested, steroids were not initially revealed as the culprit behind the positive reading, Jack Reeves said.
Then came a phone call that informed them of the source of the positive result: The illegal nandrolone metabolites in her system were traced to Nor-Andro 19.
Just after the conclusion of Wimbledon last month, the ITF announced that Reeves had tested positive for anabolic steroids.
``We thought it was good news that they'd figured out how the stuff got into her system; we thought that was the end of it,'' said Jack Reeves, who would not permit his daughter to be interviewed.
``Then we were told the review board had decided to pursue the case and test a second sample.
It's a kind of guilty-until-proven-innocent process where you're dealing with a lot of nameless, faceless parties.
They do hold a player responsible for whatever is in their system, and they're not particularly interested in how it got there.
You'd have to be a molecular biologist to know this would occur.
``It's been a very troublesome, frustrating experience; tennis is such a mental game, and this has put a lot of extra pressure on her,'' he said.
``These days, Samantha won't drink a glass of water without having it analyzed''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) The Reeves had allowed their daughter to leave high school in Wisconsin for Dennis Van Der Meer's Tennis Academy in Hilton Head, S.C., after she was selected for the U.S.
Tennis Association National Junior Team in 1995 and '96.
Then, her parents let her take a year off between high school graduation in 1997 and college to test the waters on the circuit while retaining her college eligibility.
They had expected to spend the first half of 1998 monitoring their daughter's progress on the WTA Tour; instead, they spent it helping her weather the six-month investigation by the ITF's anti-doping panel.
In addition to being the first female tennis player ever to fail a drug test of any sort, Reeves is also the first player to fail a test but escape the mandatory one-year suspension for players found guilty of using a Class One banned substance.
On the men's side, Truyol was suspended for a year in January 1997, and Mats Wilander and Karel Novacek were previously fined and suspended after testing positive for cocaine.
If only two players have tested positive after thousands of tests, does it mean that tennis can rest assured it has no steroid problem?
Some players say no.
Jim Courier, who trained his way to the No.
1 ranking and four Grand Slam singles championships without steroid shortcuts, said: ``If being big and strong were the main criteria for being a good player, then weight lifters would be the best.
But I can see where this stuff might help out some of the more slight guys, because it can make you train like an animal.
``No one worked harder on their training than I did, and it disgusts me to think I may have lost matches to guys who've been juicing and cycling it out of their systems in time for competition,'' he said.
``Boris Becker once said that if he knew for sure everybody else was using steroids, then he would too; well, not me.
I don't want kidney problems at 45''.
Courier recalled a poll of Olympians that asked whether the athletes would take a drug that guaranteed them a medal even if it also guaranteed terminal health trouble by mid-life: ``I guess it's the James Dean thing, live fast, die young, leave a beautiful corpse _ and a gold medal''.
Debbie Graham, a WTA Tour veteran, said: ``I think there's a lot of it going on because of the pressures in women's sports, and not just to win.
There's a lot of pressure for a woman to look fit in front of a crowd''.
As far as Samantha Reeves is concerned, she continued to play sporadically this year and Tuesday received a wild-card berth for the U.S.
Open later this month.
``I'm anxious to put the entire experience behind me,'' she said in a statement she gave to the U.S.
Tennis Association.
Truyol, whose suspension ended in January, has not returned to the ATP Tour and no longer holds a ranking.
Experts who study the effects of synthetic anabolic steroids are encouraged, for two distinctly different reasons, that two new trials of their use show a benefit for two groups of very sick people.
One reason is the possible long-term benefits for the patients.
But the other is that the trials may serve as a reminder of whom the drugs were not intended for: healthy people who use them in ways that can destroy their health.
The trials, reported last week, found that taking anabolic steroids helped kidney dialysis patients and people with HIV regain some of the weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result of their illnesses.
Dr. Gary Wadler, an anabolic-steroid authority at New York University Medical Center, points out that the first widespread use of the drug came after World War II for people who were wasting away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in concentration camps.
It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance.
The latter include baseball's new home-run king, Mark McGwire, who says he regularly takes androstenedione, a precursor steroid that quickly becomes anabolic once taken into the body.
Professional baseball, unlike other sports, has not banned this substance.
Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
These steroids are synthesized from human testosterone, the hormone responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle tissue, facial hair and a deep voice.
Testosterone's effect as a muscle builder was discovered more than 100 years ago by the French physician Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard, who in 1889 injected animal extracts into a dog and then into himself.
At the time, he hypothesized that added testosterone would be good for human health.
``Brown-Sequard overinterpreted what was happening, but he turned out to be onto something, as history has shown,'' Wadler said.
The synthetic forms of testosterone were designed to replace the body's normal supply of the hormone, which can be depleted by disease, and to help the patient regain strength, Wadler said in ``Drugs and the Athlete'' (Oxford Press), regarded as the definitive textbook on the subject.
Dr. Peter Goldberg, a consulting physician for the U.S.
Olympic Committee, expressed similar concern about the expanding use of steroids, especially among teen-agers.
Adolescent females are now the fastest growing group of users.
With a colleague, Dr.
Diane Elliot, Goldberg recently completed a program for 3,200 athletes in 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington among whom steroid use was reduced by a reported 50 percent.
In the clinical trials of anabolic steroids for kidney-dialysis and HIV patients, low doses were used to reverse previously uncontrollable weight loss, which has been associated with sharply reduced life spans among these groups.
The patients, in the two separate studies reported last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association, were given the steroids in conjunction with exercise programs.
Both groups of patients increased muscle mass significantly more than a group given a placebo, and increased their abilities to do more exercise faster while becoming less fatigued.
More studies are needed to determine how much and for how long steroids can be safely used, the doctors who directed the studies said.
But they pointed out that the doses used by the athletes were much higher.
Weighing medical uses against the uses to enhance athletic performance, those who take steroids must ask: What is a safe dose and when does a dose become dangerous?
The second question is being urgently studied at a number of major institutions.
In the meantime, Wadler said, all science really knows on the subject is this: It has been found safe to increase the amount of testosterone or testosterone substitute to the normal level among sick people whose supply has become depleted.
But at some level above this, the substitutes can have disastrous results.
The list of problems doctors cite is very long: liver tumors, uncontrollably violent behavior, elevated cholesterol, enlarged veins in the liver that cause fatal bleeding, permanent stunting of growth in adolescents, and blood clotting that leads to premature stroke and heart attacks.
The list of less serious but nevertheless undesirable effects is also long and includes large breasts in men and beards in women.
SEATTLE _ Mark McGwire's record-setting home run race made 1998 a banner year for baseball and sports in general.
But it also made it a banner year for an issue far more serious and potentially devastating: athletes using performance-enhancing substances to build bigger and stronger bodies.
McGwire's admission that he used two supplements, creatine and androstenedione or ``andro,'' suddenly put new light on a decades-old battle to stem the use of anabolic steroids and other so-called ergogenic aids in athletic competition.
With McGwire's admission has come a new set of concerns: (BBOX)That more young athletes will attempt to use supplements as a way of improving performance, fitness and recovery from injuries, instead of building body strength naturally.
(BBOX)That the supplements will be lumped together and considered to be medically sound simply because they are available over the counter or via mail order.
(BBOX)That policies such as the University of Washington's to administer creatine to athletes might some day create great liability if medical complications are found in the future.
(BBOX)That while creatine is considered medically safe, andro is considered to be an anabolic steroid that can lead to several potentially life-threatening diseases.
Linking the two and using both without proper medical supervision could prove dangerous.
While McGwire will go down in the history books as the unqualified home run champion for a single season, other athletes who used similar substances last year faced far different repercussions.
Most recently, Petr Korda was forced to forfeit his rankings points and $94,529 in prize money from Wimbledon after the International Tennis Federation found he tested positive for an anabolic steroid.
His attempt to defend his 1998 Australian Open title ended over the weekend, but his appearance stirred controversy among his fellow players, who question how Korda could have been allowed to compete.
Despite warnings from the medical community and ethical questions about unfair competition, athletes like McGwire and Korda are big-name indicators that supplements have become ingrained at all levels in the world of athletics.
``We can easily blame ourselves and society for putting professional and high-level collegiate athletes on such a pedestal that it's going to influence our high school athletes,'' said Dr.
Mark S.
Juhn of the University of Washington's Primary Care Center Sports Medicine Clinic.
``I think that's a shame, but it's reality''.
According to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
Supplement use appears to be starting at younger ages.
A study published in May by the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 3 percent of boys and girls at four Massachusetts middle schools were using anabolic steroids to build bigger bodies for sports.
``It's ubiquitous, there's no doubt about that,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor of health and human development who has written a book on the subject, ``The Steroids Game''.
McGwire's admitted use makes him ``a very poor role model for kids, and he can argue that it's legal to buy in society, but that's merely a loophole in the laws.
He can say anything he wants, but it's a drug''.
Patrick Olsen, president of the Washington Vocational Sports Medicine Association and the head athletic trainer at South Kitsap High School, has seen the problem first-hand and believes McGwire's admission has only clouded the issue.
``Anyone who wants to be good at whatever they do has some sort of a hero.
And if their hero is using (a performance supplement), then they will be more susceptible to it,'' Olsen said.
``They think, `This can't hurt me because I don't have to have a prescription for it'.
They fail to realize that you can buy arsenic too, but you wouldn't want to use it''.
The issue becomes all the more confusing to the average young athlete because creatine and andro are two entirely different supplements.
Creatine is an amino acid powder found naturally in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, testes and other tissues.
It is classified as a dietary supplement that enhances muscle growth and weight gain, and not a drug.
``Creatine is acceptable, and it does enhance performance,'' Yesalis said.
``Although, if you could get the proper dose of creatine in the food supply, why would anybody pay for it?
It will cost you $40 to $50 a month''.
Andro, on the other hand, is considered an anabolic steroid because taken as a pill it raises the level of the male hormone testosterone, and users claim it builds muscle mass and helps speed recovery from sports-related injuries.
Because it is still available at many vitamin stores, mail-order businesses and Internet suppliers, andro is not considered an illegal substance by major league baseball or the NBA, which ban only illegal drugs.
Because of the controversy surrounding McGwire's use of andro, baseball commissioner Bud Selig and players union head Donald Fehr have appointed a committee to study whether it should be banned, but the committee has yet to reach a conclusion.
Andro, however, already has been banned by the International Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the ATP tennis tour, and the NFL has banned its use since 1996, primarily because it can be classified with other steroids.
While the method of taking the steroid is far different from the injections athletes once used, many experts believe the basic health repercussions are the same: excessive acne, shrinkage of the testicles or uterus, and potentially life-threatening ailments such as liver damage, premature heart disease and cancer.
While McGwire can set the home run record using andro, other athletes haven't been so lucky.
Gold medal shot-putter Randy Barnes, the world-record holder, drew a lifetime ban last year for testing positive for andro.
And in September, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Paul Wiggins was suspended for four games after admitting he used the substance.
Use of creatine, however, hasn't yet been banned by any sports organization, although there is plenty of debate about its effects and potential long-term health risks.
``Some of our athletes have been using creatine for three years or so,'' South Kitsap's Olsen said.
``It's not something we supply, it's not something we tell our kids they have to be on.
They go out to their own people and do their own thing on it''.
Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and because so many athletes endorse its use.
At the University of Washington, strength and conditioning coach Rick Huegli said creatine has been dispensed to many athletes under his direct supervision, with little or no apparent ill effects.
``It enhances the short-term burst energy system,'' Huegli said, adding that most of the benefit comes during weightlifting training, rather than in on-field performance.
Huegli advises athletes to begin a program of better nutrition and training without the use of supplements before trying anything like creatine.
But he says athletes will always be tempted to use supplements because it ``helps them recover better and train longer and harder''.
In the past, Huegli said the UW would dispense a one-month supply of creatine to any athlete who wanted to use it, but the school has recently discontinued the practice for fear of liability should an athlete develop a medical problem in the future.
Athletes now must buy their own supply.
It's not hard to find young athletes who have used creatine.
One high school football player, Brian, of Mountlake Terrace, said he began using the supplement last year in an attempt to build more muscle mass and help him during offseason weight training.
He learned about creatine from other players who were using it on a regular basis.
But after experiencing some weight gain, he soon decided that the expense wasn't worth the results he was seeing.
``I just felt that it was better to do it naturally,'' he said.
Another high school football player, a 17-year-old from Edmonds, still uses creatine and says he grew from 167 pounds to 190 pounds in about six months after using the supplement and increasing his workouts.
``It doesn't work unless you also work harder, but it helps you work harder,'' he said.
The medical jury still is out on creatine, but it appears to be far safer than an anabolic steroid or a product such as andro.
However, there are few studies on its effects on adolescents, and none on long-term effects.
``It's very difficult to separate fact from hype when it comes to creatine,'' said Juhn of UW's sports medicine clinic.
``Creatine has some potential, but people have this underlying assumption that it works for everything, but it doesn't''.
For example, it doesn't help sprinters or distance people in track or swimming, said Juhn, who recently published a study on potential side effects of creatine in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine.
Juhn says the weight gain associated with creatine is largely due to water storage.
``The big issue is, in the long-term, does creatine improve strength?
That's up for debate right now,'' he said.
With concern being voiced by doctors such as Juhn, trainers like Olsen are all the more wary of its potential for abuse.
``There's no long-term study done on creatine, so you have no information from 10 years out,'' Olsen said.
From the information he has seen, Olsen believes there are several reasons to beware of the supplement: dehydration, possible kidney problems and cost.
He reports some young athletes spend hundreds of dollars on the product with minimal results.
Compared to andro or other steroids, creatine ``is probably the least harmful, but in 10 years you might have some kid who took three or four times the normal dose and find it was overworking the kidneys or something like that,'' Olsen said.
``If you get a symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road, how do you relate that back to their creatine use''?
There have been some benefits, Olsen said, noting some athletes have gained 10 to 15 pounds in weight and muscle mass.
``But once they get off of it, they lose maybe half that weight,'' he said.
``It takes so much water to digest that protein''.
Juhn notes that creatine is found not only in muscles, but in the brain, the heart, the liver and testicles.
``We haven't really studied what taking oral levels of creatine does to creatine levels elsewhere,'' he said.
``I'm saying we don't know.
... For all we know, creatine might be the safest thing in the world, but we haven't proven that''.
Olsen says he doesn't know of any of his athletes who are currently taking andro, but he's convinced that many kids are trying it.
``I bet if you talk to kids, most would say they're not scared by it,'' he said.
``It's the idea, would you trade a gold medal if you could only live five years?
Yeah, give me the gold medal''.
Yesalis believes there will always be some new product on the market that will attract athletes.
One is human growth hormone, which is used as an ergogenic supplement by body builders and has such a short half-life it is nearly impossible to detect by standard drug-testing methods.
Yesalis contends that many athletes who use creatine or andro do so to mask their hidden use of human growth hormone to build even bigger bodies.
``Some athletes have been using creatine and andro as a smokescreen for their use of other more potent supplements,'' he said.
With so many athletes using such products, there might be no way to turn back the tide short of drug testing at every level of athletics.
``I'm disturbed by the emphasis put on supplements when we should be thinking about the most proven method of enhancing athletic performance, which is dedication, perseverance, hard work and practice,'' Juhn said.
``It's really discouraging, what's happening now.''
HOUSTON _ During a U.S.
Gymnastics meet last March in Baytown, Texas, a teen-age contestant approached one of the visiting members of the Olympic team and asked what he could do to gain strength.
``Lift weights,'' he was told.
``And eat your Wheaties''.
``Wheaties''? ``Special Wheaties,'' the older gymnast said, with a grin and a wink.
The teen-ager asked no more questions.
He understood the coded message: steroids.
Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the 1956 Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the health hazards they pose.
Last month, Olympic shot-put champion Randy Barnes tested positive _ for the second time in his career _ for performance-enhancing banned substances.
Also failing his steroid test, at about the same time, was Olympic sprinter Dennis Mitchell, a bronze medalist in 1992.
Anabolic (which means ``building'') steroids were made illegal in the United States in 1990, except with medical prescription.
They are designed to imitate testosterone or to stimulate its production.
Testosterone, a male sex hormone (also found in small amounts in women), induces growth of skeletal muscles.
But at the dosage levels needed to build muscle, the steroids put so much strain on the liver, kidneys and heart that the athlete risks death before the age of 50.
Pro football star Lyle Alzado and many weightlifting competitors of the 1970s died young, ravaged by tumors and cardiac disease.
Dr. Bill Bryan of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in Houston believes steroid use has declined in the past decade.
But he said, ``Once you get into the elite levels of athletics, the least bit of performance enhancement becomes important, and those people will try all the tricks''.
This summer, the sport of bicycle racing has been scandalized by EPO, which stands for erythropoietin (eri-throw-poy-i-tin).
This is a steroid that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles.
EPO is a significant performance enhancer for endurance athletes, such as five Tour de France bicyclists who recently disqualified themselves by admitting use of the banned substance.
Dr. Gerald Gremion, after resigning his position of consultant for Swiss bicycle teams, said ``almost all'' the Tour de France cyclists use performance-enhancing drugs.
He told reporters in Europe: ``Each racer had his little suitcase with dopes and syringes''.
&QL; FOILING TESTS &QL; &QL; Like other steroids, EPO has legitimate medical purposes, when used in moderate amounts.
A protein-carbohydrate compound, EPO is helpful in treating kidney disease, AIDS and cancer.
But it is dangerous when taken in dosages large enough to affect performance in a marathon run or a bicycle race.
``The problem,'' said Dr.
Kenneth Renney of Sports Medicine Associates in Houston, ``is that you don't know exactly how much to use and what the effects are.
If you get too many blood cells, you can get sluggish, and the blood thickens''.
That leaves athletes at risk of blood-clotting, stroke and heart attacks.
In the past 20 years, EPO has been implicated in more than two dozen deaths in cycling.
EPO usually goes undetected because tests cannot distinguish between the hormone produced by the kidneys from the laboratory version.
But when blood tests reveal an excessive percentage of red blood cells, the athlete is presumed to be using EPO illegally and is suspended for two weeks.
EPO is one of at least 20 anabolic steroids prohibited by the International Olympics Committee.
New ones are constantly being invented.
No sooner is one blacklisted than another emerges to confound drug testers.
Many Olympic athletes try to foil the tests by using masking agents or a new batch of difficult-to-trace water-based steroids.
Renney, a crew chief of the U.S.
Olympic drug-testing committee, said, ``There's no masking agent that will keep steroids from being detected.
That's why some athletes fail the test.
But they can use diuretics that will get the steroids out of their system quickly, and they can use some new steroids that are water-based, that clear the body a lot faster that the oil-based ones''.
Bryan said tests will be developed that will make it more difficult for athletes to cheat with steroids.
``A Japanese company is developing biological markers that will detect the steroids people are taking,'' he said.
``The technology may be at that level to test the athletes at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
We'll be able to shut down the use of anabolic steroids significantly''.
Until then, many athletes engage in a delicate balancing act, trying to take as many hormone supplements as they can _ legal and illegal _ without exceeding the limits of red blood count or the 6-to-1 ratio between testosterone and its metabolic breakdown product of epitestosterone.
&QL; THE ADDICTION &QL; &QL; Dr.
Greg Hoover, a sports medicine specialist in Houston, said new products allow athletes to fine-tune the testosterone level.
``Some athletes are using testosterone patches that release the testosterone into the body at a gradual, lower dose,'' he said, ``like a Nicorette patch''.
Renney explained that the testosterone limit was set to take into account that ``everyone is going to have some type of level of anabolic steroids, since they are found naturally in the body''.
Although men generally have a testosterone/epi ratio of 3 to 1 or 4 to 1, some are naturally as high as 6 to 1.
``Most people could take anabolic steroids and still be within that approved level,'' Renney said.
``You can look at the tests, and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing you can do about it''.
Mitchell, ironically a vocal opponent of steroids, tested over the limit.
Barnes, who formerly competed for Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station, Texas, was cited for using androstenedione, which is found in wild yams and is legal in the United States and most other countries but has been banned from Olympic competition because of its steroidlike qualities.
While Olympic athletes, such as Barnes and Mitchell, occasionally slip up and get caught, Renney said, ``If they want to do it, they're going to find a way to beat the system''.
It would be naive to think anabolic steroids have been eradicated from the National Football League, which has a limited drug-testing program, or from Major League Baseball, which has no drug-testing program at all.
Since possession of anabolic steroids is illegal, no big-leaguers admit, on the record, to using them.
But some say, anonymously, that about 30 percent of the hitters include them in their muscle-building program.
Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, said, ``There was one kid, 27, who was cycling steroids, and I asked him, `Do you realize you could need an artificial heart when you're 40 years old'?
``He said, `I don't care what happens at 40.
All I want to do is be the biggest, baddest guy I can be right now'''.
That was the thinking of Mike Spinelli, a 1995 fourth-round draft choice of the Boston Red Sox, who began ingesting steroids at 18.
In two years, Spinelli's 6-2 frame filled out from 180 to 245 pounds.
But he did not pitch well: 4-10 with a 5.57 ERA in two minor-league seasons.
Aware that he was addicted to steroids, Spinelli checked himself into the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota last February.
``I just thank God I was able to get out of this,'' he said, ``before it killed me''.
&QL; &QL; THE TEMPTATION &QL; &QL; Athletes _ and even nonathletes _ much younger than Spinelli have been turning to steroids.
A report by the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Abuse estimates that half a million Americans under the age of 18 are using illegal steroids.
A recent survey of 965 pupils in Massachusetts middle schools found that 2.7 percent admitted to using anabolic steroids, with the percentages almost the same for girls as for boys.
Some were as young as 10 years old.
Apparently, parents are buying these substances on the black market and passing them on to their athlete children.
But studies also have shown that about 40 percent of the high school students using steroids are doing so not to compete in sports but to improve their appearance.
Charles Yesalis, a Ph.D. at Penn State University, recently reported that about 1 percent of girls in grades eight through 12 have used anabolic hormones _ a 100 percent increase by this group since 1996.
Among teen-age males, steroid use had remained stable at about 4 percent.
Such figures dismay Garner, who has seen the alarming effects of steroids on men in their 20s.
``You'd see guys suddenly add a lot of muscle,'' Garner said.
``They'd say, `I'm just lifting weights'.
But then you'd see them tear up phone booths at night and lift cars at odd hours, and you'd say, `You're doing something else'''.
Garner understands the temptation.
``You realize you can't compete against somebody doing steroids,'' he said.
``They're faster, quicker, stronger''.
In 1988, he looked to steroids as a means of delaying the end of his playing career.
He thought they might help him regain the 10 pounds of muscle mass he had lost after back surgery.
``I only knew one player who had done steroids at that time, and I talked with him about using them to put muscle back on,'' Garner said.
``But I had some friends who were doctors, and they told me, `You might have heart disease in 10 years'''.
He decided he didn't want to sacrifice years of life for a few extra glory days.
``But the kids today''? he said.
``I don't know if they're thinking about the future''.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) --Two Moroccan female athletes have been stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an official said Friday.
Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee.
A second Moroccan, Karima Shaheen, will also lose the bronze medal for the women's discus throw, Kazem said.
Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests --including several at the Pan American Games and even others announced this week in advance of the World Championships.
Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig.
``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem said.
``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field events.
No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said.
He said most gold medal winners were tested.
Suspicions about Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters.
The track and field events were held Aug.
11-14 while the games formally opened on Aug.
15 for other events.
On Wednesday, 39-year-old Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey withdrew from the World Championships after testing positive for Nandrolone.
In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers tarnished by positive tests.
Kazem said Hanifi and Shaheen have the right to appeal.
The Arab Games' Steriods Committee does not have the jurisdiction to ban athletes.
Bans imposed by international organizations range between two months and life.
The head of the games' executive committee, Sari Hamdan, rejected accusations that the organizers were victimizing Moroccan athletes.
``We don't accuse athletes falsely and we don't accuse the country of working with steroids.
We have 100 percent confidence in the tests and everything has been conducted according to the international rules and regulations,'' Hamdan said.
Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon.
Twelve athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.
Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports, working to achieve a fashionable lean-but-muscular look or suffering from a deep psychological disorder, teen-age girls are using illegal anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers, health authorities say.
The increased usage among girls, which some researchers attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia, has caught up to levels that began to be established by boys in the 1980s.
And steroid use, researchers say, exposes girls to the same severe health risks, but with the added potential of destroying their ability to bear children.
The National Institutes of Drug Abuse says about 175,000 teen-age girls in the United States have reported taking anabolic steroids at least once within a year of the time surveyed _ a rise of 100 percent since 1991.
The surveys, by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the Youth Risk and Behavior Survey System, were done in schools or the home through anonymous self-reported questionnaires.
Dr. Lloyd D.
Johnston, director of the Michigan project, which has been conducting annual youth surveys since 1975, said the actual number of users may actually be higher than the most recent surveys show, since people tend to underreport drug use.
The rate among teen-age boys has also continued to rise, to the current estimated level of 325,000.
Other indications, including the results of a small study in Oregon, are that steroid use among both girls and boys is increasing unabated.
The three national surveys were conducted before Mark McGwire set baseball's single-season home run record last year, acknowledging that he used androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone, to help him build muscle.
Whether androstenedione, which is allowed in professional baseball but banned in other sports, does in fact build muscles remains a matter of medical dispute, though the perception of many athletes, both adult and adolescent, is that it does.
In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids.
``I get calls every day from the coaches and parents of girls as well as boys,'' said Dr.
Linn Goldberg, a physician at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and a United States Olympic Committee drug testing official.
``Some are concerned and some want to know whether their children should use androstenedione''.
His answer is an unequivocal no, either to use of steroids or androstenedione.
Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice.
The hormone exists in females as well, though in much smaller amounts.
Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages.
The health damages might not appear for years or decades after the steroids are taken, said Dr.
Gary I.
Wadler, a professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine.
Dr. Charles E.
Yesalis, a steroid authority at Pennsylvania State University, was among the first to analyze the 1997 female-adolescent data in December of that year in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and to sound the alarm.
Most prevention programs, he said recently, have not been effective.
``I am asked to speak in schools and other institutions,'' Yesalis said, ``but you don't get anywhere with speeches or charts or film clips or posters.
We know one-shot messages don't work''.
Goldberg said teen-age boys and girls generally obtain illegal steroids from people who congregate at commercial gyms.
``That's where most people say they obtain them,'' Goldberg said.
``Someone, in this part of the country, will go down to Mexico, where it is easy to get the stuff, and bring it back, either in pill form or injectables''.
And then one young person will buy some and distribute them to his or her schoolmates, he said.
The new interest among teen-age girls, these and other health experts say, reflect a gradual change in attitude, and fashion, or teen-age peer pressure, away from a preoccupation with thinness.
Some teen-age girls now desire to look more healthy and somewhat more muscular, but this has led some girls toward an unhealthy compulsion to be ever fitter with larger muscles.
``We've gone from the overweight beauty of the Rubens women, to the thin rail of the Twiggy types and now back to something in between, the lean but muscular type,'' Wadler said.
``These are people who are virtually addicted to the mirror.
But they will never be satisfied with what they see, and this is now happening to teen-age girls who want bigger muscles no matter how much bigger their muscles have become''.
Dr. Harrison G.
Pope Jr.
, chief of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory of Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital, and colleagues referred to a similar disorder in male weight lifters as ``reverse anorexia'' after it was observed in 1993.
The researchers recently updated the work with a study of 32 women bodybuilders, 17 of whom showed signs of an emotional disorder called body dysmorphism, which is the excessive preoccupation with a trait or traits of the body viewed as ugly or defective whether they are or not.
Several women in the study were so addicted to working out that they cut off job opportunities and close personal relationships.
But Pope said too little research had been done on this emerging obsession among teen-age girls to draw specific conclusions about its complex causes.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The case of one of the worst known adverse reactions to steroid use, reported by Goldberg, is that of a 19-year-old West Coast woman who was preparing to enter her first bodybuilding contest, lifting weights and eating a high-protein diet.
She then switched to a drastically reduced intake of food and water.
Obsessed with her goal, she began taking anabolic steroids and a diuretic.
The steroid would add muscle and the diuretic would drain the body of fluid and make the muscle stand out more.
She won the contest, but it will probably be her last.
After she collected her trophy, she resumed drinking water and eating normally, and her weight shot up by 25 pounds in three days.
It turned out that the diuretic had masked the actual amount of muscle she had built up, said Goldberg, who was one of a group of health experts who reviewed the case.
When she drank more fluids, he said, her muscles pushed out to the full over-developed size and crushed blood vessels in her legs.
Called compartment syndrome, the condition put her limbs, if not her life, in danger, and surgeons had to cut open both legs to protect her vascular system and remove significant amounts of the new muscle tissue.
Goldberg and Dr.
Diane L.
Elliot hope to educate girls about the dangers of steroid use as they have done with boys.
They recently completed a program, called Atlas, that is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and is aimed at reducing steroid use among young male athletes.
A main element of the program, involving 3,200 male athletes at 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington, was to teach the students to educate one another on the problems.
The number of male students that reported having used steroids within a year was cut by 50 percent.
Under another National Institute of Drug Abuse grant, they are developing a similar program for girls.
Yesalis said the Goldberg-Elliot program was the only one he knew of that worked.
``Unless young people are taught to know where and how to draw the line, to know that it's not right to try to win at all costs, they're not going to listen when you tell them steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning,'' he said.
SAN FRANCISCO _ The threatened red-legged frog, which is believed to be the inspiration for Mark Twain's short story ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is about to get extra protection from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
Bowing to an order from U.S.
District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, the agency on Friday proposed that 5.4 million acres in 31 California counties be designated as a critical habitat for the frog.
``It's the biggest area that we've ever designated in California,'' said Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Patricia Foulk.
The red-legged frog reaches 5 inches in length and is the largest native frog in the West.
It breeds in wetlands, streams, ponds and stock ponds, but its historic range has diminished by 70 percent.
Just four areas in the state harbor more than 350 adult red-legged frogs.
The entire San Mateo County coast and most of West Marin, where some of the largest populations of red-legged frogs live, are designated as a critical habitat in the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal.
Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal permits _ usually from the Army Corps of Engineers _ for their projects.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has to sign off on those permits, attesting that the development will not have an adverse effect on the threatened species, as defined by the Endangered Species Act.
Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity in Berkeley, said that a major pressure point where development and the red-legged frog may collide is in Contra Costa County where several big subdivisions along Danville and Tassajara creeks are in the works.
Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Foulk said that designating a critical habitat for a threatened or endangered species isn't the same as establishing a preserve for it.
The agency can fine developers who knowingly trash a critical habitat, but as a practical matter, she said, mitigation measures such as altering the footprint of a development, or the land on which a building will be constructed, usually satisfy the agency's concerns.
Even though it is less of a protective measure than environmentalists would like, ``it's a positive step and might bring about the recovery of a listed species,'' Miller said.
The red-legged frog was listed as threatened in 1996 under the Endangered Species Act.
At that time, the Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that designating a critical habitat was ``not prudent,'' because it would not benefit the species and might make it more vulnerable to habitat vandalism and unauthorized collection.
Alsup disagreed.
Joining the Center for Biological Diversity as a plaintiff in the complaint against the Fish and Wildlife Service were the Jumping Frog Research Institute of Calaveras County and the Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation.
KUNMING, September 24 (Xinhua) --Local sources report that effective protection has been introduced to the Beihai Wetlands, Tengchong County, the only natural reserve of its kind in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge sewage and conserve water, according to experts.
Wetlands are thus ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild plants and waterfowl.
The Beihai Wetlands Reserve covers about 2,000 hectares and is divided into two major sections --Beihai Marshland and Qinghai Lake, a freshwater lake used for irrigation.
The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and bird species, and is the winter home for well over 1,000 migratory birds.
The Beihai Wetlands were placed under state protection in 1992, and Tengchong County has established a special agency and issued wide-ranging regulations to protect the area.
Planned afforestation has been carried out in the reserve and surrounding areas in recent years, with strict regulations in place to prohibit poaching.
The local governments at all levels have also extended great efforts to teach people to cherish the natural environment and protect wild animals and plants.
DENVER (AP) --The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to immediately begin efforts to restore a half-acre of wetlands illegally filled during construction of a dirt logging road.
It was just the latest episode in Vail Resorts' decades-long effort to complete a $14 million expansion project.
Environmental activists have set fires at the resort and recently lost a legal challenge over the expansion project's affect on wildlife, specifically the habitat of the lynx.
The logging road, built last fall to move heavy equipment and remove trees from the ski resort's new 885-acre area, was discovered earlier this year by U.S.
Forest Service employees.
Forest Service officials said it was causing excess sediment to flow into a water source below, and they ordered it closed in July.
The Army Corps of Engineers determined the road had violated the federal Clean Water Act.
If the EPA agrees, it could fine Vail up to $27,500 a day.
In 1996, Telluride ski area was fined $1.1 million for destroying 17 acres of wetlands.
The EPA on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to ``take action now'' to stabilize and winterize the road to protect the wetlands from further damage.
The order requires the road remained closed and sets an August 31 deadline to complete restoration.
Vail Resorts spokesman Porter Wharton III said recently that construction of the road over the wetlands was an honest mistake.
The road was realigned to miss one wetlands parcel and inadvertently affected another, he said.
CHANGSHA, December 11 (Xinhua) --Finland has agreed to help central China's Hunan Province improve biodiversity protection, environmental education, subtropical forestry and wetlands protection, according to provincial officials.
The province and Finland have established a cooperative committee and work plan focusing on environmental protection.
Finland and Hunan have cooperated in nature protection projects for over a decade.
Finland has funded a number of environmental protection projects in the province, and has exhibited special interest in flora and fauna protection programs.
HEFEI, December 16 (Xinhua) --East China's Anhui Province is working to seek international cooperation for protecting local wetland resources, which are shrinking in size and deteriorating, a threat posed by varied human factors.
The Huaihe River and the Yangtze, the longest in China, flow through Anhui province, helping form 3.8 million ha of wetlands locally, which accounts 27.8 percent of the national total.
This means that Anhui boasts the largest area of wetlands in the country.
Wetlands have comprehensive strong points, such as nurturing water sources, storing floodwater, regulating climate, as well as disposing of sewage, along with provision of a haven for wildlife, especially endangered water fowls.
The increasing population living in valleys of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers in recent years, has accelerated the decrease and worsening of the wetlands, where a renowned home for rare and precious wildlife and plants like Chinese alligator, white dolphin, red-crowned crane, diatom and hornwort.
Though Anhui has begun to set up nature reserves for wetlands since 1982, it currently has only brought 4.6 percent of local wetlands under protection, because of technology and fund shortages.
The province intends to introduce overseas technology, facilities and money to do such research works on wetlands environment, waterfowl resources, and migratory birds.
BEIDAIHE (Hebei), March 5 (Xinhua) --China will enhance its international cooperation in protecting and reasonably utilizing the country's wetlands, said a Chinese official, who is attending an international symposium on wetlands and water birds protection.
China will cooperate with the International Wetlands Organization to evaluate, monitor, and manage the country's wetlands and make relevant policies, the official said.
He said that the symposium, which followed the establishment of China's office of the International Wetlands Organization, shows that the Chinese government is making further progress in protecting wetlands.
The office, set up in Beijing, will help China to make contact with other countries and organizations, work out the plan for wetlands protection and apply for international aid, said Chen Kelin, who heads the office.
Wetlands are a kind of ecosystem, including lakes and marshlands, with ecological and economic functions such as storing floodwater for use against drought.
China now has 63 million hectares of various kinds of wetlands, or 6.6 percent of the national total area and ranking first in Asia, among which some have been listed as "Wetlands of International Importance".
The symposium, which is held in Beidaihe, a sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Forestry, the Japan's Environmental Agency and the Asia-Pacific Branch of the Wetlands International.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7: Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have promised to stop the steady erosion of the nation's wetlands _ the 100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food chain.
They have succeeded in beating back the big threats, including efforts by former Vice President Dan Quayle and, later, the Contract With America Republicans to transfer millions of these valuable acres to private interests almost overnight.
But they have been less successful in persuading the Army Corps of Engineers, which actually regulates wetlands, to take a harder line on developers and others who covet wetlands for commercial purposes.
Monday, however, the Corps announced new and stricter regulations that will make it much harder for developers to keep chewing up the country's wetlands in small bites.
The rules would require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the current minimum of three acres.
This change could make a big difference.
Though precise figures are elusive, wetlands are disappearing at a rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year, many of them lost to development on small parcels.
Regionally, the rules should benefit New York City's watershed, where thousands of acres essential to the purity of the city's water supply are threatened by small-scale development.
The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that took the Corps to court.
The rules also represent the Corps' second effort to soften the impact of an arcane but ecologically destructive rule known as Nationwide Permit 26.
Until three years ago, in the interests of administrative efficiency, Permit 26 had allowed the Corps to grant automatic permits to construction projects that affected less than 10 acres of wetlands.
In December 1996 the Corps dropped that limit to three acres.
But even these stricter standards have allowed the disappearance of 20,000 or more acres a year.
Several important steps remain.
Developers and contractors have denounced the new rules, and the administration must be ready to resist legislative attempts to overturn them.
Second, the Corps itself is under a heavy obligation to enforce the new rules in a fair-minded but hard-nosed way.
This will require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules.
The administration should make sure the Corps gets the money it needs for these additional enforcement responsibilities.
But for now, anyone who worries about wetlands has reason to cheer.
The Corps of Engineers, which is not known for environmental stewardship, has acted responsibly.
Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of the nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly retreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams, swamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the Corps' records indicates.
The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with protecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible violations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2 percent of permit applications for major wetland projects.
In 1992, the Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according to the documents.
Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters goal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they feel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one field office, they received a memo urging them to avoid time-consuming, costly enforcement actions.
Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps offices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7 million since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55.
During that period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as the region's economy prospered.
Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and enforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects a society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so there are fewer attempts to damage them.
In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget freezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to 1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor issues and allowing state regulators to do more.
``We believe we've substantially increased environmental protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.
&QL; &QL; Employees critical &QL; &QL; But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to enforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has become a paper tiger easy to take advantage of.
``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said Magi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, who quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve developments she felt should have been turned down.
``A program without enforcement is an invitation to break the law without consequences''.
The whistleblower organization, a seven-year-old advocacy group for government employees concerned about environmental issues, provided the Globe with summaries of enforcement records and other documents obtained from the Corps' 37 field offices under the Freedom of Information Act after employees complained of a precipitous drop in wetland protection at the Corps.
Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife Federation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom for thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do not have strong enforcement programs.
He said New England states generally have good state enforcement, but, even there, a tough Corps can help stand up to powerful industries.
``If we could start a program from scratch, I certainly wouldn't organize it the way it is.
But given where we are, we would be in real bad shape'' if the Corps stops enforcing the law, McCallie said.
The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals.
Americans destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap water.
&QL; &QL; Clinton steps in &QL; &QL; The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of wetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating 100,000 acres more than are destroyed.
The main tool would be the restoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the Florida Everglades.
The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development.
The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in Boston.
At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the Corps is often an obstacle to development.
However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton does not plan to beef up enforcement significantly.
Almost half of the extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses and individuals to challenge Corps decisions.
Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less comfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA.
The Corps, best known as the builder of public works and flood control projects, objected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because of a violation.
Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also cut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility review.
Orders to restore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109 since 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to 5,141 in the same period.
``It's only a matter of time before people find out,'' one Corps employee said.
``What's the use of getting a permit if people can do it without a permit''?
A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the whistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases to avoid.
According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do nothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a reported violation is substantial.
Even with some major violations, the memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case'' if another agency will not take over.
&QL; &QL; Work overload &QL; &QL; New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the office has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun transferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is overwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by one full-time and one part-time staff member.
But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes sense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger legal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle prosecution of flagrant cases.
More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement overlooks big improvements at the Corps.
For instance, he said the Corps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland damage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit, three times smaller than the previous minimum size.
He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005.
Our part of that is that we believe we should continue to administer the program so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said.
However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows half of them fail.
Moreover, critics note, the wetland damage Studet cites does not include illegal activity.
&QL; &QL; Criticism of Corps &QL; &QL; Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of controversy it bends over backward for powerful industries.
Even in the Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is more vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to political pressure.
Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one Corps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the rapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has lobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for the crop.
The memo notes that all 29 permits had been promptly granted and that only one grower had to create new wetlands to offset the damage.
New England regulatory chief William Lawless counters that each project received proper review before it was approved, saying critics ``are rushing to judgment.
We certainly were knowledgeable that the state was interested in cranberries, but that doesn't mean we are going to roll over.
We are very careful not to give special treatment''.
In truth, Lawless said, his office has done its best to keep up wetland protection even as budget freezes forced him to eliminate 12 positions during the last four years.
``We're doing more with less,'' he said.
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) --Xu Youfang, the Minister of Forestry, delivered a written statement today to mark the first "International Wetlands' Day" designated by the international wetlands organization.
He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts in the protection of wetland resources.
Wetlands, a kind of important natural ecological system and known as the earth's "kidney", play an unreplaceable role in climate adjusting, water conserving, soil-erosion preventing and pollutant resolving in addition to serving as habitats for a variety of the world's rare water fowls.
China has a total area of more than 25 million hectares of natural and artificial wetlands of different types scattered across the country, with many being waterfowl habitats of international importance.
"History has told us that the protection of wetlands represents the protection of ourselves, for the destruction of wetlands means the destruction of man's living environment," the minister said.
Xu said his Ministry will launch a drive to enhance the awareness of wetland protection among the public, establish a dynamic monitoring network and information system for China's wetlands, conduct scientific research in wetland protection as well as proper utilization and management of wetlands resources.
Thus far, China has set up more than 130 wetland nature reserves, six of which have been listed as of "international importance", according to the minister.
VAIL, Colo.
(AP) --A temporary dirt logging road carved across a half-acre of wetlands has landed Vail Resorts, the nation's largest ski area, in trouble with the government.
Last fall, Tom Allender, resort planning director, and his crews built the road to access an 885-acre expansion into undeveloped backcountry.
Until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort had done in July, no one noticed the temporary road had been built in the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into protected habitat.
The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation last month.
The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to $27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna.
Vail Resorts has said it was an honest mistake.
But the EPA's Steve Ireland rejected that defense.
``If fill material is discharged into the waters of the United States without a permit, it is a violation,'' he said.
``It's worse if they knew they were breaking the law, but whether it was unintentional doesn't change anything''.
In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers has closed the road, leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut timber and no way to remove it.
It may have to be burned on site.
The U.S.
Forest Service had ordered Vail to build the road so logging trucks could remove the timber without rumbling through the tourist-clogged village.
Allender said he became confused when building it because surveyors had left three proposed routes marked with ribbons through the wilderness.
The road is another chapter in the decades-long, controversial effort by Vail Resorts to complete a $14 million expansion project.
Environmentalists recently lost a legal challenge to the project, arguing unsuccessfully that the Forest Service didn't adequately assess the effect on wildlife, specifically the lynx.
Last fall, a group calling itself Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for an outbreak of fires at the resort that caused $12 million in damage.
In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay to fix the damage to the wetlands.
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) --Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988.
The convention, an inter-governmental treaty launched at Ramsar, Iran, on February 2, 1971, partly aims to the conservation of wetlands as habitats for migratory water birds and enhance international cooperation in the field.
The day, adopted by a conference on wetlands held in Brisbane, Austria in March 1996 as World Wetlands Day, was marked with a theme "Wetlands and Community" in Masaka District, 120 kilometers southwest of capital Kampala today.
In compliance with the convention, Uganda has made efforts to raise awareness of the public about uses of wetlands and the need of conservation.
The country has also developed a national wetlands policy, including the designation of Lake George's wetland, southwestern Uganda as a convention site, the research and evaluation of wetlands for facilitating their wise use.
The authorities, in February, 1996, set up a hot line for the public to report environment abuse and announced that new draining of swamps for economic development is no longer allowed in the country.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands offered Uganda funds for restoring some swamps in the country.
Uganda's wetlands cover an area of about 29,600 square kilometers and make for 12 percent of the country's territory.
The wetlands play a role as filters of waste before it drains into lakes and rivers in the eastern African country.
However, Uganda's wetlands has decreased in acreage, mainly due to human activities including grazing, brick-making, reduced vegetation, rice planting and hunting especially of antelopes and water birds.
Large tracts of wetlands in the country currently have been drained into paddy fields.
In Kampala and Kabale District bordering on Rwanda, many swampy areas have been drained for farming and house construction.

CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) --The formation of a new International conservation body announced today was vital to the wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told at the Ramsar meeting today.
The Wetlands International was launched at the Ramsar Convention conference held in Brisbane, a port city in Northeastern Australia, with the participation of some 1000 delegates from about 120 countries, The Australian Associated Press reported.
The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill, while addressing the conference, said that it represented a unique partnership between government and non-government interests to work for the goal of wetlands conservation.
Hill told the conference that relations between Wetlands International and Australia have been strengthened to the point that a formal agreement would be signed tomorrow.
Asian delegates to the international Ramsar conference called on the governing bureau to cut costs and move its headquarters out of Switzerland to the developing world.
Swami Singh Boparai, the Asian regional representative, said that as the infrastructure is available less costly in the developing world, the bureau secretariat can consider moving to a developing country so that it can have within the same budget more manpower and more activity.
Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and fauna.
Malaysia has estimated that its wetlands contributed 10 percent of its GDP although this percentage may have declined slightly as industrialization increased, he said.
The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the administrative bureau based in Switzerland.
Previous Ramsar conferences have been held in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland and Japan.
The vital importance of wetlands to Asia has led India to bid to host the next Ramsar meeting in New Delhi in 1999.
BEIDAIHE, March 4 (Xinhua) --Conserving China's wetlands is a national priority, said Zhen Rende, director of the wildlife and forestry department of the Ministry of Forestry.
Headed by the ministry, 17 ministries and commissions are formulating the systematic action program to guide the country's conservation and use of wetlands, Zhen said.
Speaking at the International Workshop on Wetlands which opened today in this sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, he announced that the program includes the establishment of wetlands nature reserves, protection of species, spreading of scientific findings and training of personnel.
Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land.
The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms.
In 1992 China joined the Convention on Wetlands that was established in Ramsar, Iran in 1971.
To collect the comprehensive information on China's wetlands resources, China has organized several large-scale investigations in the past few years and ran several training classes in Jiangxi, Shandong provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions for the administration of wetlands.
According to official statistics, China has more than 63 million hectares of wetlands, accounting for 11.9 percent of the world's total.
Zhen said, for quite a long time, many people believed that the wetlands were useless mud.
Now more and more people have recognized wetlands' great ecological and economic potential and the conservation and utilization of wetlands has become an urgent task.
The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe.
WASHINGTON (AP) --After years of deliberations, the Clinton administration next week will impose tougher requirements on developers to stem the loss of ecologically sensitive wetlands, according to sources familiar with the new regulations.
Homebuilders said Friday the new rules are unneeded and will stall economic development, but environmentalists welcomed the tighter restrictions, saying construction under old rules led to the loss of thousands of acres of wetlands.
The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers scheduled a news conference for Monday to announce the new rules, which have been debated internally for more than four years and were spurred by an environmental group's lawsuit.
The new requirements will take effect in June, according to the Army Corps' final draft.
The 172-page regulatory overall will require developers to seek special, individual permits to build if they want to fill in a wetland of one-half acre or more.
Prior to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1996, the cutoff was 10 acres, a standard the Army Corps later reduced to three acres.
The new regulations also will end developers' use of a streamlined ''nationwide permit'' process for most construction, meaning that specific permits will have to be approved for each project.
Homebuilders have complained that this new process will delay construction and require unnecessarily stringent review.
They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.
Robert Mitchell, a Maryland builder who is president of the National Association of Home Builders, predicted ''a dramatic negative effect on the homebuilding industry'' because of delays and more stringent wetlands protection requirements.
A study commissioned by a group of landowners and developers and the National Association of Counties estimated the cost to the economy of the new permitting process at $300 million a year.
However, the Army Corps has estimated the additional cost at closer to $26 million.
Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of disappearing wetland acres.
Although specific numbers are in dispute, environmentalists say the country, nevertheless, is losing as much as 100,000 acres of wetlands annually.
They maintain a fifth of those losses have been due to the Army Corps building permit policies.
Environmentalists have sought for years to abolish the so-called nationwide Permit 26, which applies to development, including home construction and road building, and replace it with individual permits as the Army Corps now is going to do.
David Rosenberg, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the nationwide permitting system amounted to giving ''rubber-stamp'' approval to construction projects.
''It has been the single largest source of permitted wetlands destruction in the country,'' Rosenberg said in an interview.
But the National Association of Home Builders argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost under the nationwide permit system.
At the same time, the group argues, the nationwide permitting system has allowed for fast track approval of thousands of projects without environmental damage.
The average time to get an individual permit approved was more than a year, compared with about a month for the streamlined nationwide permit for construction projects, the group estimated.
The new reliance on individual permits, with a one-half-acre wetlands threshold, ''means more regulations, delays and costs, less flexibility'' for developers, said Mitchell.
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.
(AP) - The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project.
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps has jurisdiction over any project that involves the discharge of fill or dredged material into waterways, which include rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands.
Thursday's action by its New York district suspends some of the permit procedures that are in effect elsewhere in the country.
''I don't want to say there was a full consensus, but there was a general feeling in New York, even in some towns that are more pro-development, that people wanted more protection in the New York City watershed,'' said Joe Seebode, chief of the district's regulatory branch.
The watershed affects the drinking water for New York City as well as parts of the northern suburbs.
The new rules also apply to the Great Swamp in Putnam and Dutchess counties, some Hudson River wetlands and other New York waters, he said.
''This will affect projects that are having anything more than an extremely minimal impact on wetlands and watercourses,'' he said.
The new rules require: -Public notice and public comment before a permit is granted.
-An analysis of whether there are less environmentally damaging alternatives.
-Mitigation of any impact on wetlands by creating or enhancing other wetlands.
''It does not mean people will not be able to develop, but it does mean that folks will have to come in, get an individual permit, give the corps the opportunity to coordinate with the city, the state, federal agencies and the general public on whether there is a reason not to authorize that project,'' Seebode said.
''We are interested in using our regulatory responsibility and authority to minimize the impact on wetlands in the watershed because they are so important in filtering out pollutants and purifying water and trapping sediments.''
IMPERIAL, Calif.
(AP) --It is known as one of the nation's dirtiest waterways, an 80-mile drain that catches raw sewage and industrial waste from the Mexican border city of Mexicali and mixes it with agricultural runoff from the irrigated fields of the Imperial Valley.
But after years of hand-wringing and bad publicity, the New River is getting the kind of attention that could end its notoriety.
A federally financed project to create artificial wetlands that would cleanse millions of gallons of river water is nearing completion, and the U.S. and Mexican governments last month announced $50 million in financing for badly needed upgrades to the Mexicali sewage treatment system.
The combination could go a long way to removing much of the pesticides, fertilizers, raw sewage carried by the river into the Salton Sea, the largest lake in California.
''Eventually, with what we're doing and what they're doing we'll clean up a lot of the problems with this river,'' said Leon Lesicka, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and chairman of a task force coordinating river cleanup projects.
Signs of significant improvement in the river could be less than four years away, said Eugenia McNaughton, an environmental scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency.
''This is a workable problem and we are working on it,'' McNaughton said.
So far, the progress is visible only along the river's banks at two sites near Imperial and Brawley, about 100 miles east of San Diego, where workers are carving berms and ponds for the artificial wetlands.
After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will plant bull rushes and other wetland plants.
They won't use New River water out of concern for the workers' health, Lesicka said.
For now, the river remains a fetid mess, especially near the border at Calexico, where clumps of foam and debris bob on the surface and the river gives off an acrid smell and burns the eyes and throat after a few minutes of exposure.
Illegal immigrants float down the river to avoid the Border Patrol, knowing agents are reluctant to follow them in.
Polio, tetanus and tuberculosis have all been found in the river, according to the Imperial Irrigation District, the valley's main water agency.
The river was formed from Colorado River flooding between 1904 and 1906.
Waters breached a canal and turned a usually dry creek bed into a river that flows from about 20 miles south of Mexicali to the Salton Sea, a lake with no natural outlets that is choking on its high salinity.
Congress approved $3.75 million for the artificial wetlands to filter the contaminated water through a process known as bioremediation.
An additional $25 million of federal funding through the North American Development Bank is the U.S. contribution to the sewer upgrade in Mexicali, a city that has grown to an estimated 1 million.
The Imperial Irrigation District, which also is part of the task force and is building part of the wetlands, will consider adding more wetlands sites to help filter the water, possibly expanding to the nearby Alamo River, another Salton Sea tributary, said agency spokeswoman Sue Giller.
In the artificial wetlands being built, water will flow into collection ponds, where silt and minerals will settle to the bottom, then pass through a series of reed-covered berms before returning to the river again.
Biologists will monitor the collection ponds over three years to see how they affect wildlife.
There's no easy way to explain why the cleanup has taken so long, said Marie Barrett, a biologist involved with the project and a lifelong valley resident.
''Once we realized we had a problem, it took us a long time to get going,'' she said.
''But now we're actually doing something and it's so exciting''.

WASHINGTON (AP) --New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas.
The Corps completed a 172-page overhaul of its wetlands regulations this week and is ready to issue the new requirements, according to government and private sources.
The Corps scheduled a news conference on the regulations for Monday.
But sources familiar with the regulations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today final release may be delayed because of some technical changes.
The new regulations have been in the works for more than four years, but were given new impetus 18 months ago when President Clinton said he wanted to tighten the requirements on developers ''to ensure that we think twice before building in our most sensitive wetlands''.
According to sources who have seen the new regulations, the Corps will require developers to obtain specific permits for projects affecting at least a half-acre of wetlands, compared to three acres under current regulations.
The restriction was reduced from 10 acres in December 1996.
The new regulations will replace a ''nationwide permit'' system for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction.
Statistics on wetlands loss vary widely.
Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system.
Those figures are disputed by the National Home Builders Association, which argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost by construction under the nationwide permit system.
The new regulations would cover about one-fourth of all wetlands.
Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations, said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening wetlands protection.
The Corps first began reviewing the wetlands rules in 1995 and 1996.
'The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years.
Meanwhile, homebuilders and the National Association of Counties have accused the Corps of overreaction.
There is ''little evidence to justify'' the abandonment of the nationwide permit system, and the tighter half-acre restriction is not needed, said the National Association of Home Builders.
''In 1998 alone, Corps statistics show that under the (nationwide) permit program landowners provided 6,304 acres in mitigation in exchange for permission to fill or otherwise impact 2,974 acres''.
said Neil Gaffney, NAHB spokesman.
The Corps' completion of the new rules was first reported in today's Washington Post.
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) --Vietnam and the World Bank (WB) signed here on Thursday two development credit agreements for Vietnam's coastal wetlands protection and development project and the rural transport project in amounts of 31.8 million U.S. dollars and 103.9 million U.S. dollars respectively.
Signatures were Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) Le Duc Thuy and President of WB James Wolfensohn.
The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project will assist Vietnam to reestablish and improve the coastal mangrove wetlands ecosystems in order to protect sustainable aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions.
The project also aims at improving the agricultural productivity, aquatic nurturing and other related industries of the country.
The Rural Transport Project will assist Vietnam to improve and upgrade the rural transport access network at 40 provinces and improve the access of the rural communities to the urban communities, develop the central and provincial capacity to improve and sustain the level of service of the rural transport road network.
The two credit agreements raised the total amount of the loans that WB has approved to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in the form of 25 projects and programs.
The World Bank resumed lending to Vietnam in November 1993.
A WB delegation led by its president, Wolfensohn is scheduled to conclude its three-day visit to Vietnam on Thursday.
This is Wolfensohn's second visit to Vietnam after the first one in May 1996, soon after he became the president of the World Bank.
The WB delegation's Asia-tour includes Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, aiming to prepare for an operation strategy for the World Bank in the 21st century.
NEW YORK _ The federal government announced Thursday tougher restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City watershed.
The stricter rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of an acre, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties, said Joseph Seebode, an official with the Army Corps of Engineers.
The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
Slivers of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a Hudson River environmental organization.
``These are critical little pieces,'' he said.
``There are lots of them, and together they provide filtration and flood control.
They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but if it's near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the drinking water system''.
Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have been lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around the 1,969 square miles of watershed for months.
In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal regulations, adopted last spring _ and tougher than previous ones _ will continue to apply.
TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) - A Burlington County Republican leader who used 22 acres of protected wetland in the Pinelands to expand harvesting operations may soon be off the hook.
Garfield DeMarco, former Burlington County GOP chairman and a generous contributor to state Republican causes, has applied for a newly created state permit that would give the expansion after-the-fact state approval.
DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act.
By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before undertaking the expansion.
The state Department of Environmental Protection sent a letter in October 1998 to DeMarco, alerting him of the violation.
Fines for the illegal destruction of wetlands can be as high as $10,000 per day.
At that rate, the potential penalty now exceeds $8 million.
DeMarco's attorney, Anthony Drollas, said DEP officials have given no indication that they plan to impose anywhere near the maximum potential penalty against the cranberry grower.
DEP spokesman Peter Page said the department is negotiating with DeMarco over how much to assess in penalties, but he said DeMarco could have been eligible for a state permit had he sought one.
Not everyone is happy with DeMarco's possible settlement.
Critics say DeMarco is a well-connected political figure in the state.
DEP Commissioner Robert C.
Shinn is a Burlington County native and a political protege of DeMarco's.
Page said Shinn has excused himself from the case, citing appearance of a potential conflict.
Glenn Paulsen, chairman of the Burlington County GOP, is manager of the Trenton office of Capehart &AMP; Scatchard, the law firm representing DeMarco's application.
State records show DeMarco and the legal and engineering firms involved in his permit application gave GOP campaigns more than $200,000 last year.
Since 1995, the firms have given New Jersey Republicans $517,000 - including $196,000 from DeMarco between 1995 and 1999.
''Frankly, I think this is special-interest money and special-interest regulatory privilege,'' Bill Neil, director of the conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions.
''This is a sorry chapter in New Jersey policy history''.
Drollas said DeMarco's political ties have nothing to do with the application.
Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years.
Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10 acres in any year.
That means DeMarco's 22-acre expansion will have to be phased in under permits issued over the next three years.
NEW YORK _ After repeated efforts to persuade the federal government to strictly limit building on marshes around New York City's upstate reservoirs, the Giuliani administration reversed itself this week, saying the wetlands needed no special protections.
The city's new position echoes the views of Republican officials from rural communities around the reservoirs and pits city officials against private environmental groups and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which say that special restrictions are needed because wetlands help to purify the city's water.
The change was outlined in a March 15 letter from Environmental Protection Commissioner Joel Miele to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, which is updating federal rules for wetlands.
Some environmental groups and Democratic city officials assailed the move and accused Giuliani of putting his possible race for the Senate, and his need for Republican support outside the city, ahead of his responsibility to protect the water supply.
Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, denied there was any political motive behind the change.
One of Miele's deputies made the original recommendations, and Miele never approved them, Lhota said.
Lhota defended the city's new stance, saying the city's water supply was already sufficiently protected from pollution.
``Anyone who makes the argument that these new rules would protect the watershed any further, that's just false and cheap politics,'' he said.
The city reversed its stance on the new restrictions after the original recommendations angered Republican state legislators and county officials, who called Giuliani and Miele to complain that tighter rules would stifle development.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Without a strong recommendation by the city for special rules around the reservoirs, several environmental lawyers said, the stricter standard are less likely to be adopted by the Army Corps of Engineers, particularly because upstate communities have sent the agency extensive comments of their own, opposing such a move.
The agency is responsible for issuing permits for filling in small tracts of wetlands and thus can limit development.
``It's an extreme and radical action to withdraw recommendations like this,'' said Robert F.
Kennedy Jr.
, a lawyer for Riverkeeper, an environmental group that strongly supported the Giuliani administration two years ago when it committed to an ambitious plan to protect the water supply.
``We're worried that water quality is being traded for political advantage,'' he said.
Since last summer, the corps has been updating its nationwide system for issuing permits to fill wetlands, seeking to identify areas where wetlands are particularly vulnerable or important and need protection.
The city's original written comments, by Dr.
William Stasiuk, a deputy commissioner of the city Department of Environmental Protection in charge of the water supply, recommended that the strictest procedures be applied to proposals for developing the 2,000 square miles that drain into the reservoirs, with individual applications required for any filling or construction affecting more than one-third of an acre of wetlands.
The general standard used by the Federal agency requires an application and review only for any project filling more than three acres of wetlands.
Stasiuk said extra protection was needed because ``further loss or degradation of the remaining wetlands in the watersheds may jeopardize regional water quality''.
But when his comments were circulated in upstate communities last month, local officials called them a ``sneak attack'' on the rights of residents around the reservoirs to develop their property.
Stasiuk declined to comment Thursday.
In recent days, several city officials sent Giuliani letters criticizing the retraction of Stasiuk's original wetlands recommendations.
In their letters, they said the city's reversal increased the chances that the water supply would slowly be degraded, eventually forcing the city to build a $6 billion filtration plant to remove pollution that could have been prevented.
The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the reservoirs deserve special protection.
In an interview Thursday, Miele defended the change in the city's position, saying there was no need to saddle communities in the watershed with extra federal restrictions because his staff already had the right to stop any action that might pollute the water.
Even so, Miele acknowledged that the city's options were somewhat limited.
Two years ago, it signed an agreement with communities around the reservoirs that ended their longstanding legal challenges to the city's pollution regulations around the watersheds.
In return, the city began spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help the communities keep the water clean, and it acknowledged their right to continue to grow economically.
PHOENIX _ There's a place in the far southwest Phoenix area where you can see a great blue heron &UR; picking its way along the waterline, or an egret gliding overhead.
Beavers cross one trail.
Turtles and a melodious marsh wren find homes near another.
``We came here at sunset and it was like a scene from `National Geographic,' '' one visitor, Lynn Timmons, said after a look.
``It's the desert.
You don't expect to see this kind of scenery''.
Especially when it's next to a sewage treatment plant and drawing its water from the plant's discharge.
The site is Tres Rios, a 12-acre wetlands project downstream from the Phoenix area's 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant.
But it is more than a sanctuary for nearly 100 species of birds and wildlife from javelinas to bobcats.
It's an extension of the plant itself, using nature as a filter to provide the final cleaning stage for sewer water.
The concept could end up saving cities in the Phoenix area hundreds of millions of dollars.
The reason: Increased federal standards are expected for water being released back into the environment.
Phoenix officials say the cost to upgrade a treatment plant such as the one at 91st Avenue to meet those new standards could top $375 million.
``With a wetlands, we can do a full 800 acres for about $85 million,'' said Bing Brown, spokesman for Phoenix's Water Services Department.
``It does the same thing, and does it better in some cases.
``Do you want to put up another building, or do you want a place you can take your family to watch birds and watch lizards?
If both do about the same thing but one costs less and looks better, it seems it's a shoo-in''.
Before a city creates 800 acres of wetlands, though, it needs to know whether the concept works.
That led to Tres Rios, a demonstration project near 91st Avenue and Broadway Road.
Wastewater is processed through the nearby treatment plant and pumped into the wetlands.
As the water flows through plants and vegetation, ``nature takes its course,'' cleansing the water of nitrogen, metals, pesticides and the like.
The water is collected on the other end.
Water that comes out of the plant is not used for drinking but for irrigation and to cool towers at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
&UR; Jack Landy, an environmental engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco, said the EPA supports Tres Rios and is impressed with the planning going into the project.
There are other wetlands projects, including one in Show Low and a couple in Tucson, but he said there's nothing on such a large scale in this region, including Arizona, California, Nevada or Hawaii.
``We have enough experience with wetlands, though, that we're confident it can work,'' he said.
A concern already expressed in meetings is the possibility of mosquito breeding, but Landy said he hopes that can be prevented.
``We're going to be supportive but attentive as to the environmental impacts,'' he said.
The EPA has not identified any significant pollution from the discharge at this point, he added.
Construction of the 12-acre site began in 1995.
About $8.5 million has been spent or committed so far from the federal government and cities involved.
Tres Rios is owned by a coalition of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, Mesa and Tempe.
It is operated in partnership with the Bureau of Reclamation.
Officials of the cities say the project is more successful than they anticipated, and they are pushing to build the 800 acres of wetlands.
The Army Corps of Engineers is studying the feasibility of the larger project; the study is expected to be completed by May 2000.
The project would span an area near the Salt, Gila and Agua Fria rivers, which is how it got the name Tres Rios, Spanish for ``three rivers''.
The 800-acre wetlands could have four different types of areas, including ponds, marshes, streams and an area where the water would flow underground.
The lessons learned from the smaller demonstration project would help the cities operate the full-scale wetlands, says Roland Wass, research project manager at Tres Rios.
Lessons like, watch out for the beavers.
Up to a dozen now call Tres Rios home, including Brutus, who weighs an estimated 70 pounds but still is slippery enough to avoid getting caught.
He's been busy building dams and dropping a 35-foot tree in the middle of one of the ponds.
``When we started, we never anticipated beavers,'' Wass said.
``Now it's a problem, but we're learning how to deal with it''.
The most important result of Tres Rios could be improved wastewater at a fraction of the cost of what it would take to build upgraded treatment plants.
And there's the benefit that isn't financial.
``Twenty-five years down the road,'' Wass said, ``you have usable real estate, not rusting chemical tanks''.

NEWARK, N.J.
_ Cranberry farmers have been quietly expanding into more and more unregulated acreage, even as they have sought federal approval to use sensitive wetlands, environmental groups assert.
The accusation came as one of the state's largest growers, A.R.
DeMarco Enterprises, was charged this month with illegally expanding into 22 acres of regulated wetlands in Burlington County.
That charge by the state Department of Environmental Protection _ which could mean heavy fines for the owner, Garfield DeMarco, a former Burlington County Republican leader _ cast further suspicion on the industry in the eyes of some environmental groups.
The $25-million-a-year cranberry industry has thrived for over 200 years in the state's pinelands on the fringes of natural wetlands, where swampy conditions and a web of streams, dams and ditches allow farmers to flood growing areas easily and cheaply with the water that is essential to the crop.
As a result, New Jersey, the most urban and densely populated state in the country, has become the third-largest cranberry producer, behind Massachusetts and Wisconsin.
And many people see the farming of cranberries, as well as blueberries, both of which depend on clean water, as compatible with, and indeed an aid to, wetlands preservation.
The growers say they need to expand into regulated wetlands to remain competitive.
But William Neil, director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, asserts that cranberry growers have already been working far more than the 3,500 acres that they have cited in their expansion applications.
He said that reports on pesticide use suggested that as much as 4,481 acres of cranberries were being grown in the state, and that other statistics from the state Department of Agriculture put the figure at put the figure at 3,900 acres.
Steven Lee, one of the state's 48 cranberry growers and a spokesman for the group, denied any deception.
He said that he and other growers had always indicated that they were modestly expanding into unregulated, upland areas and into blueberry bogs on their land.
Those expansions had added as much as 400 acres to the state's cranberry inventory in recent years, he conceded, which would put the total at about 3,900 acres.
``But we have done it on our farm to the maximum extent possible without touching regulated wetlands,'' Lee said.
``This is true of most of the other farmers.
We are all tapped out''.
He said the growers, most of whom are part of the large Ocean Spray cooperative, had not hidden expansions from the public, as Neil asserted.
He said they had always told regulators that they were converting blueberry bogs to more lucrative cranberry production wherever possible, and extending growing areas upland, away from the wetlands, when it did not require extensive redirection of water.
The accusations by Neil came about three weeks after the state and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said that they were close to approving conditions under which growers could expand into 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years without seeking specific permission for each expansion as they had in the past.
The draft agreement on what is called the ``general permit'' could be approved later this month.
But it is being opposed by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service as ``the most environmentally damaging proposal'' considered by regulators over the last five years.
Echoing this sentiment, environmental groups like the Audubon Society have asked federal environmental regulators to reconsider their support.
WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday proposed new rules to protect environmentally sensitive wetlands from development, a response to what administration officials called a recent rash of destruction.
The officials said that in the last two years, some 20,000 acres of wetlands and an additional 150 miles of streams had been destroyed because of what they portrayed as a loophole opened by a court decision three years ago.
The new rules, to take effect after a 60-day period of public comment, would close that loophole by adding greater detail to regulations that specify what kinds of wetlands development require an environmental impact review by the government.
The rules, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, are part of the administration's effort to fight the court decision, issued in January 1997 by a federal district judge in Washington and upheld in June 1998 by the District of Columbia U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Interpreting unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, both courts held that developers did not need to obtain a federal permit to excavate, drain or ditch a wetland as long as they did not dump soil on the property in question.
The EPA had sought as early 1993 to subject all development on wetlands to strict environmental review, but that approach was rejected by the courts, which ruled in favor of arguments made by developers and by the National Mining Association.
Among the winners in that case was the National Association of Homebuilders, which Thursday expressed strong disagreement with the new rules.
``This is a bad decision,'' said a spokeswoman, Susan Asmus, ``and it is not consistent with the previous court rulings or with the Clean Water Act''.
In her own announcement, Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: ``Today's proposal will allow us to go as far as we can through administrative reforms to close this loophole and protect wetlands.
The action we take today strengthens the protection of vital resources for future generations''.
Similarly the Sierra Club hailed the decision as an important strengthening of environmental safeguards.
``Limiting this loophole should protect the streams and wetlands that are home to thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife,'' said Robin Mann of the club's National Wetlands Committee.
``Streams and marshes protect our communities by acting as a natural sponge, soaking up water that would otherwise flood our neighborhoods''.
Administration officials warned that the action would not in itself be sufficient to guard against destruction of wetlands, and called on Congress to strengthen the Clean Water Act further.
The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land and bodies of water.
These areas play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and in harboring fish and shellfish populations.
The EPA's announcement Thursday vividly described the areas' significance.
``Destruction of wetlands,'' the statement said, ``can increase flooding and runoff potential, harm neighboring property, cause stream and river pollution and result in the loss of valuable habitat''.
Since the late 1700s, the agency said, over half the nation's wetlands have been lost to development and other activities.
Seven states, it said, have lost more than 80 percent of their original wetlands.
China will no longer consider the interests of tree-cutters when building hydroelectric power station on the upper reaches of the Yangtze and will not leave log channels for them.
The State Environmental Protection Administration says that all water conservation projects, and agriculture and forestry development along China's major rivers must be assessed in accordance with environmental protection standards, and that no projects will be allowed if they pose a threat to the environment.
Ecological damage has been a source of this year's floods.
Water levels on some sections of the Yangtze and at Dongting Lake have reached record highs, even though the flow was below record levels.
The State Environmental Protection Administration said in a report that serious damage to lakes, pools, and wetlands, a decline in vegetation's ecological function, and the resulting soil erosion have all contributed to the floods.
The administration is doing a more detailed study of ecological problems along China's major rivers and is trying to suggest ways of easing the problem.
SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Star Wars'' fan Khari Crowder set up camp Saturday on the sidewalk near the Coronet Theater.
Next to him was a big banner that declared: ``I'M FIRST''.
``If I could be here a month, I would,'' said Crowder, who works for a San Francisco radio station under the name Krazy K.
He was among the handful of fans who began lining up at the movie house, hoping to snag tickets to the long-awaited ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''.
The line _ a scene repeated in many other cities _ is expected to balloon as the film's May 19 opening approaches.
Advance ticket sales begin a week earlier.
It's a long wait and a lot of work for a movie that isn't even officially set to play at the Coronet.
But it looks like The Force is with the fans: United Artists Theaters executive vice president Mike Pade believes the deal is ``99.9 percent done'' with film distributor Twentieth Century Fox to book ``Episode I'' at the Coronet.
Crowder said he first showed up Friday night but the police told him to move.
So he slept in his van, which was parked nearby.
He was back in the same spot Saturday, lounging on a lawn chair.
He said he was prepared to wait until opening day.
``They don't call him `Krazy' for nothing,'' said a co-worker who dropped by to see him.
For other fans camped out, the wait is a minor inconvenience to see the first ``Star Wars'' installment since 1983.
``I've been waiting for this moment for 15 years,'' said A.J.
Nappa, a 20-year-old San Francisco resident who staked out a piece of pavement a few feet from the theater's box office.
For him, it's not just a movie.
``This is a defining moment for our generation''.
He and friend Joe Buckley began their camp-out Saturday at 9 a.m.
Their spirits were up as they munched on pizza and played Monopoly _ the ``Star Wars'' edition, no less.
The wind threatened to blow away their Monopoly money.
But even then they seemed prepared to weather the nearly three-week wait.
Stashed away in their cars were tents, sleeping bags and other necessities.
More friends will join them as the days pass, they said.
Round Table Pizza, a few doors from the Coronet, welcomes any extra business the ``Star Wars'' hype brings.
Assistant manager Peter Kwan said he's used to blockbuster films sparking big crowds, but he's not used to seeing a line form so early.
``I think ``Star Wars' is going to be the biggest,'' Kwan said.
Nappa, Buckley and his friends plan to watch the classic ``Star Wars'' trilogy on the eve of the film's opening _ right where they're camped, using a TV, VCR and gas generator.
The moviegoers at the Coronet aren't alone in their enthusiasm.
Over the weekend, there were signs of ``Phantom'' fever spreading: _ More than 15,000 fans overwhelmed the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver for the three-day ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a Lucasfilm- sanctioned event featuring cast, crew, props and merchandise _ enough to make the most rabid Jedi junkie drool.
_ FAO Schwarz, Toys R Us and other chains prepared to open Monday at 12:01 a.m. to hawk long-awaited ``Episode I'' goods, such as plastic light sabers, talking action figures and toy spaceships.
Merchandise sales from the classic trilogy have raked in more than $4 billion and the new film is expected to match that.
``The Phantom Menace,'' which opens in 2,500 theaters on opening day, is expected to surpass the $1.78 billion grossed worldwide by ``Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi''.
Some even think it may sink ``Titanic's'' record-setting $1.84 billion worldwide receipts.
The $115 million film is a ``prequel'' set about 30 years before the first ``Star Wars'' film.
One part of the storyline tells of a 9-year-old slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, who eventually becomes the infamous Darth Vader of the trilogy.
The plot also centers around a brewing galactic war involving the Trade Federation and the Republic of pre-Imperial days.
Buckley, 19, tried to explain the appeal of the ``Star Wars'' series that has kept it a cult favorite since the first film appeared in 1977.
``I've watched a lot of movies and that's just the one that grabs you,'' he said.
``The movie's magic is still there.''
The ``Star Wars'' series has a lot to answer for.
In the specious book ``Easy Riders and Raging Bulls,'' it's targeted as the catalyst for the end of personal filmmaking.
Its success, along with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind of movie forever.
In fact, the movie that probably started off everything that ``Star Wars'' is accused of was actually ``Gone With the Wind''.
It got the kind of blockbuster send-off in the press that is still imitated today, 60 years later.
``GWTW'' producer David O.
Selznick made sure that every step of the film's conception was covered by the all-too-willing news media: from the purchase of the rights to Margaret Mitchell's novel to the highly publicized worldwide search for a Scarlett O'Hara.
If the cable outlet E!, which serves up fresh news releases still warm from the Xerox machines, had been around in 1939, it would've been eagerly fogging up Selznick's office window for a glimpse of the Great Man's shrewd manipulations.
Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before its release _ as hard as that is to believe _ and that Lucas had to shop around to get made.
Universal Studios, where he'd made the hit ``American Graffiti,'' refused to make ``Star Wars''.
And one of the few pre-release pieces on the film in The New York Times was stuck inside in the Sunday Arts &AMP; Leisure section, and detailed a Lucas working so hard to get out a picture that he was happy with that he seemed to be blowing on the prints to get them dry and into theaters on time.
Lucas' appropriation of simple mythology made ``Star Wars'' the first post-Vietnam War-era movie.
That is, the first big movie of its time by a film-school student who was totally uninfected by '70s cynicism or fear of the draft.
(Lucas was set to direct what became ``Apocalypse Now,'' with Francis Coppola producing, so it's not that he was unfamiliar with those elements).
The characters _ more archetype than character, really _ lent themselves to the sheer unsophisticated enjoyment of kids, and Lucas' canny pilfering of philosophy, psychology and camp gave those interested in searching out deeper meaning a chance to do so.
Luke Skywalker's quest has been compared with the New and Old Testaments, Homer and Superman's feats.
It seems that it took nostalgia to get ``Star Wars'' back into hyperspace.
If the trilogy, in which Luke goes nose to nose with Darth Vader and discovers that Vader is his father and that Princess Leia is his sister, had been re-released 10 years ago, it might have got the obsessives out of the house.
But bringing the trilogy out a couple of years ago piqued the interest of those who were kids when they saw it the first time.
And the rerelease also served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace''.
``Phantom'' is in the unique _ and intimidating _ position of being hyped everywhere for its May 19 opening.
The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before.
Before ``Star Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from their TVs.
Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before ``Star Wars'' was made.
(The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was made by 20th Century Fox _ ironically, the studio that became the home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it).
Even ``Jaws'' was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out.
But ``Jaws'' hit because it crossed over to the young audience that had been avoiding Julie Andrews singing to Rock Hudson (''Darling Lili''), or Clint Eastwood singing to anybody (''Paint Your Wagon'') _ and the youth audience was the first to go see a movie again and again.
``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation that was running the film industry.
They didn't yet realize that science fiction was due to replace the western as the action metaphor that mattered.
The evidence, based on the middling ratings of ``Star Trek'' _ which would also go on to become a cottage industry (a cottage the size of Belgium) _ was that people wouldn't rouse themselves to watch spaceships roar across the screen.
Unless Stanley Kubrick put them up there.
``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No.
1 grossing movie of all time from the box office.
It took 35 years, and the arrival of ``Jaws,'' for ``GWTW'' to be removed as box-office champ.
But it took less than three years for ``Star Wars'' to unseat ``Jaws,'' and by the end of 1977, ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' was on its way to outdoing ``Star Wars'' in box-office receipts.
It seems unfair to fault ``Star Wars'' for the laziness of the film industry, for the fact that studios suddenly wanted to find a way to make a science of what was essentially a gamble: finding a manifest-destiny hit.
They'd forgotten that Lucas' film cost tens of millions less than the big-budget blunders featuring stars who had long since outlived their usefulness.
(Although Eastwood did go on to much larger success, he never made any money singing in his movies.
If you need any further proof, just check the layers of dust on top of that copy of ``Honkytonk Man'' at your local video store).
Maybe the most important thing to note about ``Star Wars,'' along with its inclusion of comic-book storytelling elements, Joseph Campbell invocations of mythology and businesslike handling of science fiction (Lucas didn't glorify otherworldly action adventure) is that it was the first big film-generation hit.
That is, it was the first movie to blow up by quoting other films, such as the procession at the end of ``Star Wars'' echoing Nazi documentarian Leni Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' _ complete with the columns of soldiers moving in exactly the same pattern.
(At the time, it served as a fairly subtle indication that the Force had fascistic implications).
Or the x-wing shootout sequence lifted from scores of WWII dogfight scenes.
In the pre-video days, the world of old movies was mostly at the fingertips of film-school students.
People who could study them over and over, and carefully decide what to steal _ or, more politely, pay homage to.
By hitting so big so fast, ``Star Wars'' raised interest in entertainment, so that now every publication except ``The Watchtower'' sees the virtue of giving movie-related stories big play.
But the result is that the generation following every step of ``The Phantom Menace'' before it opens Wednesday is robbed of a sense of discovery.
They'll never know the thrill of going to a late show on a Monday night and finding it's sold out.
What ``Star Wars'' helped to create, and has now become a part of, is the need to have every element of a film spelled out before it's seen.
Lucas and company tried to sidestep spilling secrets, but the Internet is filled with reviews by fans who sneaked into exhibitor screenings.
Almost everyone has forgotten the joy of having a hit sneak up on you, of seeing a movie no studio wanted to make blast its way to the top.
That's why the world got sick of Quentin Tarantino so fast.

Who doesn't remember feeling an electrifying zing up the spine at that majestic blast of trumpets and the ``Star Wars'' title appearing on the big screen for the first time?
With innovative special effects and a classic good-vs.-evil theme, the ``Star Wars'' series became a part of pop culture.
For ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into theaters around the country to watch it over and over again.
The Zing strikes back.
That was the response to the two-minute trailer _ just the preview, mind you _ for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas' latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the ``Star Wars'' trilogy.
The actual film is due in theaters on May 21, 1999.
The first ``Star Wars'' trailer also began showing months before the film's release in May 1977, but after reports of audiences booing and laughing, the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox, quailed and yanked it out of circulation.
It was a completely different scene Tuesday night at the sneak preview of the preview in a downtown Manhattan theater.
(Its official opening date was Friday, but the movie's Web site, www.starwars.com, announced advance screenings at selected theaters).
The lights went dark, and unlike the typical New York movie experience, the audience instantly shut up.
The crowd seemed to be holding its breath as scenes from ``The Phantom Menace'' thundered onto the screen in a flurry of spaceships, aliens, robots and humanoids, all new but vaguely familiar.
Set a generation before the original ``Star Wars'' movie, Episode I follows a youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, the boy who is destined to become Darth Vader.
The cast includes Liam Neesom, Natalie Portman and Samuel L.
Jackson, among others.
To see the preview, fans still had to pay $9, the price of admission at most New York City theaters.
As soon as the trailer ended and the one for the remake of ``Psycho'' began, about 30 people ran to the theater next door to catch the ``Phantom Menace'' preview again as it began to play after the closing credits of ``Meet Joe Black''.
Ushers discreetly looked the other way as the trailer was being trailed.
``I've been here since 10 a.m.,'' said Chris Bergoch, a 26-year-old diehard ``Star Wars'' fan who took the day off from work and spent it ducking in and out of three screening rooms showing the trailer.
By 8 p.m., he'd seen it 20 times and was planning to spend the rest of the night there.
``I've waited 16 years for this,'' he said.
Another all-day viewer was Jude Lane, who was only 3 when ``Star Wars'' came out and says it was her first memory.
``No matter what the color, race, background or religion of the people watching the trailer, for two minutes and five seconds everyone feels the same,'' she said.
``You're friends with everybody in the theater''.
The renewed buzz about ``Star Wars'' has been building since last year's re-release of the trilogy, which incorporated new footage and state-of-the-art digital effects.
The movies offered nostalgia for viewers, and some of them brought their own children to experience the movies on the big screen, and not slice-and-dice versions on television.
Generation X, who once nagged Mom for those little $1.49 Luke Skywalker action figures, can today choose from vast array of toys including videos, games, books and a $29.95 CD-ROM titled ``Behind the Magic,'' which serves as a guide to the ``Star Wars'' universe and offers a glimpse of ``The Phantom Menace''.
But by May all the hype _ from merchandise to advertising _ might work to turn off an already cynical public.
``There are concerns, certainly in the wake of `Godzilla,''' said Andrew Hindes, a senior writer at Variety.
``Fox knows they don't have to overhype this.
You can't have more awareness.
If they're smart, they'll be subtle.
You could open it cold and it would still be huge''.
``Godzilla'' cost Sony Pictures Entertainment $200 million to make and market globally, but will result in little if any profit.
So far, the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy has made at least $1.7 billion.
``The Phantom Menace,'' the first in another Lucasfilm trilogy, cost $115 million to make.
No one knows if the hype will overshadow ``The Phantom Menace'' itself.
If Lucas has stuck with his original vision of the saga, which was of a simple, feel-good action series full of universal themes, it might not.
Deep down, past all the special effects and whiz-bang glitz, the director is conjuring with some fundamental elements of mankind.
`` `Star Wars' is not a simple morality play,'' the late Joseph Campbell, an authority on mythology, wrote.
``It has to do with the powers of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and suppressed through the action of man''.
Maybe with this newest episode, the marketing team will resist the temptation to paste hundreds of posters saying ``Yoda is THIS tall'' on the sides of street-corner newspaper boxes.
If there's a film that doesn't need too much hype, it would be ``The Phantom Menace,'' and face it, the Force is already with them. &QL;
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and dodging reviews from the Dark Side, the new ``Star Wars'' movie was set to open, appropriately, when the stars are out, at midnight screenings around the country early Wednesday.
``This is the best place to be right now in the whole world,'' said Chris Chaplin, 30, who had a ticket to the midnight show at Mann's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the doors swung open to get a good seat.
It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time.
The only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America.
``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge, unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.
``But beyond that you're in a very competitive release period''.
Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than $100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' for the film-opener crown.
``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997.
``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its ancestors.
The original ``Star Wars'' is the No.
2 movie of all time.
Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in tickets domestically.
``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 million, for No.
7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place.
Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof.
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas.
The reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious.
The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement.
More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor''.
Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle.
Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking''.
Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars''.
It is set a generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee father.
The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons beyond recycling.
Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial.
The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out almost immediately.
At Mann's Chinese, where the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning Tuesday.
One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an aspiring screenwriter.
``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' line.''
DENVER _ There were a lot of storm troopers wandering around without their blaster guns at the ``Star Wars'' Celebration here, the first convention and exposition dedicated to the 22-year-old movie series to win the approval and support of the films' creator, George Lucas.
Through a strange twist of fate, the ``Star Wars'' Celebration landed in Denver on the same weekend as the National Rifle Association convention, which drew 7,000 protesters, and just 10 days after the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, a suburb 20 minutes away.
It was food for thought, not least because the ``Star Wars'' movies _ whose ``dark side'' leans heavily on the iconography of the Third Reich, an obsession of the Columbine killers _ are filled with the kind of shoot-'em-up entertainment fantasy that many citizens are blaming for society's ills.
Throughout the convention, which drew about 40,000 fans to the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum here Friday to Sunday, the specter of Columbine hung over the event like the Death Star.
A petition was circulated urging Decipher, the company that makes the ``Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game, to create a card depicting one of the slain students, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars'' fan named Steven Curnow, as a Jedi knight.
A Decipher spokesman said the company declined ``because other kids would start thinking it's fun to kill him with a blaster'' during game play.
Eric Harris, one of the two students who planned and died in the Littleton attack, included a rant on his Web site about things he hated, including ``Star Wars'' fans.
At the booth run by Star Wars Insider, the official fan club magazine, which organized the convention, action figures with guns were no longer for sale.
Dan Hogatt, a 30-year-old foreman at Ford Motor Co.
in Louisville, Ky.
, who dressed up as a very convincing Chewbacca complete with a fur head and suit, foam latex hands and drywall stilts that boosted his height to 8 feet, had to check his crossbow at the door.
(Light sabers were deemed permissible).
``They asked us not to bring our weapons in here,'' he said.
``And I was upset, but I totally understand''.
In the search for answers to the Littleton tragedy, convention goers turned to their favorite film.
One speaker told the audience to always remember the Columbine events and a quote from Yoda that appears in a trailer for the forthcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menance''.
(The first movie in the new trilogy is set a generation before the first three ``Star Wars'' films).
``Fear is the path of the Dark Side,'' the green Zen master says.
``Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering''.
But in the end the anticipation that the first ``Star Wars'' prequel would be in theaters in less than three weeks _ on May 19, a date more anxiously awaited than the millennial New Year's Eve for most of these fans _ snapped fans out of tragic reality and into happy fantasy.
Some had overcome hardship to attend the celebration.
A dying father from the East Coast took his wife and young children, hoping that he could give them one last fond memory of being together as a family.
And Joshua Hamilton, a 26-year-old from Denver who works for a publisher of comic books, wandered through the exhibition center with his forehead lacerated with fresh cuts, a result of a car crash just hours earlier.
``Our car was totaled,'' said his wife, Kimberly.
``The ambulance came and put him in a neck brace and strapped him to a board.
They X-rayed both of us at the hospital and said we were OK.
It was worth it.
This is a once in a lifetime event''.
As films and personalities race through pop culture leaving a trail of momentary obsession behind them, ``Star Wars'' has passed the test of time and has spanned generations.
It has worked its epic tale of the relationships between good and evil, father and son, man and machine, youth and maturity, and thinking and feeling into a cultural landmark.
Joseph Campbell (whose book ``The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' seems to have inspired the galaxy-saving journey of Luke Skywalker) has been perhaps the films' greatest ally, examining it as a myth as universal as the Upanishads or the Bible.
``It's almost like a religion,'' said Won Park, a watercolor artist who flew in from Honolulu and dressed up as the Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson's character in ``Episode I'').
``If George Lucas turned this into a religion, it would blow L.
Ron Hubbard's Dianetics out of the window''.
Hubbard, of course, was a science-fiction writer before he led the Church of Scientology.
Nearby, Michael Cruz, a 24-year-old fan from New York City with seven ``Star Wars'' tattoos and a wife in her eighth month of pregnancy, said they were waiting to watch ``Episode I'' to select a name for their baby.
Some of the people feverishly wandering through the tents and airplane hangers housing ``Star Wars'' toy and video game previews, glass-encased movie props and collectible merchandise seemed to fit the stereotype of geeky males in their 20s and early 30s.
But the convention drew a racially, sexually, ethnically and generationally mixed crowd, many in costume although inexplicably there was nary a Luke Skywalker or C-3PO in sight.
It was hard to tell whether a parent or a child was the ``Star Wars'' fan, and often the answer was both.
nn (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Most of these conventioneers inhabit an alternate world in which George Lucas is God.
The universe of ``Star Wars'' is one of his making, the quality of its images and products rigorously maintained and controlled by his company over the years.
The tale itself _ a fantasy rendered with elaborate realism down to the last planet, droid and Gungan, each of which has its own background story _ was created with the kind of methodical obsession with detail that is the hallmark of an Outsider artist like Henry Darger.
In his Chicago apartment several decades ago, the reclusive Darger typed 15,000 single-spaced pages and drew 300 oversize water-colors carefully detailing of the plight of young slave girls in outer space and the battle between their captors, the Glandelinians, and their protectors, the Abbennians, along with all kinds of supplemental characters and species.
The battle myth could have attracted a ``Star Wars''-like cult complete with corresponding action figures.
But without the benefit of mass entertainment it attracted only one fan in the artist's lifetime: Darger himself.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Lucas has the gift of being as focused on the commercial reach of his work as he is on its inner world.
Of the more than 30,000 ``Star Wars'' products _ a $4 billion business with rarities that fetch as much as $25,000 in the case of one Boba Fett action figure that shoots projectiles that may land in the throats of young children _ every one has been approved by Lucasfilm.
At the convention, merchants like Hallmark and Hasbro lucky enough to receive a Lucasfilm license showcased their official products _ from blow-up pool rafts shaped like Naboo Starfighters to toothbrushes emblazoned with the likeness of the new character Jar Jar Binks _ as if they were fragments of the lost ark.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``Don't videotape,'' a representative in a ``Star Wars'' costume shop told one fan.
``Next thing you know, it will be on the Internet''.
When asked why anyone would care to post images of costumes of familiar characters on the Internet, the representative replied, ``I don't know, they told me to say that,'' ``they'' referring to Lucasfilm officials.
``It's all been hush-hush''.
Merchants were under strict orders not to sell or even discuss merchandise from the forthcoming movie, some of which conveniently went on sale in stores on Monday, the day after the convention ended.
The convention may have been a way to repay diehard fans, as editors at Star Wars Insider said, but it was also a way to stick them with the bill by waving new collectibles under their noses.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) ``I placed my orders without knowing what the product was going to look like,'' said Kyle Puttkammer, owner of a store called Galactic Quest in Atlanta.
``But now that I've seen them, I'm going to increase my order''.
As he spoke, passers-by paused to take photos of Puttkammer, who was dressed as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his 10-month-old daughter, dressed as Yoda, in her stroller.
In addition to being treated to never-before-screened scenes from the closely guarded film, audience members could attend question-and-answer sessions with many who worked on the film, including Jake Lloyd (who plays Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father and the future Darth Vader), Ray Park (the villain Darth Maul), Rick McCallum (the movie's producer), Anthony Daniels (the voice of C-3P0) and Pernilla August (Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker).
Ms. August was actually asked what it felt like to be the grandmother of Luke Skywalker.
``Star Wars'' buffs may be able to distinguish between fantasy and reality, but it was clear which side they preferred.
When an audience member asked Park whether his character, the devilish-looking, double-light-saber-wielding Darth Maul, would be returning in Episode II, the audience broke into confused murmurs.
``What do you want to hear''? asked the master of ceremonies, Daniels.
``The truth or a lie''?
Roaring through the tent came the overwhelming reply of over a thousand fans screaming in unison, ``A lie!''
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Force will soon be arriving at a toy store and Taco Bell near you.
In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' is scheduled to open.
A battalion of toy action figures and space crafts related to the movie will go on sale three weeks before ``Phantom'' opens nationwide.
Lucasfilm Ltd.
, which is producing the movie, has licensed Hasbro Inc.
, Galoob Toys Inc.
and Lego Group to make the toys.
Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well.
But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging.
The company, which has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom''.
Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie, industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second ``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film merchandising attempts.
``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to ``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King''.
Brochstein estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'') didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks, most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint.
According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars'' films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie series.
They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King''; the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films.
The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products.
``With `Star Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry trade association in New York.
``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the film merchandising industry.
As a result, Lucasfilm knows this segment of the industry like no other film studio.
```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,'' Brochstein said.
Lucas retained the licensing rights to products that used the ``Star Wars'' name.
``Before that, licensing was considered ancillary income.
But now in major films, particularly those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item''.
Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom'' merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public interest for the movie.
``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what they're doing,'' Brochstein said.
``They've let things out in dribs and drabs.
They make it a game''.
Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd.
allowed retailers to begin selling three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L.
Jackson, the actor who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set.
Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full range of merchandise they'll be releasing.
Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I _ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces.
In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a ``Phantom'' soundtrack in May.
Video games from Nintendo and Lucas Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom''.
On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins with the movie.
Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters.
The cans featuring Yoda will have prizes.
Pepsi would not comment on its promotions.
Tricon Global Restaurants Inc.
, the Louisville, Ky.
, parent of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk about its promotions.
TOKYO (AP) --Star Wars mania has struck in Japan, where fans turned out in droves at theaters around the country Saturday for a sneak preview of the hit movie.
Some in costume and others toting light sabers, the movie-goers began lining up as early as Thursday to see ``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace'', which officially opens on July 10, more than five weeks after its U.S. debut.
``It's like a festival,'' said Yuki Nishijima, a 19-year old student who had been waiting seven hours for one of three late-night showings at the Nihon Gekijo theater in Tokyo.
Around him, hundreds of people sat in the theater's sweltering entryway, fanning themselves and passing the time with everything from backgammon to beer.
Japan, the world's second largest movie market, is home to legions of Star Wars fans, and the film has been heavily hyped by the media in the weeks leading up to its first showing.
Some say the space fantasy series holds a special appeal for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic samurai films.
The first ``Star Wars'' movie was based loosely on ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Akira Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director.
``I realize this has sort of become a media event,'' said Chitose Koike, a 37-year old pianist who was waiting to see the sneak-preview.
``But I wanted to see it before everyone else''.
Nihon Gekijo officials said advance ticket sales had already surpassed previous records for the theater.
The new ``Star Wars'' prequel is good enough, but only just.
It's got the hardware, but neither the characters, the imagination, nor the resonance one had hoped for.
What fans will want to know, now that the hype can be replaced with actuality, is whether ``The Phantom Menace'' is sufficiently of a piece with the first three films to make it worth seeing.
The answer is yes, but not by much.
George Lucas, perhaps inevitably drawn back into the ``Star Wars'' gravitational field, has talked a lot about technological razzle-dazzle not being nearly as important as the characters and story.
But the truth is that it's the visuals and the new screenful of computer-generated whiz-bangs and other toys that drive ``The Phantom Menace''.
Character and personality take a back seat on this ride.
The kids toward whom the new film is frankly skewed will storm the malls and multiplexes to see Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young hothead Jedi warrior, how Obi-Wan's wise mentor, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn, teaches him control, and how they both discovered Jake Lloyd's prodigy, Anakin Skywalker, before he even knew there was such a thing as The Force, much less a Dark Side of it.
R2-D2 and C-3PO (before he got the skin job that made him gold and shiny) are on hand, too.
We're also introduced to Natalie Portman's young queen Amidala, who becomes the mother of Luke and Leia; to Samuel L.
Jackson's Mace Windu, whose role as a Jedi Council mainstay is so small you know he'll be back in later episodes; and to Ahmed Best's comic relief, Jar Jar Binks, a rubber-limbed amphibian Gumby figure who talks funny and walks clumsy and brightens the rather long and lightweight film a lot.
In short, there's a lot that's eye-filling in ``The Phantom Menace,'' but not much that's brain-filling, and nobody is going to think of it as soul food.
Its high point isn't even the space or land battles one has come to expect of ``Star Wars''.
It's a chariot race right out of ``Ben-Hur,'' except that it takes place on the desert planet of Tatooine, its chariots are jet-powered jalopy pods, and young Anakin looks like a World War I flying ace as he challenges the nasty champ in a contest whose ultimate winner will be Nintendo; pod race games will fly off the shelves as fast as laser swords.
Great pains were taken to make the gear in ``Phantom Menace'' look less sleek and evolved than in ``Star Wars,'' a reasonable enough decision since it takes place three decades earlier.
Jabba the Hutt, who figures briefly, even looks less blobby than the heavyweight we meet later.
Looking at Lloyd's smart, tough, empathetic Anakin has the effect of making us dread what we know will later be his downfall.
But the fact is that there isn't much emotional tug this time around.
``The Phantom Menace'' is bland, perhaps not surprisingly considering the difficulty of conjuring up the freshness and wonder with which the original burst upon the scene.
Although technically slicker, this installment isn't nearly as involving as ``Star Wars'' or ``The Empire Strikes Back''.
(By the time ``Return of the Jedi'' came out, there was a noticeable drop-off in energy and inspiration _ a trend that continues here).
There's no equivalent here of Alec Guinness's twinkling wisdom, Harrison Ford's unruliness, or the looming ominousness of the grown Darth Vader.
Lucas has written better stuff here for his Industrial Light &AMP; Magic computers than he has for the people.
``The Phantom Menace'' mutes McEwan's Obi-Wan and Neeson's Qui-Gon to the point where we grow detached enough to speculate on possible influences on aspects the new film.
When Qui-Jon and Obi-Wan visit Anakin's mother, learn about the remarkable circumstances surrounding the boy's birth, and ask her permission to take her son from slavery on Tatooine to a life as an apprentice Jedi knight, the moment seems to echo, intentionally or not, ``Citizen Kane''.
Visually, the idyllic capital of Naboo, the peaceful planet ruled by Amidala and coveted by the trouble-making Dark Lord of the Sith, suggests a cross between Marin County and the patina-domed campuses of Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley.
The elaborate sci-fi towers of the Federation's capital city of Coruscant suggest ``Metropolis'' passed through a computer.
Darth Maul, the bad guy in the climactic laser sword fight, suggests a hooded wannabe from the rock group KISS.
Lucas even has fun with ``Monday Night Football'' in the character of a two-headed announcer at the pod races.
The big victory celebration seems like a halftime show.
Just as Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park'' dissolved the line between movies and theme parks, so ``The Phantom Menace'' dissolves the line between movies and merchandising.
It's its own giant exercise in product placement.
It's hard to believe that McGregor's Obi-Wan and Portman's Amidala won't be given juicier material in episodes two and three.
Even allowing for the inevitably overinflated expectations connected to this overinflated event, ``The Phantom Menace'' is more fizzle than sizzle.
Although it at least avoids disaster, it brings to mind an exchange at Lucas's recent press conference in New York.
When I asked the director what was at stake for him with this movie, personally and professionally, he replied, ``Nothing''.
Perhaps that's the trouble with it.
LONDON (AP) --A failed bet on a "Star Wars" craze in Britain has left a publisher with 10 million unsold books and a vacancy for the post of chief executive.
British children's books publisher Dorling Kindersley announced Monday that its chief executive has resigned because of "a seriously misjudged" overinvestment in books tied to the launch of the latest movie in the saga, "Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace".
Expecting a Christmas rush, James Middlehurst arranged for the group to print 13 million of the books in the 18 months to Dec.
31 last year.
Sales totaled 3 million.
Company chairman Peter Kindersley blamed the "Star Wars" debacle for more than half of a pretax loss of $41 million which it expects to announce in the spring.
ATLANTA _ The phenomenon began a long time ago in a cineplex not so far away.
Now it's coming back _ in 83 days, to be precise.
And leading up to its May 21 release, George Lucas' fourth ``Star Wars'' film will be one hyped-up ``Menace'' to society.
Next month will bring a new 2.5-minute trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' purported to have more than 100 fresh sequences from the film, featuring battle droids, laser firepower and an eye-popping canyon race.
Later, Pepsi USA will launch an ad campaign for soft drink collectibles that will likely include a gold Pepsi can sporting Jedi instructor Yoda and the ``Star Wars: Episode I'' logo.
And starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a.
Darth Vader), and a marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films.
When the movie finally debuts in May, some think its box office take will be staggering, likely topping ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park's'' record $92.73 million opener in 1997.
For ``Phantom Menace,'' Hollywood is planning on stepping out of the way.
``You've got a clear path completely around that movie for weeks,'' says Ira Mayer, publisher of Entertainment Marketing Letter in New York.
``Nobody's putting anything major out against it''.
Moviegoers haven't seen hype this big since, well, last summer and ``Godzilla''.
``Hype can kill you, as `Godzilla' found out,'' says Dan Cox, film editor at the trade magazine Variety.
``I expect (`Phantom Menace') will make an enormous amount of money, but I don't know how it will hold up.
George Lucas is a little out of touch, frankly.
But he can tell a story well.
I just wonder if the technology is going to be up to what people are expecting''.
Certainly, people are expecting a lot.
Last November ``you had moviegoers paying $7.50 not to see a movie but to see the first trailer (when it was paired with films like `The Waterboy' and `Meet Joe Black'),'' says CNN's Jim Moret, anchor of ``Showbiz Today''.
``If that isn't pre-opening buzz, I don't know what is''.
One of those fans was Kristopher Graham, 24, of Dawsonville, who drove to Alpharetta's North Point theaters just to see the trailer.
He dubbed it ``awesome.
It sends chills down you''.
The whole ``Star Wars'' thing ``has come to occupy our culture in a unique way,'' says Matthew Bernstein, associate professor of the film studies program at Emory University.
``They talk about a film everybody has seen like `The Wizard of Oz'.
It's occurred to me I'm no longer sure every child in America growing up sees 'The Wizard of Oz'.
But you know every one of them sees 'Star Wars'''.
And it's not just in America.
Recently, Moritz Minzlaff, an 18-year-old German college student in Karlsruhe, south of Heidelberg, posted an Internet message begging fellow foreign ``Star Wars'' fans to join him in traveling to the United States to see ``Phantom Menace'' in May (opening dates outside North America start in June).
So far Minzlaff has gotten responses from dozens of fans in Germany, France, Slovakia, Great Britain, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland.
He plans to travel to Los Angeles with the group he assembles for the first showing of ``Phantom Menace''.
``I haven't done anything like this (before),'' Minzlaff says in an interview via e-mail.
``I think it's a crazy thing to do but that's part of the fun.
`Star Wars' is something special to me.
I've never been this excited about anything.
I started counting down the days when the release was more than 500 days away''.
Similar sentiments clog the Internet, which has been littered with ``Star Wars'' sites for years.
Activity has intensified in recent weeks with unofficial postings of purported sound clips pirated from the film's production, an alleged frame-by-frame accounting of what moviegoers will see in the coming new trailer and spy reports from London's Abbey Road where John Williams recently began recording the ``Phantom Menace'' soundtrack.
Much of the information is housed in sites commonly referred to among the webnoscenti as ``spoilers'' for the obvious reason that they readily reveal anything they can get their hands on.
The minutiae is often mind-boggling.
Ryan Johnson's www.astheygo.com, for instance, details one script excerpt he's ``99 percent sure that this might be authentic''!
Here it is: Jedi: ``Holy Moley!
What's that''?
Anakin: ``I've got a bad feeling about this ''...
Jedi: ``You always say that''.
Some Internet users such as Germany's Minzlaff avoid many of the spoiler sites.
``I'm very much concerned about knowing too much about the story,'' he says.
But he does hook into sites like www.countingdown.com at least three times a day for ``Phantom Menace'' updates.
Countingdown.com is an obsessive-compulsive nirvanaland.
The entrance to the ``Star Wars'' pages contains a digital clock counting down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until ``Phantom Menace'' opens in theaters.
(You, of course, can capture the clock to place on your own computer desktop).
Inside are news bits gleaned from media around the globe, posters from the film and spy reports, including the latest gossip on the burgeoning line of upcoming toys.
One item, for instance, estimates exactly how many new Lego ``Star Wars'' Mindstorm Droid Developer Kits (each selling for $100) will be available at every Toys R Us this fall.
The Internet's ``Phantom Menace'' mania, however, isn't as shocking to some as the mainstream media's handling of both of the film and marketing in general.
``Everybody's talking about the hype,'' Entertainment Marketing Letter's Mayer says.
``The sense in the press is that (the film) is the second coming.
The truth is there is no next Beatles, there's no next Elvis.
There is just what there is''.
In effect, he says, ``the media is pushing how marketing is done''.
The press has definitely picked up on the ``Phantom Menace'' buzz.
Many newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, covered the debut of the first trailer.
USA Today has announced it will publish a package of ``Phantom Menace'' stories today.
The San Jose Mercury News began a weekly column on the coming film last Sunday.
And magazines like Vanity Fair have run extensive interviews.
Movieline even featured twentysomething movie and TV stars talking about their favorite ``Star Wars'' characters.
(``Felicity's'' Keri Russell, for example, admits she wore her hair in big, tight Princess Leia ear buns for two years after seeing the original film, which debuted in 1977).
To CNN's Moret, it's all pretty much justified.
``I don't look at our function as being a marketer of the film,'' he says.
``But if it's being embraced enough by moviegoers to obsess over seeing a trailer, if people are going to camp out to get the first tickets, that's a story''.
With this film, there's a ``clear indication for quality and blockbuster,'' Moret says.
``You don't often have both''.
Plus, he adds, all the hype and all the marketing and all the press and all the Web sites will only be too much ``when the fans say it is too much''.
Is it too much?
Certainly not for Keir Larock, 17, a student at the Maine School of Science and Mathematics in Limestone, Ma.
In a phone interview, he says he's seen the first three ``Star Wars'' films ``200 times each easily,'' has downloaded from the Internet at least seven copies of the first ``Phantom Menace'' trailer and is organizing via the Web his own group of fans to see the film on opening day.
``I was totally mystified'' while watching that trailer for the first time, he says.
``I saw my reason to live for the next six months''.

HOLLYWOOD _ The opening title reads: ``Every generation has a legend.
... Every journey has a first step.
... Every saga has a beginning''.
Then the John Williams music starts, the opening chords so unmistakable that movie audiences burst into applause.
``Star Wars'' is back.
Or more precisely, a 2-minute 10-second trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' the first ``Star Wars'' film since the release of ``Return of the Jedi'' 15 years ago.
The new film, written and directed by George Lucas, opens on May 21, but the anticipation for it is extraordinary, several distribution executives say.
The trailer was screened on Tuesday in 26 states on 75 screens selected by the movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox.
Fans heard about it four days earlier on the Lucasfilm Web site (www.starwars.com), and it quickly turned into a film event that had no precedent.
Theaters showing films like ``The Waterboy,'' ``The Siege'' and ``Meet Joe Black'' were crammed with people _ mostly young men _ who paid full admission just to see the trailer and left when the movie began.
The trailer was also shown after each movie ended, so a handful of theater owners allowed filmgoers to return with their torn ticket stub.
(Historically, trailers used to be shown after movies ended, hence the name).
``This is incredible,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.
, which monitors the box office for theater owners.
``We've never heard of a trailer packing people into a theater.
It's a precedent-setting event''.
He said the reaction to the gimmick made it inevitable that the new ``Star Wars'' would have powerful audience appeal.
``It's going to reach fever pitch with this movie, which is unquestionably going to be one of the biggest of 1999,'' Dergarabedian said.
Tom Sherak, the chairman of Fox's Domestic Film Group, said the idea for the early-in-the-week trailer, which was released nationally over the weekend, came from Lucas' associates.
``They said since they have such a big fan base, why not set something up just for the fans first and make sure it's shown to the rest of the public very quickly''? he said.
``The idea was to figure out a way to have fun with this.
`Star Wars' is part of the culture, but it's still a movie.
Let's treat it like a movie''.
Underscoring the box office impact of the trailer _ and the trailer alone _ were the substantial gains made on Tuesday night over Monday at theaters showing it.
At the Mann Theater in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, near the University of California, ``The Siege'' took in $13,000 on Tuesday night; it had taken in only $1,000 on Monday night.
At the Union Square Theater 14 in Manhattan, ``Meet Joe Black'' grossed $6,300 on Monday night, but $10,800 on Tuesday night.
The new ``Star Wars'' is the first of three planned prequels that will go back in time a full generation and detail the story of Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the mysterious and sinister Darth Vader.
In the new film, Skywalker is a 9-year-old boy and Obi-Wan Kenobi is a brash young Jedi knight.
Lucas himself has virtually total control over the film.
Not only has he put his personal fortune into it, he is in charge of its promotion and distribution.
No decisions are made without his approval.
The trailer itself shows glimpses of some of the film's stars: Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson as his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; Natalie Portman as the young Queen and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker.
Samuel L.
Jackson and Terence Stamp are also in the cast.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Whatever the mystique of ``Star Wars,'' the reaction to the trailer seemed to burn up the Internet.
It has been shown on the ``Star Wars'' Lucasfilm Web site, and was widely videotaped by fans when it was shown on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood''.
``The trailer felt like five seconds,'' said Harry Knowles, who founded the Ain't-It-Cool-News Web site (www.aint-it-cool-news.com), which is populated by movie fans obsessed with ``Star Wars''.
Over the Internet, Knowles seemed stricken with guilt about his early qualms about the new ``Star Wars''.
``I hate myself for every doubt I had,'' he said.
``What on earth was I ever thinking?
Analyzing every nugget, every whisper.
Worrying about reshoots and deadlines.
George seems to be 100 percent on his game''.
Other fans, on the Internet, talked about weeping and shaking while watching the trailer.
On Knowles' Web site, a fan named David Chung summed up his feelings: ``What can I say!
George Lucas must be a superior form of life!''
With about two weeks to go before the release of the new film ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' there are so many ``Star Wars'' sites on the Web that the creator of one site, Jedi Temple (www.spiderspace.net/jeditemple), felt compelled to list his favorite 100.
And that barely scratched the surface.
Hardly a shred of information or rumor about the $115 million ``Star Wars'' film has escaped legions of wired ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts.
``The information is pouring in like crazy from all over the world,'' said Steve Head, one of a dozen co-editors of The Force.net (www.theforce.net), a popular fan-created Web site that promises Web surfers ``your daily dose of `Star Wars'''.
``We used to have to fish for information,'' said Head, a 33-year-old real-estate marketing representative.
``Now the fish are flying out of the water''.
Many Web fans promptly package what they know (or think they know) and post it on sites that include clever design, often using stunning homemade artwork and computer graphics.
There are even homemade films that include take-offs on ``Star Wars'' characters, like ``Kung Fu Kenobi's Big Adventure'' (at The Force.net), one of several parodies made by Evan Mather, a 29-year-old landscape architect in Seattle.
``It's just taken on a life of its own,'' Lou Tambone said of his site at www.starwarz.com.
While he said that he is not a ``fanboy,'' mildly pejorative slang for an aggressively obsessive ``Star Wars'' fan, he did mention that the John Williams ``Star Wars'' theme was played at his wedding reception two years ago.
And on the wedding cake were figurines of Princess Leia and Han Solo.
Tambone, who is 29 and lives in Boston, said the Internet's relatively low cost, capacity for graphics and digital effects, and global reach made it a natural medium for the generation that grew up on ``Star Wars''.
Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television, agreed.
``The core audience of the Internet is the core audience of `Star Wars,''' he said.
The strong affinity among ``Star Wars'' fans for the Web has not been lost on the film's producers, who have answered the flood of fan sites with a deluge of hype of their own.
``What we found out was that a great way to communicate with our fans was through our Web site,'' said Jim Ward, director of marketing for Lucas' company, Lucasfilm Ltd.
``Rather than simply being a marketing device, we discovered that it is really a medium for entertainment and beyond''.
The site (www.starwars.com) offers its millions of Web visitors something new: truly insider information, production photographs and the occasional scoop.
It was on the site that Lucasfilm first released the name of the film, ``The Phantom Menace''.
It also used the site to announce the company's decision _ since rescinded _ to offer no advance ticket sales for ``The Phantom Menace'' for fear of ticket scalping.
When the film's first two-minute trailers went on the Internet last November, Web servers offering the teaser were swamped.
When the second trailer went on line in March, more than a million people downloaded it in a single day.
But long before Lucasfilm's publicity machine was thrown into hyperdrive, sites like www.jedinet.com, Starwarz and the Holocron (www.holocron.simplenet.com) were lush oases for those thirsting for speculation and gossip about the first ``Star Wars'' film in 16 years.
Newsdroid (www.newsdroid.com), subtitled Headline News for Star Wars Fans, recently explored the persistent rumor that Jake Lloyd, the child actor who portrays Darth Vader as a boy in the new film, has had his speaking parts redone by another child actor.
On Holocron, articles delve into such weighty topics as similarities between ``Star Wars'' and ``Gone With the Wind''.
One writer notes, for example, that in ``Star Wars'' the ``empire enslaves entire planets; the South enslaved an entire race''.
On several sites there is a petition drive to have a special card in a ``Star Wars'' board game be made to honor the memory of Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars'' fan who was shot and killed at Columbine High School in April in Littleton, Colo.
Practically every other mouse click on these sites leads to downloadable ``Star Wars'' photographs, screen savers, sounds, animated graphics, fan-made movie shorts and cartoons.
There are also links to collectibles for sale and trade, backgrounds on characters, vehicles and weapons, and well-marked ``spoilers'' _ glimpses, with words and sometimes pictures, of the new film's much-guarded plotline.
Some Webmasters of ``Star Wars'' sites claim to have pirated versions of the film's shooting script, a kind of bible they use to weed out wild rumors about how the action unfolds in the film.
And many claim to have vast networks of contacts and spies working on the film and many of its toy and promotional campaigns who feed the sites with provocative tidbits.
&QL; nn News Service &QC; When ``Star Wars'' blasted into movie theaters in 1977, the Internet was hardly a household word; it would be almost 20 years before the World Wide Web would begin appearing in American homes.
And nowhere among the futuristic light sabers and X-wing fighters was there a glimpse of anything that even slightly resembled the Net, which is a shame.
If Princess Leia could have just sent the rebels the stolen plans for the Death Star in an e-mail attachment (cc: Obi-Wan Kenobi), she could have saved everyone a lot of trouble.
But the Internet and PC-inspired technology appear to be exerting some influence on the look of the new ``Star Wars'' film, ``The Phantom Menace''.
For example, while there is still no explicit mention of anything like the Web on exotic planets like Naboo and Coruscant, there are a series of spiffy view screens that look like Palm Pilots you might find in a galaxy far, far away.
In tune with the esthetic sensibilities George Lucas has insisted upon for his ``Star Wars'' films, these view screens have the decidedly worn, retrofuturistic look of handheld computers that have seen better days.
``That's George's whole design philosophy, to make things very believable,'' said Doug Chiang, director of concept design for ``Phantom''.
The view screens, which Chiang said were not really supposed to be stand-ins for laptops and such, appear to be fashioned from alien metals and have organic details, like handles made from animal bones.
One even looks like a cross between a hand mirror and an old microphone from the golden age of radio.
``They're small versions of a TV set,'' Chiang said, adding that there was no real equivalent of the Internet in the new movie.
Lucas' idea is that technological evolution in the ``Star Wars'' universe occurred quite differently than it did on Earth, Chiang said.
The view screens, inspired by drawings made by Chiang, are mostly used in the film to permit characters to see things difficult to see otherwise, like a child who is far away.
The view screens are somewhat like computer screens linked to Webcams.
``Well, you see it, but it is never explained in the movie,'' Chiang conceded.
``George doesn't like to focus on the technology.''
Does any adventure series have a greater _ and more supremely deserved _ reservoir of good will going for it than ``Star Wars''?
At a preview screening last week in San Francisco, the keyed-up audience for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' cheered the dimming of the lights before the film even began.
They cheered the Lucasfilm logo.
They even cheered Rupert (talk about an evil empire)!
Murdoch's 20th Century Fox logo.
They cheered the slogan ``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away''.
Truth to tell, there were more cheers at the beginning than there were, almost 2 1/4 hours later, at the end.
Right off the bat, Ewan McGregor, as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, echoes Han Solo's ``I have a bad feeling about this''.
It would be merely clever and terribly unfair to say ``Star Wars'' fans might share that sentiment.
Is ``The Phantom Menace'' worth seeing?
What a question!
Of course it is.
It is a stunning spectacle, maybe even Industrial Light &AMP; Magic's greatest special-effects achievement.
But creator George Lucas has left a lot of room for improvement, particularly for character development and emotional juice, in this beginning of the second trilogy.
We have every right to assume _ to demand _ that the next two episodes will accomplish exactly that.
For the moment, there are high hopes for a promise not yet fully satisfied.
The most distinctive thing about ``The Phantom Menace,'' which opens Wednesday, is the extraordinary degree to which it is animation _ far, far and away more so than any previous ``Star Wars''.
An accurate categorization of it would be sci-fi, live-action animated feature.
From richly imagined new computer-generated characters who interact uncannily with the human actors to a strategically paced bonanza of extended, huge-scale, self-contained sequences, the computer-generated animation is a marvel of solidity, density, color subtlety and 3-D depth.
It is truly out there.
The action introduces us to Anakin Skywalker, the 9-year-old we already know will become not only Darth Vader but also the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.
Two Jedi knights, dispatched as ambassadors to broker peace between the intergalactic Trade Federation and the idealistic planet Naboo, believe that they have discovered along the way the Chosen One who will bring the galaxy into equilibrium with the Force.
Remember the Force?
It's not the seat-rattling sound that rumbles through the theater when spaceships accelerate, but it could've fooled me.
The new computer-generated creature Jar Jar Binks also brings off the illusion.
A buddy of Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), Jar Jar kind of fills the Chewbacca vacuum.
He has droopy ears, bulging eyes on stems and a humanoid torso.
He's got an anteater's wandering tongue and a hipster's walk, put to delightful use in a dance of celebration with New Orleans-style prancing droids.
Ironically in ``The Phantom Menace,'' the animated characters have more human juice to them than the live ones.
The humans, low-key and one-dimensional, are the stick figures.
This new trilogy needs a lovable rascal like Han Solo and a bitchy, bossy princess like Leia _ somebody to set off some sparks.
The stolid Neeson is warmer than anyone has a right to expect, and even his Buddhist platitudes (``Be mindful of the moment'') are never burdensome.
My favorite: ``The ability to speak does not make them intelligent''.
The prevailing message is: We must learn to help one another.
McGregor is more of a problem.
As the living prequel to the saint of the series, in a brush cut with a topknot that seems to have slipped down the back of his head, McGregor seldom shows his natural vivacity as an actor and, especially, his unpredictability.
An Alec Guinness imitation is interesting only up to a point.
Natalie Portman has grown up from the 11-year-old urchin in Luc Besson's ``The Professional'' and now is a regal, perhaps too regal, queen of Naboo and something of a clothes horse.
One of her costumes recalls the Elizabethan age, and another is very Japanese.
She has one stripe of lip gloss on her lower lip, and it's likely that teenage girls already are imitating it.
There are some shocks and surprises along the way, and Portman is involved in one of the best.
The big question about Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), to my mind, is what planted the seeds that led to his embracing the dark side of the Force as Darth Vader.
As yet, we don't know.
A slightly younger but still wispy-haired Yoda says that ``fear is the path to the dark side,'' but the Anakin we see is resourceful and brave.
He's already involved in the creation of a see-through C-3P0 droid, and the nearby prototype of R2-D2 is greeted by the audience like an old friend.
Fighter-pilot son Luke will be a chip off the old block, as we see in Anakin's entry in the pod race.
The cab of his aircraft, by the way, sometimes hangs behind the free-floating jets and, in the twists and turns through canyons, sometimes precedes them.
&UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; (MORE) &LR; &QL; The battles and other set pieces, such as the pod race, go off like a carefully timed string of firecrackers.
The computer-generated landscapes, cityscapes and seascapes are awesome.
An underwater city is surrounded by an increasingly ripping series of marine monsters that sequentially gobble each other up.
``There's always a bigger fish,'' Neeson observes drily.
The cityscapes range from pre-Mayan and Babylonian to Venetian canals and the precipitous, illuminated towers of skyscrapers.
One battle takes place on an enormous plain, and a climactic lightsaber fight is waged among ramps, platforms and infinitely deep crevasses.
Among the creatures are ants-on-their-hind-feet cannon fodder called battle droids.
Another new one is the greedy, winged slave master of Anakin.
His bet with Qui-Gon Jinn leads up to the pod race.
The ever-resourceful Jedi knight has a jujitsu-like knowledge of how to let an opponent defeat himself.
The celebratory scene, a hallmark of Lucas' films and, I think, of his philosophy, features some of John Williams' new music, which otherwise tends to fade from consciousness with overfamiliarity.
Jar Jar, by the way, sometimes seems to sound like the Central American houseboy in Robin Williams' ``The Birdcage''.
There are other intriguing dialect choices, such as the Federation reps who seem to speak English with a Mandarin accent.
Before Tuesday's show started, a representative of the publicity agency presenting the screening asked audience members to report any camcorders they spotted among them.
Piracy is a serious international problem, of course, but anybody who sees a shaky copy of ``The Phantom Menace'' on a small screen with tinny sound is missing the point.
The need for the ``special edition'' remake of Episodes IV, V and VI, adding landscapes and cityscapes to put the action in a more believable context, must have arisen during creation of the extraordinary environment for ``The Phantom Menace''.
People may have forgotten how low-rent and underpopulated the original ``Star Wars'' was in 1977, with its tacky sets and ragtag little kids disguised in hoods.
In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond.
In energy, not yet.
&UR; STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE: &LR; Science fiction.
Written and directed by George Lucas.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --Now that a few people have actually seen the new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded to the buzz.
And the buzz is...
well, don't expect a masterpiece, just a really good movie with cool special effects.
In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.
``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace'' was screened Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets.
Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19.
``Guys, it's a movie''! responded Tom Sherak, distribution head of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas.
``It isn't the Bible!
It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism.
But it's a movie''.
Uh huh.
In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans.
``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it feels like 'Star Wars'.
However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are going to walk away satisfied with?
Well ...
perhaps, but not for everyone,'' Epstein wrote.
While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was annoying.
Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be ``PHENOMENAL''!!!!
``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he said.
``I did''.
On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow!
What a film.
I'm going to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in''.
But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed.
``It was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a nightmare,'' Job21 said.
That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would suggest he was there.
As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual tempered thumbs-up --they praised the movie just enough to avoid losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract higher fees for showing the film.
The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz --or for that matter the reactions from the professional critics who see ``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc. ``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said.
``I think it doesn't matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent.
The film is going to play big in those first two weeks without question''.
After that ...
the Force only knows .
TOKYO (AP) --Kabuki-style makeup.
Samurai-style swordplay.
A director who confesses a love for the work of Akira Kurosawa.
The ``Star Wars'' space fantasy series holds a special appeal for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic samurai films.
The first ``Star Wars'' movie was inspired in part by ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director.
Fans in Japan were quick to find elements of Japan's feudal warlord culture in the 1977 movie, citing everything from the design of villainous Darth Vader's costume to the samurai-style swordplay, albeit with lightsabers.
Director George Lucas, in Tokyo on Wednesday to plug the new film, acknowledged his debt to Kurosawa.
``He's just a master that you work toward (hoping) that someday you can reach that level,'' Lucas said.
Even so, audiences here won't get a look at the film until opening day, July 10.
Although ``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace'' opened in the United States and Canada on May 19, it won't be released in many Asian and European nations until mid- to late summer.
For many Japanese fans, that's just too much to ask.
Hiroshi Kobayashi, a 27-year-old graduate student whose business card reads ``Star Wars Evangelist,'' was one of 30 Japanese fans who flew to Los Angeles last month to see the new film.
The lack of Japanese subtitles made the dialogue hard to follow, but he still gave it a thumbs up.
``It had a great visual impact,'' he said.
After its release in the United States, ``The Phantom Menace'' earned more than $205 million in a record 13 days.
Industry experts here are optimistic.
Most expect it to go over well with the Japanese audience.
Toshio Furusawa, 20th Century Fox's marketing director in Japan, said pre-release ticket sales have been strong and that demand for 4,000 passes to a ``Star Wars'' fan event held last month exceeded availability by 30 times.
``The movie looks like it was made for audiences in Japan,'' said Japanese film critic Yuichi Tanuma, who attended a special showing for the media last month in Tokyo.
He said ``The Phantom Menace'' has touches of Japanese influence in the Kabuki-style facial makeup sported by the evil Darth Maul and Zen-like meditation practiced by the heroic Jedi knights.
SEATTLE _ The Force pulsates through the front door.
Turn the knob.
Walk in.
Slowly. Look out!
It's Darth Vader, 7 feet tall, leering in the foyer.
His red and green chest lights flash mean and fast.
Dash to the bedroom.
More trouble.
A blaster-toting Imperial Stormtrooper is crouched in a corner.
Gotta escape!
Where? Think.
The back patio.
Almost there....
A few more steps....
Oh no!
Boba Fett is blocking the way _ and his laser is about to get personal.
Doom looms.
Then, from out of the blue, a voice of salvation: ``How would you like some of my world-famous spaghetti sauce''?
Welcome to the universe _ actually the Kirkland, Wash.
, home _ of Lauren Bock, where a zeal for ``Star Wars'' and homemade Italian cooking makes for out-of-this-world fun.
Bock and his family are among the top collectors of ``Star Wars'' memorabilia in the Pacific Northwest.
He has almost every boxed action figure connected to George Lucas' popular movie trilogy.
All told, more than 4,000 4-inch and 12-inch ``Star Wars'' dolls, including vintage items, populate his home.
Now, with excitement building for next month's premiere of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' it's boom time for Bock and other collectors.
Last week, a video crew from cable TV's Sci-Fi Channel dropped by to tape a show due out in early May.
The topic?
``Star Wars'' uber-fans.
Bock says he has been spending $100-a-day on stuff related to the saga _ from bar soap with a tiny R2D2 inside to his latest find: Star Wars shampoo.
Since the series kicked off in the late 1970s, sales of ``Star Wars'' toys, games, soundtracks and books have topped $4 billion, according to Warman's Today's Collector Magazine, a leading trade publication.
And `Phantom's'' spinoff sales alone could break the $1 billion mark, analysts say.
In recent years, Bock has forked out tens of thousands of dollars for his still-growing stash.
The 57-year-old retired insurance adjuster got his purchasing power after taking a big gamble: He sold off two rental properties and put the profits, along with part of an inheritance, into Microsoft stock in the late '80s.
``My toy money,'' he jokes.
A 5-by-6-foot model of the spaceship Millennium Falcon, its gun turrets pumping red lasers, swoops from his living room ceiling.
A television, 65 inches wide, blares ``The Empire Strikes Back'' (Bock's favorite flick).
The walls of his hallways are blanketed with signed pictures from stars of the space trilogy.
Need to go to the bathroom?
Be forewarned... eyes from hundreds of creatures from a galaxy far, far away will be on you.
But these items are just the trailer before the main attraction.
Bock's best stuff is in an upstairs bedroom and in the basement.
Both rooms are brimming with ``Star Wars'' paraphernalia: Two pinball machines, two stand-alone arcade games and two wood-and-glass cases chock-full of dolls, ceramic cookie jars and Frisbee-size rubber molds used to make ``Star Wars'' commemorative coins.
``It's just so much fun,'' Bock gushes, his arms spread high and wide.
``God, it's great''!
It's the second Wednesday of April, and Bock's home is officially Sarlacc's Pit _ named after Lucas' omnivorous, multi-tentacled creature with sharp teeth.
Pit members have fashioned an appropriate acronym: Seattle ARea Lucasfilm Artifacts Collectors Club.
The monthly gathering brings together more than 40 people who watch ``Star Wars'' videos, dress up in movie costumes and weigh the latest flick gossip.
They also clear up misinformation _ the bane of the serious collector.
But in no way, they insist, do members ``geek out''.
``We are not like Trekkies,'' says one visitor.
This meeting, however, is particularly festive.
Maybe it's because the prequel is about a month away, or because the sun is out or because the Sci-Fi Channel crew is giddy to have the members circle a table and parody a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.
(``Hi, my name is Bill.
I'm a Star War-holic'').
In any case, light sabers are swinging.

NEW YORK (AP) --With ``Star Wars'' mania heating up across the nation, retailers are gearing up for what's expected to be one of the biggest rollouts of licensed merchandise in history.
Toys R Us is expected to announce on Wednesday that most of its 1,500 stores will open at 12:01 a.m. on May 3, the first day that merchants are permitted to sell goods based on ``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace''.
The Paramus, N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large area of its stores entirely to the ``Star Wars'' line.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
, the nation's biggest retailer, told The Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of ``Star Wars'' items beginning on May 3.
``Star Wars''-related goods --from snack foods to body lotion to skateboards -- will be found in 16 of the 36 different departments in Wal-Mart's stores.
``Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related merchandise than any other film in our history,'' said Les Copeland, spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.
Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming from toy sales.
The movie debuts May 19.
Merchants expect anxious ``Star Wars'' fans --oth children and avid adult collectors -- to begin lining up well-before midnight on May 3, hoping to be one of the first to get a glimpse of the movie merchandise.
``Star Wars'' director George Lucas signed strict licensing deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing virtually all information on their products to the general public, including the media.
Lucas, who financed the $115 million movie himself, also chose the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves.
Given the huge demand for this merchandise, merchants will keep the ``Star Wars'' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin stocking store shelves late on May 2.
NEW YORK (AP) --The Force is with ``Star Wars'' fans, and it's telling them to hit the toy stores early and spend, spend, spend.
The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history --for the still unreleased ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' -- is finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule, and fans and retailers aren't wasting a minute.
In an unprecedented move, Toys R Us stores around the country decided to open their doors at 12:01 a.m.
Monday for an all-night selling marathon of toys based on the movie.
Some FAO Schwarz stores planned to open from midnight to 2 a.m.
Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for their 24-hour stores to handle the post-midnight crowds.
Many stores planned to limit the number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate sell-outs.
By 6 p.m.
EDT, some fans were already lining up to get first dibs on the new merchandise.
``We've been getting lots of phone calls and there are already people out there,'' said Randy Perkins, a manager at the Wal-Mart store in Rome, N.Y.
``We expect this to be a busy night''.
Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night surfers with an itch to buy.
Internet merchants Amazon.com and eToys planned to open their online ``Star Wars'' stores just after midnight.
Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast array of goods --from action figures to wigs to body lotion to snack food -- tied to the movie, which opens May 19.
But LucasFilm Ltd.
had signed strict licensing deals that prevented manufacturers from releasing virtually any information about their products ahead of time.
As a result, people had been speculating for months, especially on the Internet, about what the toys and other merchandise would be.
``Right now, people are just frothing at the mouth,'' said Omaha resident Dean Phillips, a ``Star Wars'' merchandise collector.
Jeff Van Pelt had already figured out that he'd spend about $150 at Toys R Us on Monday morning.
``I have gone online, gotten a list of things that's expected to come out, so I have an idea of what I'm getting,'' said Van Pelt of Concord, N.H.
Die-hard fans who turned out for a Star Wars convention in Denver on Friday got a sneak-peek at some of the merchandise.
There were eight basic action figures, which are 3 3/4 inches tall, including the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man; Anakin Skywalker, the father of Luke Skywalker and the man who later became Darth Vader; Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature; and Queen Amidala, the leader of the ``good'' side.
The action figures retail for $7 to $8, while related computer gear to make them talk costs an additional $20 to $25.
A collection of Queen Amidala fashion dolls also was introduced.
And there was a 3-D diorama that recreates memorable movie scenes.
Analysts estimate that sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming just from toys.
Many stores kept the ``Star Wars'' merchandise locked up until late Sunday, when they began stocking shelves.
At some stores, managers were not even permitted to see the merchandise until the last minute.
Some stores created a party atmosphere for the late-night crowds.
At a Toys R Us in southeast Oklahoma City, there was a costume contest as well as a tent set up where they could watch the first ``Star Wars'' movies.
In Omaha, the Toys R Us served cakes in the shape of ``Star Wars'' characters.
&LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the hype had subsided, ``Star Wars'' fans are flooding the Internet with impassioned pleas to pack the theaters once again.
You'd think George Lucas himself was behind the international movement, but two Internet site creators operating out of Maryland are claiming credit for the idea.
June 19, they have proclaimed, will be Fan Day.
In celebration of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace's'' one-month anniversary, they want devotees to gather their friends, dress as their favorite characters and go see the movie over and over again, just like on opening day of the much-anticipated prequel.
Their plan: Dethrone ``Titanic,'' current king of the box-office gross chart.
It's a lofty goal, considering the movie had only climbed to 11th-highest grosser of all time as of close of business Thursday, reaping a total of $271.3 million by its 23rd day in theaters.
``Forrest Gump'' and ``Lion King'' were still ahead of the ``Phantom''.
But Simon Daoudi, 21, of Tarzana, Calif.
, is paying no mind to the movie pundits who have widely declared ``Phantom'' an attendance dud.
``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the movie and believe in `Star Wars' again _ and try to make it pass `Titanic,''' said Daoudi, the self-anointed man in charge of Los Angeles' Fan Day.
The Pierce College student is occupying much of his time trying to spread the word about Fan Day.
He's circulating Fan Day fliers.
He's making up Fan Day badges that participants can wear around their necks that day.
He's even tried recruiting toy stores and movie theaters to sponsor and host the event.
But talk about a phantom menace.
Many of his efforts have fallen flat.
Toy companies aren't interested in supplying free lightsabers to fans in line.
And a disappointed Daoudi discovered last week that Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, site of all the craze on opening day, won't even be showing the film anymore by the time Fan Day arrives.
Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Mann Theaters, said taking ``Phantom'' off the schedules at Mann's Chinese and its Westwood Village locations after June 17 was decided long before the movie debuted.
``Regardless of what happened, that was just the deal that we made with Fox,'' said Baker.
The film, she said, met Mann's expectations for attendance, with long lines waiting to get in at both theaters during the first week.
But the crowds diminished after that, and on Friday, ``The General's Daughter'' will replace ``Phantom'' on the marquee.
``They go, `It's been there long enough.
We gotta show other movies,' '' Daoudi said.
``I go, in my head, `Stupid mooove'.
'' But he pressed on, redirecting local fans to celebrate at Burbank's AMC 14 theater, which is scheduled to begin showing the film in its new digital format starting Friday.
AMC officials, however, are distancing themselves from Fan Day.
``We've learned that anything, particularly connected to `Star Wars,' is a very sensitive issue,'' said Richard Fay, president of AMC.
Fay said this was the first he'd heard of any individual or group promoting the movie as an event a month after its opening.
And while the intentions are good, even he had doubts that the fan-driven campaign could help ``Phantom'' steal ``Titanic's'' top spot.
``It's an interesting idea, but they've got a long way to go to do that,'' Fay said.
``But anything is possible, especially, as I've learned, when it comes to movies''.

HONG KONG (AP) --A week after the new Star Wars blockbuster opened in the United States, pirated copies have already hit store shelves in Hong Kong and Macau.
Pirated video CDs of ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' are widely available in shopping malls for Hong Kong for $3.20 to $3.80, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.
In nearby Macau, the pirated VCDs are selling for about $1.50.
The ``Star Wars'' film, which began screening in the United States last Wednesday, is scheduled to be screened in Hong Kong in July.
It became the fastest movie to reach $100 million (five days, versus six for ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'').
Despite rampant crack downs by customs officials, pirated CDs, VCDs and software are still widely available in Hong Kong and Macau.
TOKYO (AP) --Brandishing light sabers, Japanese ``Star Wars'' fans welcomed the opening Saturday of the hit film in the land credited with inspiring the saga.
Hundreds lined up as early as Friday morning at select theaters for a special countdown ceremony for the arrival of ``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace''.
Some wore costumes of Darth Vader, Yoda and other ``Star Wars'' characters.
And the crowd broke out into a cheer when the film finally began.
``The special effects are so awesome,'' said Shingo Oyama, a 19-year-old college student, lining up with a friend outside a Tokyo theater.
Like many others, Oyama has seen all three previous ``Star Wars'' films and was dead set on seeing the latest on opening day.
The film's makers have made no secret that the work owes much to Asian influences: the kimono-like costuming, the sword-fighting scenes, the Kabukiesque makeup, and, of course, the epic fable of good vs.
evil. Director George Lucas, who came to Japan in person last month to plug the film, is an avid fan of the late Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa.
Some Asian-Americans have complained about stereotyping.
But the Japanese haven't minded a bit, seeming to see it all as an honor.
For months, TV shows here have featured hype on the film, sometimes showing off ``Star Wars'' products like action figures and T-shirts.
Die-hards, who couldn't wait to see the movie, went all the way to the United States, where it opened May 19.
With such anticipation, the arrival of the film at more than 400 theaters nationwide was a jubilant affair.
At the Miyukiza theater in Tokyo more than 1,000 people packed three showings.
``They were clapping from joy, shaking their light sabers,'' said theater employee Akinari Matsumoto.
But not all gave the film a thumbs-up.
``The visual effects were fantastic, but there wasn't much content to the story,'' said Shinichiro Oka, a 31-year-old computer engineer.
``Still, seeing `Star Wars' is an important thing to do.
It was worthwhile.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Summer blockbuster?
Without a doubt.
A sci-fi masterpiece that will please all its fans?
Probably not, but it's got some cool effects.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting box-office records, but it is not alone.
``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace'' was North America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 days.
``Independence Day'' set the previous record in 21 days in 1996.
But another kind of star power --Julia Roberts -- helped ``Notting Hill'' pull in $27.8 million, the biggest opening ever for a romantic comedy.
``The Wedding Singer,'' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, earned $21.9 million in three days last year.
The comparable three-day figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million.
``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill ride'' fans, studio executives said, while the love story between Ms.
Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place.
Still, the ``Star Wars'' film is flying.
It already holds records for opening day and five-day totals, and is the fastest to break the $100 million barrier (five days).
``The movie's like a thoroughbred.
We put it on the track every day and it doesn't disappoint you,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th Century Fox.
He said families are the key to the repeat business if ``Phantom'' is to thrive in the summer blockbuster season.
Universal's strategy to open its films before and after ``Star Wars'' paid off.
``The Mummy,'' the studio's own thrill ride movie, was in third place last weekend with $12.7 million.
It has grossed $117.1 million in four weeks.
``The marketplace has got to support more than one movie.
There are different tastes,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal.
The only other new film in wide release, ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' opened in fifth place.
The sci-fi film noir had a disappointing $4.3 million, industry estimates showed Monday.
``The Love Letter,'' also billed as a romantic alternative, tanked in its second week, dropping out of the top 10 list with a gross of $1.3 million.
Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc.: 1.
``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace,'' $64.8 million.
2. ``Notting Hill,'' $27.8 million.
3. ``The Mummy,'' $12.7 million.
4. ``Entrapment,'' $6.3 million.
5. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $4.3 million.
6. ``The Matrix,'' $3.1 million.
7. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $2.004 million.
8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $2 million.
9. ``Life,'' $1.4 million.
10. ``Election,'' $1.38 million.
If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie has a timely snack to sate your appetite.
McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc.
, the maker of the popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and eject pellet-size sweets.
His company, known for its dispensers of Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a galaxy far, far away.
Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace''.
The new dispensers show the heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the furry-faced Ewoks.
The company already has other well-known ``Star Wars'' faces in its arsenal _ Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers, Yoda and Chewbacca.
More are coming.
McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer.
``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars'' collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in Orange, Conn.
``It's a big thing for us''.
It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style.
In 1996, PEZ bigwigs trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German word for peppermint _ pfefferminz.
``They loved us, we loved them,'' McWhinnie explained.
But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year _ 1997 _ the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored and returned to the big screen.
So they were pleasantly surprised when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world.
``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains.
Fast forward to 1999.
Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters _ on top of the 150 characters currently in production _ to the Pez family.
For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps _ until the ``Phantom'' appears.
``I can't tell you (about those) characters,'' McWhinnie said with a chuckle.
``I was at a private showing.
I had to sign my name to get in.''
BALTIMORE _ In the year he has suffered from osteoarthritis, Harold Katcoff has followed his doctors' advice, to no avail: aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs.
The pills, he says, offer little relief from the stabbing pain in the back of his knees.
So Katcoff, an 80-year-old retired pharmacist, is trying Chinese medicine instead.
Or at least, he thinks he is.
Every Tuesday and Thursday since late November, Katcoff has come here, to Kernan Hospital, to see an acupuncturist who pokes him with 20 needles, nine in each leg and two in the belly, and then hooks the probes to a mild electrical current.
The patient is convinced that the therapy works.
``It's fantastic,'' Katcoff says.
But in the same breath, he admits that he cannot be certain if the effect is real or imagined.
That is because Katcoff may be receiving sham acupuncture _ needle sticks in places where, according to the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, they should not do any good.
He is a volunteer in a $2.5 million federally financed study, run by a rheumatology professor and a family-practice doctor at the University of Maryland.
The study represents a new wave in academic medicine: the application of rigorous, Western scientific methods _ including the gold standard of medical research, the placebo, or fake therapy, as a control _ to test alternative therapies, from ginkgo biloba to shark cartilage to a mystical Chinese healing art known as qi gong.
Just five years ago, many academics would not have gone near such studies, for fear they would become laughingstocks.
And while alternative therapies remain hugely controversial in the stodgy world of science _ ``quackupuncture'' is how one vocal critic, Dr.
Victor Herbert of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, summed up the University of Maryland's work _ large, multimillion-dollar clinical trials are getting under way this year at some of the nation's most prestigious university hospitals.
``The scientific games have begun,'' declared Dr.
David Eisenberg, director of the Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston.
Or, as Dr.
Barrie Cassileth, chief of integrative medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said: ``The research is just coming into its maturity.
It's bar mitzvah time''.
The boom is being driven by the National Institutes of Health, which, under pressure from Congress, has sharply increased its budget for studies of alternative medicine.
Eight years ago, much to the chagrin of institute leaders, Congress required the institutes to establish an Office of Alternative Medicine, a tiny operation with a budget to match, just $2 million.
``It was,'' said Dr.
Daniel Moerman, a medical anthropologist at the University of Michigan, ``like setting up an office of deviltry within the Catholic Church''.
But after a rocky beginning, the office is gaining acceptance at the institutes and is setting the tone for scientists around the country.
Last year, Congress upgraded the office, making it the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which means it now has grant-making authority.
Its yearly budget has grown to $68 million.
In October, a new director came on board, Dr.
Stephen E.
Straus, a virologist and longtime NIH insider whom Dr.
Harold Varmus, the former director of the institutes and once one of the program's biggest detractors, describes as ``a really distinguished scientist''.
At the same time, hospitals and medical schools are bowing to economic reality: alternative medicine is big business.
According to the Nutrition Business Journal, an industry trade publication, Americans spent $27.2 billion in 1998 on providers of alternative health care, including those in chiropractic, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy and massage therapy.
Sales of herbs are also growing, to $4.4 billion last year, from nearly $2.5 billion in 1995, the journal said.
A survey of more than 2,000 adults, conducted by Eisenberg and published in November 1998 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated that 46 percent of the American population had visited a practitioner of alternative health care in 1997, up from 36 percent in 1990.
Patients like Katcoff, who had never before tried alternative therapies, are increasingly doing so.
``Consumers are saying, I want some type of care and I will pay for it out of pocket if I need to,'' said Dr.
Brian Berman, the principal investigator in the Maryland acupuncture study.
``I think that has been heard by the medical establishment''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) But applying Western methods to Eastern traditions may be easier said than done, as Berman well knows.
For one thing, how do you do placebo acupuncture?
Berman and a Chinese colleague, Dr.
Lixing Lao, ran several experiments just to figure out a technique that, they say, can reliably fool patients.
And medical concepts do not easily translate.
The diagnosis ``osteoarthritis of the knee'' does not exist in traditional Chinese medicine.
The closest translation, Lao said, was ``the knee area is energy blocked''.
Cultural clashes aside, the work proceeds.
At Duke University, 330 patients are being enrolled in a study of St.
John's wort, an herb that is thought to relieve mild depression.
One-third of the participants will receive the herb, one-third will receive a placebo and one-third will receive Zoloft, a commonly prescribed drug.
In Houston, the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center has just begun testing shark cartilage as a treatment for lung cancer; the study, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, will involve as many as 700 patients who will receive either shark cartilage or a dummy pill in addition to conventional treatment.
And at the University of Michigan, Dr.
Steven F.
Bolling, a heart transplant surgeon who describes himself as ``the high priest of techno-medicine,'' is surprised to find himself examining whether practitioners of the Chinese art of qi gong can help his cardiac surgery patients recover faster.
One-third of the patients in the clinical trial will be visited by a qi gong master, who performs slow-motion exercises that are said to release a healing energy.
One-third will be visited by an impostor and one-third will not have visits.
``If it's proven, it works and it helps my patients,'' Bolling said, ``so be it''.
The trend is affecting the training of young doctors as well.
Two-thirds of the nation's medical schools now have courses on alternative medicine, many of them to teach doctors how to handle questions from patients.
Harvard Medical School is about to begin a fellowship program to train internists in how to conduct research on alternative therapies.
``We need a small army of clinician researchers who will do this work now,'' said Eisenberg, the co-director, ``and for the next generation''.
The story of how alternative medicine has worked its way into the mainstream of scientific research begins not with scientists, but politicians.
In the late 1980s, Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, became chairman of the subcommittee that holds the purse strings to NIH.
At about that time, Harkin said, a friend, Rep.
Berkley Bedell, D-Iowa, became ill with Lyme disease and prostate cancer, and resigned from Congress.
``A couple of years after that, Berkley came to see me and he looked like a new man,'' Harkin said.
``He told me about a strange cure he had taken, an alternative approach.
I was just amazed''.
Harkin has since become an aficionado of alternative medicine himself: He takes bee pollen for his allergies, a practice that critics find silly.
But Harkin may have had the last laugh.
In 1991, he inserted a provision into the NIH appropriations bill requiring the institutes to create an Office of Alternative Medicine, with a $2 million budget.
``They fought it and fought it and fought it,'' Harkin said in a recent interview.
``You'd think I was single-handedly destroying NIH by spending $2 million on alternative therapies''.
The amount was indeed a drop in the bucket for the institutes, an agency that now has a $15 billion annual budget.
The tiny office on alternative care was set up in a remote outpost, nowhere near the institutes' main campus in Bethesda, Md.
Its mission was complicated.
Alternative medicine is such a vast conglomeration of practices, ranging from the use of vitamins and herbs, to meditation, massage, movement therapy and acupuncture, that even its practitioners cannot agree on what to call it.
(The terms ``complementary,'' ``integrative'' and ``alternative'' are used interchangeably).
The office began by offering small grants of $30,000 each.
Soon, it was drawing fierce criticism for spending taxpayers' money on projects of dubious scientific merit.
``The quality was incredibly low,'' Varmus said.
``The investigators who were applying didn't really know much about science''.
In 1994, Congress took a step that would have a major effect on patients' access to alternative therapies.
It passed a law that permits manufacturers to make claims about health benefits for herbal medicines whose safety and effectiveness had not been proved by the usual standards applied to prescription drugs.
Now, said Cassileth, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, ``Everybody can play doctor and buy anything they want over the counter and treat themselves''.
Good research became even more necessary, she said.
But the battles at NIH continued.
The alternative medicine office ran through a string of directors.
The man who took the job in 1995, Dr.
Wayne B.
Jonas, drew criticism because he practiced homeopathy, a 200-year-old system of medicine in which illnesses are often treated with diluted solutions of plant extracts.
Most mainstream scientists, including Varmus, take a dim view of homeopathy.
As a result, said Jonas, who left the institutes at the end of 1998, he had a difficult time getting approval of proposals to finance research.
But as Congress continued to appropriate more money for the office and public interest grew, Varmus said, ``I came to feel that there was a real public health concern that NIH had a responsibility to address''.
By 1996, the alternative medicine office had moved onto the main institutes' campus, and Varmus had formed an advisory group of government scientists to set priorities.
The alternative medicine literature contains thousands of studies, but the majority are scientifically flawed.
Varmus wants scientists to test the most promising and most widely used therapies.
But the critics remain.
Herbert, the Mount Sinai professor, calls the institutes' center on alternative medicine ``a worthless waste of money'' that was ``set up to promote fraud''.
Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said the center had so far failed to publish any significant articles in scientific journals.
``The proof is in the pudding,'' Dr.
Angell said.
``Just show me the papers''.
That may take some time.
It will be three to four years, Straus predicts, before the current crop of clinical trials is complete.
Still, in a recent interview, Straus came armed with two loose-leaf notebooks full of articles that had grown from NIH-financed research, some published in the respected Journal of the American Medical Association.
He acknowledged that the center ``still has to prove itself''.
But, he said, ``I predict it will''.
For the American health care system, the implications of the new research will be vast, medically and economically.
Health maintenance organizations are just beginning to cover some alternative therapies; Oxford Health Plans, for instance, offers coverage for acupuncture.
If therapies being tested prove effective, patients will undoubtedly begin demanding coverage.
The new research could be a boon to manufacturers of herbs.
Several manufacturers of dietary supplements are beginning studies of products like ginkgo and St.
John's wort that could lead to their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, in the same way the agency approves prescription drugs, said Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association, a trade group.
The University of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is joining Chinese scientists to develop herbal medicines as drugs.
In addition, Dr.
Steven DeKosky, who directs the university's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, has also received a $3 million NIH grant to see if the ginkgo herb can prevent dementia.
Two thousand elderly patients will be enrolled.
If it works, he said, the next step will be to isolate the active ingredients and figure out how they work.
Some researchers, including Eisenberg of Harvard, say alternative therapies will not be truly accepted as mainstream until scientists can prove not just that they work, but how.
But already, medical practice is opening up, said Dr.
Marc C.
Hochberg, the rheumatology professor at the University of Maryland, who is an investigator in the acupuncture study.
This year, acupuncture was mentioned for the first time in the American College of Rheumatology's guidelines for medical management of osteoarthritis of the knee.
``Our work has opened people's eyes,'' he said.
``This used to be in the same ball park as copper bracelets.
I think we have taken acupuncture for osteoarthritis out of that realm''.
Still, Hochberg said, an important question remains: does the acupuncture really work, or is it just the placebo effect?
Hochberg hopes to have an answer by 2002.
As for Katcoff, he is sold.
He said he had been reading up on Chinese medicine, and had learned that even people who did not believe in it could benefit.
``I think I'm getting the real goods,'' he said recently, moments after a treatment.
``I've been going twice a week, and this is my fifth week, and I can honestly say that the pains in the back of my legs are gone.''
NEW YORK (AP) --Monsanto's highly successful painkiller Celebrex has been linked to 10 deaths and 11 cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhages in its first three months on the market, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
Half of the 10 people who died suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, according to ``adverse incident'' reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration that were obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act.
Two other deaths were attributed to heart attacks, one to drug interaction and one to kidney disorder.
No cause of death was given for the 10th fatality.
A Monsanto spokeswoman said Tuesday that there is no evidence that Celebrex actually caused the deaths or other health problems in people taking the drug.
More than 2 million consumers have taken Celebrex.
``You can't draw any conclusions from the adverse incident reports,'' said spokeswoman Scarlett Lee Foster.
The Journal did not specify the sources of the adverse event reports, which could come from health professionals, consumers or the drug company itself.
Celebrex, manufactured by St.
Louis-based Monsanto Co.'s G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.
subsidiary, went on the market in January to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Celebrex was touted by Monsanto as an effective pain reliever much like ibuprofen, but was much less likely to cause severe stomach problems such as bleeding ulcers.
So far it has been a gigantic success: 2.5 million prescriptions have been filled in its first 13 weeks on the market, compared with the record 2.7 million prescriptions of anti-impotency drug Viagra filled during its first three months.
Robert DeLap, director of an FDA office of drug evaluation, told the Journal that more research needs to be done before coming to a conclusion about Celebrex's safety.
``Do we think there's a signal that the product poses some special risk?
No, not at the moment''.
Searle officials told the Journal they remain excited about Celebrex's performance.
``We really feel the drug is performing as expected.
The safety profile is what we would expect,'' said Steve Geis, the company's vice president for arthritis clinical research.
Geis declined to go into details about any cases of death linked to the drug, but said that many patients taking Celebrex have other illnesses and are taking multiple medications.
CHICAGO (AP) --Two popular nutritional supplements won't cure arthritis but might improve its symptoms with fewer side effects than traditional treatments, an analysis of 15 studies concludes.
But much of the research on glucosamine and chondroitin compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints, according to the analysis in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
The supplements are marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis, the degenerative joint disease that afflicts about 21 million people nationwide.
They are sold over the counter in health food stores and became popular after being recommended in a 1997 book, ''The Arthritis Cure''.
''Overall, it seems probable that these compounds do have some efficacy in treating osteoarthritis symptoms and that they are safe,'' the authors wrote.
Dr. Timothy McAlindon, a Boston University rheumatologist and lead author of the analysis, said his conclusions are ''a little more positive'' than the ''profound skepticism which has existed''.
''I'm not actively recommending'' chondroitin and glucosamine, ''but I certainly don't discourage people from trying them provided they're cognizant of the available data,'' McAlindon said.
Both supplements are synthetic versions of body substances that help build cartilage, the tough tissue that lines the joints.
Laboratory studies have suggested they might promote cartilage growth, though whether they do in humans remains to be seen, McAlindon said.
The studies he analyzed compared the supplements with a placebo's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring any changes in joints.
The authors evaluated six studies on glucosamine and nine on chondroitin published between 1966 and 1999.
All involved patients with arthritis in the hip or knee.
Overall, the studies showed moderate to large benefits from the supplements.
Chondroitin seemed to be the most effective.
But studies showing the biggest benefits were also the most flawed, McAlindon said.
Many failed to detail how the authors hid the identity of substances given to subjects --a crucial element in placebo-controlled studies.
''We also found evidence of publication bias,'' McAlindon said, referring to selective publication of the most positive results.
Most, if not all, of the studies were sponsored in some way by the supplements' makers.
While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments --aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or liver damage, none of the studies showed significant side effects.
The analysis is ''an important contribution'' because the authors deciphered hard-to-interpret studies and provide a useful assessment of the latest research, said Dr.
John Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation.
The analysis was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

DAYTON, Ohio _ Even as new medications are relieving arthritis symptoms without upsetting stomachs, an Arthritis Foundation survey shows that misconceptions by both doctors and patients are holding people back from treatment that might help.
The American Physical Therapy Association hopes to educate at least the patients this weekend when it operates a toll-free hot line.
``There are tips that physical therapists can offer to help people with arthritis to avoid fatigue and flare-ups and to make their homes more arthritis-friendly,'' said APTA president Jan K.
Richardson. Many primary-care physicians are unaware of aggressive treatment strategies that go beyond medications, the Arthritis Foundation found, despite research showing the value of support groups, exercise classes and other complementary therapies.
The foundation's own Arthritis Self-Help Course has been shown to reduce pain by 20 percent and doctor visits by 40 percent.
Arthritis is the No.
1 cause of disability in this country, the foundation claims, costing the economy $65 billion a year and striking 40 million Americans, including 300,000 children.
But the foundation's report card still found considerable belief in the myths that arthritis only affects the elderly and that little can be done to relieve it.
Two out of five Americans with chronic joint symptoms haven't sought a doctor's diagnosis, according to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And even among those diagnosed with arthritis, nearly three out of five are not undergoing treatment for it.
One reason is many people's stomachs can't handle the longtime drug of choice for arthritis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.
But two recently approved drugs called cox-2 inhibitors have shown success in relieving arthritis pain without upsetting the stomach.
Celecoxib, marketed as Celebrex, was the first on the market, with MK-0966 (Vioxx) receiving approval May 21.
Two new injectable drugs, hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk), also are effective for osteoarthritis of the knee.
By inhibiting only cox-2 enzymes, the new drugs relieve pain in the joints without leaving the stomach lining vulnerable to ulcers and bleeding, explains the Mayo Clinic's Mayo Health Oasis Web site (www.mayohealth.org).
The nutritional supplement glocusamine sulfate has been associated with reduced pain and increased mobility for arthritis patients, Mayo says, but it also warns that it hasn't been subjected to long-term safety studies and that dietary supplements aren't federally regulated to contain what they say they do.
Little controlled research has been done on chondroitin sulfate, another popular arthritis treatment.
Fraudulent arthritis products are at the top of the list of top health frauds published by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
``Copper bracelets, Chinese herbal remedies, large doses of vitamins, snake or bee venom just don't work,'' the FDA explains.
``Because the symptoms of arthritis go into remission periodically, individuals who try these unproven remedies may associate the remedy with the remission''.

NEW YORK (AP)--Merck &AMP; Co.
made a $5.2 billion profit last year on nearly $27 billion in sales.
But the future of the nation's largest drugmaker is uncertain as four of its blockbuster drugs lose patent protection in the next two years, which make them susceptible to competition from cheaper generics.
That's why analysts say Merck desperately needs strong sales from its new pain pill Vioxx, which was approved Friday by the Food and Drug Administration and is expected to reach pharmacies in mid-June.
Vioxx, though, will have to compete with another new painkiller, Celebrex, which has been the hottest selling drug of the year.
Doctors have written 4.4 million prescriptions for Celebrex, jointly marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, since it was launched in early January.
Celebrex this spring became the second fastest selling new drug ever, after the anti-impotence pill Viagra.
Vioxx and Celebrex are in a new class of drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors.
They offer the same pain relief as traditional arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and intestinal bleeding.
Although Merck and Monsanto have touted tests showing fewer side effects on their drugs, the FDA has ordered both to place standard warnings about the potential for stomach problems on their labels.
Merck won a slight marketing edge Friday as the FDA approved Vioxx for menstrual pain, acute pain in adults and osteoarthritis.
Celebrex is also approved for osteoarthritis, which is the wear and tear of joints usually linked with aging, as well as for rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body's immune system backfires to cause pain and inflammation.
Once the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can prescribe it for other ailments.
As a result, analysts say it is likely doctors will use Vioxx and Celebrex interchangeably.
The battle between the drugs will take place in physician offices as thousands of pharmaceutical sales representatives prod doctors to give out free samples.
Heavy consumer advertising should also start later this year.
Both drugs also will battle to gain acceptance from managed care companies, which increasingly restrict pharmaceutical coverage.
Celebrex is covered by about half of all health maintenance organizations.
Analysts expect both drugs to each eventually surpass $2 billion in annual sales by 2002.
For Merck, $2 billion will merely replace sales lost from the hypertension drug Vasotec and ulcer drug Pepsid, both of which lose U.S. patent protection next year.
Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001.
Another factor putting pressure on Merck is that sales growth has slowed for its top-selling drug, the cholesterol pill Zocor.
Merck officials play down their reliance on Vioxx.
``We have a lot of products,'' said Wendy Dixon, Merck's vice president of marketing.
``Vioxx is clearly important to us, but we are by no means dependent on the success of Vioxx''.
Many analysts see it differently.
Merck is ``extremely dependent'' on Vioxx's success, said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners.
Merck hopes to persuade doctors to prescribe Vioxx, by showing results of a yearlong study compared to just three months of data for Celebrex.
Additionally, Merck's label will highlight that just 4 out of 3,300 patients studied on Vioxx suffered serious gastrointestinal problems.
``We think Merck will be able to do some damage with those numbers,'' said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
The safety of the drugs will only become clear in the months ahead as the drugs are used by hundreds of thousands of patients compared to the few thousand patients which took part in the drugs' testing.
Merck officials also hope to convince doctors and patients that Vioxx is a true once a day pill.
They note that a significant number of Celebrex users must take the pill twice a day.
Monsanto said most osteoarthritis patients take Celebrex once a day.
The average wholesale price for Vioxx and Celebrex is $2.02 for the standard dosage.
Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen.
Pain sufferers may be getting some new drug options that appear to bring relief with fewer side effects than most other treatments.
One drug, called gabapentin, is already on the market as a treatment for epileptic seizures.
Two new studies, appearing Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show the drug is an effective painkiller in hard-to-treat cases of nerve damage from diabetes or shingles.
Separately, a panel of experts advising the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration endorsed the first in a potential new line of pain relievers, known as Cox 2 inhibitor drugs.
The new medications are designed to reduce inflammatory pain from arthritis, without the stomach distress and other gastrointestinal side effects of widely used painkillers.
The Cox 2 inhibitors are being widely touted as potential blockbusters, likely to generate at least $1 billion a year in sales during their first year on the market.
Estimates for worldwide sales of all analgesics run as high as $12 billion a year.
But many experts doubt the new drugs will live up to their early billing as ``superaspirins''.
The evidence does suggest they cause fewer side effects than ibuprofen and aspirin, even with daily use for many years.
But the Cox 2 inhibitors don't seem to control pain much better than current treatments.
The FDA-sponsored advisory panel voted to recommend approval of Celebrex, G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.'s Cox 2 inhibitor, for both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
The vote paves the way for full FDA approval sometime next year.
Meanwhile, Merck &AMP; Co.
has its own Cox 2 inhibitor awaiting approval, and other drugmakers are said to be close behind.
Patients with pain from nerve damage will not need to wait to try gabapentin _ it's now sold as an anti-convulsant under the brand name Neurontin by Parke-Davis, a unit of Warner-Lambert Co.
Because the drug is already on the market, doctors are free to start prescribing it immediately for pain patients.
Many already have been using it as a pain remedy, in fact, although they have had little besides rumor and first-hand experience to suggest that it works.
The new studies were carried out by independent teams of clinical researchers across the country, including doctors at the University of California at San Francisco.
Results showed that the drug works at least as well and probably better than other treatments for neuropathic pain, but with far fewer side effects.
Although the tests were conducted only in diabetes and post-herpetic neuralgia, or shingles, experts said it might also help alleviate nerve pain suffered by people with cancer and AIDS.
``It's a very important advance in pain management,'' said Dr.
Edgar Ross, director of the pain management center at Brigham and Women's Medical Center in Boston, who participated in one of the two studies.
``This is the first time we have a drug reasonably well-tolerated by most people and effective for a problem that has been resistant to most treatments''.
A Warner-Lambert spokeswoman said the company is evaluating the new evidence, and may seek FDA permission to start promoting Neurontin as a pain remedy.
But no decision has been made, she said.
Veterinarians have prescribed it for years for high-priced polo ponies and creaky old dogs.
More recently, it's been hyped as a ``cure'' for human arthritis.
But a dietary supplement called glucosamine had been dismissed as quackery by many mainstream doctors.
Until now.
Earlier this month a respectable long-term European study on glucosamine won a prominent place on the program of the American College of Rheumatology meetings in Boston.
And on September 30, the National Institutes of Health announced it will launch a $6.6 million study of glucosamine and a similar supplement called chondroitin, one of the most expensive clinical trials ever conducted of any ``alternative'' therapy.
But glucosamine and chondroitin are not the only hot new areas in arthritis.
Researchers are paying respectful attention to acupuncture, tai chi, stinging nettle (it may cut down on the need for conventional painkillers), and other complementary therapies.
They're also excited about new science-based approaches such as cox-2 inhibitors (already on the market) and metalloprotease inhibitors (still experimental).
Arthritis researchers say they're finally beginning to understand how to attack the most common form of the disabling disease, called osteoarthritis _ the deterioration of the cartilage that cushions each joint, generally causing symptoms after age 45.
Currently, 23 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis _ one in every eight adults.
(Another 2.1 million have rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that strikes younger adults, usually women).
As the baby boomers enter the osteoarthritis-prone years, the number of sufferers will swell.
Nothing except heart disease causes more disability, and no disease robs more people of their ability to walk, climb stairs, and even do something as simple as rise from a sitting position.
Fortunately, ``there's a lot of progress in osteoarthritis,'' says rheumatologist David T.
Felson of Boston University School of Medicine.
``The emerging paradigm is that this is a disease that needs to be treated with multiple approaches''.
That includes alternative treatments.
Even before the NIH study is off the drawing boards, leading US arthritis specialists are recommending glucosamine to their patients _ not as a cure, but as something that reduces pain in some people and may (or may not) retard the progress of the disease, depending on whether the European study results can be confirmed.
``Try it for 30 days,'' Boston University rheumatologist David T.
Felson told 62-year-old Maureen Palmer last week at Boston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where she is participating in a BU study of osteoarthritis.
``I'm putting all my patients on this stuff.
It's completely safe, and it's worth trying''.
Palmer, a fifth-grade schoolteacher with a painful right knee, says her primary care doctor was skeptical of glucosamine when she asked about it.
``Now I think I'll give it a try,'' she said.
Specialists' open-mindedness about alternative therapies is underscored by a new 286-page ``Guide to Alternative Therapies'' published by the Arthritis Foundation, a nonprofit research and service organization.
The guide sorts through the scientific evidence (or lack thereof) on 80 arthritis nostrums and ``healing systems,'' from Ayurveda and qi gong to copper bracelets and Thunder God Vine.
The Arthritis Foundation undertook the project because it was getting 5,000 telephone queries a month about alternative therapies.
``We had no position except `we don't know,' '' says Dr.
William J.
Arnold, who chaired the foundation's task force on alternative medicine.
To be sure, not all arthritis specialists are receptive to alternative therapies.
``To some extent the Arthritis Foundation has given credibility to a lot of things that don't deserve it,'' complains Dr.
Donald M.
Marcus, a Houston rheumatologist.
Despite lingering skepticism among their colleagues, many arthritis specialists see their field as an emerging model for the marriage of scientific and complementary approaches.
On the scientific side, leading researchers paint an expansive picture of the future of osteoarthritis treatment.
``We're going to be able to treat the pain better with safer agents.
In the next decade, if not sooner, we'll be able to give you things that will slow the disease,'' says Dr.
Roland D.
Moskowitz of Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland.
``And we're going to able to resurface joints with biological materials, not only to treat the disease but to repair the damage''.
Some new approaches come from surprising directions.
For instance, there's some evidence that a common antibiotic may slow joint damage or even prevent osteoarthritis.
Dr. Kenneth D.
Brandt of the University of Indiana is overseeing a large federally sponsored trial of doxycycline, a synthetic version of the antibiotic tetracycline, in people with osteoarthritis or at high risk for the disease.
Tetracyclines inhibit enzymes that soften and break down cartilage.
Until recently, researchers thought that osteoarthritis was simply a matter of wear and tear, a grinding down of the slick, elastic cartilage that cushions and lubricates the ends of all bones.
Mechanical forces certainly play a role, especially in initiating the damage.
Earlier injury, whether from athletics or repetitive overuse in the workplace, increases the risk for later arthritis by three- to six-fold.
Maureen Palmer's knee arthritis is the price she's paying for a ski injury nearly 30 years ago.
With each step, weight-bearing joints must bear a force equivalent to up to six times total body weight.
Thus, it makes sense that there's a strong link between osteoarthritis and excess weight.
Overweight individuals have four to five times the risk of osteoarthritis.
But mechanical forces do not totally explain osteoarthritis.
Overweight individuals have a higher risk of arthritis in the hands too, suggesting that obesity exerts a systemic effect.
Inheritance plays a role too, especially in arthritis of the hand.
So do hormones, since women's risk of the disease rises sharply after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease sharply.
Diet also affects osteoarthritis, especially once the process has begun.
Researchers think this may be due in part to the effects on cartilage from oxidation _ a central mechanism of age-related tissue damage.
In a study of participants in the well-known Framingham Heart Study, Felson's group found those with the highest dietary intake of vitamin C, an antioxidant, had one-third the risk of developing knee pain from arthritis compared to individuals with the lowest vitamin C levels.
Vitamin C may also facilitate cartilage repair.
Vitamin E, another antioxidant, apparently has less effect on the progression of arthritis, but its anti-inflammatory effects may explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease pain in some patients.
For now, the best advice specialists can offer to osteoarthritis sufferers is to attack the disease with a combination of lifestyle, medical, and dietary interventions _ and ultimately, joint replacement surgery when all else fails.
At the top of the list are weight loss and exercise.
``Even a little weight loss can make a difference,'' says Brandt, the Indiana arthritis specialist.
Framingham data show that a weight loss of 11 pounds in women of medium height reduced the risk of painful knee arthritis by half.
Exercise _ especially gentle and progressive resistance exercise that strengthens leg muscles _ is getting increased attention among arthritis researchers.
This doesn't mean going to a gym and working out like Schwarzenegger; cheap ankle weights or elastic bands, used faithfully at home to do leg-lifting exercises, will do the trick.
``It takes very little physical activity to improve fitness,'' says Brandt.
``Even the very elderly can do it''.
One reason is that stronger leg muscles brace the knee and hip joints, reducing the wobble that comes with age-related loosening of ligaments.
Increased joint stability in turn protects cartilage from the cycle of injury, enzymatic breakdown, and inflammation.
A Tufts University study presented at the Boston rheumatology meeting showed a home exercise regimen improved leg strength by 71 percent and reduced arthritic knee pain by 36 percent.
A larger exercise study from England showed similar improvements in knee pain and physical function.
When painkillers are necessary, doctors often advise the old standby acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic brands) if inflammation is not an issue, although users should be cautious about combining this drug with alcohol to avoid liver damage.
To relieve both pain and inflammation, the standard recommendation has been non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), but chronic use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can erode the stomach lining and cause potentially dangerous bleeding.
The new cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) appear to avoid this problem entirely while maintaining equal efficacy against osteoarthritis pain and inflammation, according to two studies published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
It's no accident that Celebrex has vaulted into first place among prescription painkillers.
But Celebrex and Vioxx cost from $90 to $120 a month, which can be prohibitive for many people, especially if they have little or no prescription drug coverage.
Eventually, Moskowitz thinks, ``more cox-2 inhibitors will come out and the price will come down''.
Whatever improvements emerge in medical therapy _ conventional or alternative _ many osteoarthritis patients will eventually run out of stop-gap options.
For them, the ultimate treatment is an artificial knee or hip.
``Total knee and hip replacement have totally revolutionized arthritis treatment, in terms of keeping people walking and off crutches,'' Moskowitz says.
``When patients say, `Doc, this is really interfering with my lifestyle and the medicines aren't helping anymore,' it's appropriate to take the risk''.
Thomas Ercoline, 64, is glad he did.
After conventional medicine and acupuncture no longer relieved the excruciating pain caused by his knee arthritis, the Peterborough, N.H. man had joint replacement surgery in July.
``Initially the pain was worse than the arthritis.
The first two weeks after the operation you wonder why you had it done,'' Ercoline said.
``But when I found I could walk up and down stairs again, and walk with a normal gait, it sure was worth it''.

NEW YORK (AP) _ The pharmaceutical industry is announcing big gains in the fight against arthritis this week, with several companies reporting they can now reduce pain and slow progression of the often debilitating illness.
The federal government has approved two new drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis since September, drugs that aim to help those with moderate-to-severe forms of the disease.
But industry observers say the biggest advances will occur next year with the expected approval of arthritis drugs made by Searle Inc.
and Merck and Co.
These drugs will treat the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the companies say.
These drugs, called Cox-2 inhibitors, are likely to be marketed to people with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis _ or nearly 40 million Americans.
The arthritis drugs, those in testing and those on the market, are being showcased this week at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Diego, where each company is trying to show arthritis doctors why its treatment works best.
``This is a tremendous time,'' said Dr.
Brian Butcher, an official with the Arthritis Foundation.
``We have gone from where we could not offer much hope to people to where we can diagnose, provide early treatment and stop the progression of the disease''.
Rheumatoid arthritis afflicts 2.1 million Americans.
It occurs when patients' immune systems go awry and attack their joints, causing inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune cells eat away cartilage.
Osteoarthritis affects more than 37 million Americans, and is usually associated with the aging process.
In the past year, doctors wrote 76.7 million prescriptions for anti-arthritis drugs, according to IMS Health, a research group.
With a number of new drugs coming on the market, analysts expect sales to increase from dlrs 1.9 billion to dlrs 3 billion by 2001.
Among its many players, the pain wars pit Merck, the largest drug company worldwide in terms of sale, against the fastest growing company, Pfizer.
Pfizer will market Celebra, the Cox-2 inhibitor made by Searle, a division of Monsanto.
The federal Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee has scheduled a hearing on Celebra for Dec.
1. Merck hopes to file for FDA approval for its Vioxx drug later this year.
Company officials say they are not concerned about lagging behind Celebra for federal approval.
One reason is because Vioxx is designed as a once-a-day pill, while Celebra will have to be taken several times daily.
Dr. Bennett Shapiro, an executive vice president with Merck, attributed the surge of interest in arthritis to scientific discoveries in 1991 that showed that two different enzymes cause the body to make hormones that bring pain and inflammation and also protect the stomach lining.
As a result, drugs could be developed that stopped the pain, but left the stomach alone.
Immunex Corp.
, which won federal approval last week for its Enbrel arthritis drug, is working with American Home Products Corp.
to market it.
Enbrel is given via injection twice a week and studies show it reduces pain and duration of morning stiffness and improves swollen and tender joints.
Enbrel used the meeting in San Diego to show that the drug is also effective in children.
Centocor Inc.
used the meeting to show its experimental drug Remicade also provides relief from rheumatoid arthritis.
Remicade is already approved to treat Crohn's disease, an intestinal disorder.
The company hopes to win approval to treat arthritis with the drug next year.
Enbrel and Remicade will compete with Arava, the arthritis drug approved by the FDA in September.
Arava, made by Hoechst Marion Roussell, bills itself as the only approved drug that helps stop the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.
This isn't the way medical science is supposed to work.
A remedy used to treat creaky bones in horses and dogs works so well that humans start taking it.
It gets hyped in a best-selling book on arthritis and the number of users skyrockets.
Doctors get glowing testimonials from patients, so they tell other patients to try it.
Finally, with about 5 million Americans taking the concoction of crab shells and cow cartilage, enough begin asking how it works _ and enough doctors wonder whether it really does _ that scientists finally begin studying its safety and effectiveness.
That's what happened with glucosamine and chondroitin, which taken together or separately are now America's top-selling joint supplements.
The early results of research, including one study just published and another due out soon, suggest the treatment actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further cartilage damage.
The promising research is bound to make the hard-to-pronounce potions, which are available over the counter, even more wildly popular.
``This is a strange, inverted application of the traditional scientific model,'' said Dr.
Timothy McAlindon, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University who has analyzed the evidence on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, here and abroad.
``The science isn't black or white.
We're building a case trying to figure out if this works or not, and at the moment the evidence is favoring these products''.
Dr. Roland Moskowitz, a professor at Case Western Reserve University who next week will help initiate the biggest study ever of glucosamine and chondroitin for the National Institutes of Health, also is bemused by the treatment's unconventional history.
But he said ``enough people are using it that if it works, we ought to know about it.
And if it doesn't, we should know it doesn't and stop people from spending money on it.
``If it works, we'll have lucked out''.
Luck has little to do with it if you ask the hordes of horsemen and pet owners across America who have been giving their animals the glucosamine-chondroitin pill since the early 1990s and swear that it quickens the animals' gait and eases their agony.
Ditto for millions of people in Europe who for even longer have been using the two compounds, which occur naturally in human cartilage and are synthesized in the treatment capsules.
The Europeans even have scientific studies, more than three dozen of them, saying the medicine works.
American researchers have been slower to show an interest, which is largely a function of the way things work here with herbal therapies, dietary supplements and other nonpharmaceutical products.
Given the medicine's natural derivation, drug companies find it difficult to take out patents on the products, so they have no incentive to sponsor the expensive research to ensure they are effective or safe.
The Food and Drug Administration also steers clear of such remedies.
In the last couple of years, however, American researchers have become curious.
It was partly because of the publication in 1997 of a popular book called ``The Arthritis Cure,'' and the way it triggered an avalanche of interest in glucosamine-chondroitin among America's 20 million sufferers of the degenerative joint disease called osteoarthritis.
Many were frustrated with the side effects of other medicines and were thrilled with results they got with the new treatment.
Doctors were not about to object since their patients were so convinced and the treatment seemed safe, although over time they started pressing for more concrete evidence.
McAlindon, the BU arthritis specialist, set out to see whether all the European studies held up.
His conclusion, outlined in an article earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was that the overseas clinical trials do show that glucosamine and chondroitin reduce pain in osteoarthritis sufferers and are safe.
But nearly all the European trials were supported by manufacturers of the supplements who had the most to gain from positive publicity.
And ``in general they were not that well done,'' McAlindon said last week.
``They seem to exaggerate the treatments' efficacy''.
A series of US studies is trying to weed out those quality problems and come up with definitive answers.
The largest of its kind, published this month in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, looked at how glucosamine-chondroitin affected pain and movement in 93 patients with arthritic knees.
``The treatment was significantly more effective than a placebo for pain and function,'' said Dr.
Amal Das, a joint replacement surgeon in Hendersonville, N.C., and the lead author.
That finding is consistent with reports from private physicians nationwide and with the results of other, smaller studies, including one published last year involving 34 Navy personnel suffering from knee or lower back pain.
While the effects on back pain were unclear, that study found, the aching in knees clearly was relieved.
The next question everyone is asking is whether the treatment does more than mask the pain.
Does it actually cure the underlying disease of osteoarthritis?
And can it help the thousands of young athletes with cartilage damage?
Logic suggests it might.
Glucosamine in its natural form stimulates cells that make cartilage, while chondroitin sulfate blocks enzymes that break down old cartilage.
The question is whether the same effects are produced by the capsules people take, which generally get glucosamine from crab, lobster, or clam shells and chondroitin from the cartilage in a cow's trachea.
And, even trickier, can the glucosamine and chondroitin in the pill work their way from the stomach to the blood to the aching knee?
Animal tests in Arizona offer hope.
Cartilage was removed from rabbits to mimic an injury of the kind humans get, and they were fed glucosamine, chondroitin, and a combination of the two.
After several months, researchers examined the injured area.
``We found the severity of the arthritis process was less in those given the treatment,'' and the combination of compounds worked best, said Dr.
Robert R.
Karpman, one of the researchers who oversaw the study in Phoenix, which is due to be published next month.
``It seems to slow the arthritic process, but it doesn't repair the joint surface''.
However, the Arizona study raises questions.
For instance: could humans tolerate the megadoses given to rabbits?
Were the beneficial effects a result of stopping further erosion of the cartilage or making new proteins to replace what was gone?
And can glucosamine and chondroitin really find their way around the stomach and liver not just to a knee or other joint, but to the particular joint that is damaged?
The fact that cartilage does not have blood vessels, and gets its only nutrition by seepage through the surrounding membrane, probably makes it easier for substances like glucosamine and chondroitin to work their way there, said Dr.
Lou Lippiello, director of laboratory research at Nutramax Laboratories, one of the leading manufacturers of the treatment and a partial sponsor of the Hendersonville and Phoenix studies.
``Apparently it doesn't affect normal joints,'' he added.
``It seems to have an affinity for joints that are undergoing some kind of trauma or stress''.
Further studies clearly are needed, which is why the NIH next week is scheduled to begin a $10 million project involving 1,500 patients.
It will look at glucosamine, chondroitin and the two together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and whether they actually attack the underlying disease.
What should patients do in the meantime?
Most orthopedic surgeons advise their patients to try it, under a doctor's guidance.
But it is expensive _ $1 or so a day for the eight weeks it takes to begin working, at which point the dosage is lowered and the cost falls to about 60 cents a day.
Insurance generally does not cover the treatment, and physicians caution children and pregnant women not to use it.
Anyone who has diabetes or is taking the blood-thinning drug heparin also should be careful.
And researchers warn that many of the low-cost concoctions being marketed today do not contain quality products.
The roar of the crowd, the crack of the bat _ and that unpleasant little squirt of tobacco juice many batters like to let loose just before they step into the box.
It just wouldn't be baseball without them.
But, hard as it may be for baseball fans to believe, chewing tobacco, or consuming nicotine in any form, may make it harder for people to perform complex tasks involving hand-eye coordination.
Tobacco-chewers proved slower at learning and adjusting to changing visual patterns on a computer screen.
They also exhibited slower, jerkier movements and were less accurate over all than non-users, reports a study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco this month.
It is intriguing, said Jose Contreras-Vidal, the lead author of the article, that so many tobacco-chewing batters can perform a feat far beyond the ability of most other people, tobacco-using or not.
Batters routinely hit balls streaking in at more than 90 mph on any one of a number of trajectories.
He suggested the explanation may lie in the overall consistency of what batters see when they step into the box, however varied the pitches.
But he also wondered whether refraining from tobacco could still make a difference.
``Maybe they could be even better,'' said Contreras-Vidal, of the University of Maryland.
Subjects were asked to draw the straightest path from a central point on a computer screen to changing targets.
No differences were seen in a first round of tests between tobacco-chewers who had abstained for at least eight hours and non-users.
But after the test was changed, and some participants were allowed to chew tobacco, they were found to perform significantly less accurately.
Their problems continued even when they repeated the first test.
&UR; REMEDIES: Taking Vitamin E, for Better or for Worse &LR; Vitamin E supplements are among the most popular over-the-counter remedies, taken in the belief that they may help with everything from dry skin to the effects of aging.
But not all vitamin E is created equal.
A new study raises questions about how useful the vitamin can be in helping people with crippling arthritis of the knee and also offers evidence that some forms of it may actually worsen osteoarthritis.
In a study presented last week to a meeting in Boston of the American College of Rheumatology, researchers focused on a component of vitamin E called gamma tocopherol, which is increasingly being found in preparations of vitamin E, along with alpha tocopherol, the most common ingredient.
Dr. Joanne Jordan, an arthritis specialist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who presented the findings, said much more study is needed.
But she added, ``Based on the results of our study, we would suggest that you take the alpha tocopherol and stay away from the gamma tocopherol''.
Earlier research had suggested that a higher amount of vitamin E in the diet might help slow the progression of arthritis in the knee.
But that study did not include blacks, Dr.
Jordan said, and it gauged vitamin E intake by asking people what they ate rather than by drawing blood samples.
The new study of 400 people was evenly divided between blacks and whites with arthritis.
Researchers studied X-rays of the subjects' knees and tried to correlate the degree of their disease with the components of vitamin E in the blood.
&UR; AT RISK: Stress of War Might Cause Heart Disease &LR; The war never seems to end for some combat veterans.
A growing body of evidence has indicated that veterans who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder are at risk for a variety of health problems, from infections to digestive disorders.
Now a new study adds weight to the theory that the veterans may be more likely candidates for coronary heart disease.
The research, in a report in the current Annals of Behavioral Medicine, suggests that the stress disorder and other kinds of severe psychological stress may actually cause heart disease.
The research was part of a series of studies done by Joseph Boscarino, a Vietnam veteran and epidemiologist.
Now in private industry, Boscarino did the studies at Catholic Health Initiatives, a health network in Louisville, Ky.
``If this is confirmed, then doctors need to consider this as a risk factor'' for heart disease, Boscarino said.
Researchers based their conclusions on data from a large-scale study done for the National Institutes of Health in 1986 and 1987.
More than 4,000 Vietnam combat veterans were examined to determine the health effects of their experiences an average of 17 years after they had fought.
Although earlier studies using information from those examinations also theorized a higher risk of heart disease for veterans with stress disorders, Boscarino said the new one was more definitive because it looked at electrocardiogram data from the veterans.
Those data showed abnormal results in 28 percent of the veterans with stress disorder, 24 percent of those with depression and 22 percent of those with anxiety.
&UR; NUTRITION: Newest Superfruit: The Pomegranate &LR; Make way for the latest entrant to the pantheon of fruits and vegetables that may fight disease: the pomegranate.
Scientists at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, a major research center in Haifa, have issued two new studies suggesting that components of the fruit could be effective in fighting disease and slowing aging.
The studies found evidence that pomegranates contain high levels of chemicals that may help combat cancer and hardening of the arteries, and slow the aging process at the cellular level.
(One study was reported in the July issue of The Journal of Ethnopharmacology; the other has been accepted for publication next month, according to officials affiliated with the institute).
The researchers chose the pomegranate for study because it has a long history of use as a folk medicine in the Middle East, Iran and India.
They found that flavonoids, antioxidants that are believed to have a beneficial effect, exist in higher concentration in pomegranate wine than in wine made from grapes.
They also found high concentrations in pomegranate oil and juice.
The scientists cautioned, however, that more study needed to be done to prove that there were health benefits, and that people would have to eat the fruit regularly and over a long period of time.
For people who have AIDS, or the infection that causes it, information can be the most important weapon of all.
Now it has become easier to get.
A new Web site offers doctors and patients a wealth of information, regularly updated, about various HIV therapies that are approved or are still in the experimental stages.
The Web site should improve access to what has long been a valuable resource for fighting the disease: the HIV/AIDS Treatment Directory, published since 1985 by the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
The Web site (www.amfar.org/td/) offers users the ability to search a database of clinical studies of experimental therapies, which may be especially useful for patients who are not responding to conventional treatments.
People using the Web site can anonymously enter information about where they live and the specifics of their conditions, like their blood counts.
They will then be told which programs may be the most appropriate.
The site also contains links to published studies.
Unlike the print version of the directory, which was updated twice a year, the Internet one will be changed continually.
But the print directory will still be published and be available free to patients.
The foundation is a nonprofit group that says it has spent more than $161 million to fight AIDS, mostly by helping to finance almost 1,800 research teams. &QL;
NEW YORK (AP) --Monsanto will be first to sell a revolutionary type of arthritis medication, but its battle with Merck &AMP; Co.
in the high stakes painkiller drug wars is far from over.
Celebrex, made by Monsanto's Searle pharmaceutical unit, on Thursday became the first ``cox-2'' inhibitor to win Food and Drug Administration approval.
The drugs have been touted as possibly the next wonder pills because of their promise to be easier on patients' stomachs than existing medications.
But Monsanto was dealt a blow when the FDA declared there is no proof that Celebrex actually is safer for patients' stomachs than older painkillers.
As a result, when Celebrex hits retail outlets next month it must bear the same warning about side effects as many of its older competitors.
Merck, which is awaiting FDA approval for its Vioxx drug, another cox-2 pill, hopes to get a less stern warning label.
One reason Merck was behind Monsanto in seeking federal approval is because it was waiting for the results of some longer term studies.
The warning label could be a key driver of physician use, and whether either drug reaches the $1 billion in annual sales that some Wall Street analysts had forecast.
Merck also hopes to gain another advantage by getting approval for Vioxx to be taken only once a day for arthritis users.
The recommended dose of Celebrex is once or twice a day for osteoarthritis, and twice a day for rheumatoid arthritis.
``Merck may be able to use Monsanto's experience to get a better label,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners in New York.
After the FDA ruling Thursday, shares of Monsanto rose $1.19 to $47.50.
Pfizer, which will be co-marketing Celebrex, fell $1.12 to $125.
Merck shares dropped $1.31 to $147.50.
Merck spokesman John Bloomfield refused to speculate whether the company has enough research results to get a better warning label than Monsanto.
Merck is working closely with the FDA to demonstrate that Vioxx has safety advantages over existing drugs, he said.
``We are pretty darn happy,'' said Scarlett Lee Foster, a Monsanto spokeswoman.
``I think we got a label we can use...to have the drug widely accepted''.
Monsanto is continuing to study Celebrex in hopes of providing FDA with enough evidence to advertise Celebrex as a safer painkiller.
Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, and a host of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or NSAIDs for arthritis and other pains.
NSAIDS can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects, and are blamed for causing 107,000 Americans to be hospitalized every year, and for killing 16,500.
Monsanto said it will price Celebrex comparably to other prescription strength painkillers that cost about $2.40 a day.
With the traditional safety warnings on Celebrex, Monsanto would have faced considerable difficulty convincing insurers to pay any more.
Despite the warning label issue, the government approval of Celebrex is a boost for Monsanto, which last summer had to drop plans to merge with American Home Products, maker of Robitussin cough syrup and Advil pain reliever.
The $33.6 billion marriage would have been the biggest merger ever in the pharmaceutical industry.
Monsanto, based in St.
Louis, makes the artificial sweetener Nutrasweet and is also heavily involved in genetic research for agriculture.
``This adds credibility to their pipeline,'' said Sano Shimda, president of BioScience Securities.
And the FDA approval is a boost for Pfizer, who some analysts feared would grow too dependent on its anti-impotence drug Viagra to spur sales growth.
Merck knows that being first to market with a new class of drugs is no guarantee of long-term success.
Merck held the lead in cholesterol lowering drugs with its Zocor drug, but Warner Lambert in the last two years has taken the market lead with its Lipitor pill.
BOSTON (AP) _ Suddenly hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of Americans with arthritis are taking a combination of obscure nutritional supplements.
Whatever made these pills the latest cure, it's certainly not the way their names roll off the tongue.
Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate.
Hard to imagine marketing executives coming up with those tongue-twisters.
It's also not because a lot of arthritis specialists are pushing them on their patients.
Mention health store pills to most doctors, and the response is likely to fall somewhere between a blank look and a condescending smile.
The real reasons, it seems, are a cleverly titled book, a hard-to-treat disease that afflicts 16 million Americans and that most elusive and powerful of marketing forces, a good buzz on the street.
Or the golf course.
Or wherever else men and women of a certain age gather and talk about what's aching them.
Across the country, folks have seized on these over-the-counter pills as a new way to ease throbbing knees and hands, even though the opinion of the medical establishment is, to put it politely, skeptical.
Just how many of these people are truly finding relief is impossible to say, but clearly the experience has made believers of some.
Among them is Ralph Cushman, 49, a real estate lawyer in Anchorage, Alaska.
Cushman is the kind of guy who lives to hike and fish.
Those pleasures gradually grew difficult as old injuries stiffened his knees with arthritis, making walking painful.
On a hunting trip two years ago, he got 500 feet (150 meters) up a mountain and could go no farther.
``It was heartbreaking''.
he recalled.
``Suddenly, I couldn't deer hunt anymore.
All the things I lived for were slipping away''.
His doctor told him nothing could be done.
Take pain pills and live with it.
Cushman limped to a bookstore.
There he found something that, in his mind, changed his life.
``The Arthritis Cure,'' written by Dr.
Jason Theodosakis, lays out a program of exercise, diet and glucosamine and chondroitin.
The book has sold more than 1.4 million copies since it came out last year.
Cushman followed its directions.
``Within days, I realized it was making a tremendous difference,'' he said.
``Suddenly I could out-hike my boys rather than hollering for them to wait.
There was just no question this was working.
I assure you, you cannot make that kind of pain go away with a placebo''.
``Placebo'' is just one of the words that comes up when arthritis doctors get onto this subject.
They correctly point out that a belief something will work is often powerful medicine in itself.
Indeed, when researchers test possible arthritis drugs, about 30 percent feel better even when they are in the comparison group getting sugar pills.
Some doctors suspect this may at least partly explain why people find relief from glucosamine and chondroitin.
``Patients invest time and money in them and they want them to work, so they are more likely to see a positive effect than a negative one,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Kay of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass.
Osteoarthritis, by far the most common form of the disease, develops when the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones in the joints begins to break down.
Eventually, bone rubs against bone, causing pain and loss of movement.
Doctors' usual advice is exercise to strengthen the muscles around the joints and weight loss to reduce some of the stress.
Mainstream practitioners also usually recommend anti-inflammatory drugs.
Among these are aspirin, Motrin and other other-the-counter painkillers and a variety of prescription medicines.
But many patients suffer despite these pills, and steady use can have serious side effects, such as stomach ulcers and liver damage.
According to one estimate, anti-inflammatory drugs contribute to more than 7,000 deaths in the United States annually.
Furthermore, the medicines do nothing to slow the progression of arthritis.
Unlike these drugs, glucosamine (pronounced glue-COSE-uh-mean) and chondroitin (conn-DROY-tin) are already present in the body as building material of cartilage.
Proponents theorize that taking extra glucosamine stimulates new cartilage production, while chondroitin slows its destruction.
To hear them tell it, these supplements not only relieve or eliminate the pain, they can also stop and even reverse the disease.
And they do all this with no side effects.
To which many arthritis experts reply: Show us the proof.
Most studies of glucosamine and chondroitin were done several years ago in Europe.
In general, they suggest that the supplements work about as well as over-the-counter painkillers in easing the ache.
In the test tube, they appear to stimulate and preserve cartilage.
However, skeptics note these studies were small, not particularly well done and didn't combine glucosamine and chondroitin, which is the way most people now take them.
Dr. Doyt Conn, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation, said the supplements appear to be safe, and they may indeed do some good for some people, but his organization cannot recommend them until there are better scientific data.
``We have to be responsible to the public and give them what reliable information there is to make a judgment,'' Conn said.
``Right now, I don't think that information is out there''.
Several U.S. studies are under way, sponsored by companies that make the supplements.
The National Institutes of Health is also underwriting one, with results expected in about five years.

Dr. Bobby Wroten, the prestigious Fort Worth hand surgeon who fixed Juan Gonzalez's left thumb last year, was peering at my X-rays.
We can relieve the tingling and numbness, he said, keep your hands from falling asleep and restore some of the strength, but it's not going to get rid of all your pain.
I had arthritis.
That was five years ago, plenty of time to have recovered from successful carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists and to become much more aware of the lingering pain of arthritis.
Thumbs throbbing, fingers stiff, wrists aching, neck and shoulders burning like muscles pushed to the limits of exercise, arthritis can wake you up at night _ sometimes with tender spots that feel as if you must have been sleeping on pea gravel.
Others say arthritis feels like having shards of glass in your joints.
I take a lot of Tylenol and Aleve and have tried cortisone injections and capsaicin cream, the topical analgesic made from red pepper.
I've never hurt badly enough to deliberately submit to bee stings in the hope that the venom might relieve the pain, but some arthritis sufferers are willing to take that risk.
They spend more than $1 billion a year on unproven remedies for the pain and inflammation of more than 100 different types of arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
``We spend as much on unproven remedies for this disease as we do on research,'' says Dr.
Bernard Rubin, chief of rheumatology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
Arthritis is prone to unproven, fraudulent and even dangerous treatments because so many people suffer from it _ 40 million Americans today, expected to hit 59.4 million by 2020 _ and because there are no effective drugs that work long term for everybody.
``People grasp at straws.
Sometimes patients feel doctors don't give their arthritis enough attention.
There must be something better out there, so they go looking for it,'' Rubin says.
Something better _ in the form of a whole new class of anti-inflammatory drugs that fight pain and joint destruction without destroying the stomach and kidneys _ made headlines this month.
Cox-2 inhibitors, being developed under the names Celebra and Vioxx, are expected to outsell even Viagra, the impotency pill that became the fastest-selling drug in history.
Cox-2 drugs are not more effective, just safer.
They are easier on the stomach and can be taken in larger doses for a longer time without damage to the stomach or kidneys.
They could be on pharmacy shelves by early 1999.
``It's one of the most exciting developments in the treatment of arthritis in 25 years because we potentially will be able to treat people for their pain and inflammation without them suffering the side effects,'' says Rubin.
Cox-2 drugs are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Naproxen and Ibuprofen.
Anti-inflammatories are drugs that reduce both pain and swelling by neutralizing the enzymes that cause them.
Researchers have identified two types of this enzyme: cox-1, which releases chemicals that protect the stomach against peptic ulcers, and cox-2, which releases chemicals that cause inflammation.
The old class of drugs inhibited both enzymes.
The new class of drugs selectively works against cox-2 enzymes _ without inhibiting the cox-1 enzymes that protect the stomach.
It's a development that could be worth billions.
Arthritis sufferers spend millions to pay for unproven alternatives because it gives them a sense of mastery over their pain and because they mistakenly believe that traditional medicine has nothing to offer, says Dr.
Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs for the Arthritis Foundation.
``The problem is, the public's misconception that tends to lump all forms of arthritis into one package, and to assume that it's an inevitable part of aging and nothing can be done about it _ all misconceptions,'' Conn says.
The term ``arthritis'' includes more than 100 disorders that attack cartilage in the bone joints.
The disease causes pain, swelling and loss of movement when bone rubs against bone after the cartilage has deteriorated.
The best treatment depends on the specific diagnosis.
MORE Among the most common types of arthritis: OSTEOARTHRITIS, or degenerative joint disease.
Affects an estimated 15.8 million Americans, mostly over age 45.
It involves the breakdown of cartilage and bones through wear-and-tear injuries, and is most often found in the fingers and weight-bearing joints including the knees, feet, hips and back.
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.
One of the most serious and disabling types, affecting an estimated 2.1 million Americans.
It involves a genetic abnormality in the body's immune system that causes inflammation in the lining of the joints that can damage cartilage and bone.
It often leads to crippling deformities in the hands, wrists, feet, knees, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw and elbows.
JUVENILE ARTHRITIS.
A general term for all types of arthritis that occur in children.
An estimated 300,000 children in this country have the disease; most have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
FIBROMYALGIA. Affects approximately 3.7 million Americans, causing pain and tenderness at points where muscles attach to bones.
People with fibromyalgia frequently experience fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness and sometimes psychological distress.
GOUT. A painful condition that most often attacks small joints, especially in the big toe.
It is caused by a defect in body chemistry and usually can be controlled with medication and changes in diet.
BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS.
Result from irritation caused by injuring or overusing a joint.
Bursitis affects a small sac that helps muscles move easily.
Tendinitis affects the tendons that attach muscles to bone.
It is critically important to first find out what kind of arthritis you have, according to the experts.
``Usually there are lifestyle measures that are very important,'' Conn says.
``If you have osteoarthritis of the knee and you are 20 pounds overweight, that weight is a big factor.
You need to know what exercising, what conditioning you should be doing''.
The earlier that diagnosis is made, the more hope there is for living well into old age with even the most crippling forms.
For example, only in the past few years have experts recommended very early, aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate (first developed for cancer treatment).
The National Institutes of Health reported last month that arthritis is now the leading cause of disability among Americans older than 15, as measured by federal disability payments.
The surge of aging baby boomers and the growing number of children who have the disease put arthritis ahead of heart disease, the leading cause of disability payments in a similar study in 1989.
More than $65 billion a year in Social Security disability payments goes to the 21 million arthritis sufferers who are unable to work because of their disease, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
In comparison, about $50 billion a year in disability payments goes to 17 million heart disease patients.

NEW YORK (AP) --Vioxx, the highly anticipated new pain pill from Merck &AMP; Co.
Inc. that promises to be easier on the stomach than aspirin, works well in relieving menstrual and post-surgical pain, according to two company studies unveiled today at a medical meeting.
Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration.
Vioxx was as effective as prescription-strength Aleve, an aspirin-type drug, in treating moderate to severe menstrual pain, according to a Merck study of 127 women being presented at the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in San Antonio, Texas.
The study found pain relief was sustained for at least 12 hours.
In a second study of 151 patients who had oral surgery to remove their wisdom teeth, Vioxx proved as effective at postoperative pain relief as ibuprofen.
The dental study also showed one 50 milligram Vioxx pill could provide relief for a full 24 hours.
Ibuprofen must be taken at least three times a day.
Vioxx will likely become the second in a new class of pain medications which work as well as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medicines but don't cause stomach irritation that can lead to ulcers and other dangerous ailments.
Merck, the world's largest drug company, will be playing catch-up to Monsanto Co.'s Celebrex drug, which won U.S. approval on Dec.
31. Celebrex, approved for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has already sold more than 1.1 million prescriptions, making it the biggest new drug of 1999.
It has also has become the second-fastest-selling new drug in history after Pfizer Inc.'s impotence pill Viagra.
Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans.
But instead of also seeking indication for rheumatoid arthritis, which affects about 2 million Americans, it wants the FDA to approve Vioxx for acute pain treatment --a market of more than 40 million Americans.
It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing how the drug works against different types of pain.
Though the risk of stomach ailments is higher when taking aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs for prolonged use, a dilemma faced most arthritis sufferers, the gastrointestinal risks exist even with short duration use, experts say.
Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said getting the acute pain indication is vital for Merck, though the market for the both Celebrex and Vioxx is bigger with arthritis because patients with that condition take pain relievers more often.
An FDA advisory committee meets April 20 to review Merck's application for Vioxx.
NEW YORK _ Doctors are accustomed to offices crowded with patients, but in the last several weeks, salespeople from Merck and Monsanto have also been vying to get their attention to promote new arthritis drugs.
Monsanto is off to a fast start with Celebrex, its arthritis tablet, which has had the strongest debut ever for a drug.
The company anticipates more than 2.5 million sales calls on doctors this year, the most ever in a drug's first year, says Monsanto.
But Merck is gaining fast with Vioxx in its first couple of months on the market.
And it will soon begin a big advertising push to compete with Monsanto's.
These efforts are destined to make the pills as ubiquitous on the airwaves at least as Tylenol and Excedrin.
Can celebrity endorsers be far behind?
There is plenty riding on this battle.
Analysts expect the market for prescription arthritis drugs to swell from $7.2 billion worldwide this year to $13 billion by 2005.
And for their own reasons, Merck and Monsanto want not just a success but a blockbuster.
The scrap is beginning to get interesting.
Even though Celebrex, which is being co-marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, controls the market, Vioxx has made steady gains since its introduction in May.
Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach.
In the week ended June 11, Vioxx had 7 percent of the Cox-2 market, with Celebrex taking the rest, according to the industry consultant IMS Health.
But by July 23, Vioxx accounted for 22 percent of total prescriptions, while Celebrex had fallen to 78 percent.
``It's unlikely that Vioxx will ever catch up with Celebrex,'' said Jack Lamberton, a managing director at HSBC Securities.
``But this market is large enough for both drugs''.
The stakes are unusually large.
In an industry where earnings tend to rise 15 percent or more a quarter, Monsanto and Merck need a blockbuster drug to remain competitive with other pharmaceutical companies.
After its proposed merger with American Home Products fell apart last year, Monsanto announced a $625 million reorganization.
Even though drug makers are generally suffering and the Standard &AMP; Poor's drug index is down 14.7 percent this year, Monsanto has done worse.
Its stock has slid 17.1 percent this year, to close Monday at $39.375, up 12.5 cents.
Merck's situation does not appear as dire _ the company's stock is down only 8.6 percent this year _ but analysts say the company can ill afford a marketing disaster.
Several of Merck's drugs will lose their patent protection in the next few years, leaving the company vulnerable to eroding revenues as generic alternatives become available.
And Merck is no longer Wall Street's darling.
During the last 12 months, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have climbed 18.6 percent.
Meanwhile, Merck's shares have gained 10.7 percent.
They closed Monday at $67.375, down 25 cents.
Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis drugs.
After Vioxx was introduced, analysts began ratcheting up their projected sales of it to an expected peak of about $2.3 billion a year sometime around 2004, up from a peak estimate of $1.5 billion just months earlier.
Celebrex's sales, meanwhile, are expected to be about $3 billion by 2004.
``Our marketing success with Vioxx will depend on the awareness of the brand,'' said Wendy Dixon, a Merck vice president.
``With a condition that involves pain, people talk to each other.
A lot of the sales from Vioxx should be generated by word of mouth''.
Willard Reese, a retired engineer from Palm Coast, Fla.
, suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx.
``My doctor changed several of my medications,'' Reese said.
``But I have realized a marked improvement.
My right hand is almost normal, when it was about 60 percent functional before''.
Testimonials like his are sure to encourage arthritis sufferers to inquire about Vioxx and Celebrex.
Except in rare cases, the drug that first racks up the largest share of a new market seldom relinquishes it.
Celebrex, whose sales began in January, had the most successful debut by a drug ever in the United States, eclipsing such luminaries as Viagra, Pfizer's impotence pill, and Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's drug for reducing cholesterol, according to IMS Health.
``We're not looking over our shoulder at Vioxx,'' said Joseph Papa, president of U.S. operations for Searle, a division of Monsanto.
``We're outperforming them on every measure''.
Merck, though, has been fast off the starting block.
Known for its Marine-like marketing efficiency, Merck began shipping Vioxx to pharmacies two business days after it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Merck has also distributed the most free samples in its history.
The biggest selling point for Vioxx and Celebrex is that they may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding than other arthritis remedies.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) ``Vioxx and Celebrex are safer on the gastrointestinal tract,'' said Dr.
Steven Abramson, the chairman of Rheumatology at the Hospital of Joint Diseases and the chairman of the FDA Advisory Committee that reviewed both drugs.
In comparisons between Vioxx and Celebrex, Merck would like to focus on the two drugs' labels.
Vioxx has an indication for treatment of acute pain; Celebrex does not _ it has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
The Merck drug is also single-dose.
Celebrex can be administered in a single or double dose.
Merck executives contend that Vioxx's single dose gives it an advantage over Celebrex since patients usually want to take as few pills as possible.
Monsanto has countered that Celebrex gives patients more options.
``About 90 percent of the people who use Celebrex for osteoarthritis take the 200-milligram pill once a day,'' Papa said.
``If someone wants the flexibility, they can take the 100-milligram pill twice a day''.
Along with doctors and consumers, health-maintenance organizations may hold part of the key to the drugs' acceptance.
Several HMOs have restricted the use of one or both of the drugs.
Kaiser Permanente, which has 8.6 million members nationwide, has limited the use of the drugs to people who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Even though Dr.
David Campen, who chairs Kaiser's drug formulary committee, notes that the plan will cover any drug a doctor prescribes, he does not believe the plan should cover Vioxx and Celebrex.
Campen has recently sent out questionnaires to some 50 doctors, and expects to render a decision in September.
The pills' prices might play a role.
Vioxx is priced comparably with Celebrex, which has an average wholesale price of $2.42 for its once-a-day pill.
But when patients use Celebrex twice a day, the cost swells to $2.86.
Both drugs cost considerably more than traditional generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which run about $1.70 for a daily dose.
Some natural remedies can ease the pain of arthritis.
Others just ease the money out of your wallet.
Here's what you need to know to be a wise _ and safe _ consumer.
Shark cartilage.
Glucosamine. Chondroitin.
You've undoubtedly heard of them.
They're all touted to help _ if not ``cure'' _ arthritis.
But do they work?
Some do, some don't.
Americans spend an estimated $10 billion a year on unproven _ and ineffective _ arthritis remedies.
This guide will help you choose the right natural remedy to ease your pain _ and at the right price too.
Here is an overview of supplements, what they claim to do, any proof related thereto, suggested use and cost.
&UR; GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE &LR; &QL; Claim: Glucosamine, a natural substance, furnishes the building blocks that our bodies use to make and repair cartilage.
Proof: Some recent well-done research shows that glucosamine soothes knee pain as well as ibuprofen does, but without the side effects.
Suggested Dose: 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day in two or three doses.
Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 600-mg capsules, $7.99.
Nature's Bounty: Thirty 500-mg capsules, $10.89 &UR; CHONDROITIN SULFATE &LR; &QL; Claim: Experts think that chondroitin, which exists naturally in cartilage, may make tissue more flexible and protect it from harmful chemicals.
Proof: Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain.
But evidence is stronger for glucosamine.
Suggested Dose: 1,200 mg a day in two or three doses.
(May increase the effects of blood-thinning drugs and herbs).
Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Thirty 750-mg capsules, $17.09.
Basic Nutrition: Thirty 400-mg capsules, $9.99.
GNC: Thirty 400-mg capsules, $18.49.
&UR; GLUCOSAMINE AND CHONDROITIN &LR; &QL; Claim: The combined effects of these supplements may help ease osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms.
Proof: A recent study showed that after eight weeks of taking both supplements (Cosamin), men with OA reported less knee pain.
Suggested Dose: 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin in three doses.
It may take up to eight weeks to see improvement.
Some Prices We Found: Cosamin DS: 180 capsules, $84.99 to $94.99.
&UR; SAM-e/ or S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE &LR; &QL; Claim: May improve joint mobility and relieve the pain of OA by boosting levels of the amino acid ATP and supporting cartilage production.
Proof: Some studies have shown that SAM-e relieves mild OA pain almost as well as NSAIDs, but without the digestive tract side effects.
Suggested Dose: 200 to 400 mg in three doses.
Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 200-mg tablets, $39.99.
Nature Made: Twenty 200-mg tablets, $21.99.
&UR; FISH OIL &LR; &QL; Claim: The omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil _ eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) _ may ease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms by providing anti-inflammatory building blocks.
Proof: Many studies have shown that fish oil helps the inflammation and accompanying pain of RA.
It may reduce the need for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.
Suggested Dose: 3 grams (g) or 3,000 mg a day total of EPA/DHA.
Good food sources are cold-water fish such as sardines, salmon, tuna and mackerel.
Try to eat them two or three times a week.
Some Prices We Found: Nature's Way: Max EPA, 100 capsules (120 mg DHA and 180 mg EPA each), $10.39.
Twinlab: Twin EPA Extra Strength, 60 capsules (240 mg DHA and 600 mg EPA each), $27.95.
&UR; GLA (GAMMA LINOLENIC ACID) &LR; &QL; Claim: The body converts these omega-6 fatty acids into anti-inflammatory compounds.
Proof: Studies show that GLA can reduce the tenderness, morning stiffness and inflammation of RA.
It may reduce the need for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.
Suggested Dose: 1,800 mg a day.
GLA is available in evening primrose oil (may counteract the effects of anticonvulsant drugs), borage oil and black currant seed oil.
Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Ultra GLA 300, Thirty 300-mg softgels, $11.89.
&UR; GREEN TEA &LR; &QL; Claim: Polyphenols in green tea have been shown to reduce inflammation, a symptom of RA.
Proof: Mice given green tea extract had much lower rates of arthritis than mice not given the extract.
Human studies are needed, but green tea is safe, so it may be worth a try.
Suggested Dose: 3 to 4 cups a day (equivalent of 600 to 800 mg of polyphenols).
It's also available in decaffeinated and flavored forms and capsules.
If you buy decaffeinated tea, it must be decaffeinated using water and carbon dioxide, a process called effervescence, in order to retain the polyphenols.
If the label doesn't tell you, contact the manufacturer.
Some Prices We Found: GNC: Star GLA Omega-3 Gamma-Linolenic Acid, Sixty 200-mg softgel capsules, $29.99.
Alvita: Green Tea bulk (note: milk may interfere with the polyphenol's action, so drink green tea plain), 4.5 ounces, $3.99.
GNC: Chinese Harvest of Nature Green Tea, 24 bags, $4.99.
Natrol: Sixty 500-mg capsules, $8.29 &UR; TYPE II COLLAGEN &LR; &QL; Claim: Suppresses the autoimmune response that causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of RA.
Proof: Some studies show that taking type II collagen orally can reduce the pain and inflammation of RA.
Suggested Dose: 500 micrograms (mcg) or less.
NSAIDs may block the absorption of type II collagen; talk to your doctor before using.
Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Maxilife chicken collagen, 60 pills, $25.95.
&UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SAVE YOUR MONEY &LR; &QL; The pain and chronic nature of arthritis force some people to try almost anything for relief, even unproven _ or downright harmful _ remedies.
When in doubt, ask your doctor for guidance.
In the meantime, here are a few products that have not been proven to relieve arthritis _ though some have benefits for other conditions: _ Copper bracelets: There's no scientific evidence to back up copper's antiarthritis claims.
_ Shark cartilage: Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis.
_ Alfalfa: Used for years as a folk remedy for arthritis, no studies show that it's effective.
_ DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide): A byproduct of wood processing, DMSO is said to ease pain and improve flexibility in people with arthritis.
But many versions on the market aren't suitable for humans.
They're chemically impure and potentially harmful.
_ Maybe MSM?
There is some anecdotal evidence that MSM (methyl sulfonyl methane) may help alleviate arthritis pain.
So far, no published studies have shown that it's effective for treating arthritis.
But if you haven't had success with any of the proven arthritis remedies, it's probably safe to try MSM to see if it helps you.
&UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SHOP SMART &LR; &QL; With so many arthritis supplements on the market, it's hard to know what to buy and what to avoid.
Our 10-point checklist will help.
1. Make sure that the product label lists the amount of the active ingredient it contains.
2. Choose products from large companies _ they value their reputations.
3. Buy supplements at stores you trust.
4. Avoid products using words such as ``scientific breakthrough'' or ``miracle cure''.
5. Beware of products that claim to cure all types of arthritis.
6. Remember: If a product sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
7. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement for arthritis.
8. Continue taking your current medication until you've gotten your doctor's OK to try something new.
9. Bear in mind that ``natural'' doesn't necessarily mean safe.
10. If you already take an arthritis supplement, mention it to your doctor.
&UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: ANTIOXIDANTS FOR ARTHRITIS &LR; &QL; Need another reason to get your five-a-day?
Some studies have shown that the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may protect joints _ especially the knee _ from the ravages of osteoarthritis (OA).
Here are a few of the studies' findings: _ People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression.
_ Certain antioxidants (including lutein and lycopene, among others) were associated with lower risk of knee OA.
_ Vitamin E eased arthritis pain better than a placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
To be sure that you're getting enough beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene and vitamin C, eat lots of carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, spinach, tomato sauce and tomato juice, oranges, kiwifruit and strawberries.
(Prevention now recommends nine veggies a day for disease protection).
To get the amount of vitamin E that most experts advise, you'll need a vitamin E supplement containing 400 international units.
Since OA progression was three times higher in people with low levels of vitamin D, it's best to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement with 100 percent of the daily value for D.

The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for cosmetic surgery.
`` Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport Beach, Calif.
``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety of conditions this way''.
Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West keep expanding.
Inserting needles into pressure points throughout the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.
But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents a whole new concept in cosmetics.
``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles underneath the skin,'' says Woo.
``Stimulating energy centers restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body''.
``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach, California.
``I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened, and my smile lines diminished a lot.
I'm most pleased about that''.
COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture treatments.
But inviting as the treatment seems, not many acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain, adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility.
``It opens the channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's cells.
The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate wrinkles''.
Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease their anxiety.
``I help patients overcome their fear of needles by first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of steel.
They don't hurt''.
Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed atmosphere.
The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from patient to patient.
Some require as few as nine, and others need 16 or so placed strategically around their face.
``The needles bring more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo, ``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells.
The needles activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more elasticity''.
NEEDLE PLACEMENT After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape to put pressure on the muscles.
Anesthesia cream is applied to the sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort.
Then he inserts the needles at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top of the head.
This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in place for about a half hour.
Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate circulation to the face.
``It's the same pressure point used to stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes.
A Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin.
Ten treatments usually do the job.
Then, maintenance visits once or twice a month renew the benefits.
EASY TO KEEP UP Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45 for each acupuncture treatment.
Woo explains that restoring the essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and increases a sense of well being.
This shows in the face.
``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says.
``That is then followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease''.
Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to achieving beauty than a surgical facelift.
The focus on the whole person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that.
But if I can put it off, that's a good idea, I think.
Acupuncture seems like a better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to keep up.
And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time.
I enjoy the procedure''.
ACUPUNCTURE USED WIDELY A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
Since the field still remains relatively new to the public, issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need further clarification.
The majority of states offer licensure or registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the same credentialing exam.
A nationally recognized exam has been established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes.
This ensures good manufacturing practices and high standards of sterility.
The FDA recommends that the needles be used only once.
The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and fibromyalgia.
The consensus panel concluded that further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture interventions will be helpful.
Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all encompassing way for some patients.
``I feel like I'm brighter,'' says Sandy Ridout.
``It gives me a better feeling just to know I don't have wrinkles.
``I'm a preventive type person, and my appearance and my mood are important to me.
I needed a perker-upper and this is it''.

WASHINGTON (AP) --A third new drug for people suffering from the pain of arthritis has been approved by federal regulators.
The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved meloxicam tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
Meloxicam will be marketed under the name Mobic by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories and is expected to be available in early May.
The wholesale price is expected to be $1.98 per tablet and dosage is once a day.
Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx.
Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other pills to relieve pain.
But these can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other side effects, especially in long-term users.
In clinical trials Mobic had a low instance of gastrointestinal side effects, the manufacturer said.

&LR; &LR; New insights into the biochemistry of pain are starting to pay off in safer, and perhaps even more effective, treatment options for chronic sufferers.
One new type of painkiller, known as COX-2 inhibitors, just hit pharmacy shelves.
The drugs appear to be no more effective at fighting pain than traditional anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and aspirin, but offer the advantage of fewer side effects.
That is a major plus for people who must use pain relievers long-term and risk such problems as stomach bleeding and ulcers.
The first of the new drugs, Celebrex, developed by Monsanto's G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.
pharmaceutical unit and co-marketed by Pfizer Inc.
, was launched commercially last month.
A different drug of the same type, Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx, is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration and could be on the market by summer.
Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters, likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain relievers.
COX-2 drugs are designed primarily for those with rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts about 2.1 million people in the United States, and for painful flareups of osteoarthritis, the ``wear-and-tear'' form of the ailment, which affects an estimated 20.7 million people.
Until now, these patients and others in chronic pain have relied mostly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sold over-the-counter or at prescription strength under brand names such as Advil, Daypro, Lodine and Naprosyn.
The drugs are generally effective but can be harmful with constant use.
A 1997 study of arthritis patients showed at least 107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths a year from NSAID-related problems.
COX-2 drugs block production of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2, which produces painful inflammation.
Unlike NSAIDs, however, they do not interfere with the closely related COX-1 enzyme, which helps build a protective lining in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract.
Searle began selling Celebrex for $2.42 per 200 milligram pill, less than expected but still more than some HMOs might be willing to pay, especially for patients without a demonstrated problem with NSAIDs.
The COX-2 inhibitors, meanwhile, are not the only new possibilities for fighting pain: --Ziconotide, awaiting FDA approval, has been touted as a potent alternative to morphine in cases of severe pain.
Derived from sea snail venom, it is designed to block calcium channels in nerve cells of the spine, interrupting the flow of pain signals to the brain.
--Enbrel, first in a new class of rheumatoid arthritis medicines called biologic response modifiers, soaks up excess ``tumor necrosis factor,'' a chemical secreted by immune cells involved in joint inflammations.
The drug, made by Immunex Corp.
of Seattle, was approved by the FDA last year1998cq &LR; for use in adults.
New studies show that it may also be effective in childhood forms of arthritis.
--Neurontin, known generically as gabapentin, is an established epilepsy drug that has been shown to work against hard-to-treat nerve pain from shingles or diabetes.
--Tests are underway to establish whether memantine _ used in Germany to treat Parkinson's disease _ can ease the pain of diabetic neuropathy.
The drug blocks NMDA receptors, nerve cell sites that help relay pain signals.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ The Muhammad Ali who danced around a generation of heavyweight fighters and set the standard against which all boxers are judged leans deeply into the armrests of his chair and rises.
He walks gingerly to a door frame, lingers, leans for a moment into the wall with his right shoulder, and bidding his audience of three to pay attention to the soles of his black high-top sneakers, he levitates.
In the moment, the years fall away, as does the Parkinson's disease that has stolen his grace.
In the moment, Ali is again, the magician.
And the magician has risen.
He has come to suburban Boca Raton on a pilgrimage, he says, to return to the days when he floated above the ring and punished his opponents with a beauty so startling everyone looked.
``I'm going to make a comeback,'' Ali says, his gravelly voice barely above a whisper.
``That's my dream''.
He arrived last Tuesday from Canada to begin treatments with Jerry Jacobson, a retired dentist and oral surgeon who lives in Jupiter.
Inside an office at West Boca Medical Center, Jacobson is surrounded by acolytes.
They are the parents of children with cerebral palsy and brain damage, and they believe in his magic.
They sing his praises.
They believe that the Jacobson resonator will deliver their children.
Ali, too, has come to be saved.
Modern medicine, the establishment's best and brightest, have failed him.
``I've been to 15 different doctors,'' Ali says softly, his expression flat.
``None of them have been able to do anything''.
So The Greatest has sat, for five sessions now, on a cushion in a $15 lawn chair between two black, eight-foot high circles.
He has sat and prayed that the self-described genius with the white hair and white suit is telling the truth, and has figured out a way to rejigger the particles of his body and deliver him.
``They have no cure,'' he says, again his voice barely audible.
``Maybe next year.
In ten years.
Next month''.
His mind has never stopped working, his acuity has not been diminished.
He closes his eyes in mid-conversation as if he is asleep, and reopens them a moment later, wide-eyed, in mock surprise at the faces looking at him.
``I am the most recognized man on earth,'' he says.
``Of all the movies stars, of all the athletes ''...
He turns to a teenage girl sitting nearby.
``If you saw me on the street, would you recognize me''?
He asks.
The girls answer yes.
``Everybody knows who I am,'' he says.
A smile crosses his face.
It is the face of the most recognized man on earth, and it is waiting to be saved.
The legendary boxer is just one of many celebrities Jacobson says he's treated with his signature Jacobson resonance machine, which emits a weak magnetic field.
Jacobson is using the electromagnetic machine to treat everything from a bad knee to neurological disorders like Ali's.
He is still working on proving the machine will help patients overcome osteoarthritis in the knee so the Food &AMP; Drug Administration will give him approval to mass produce the gadgets.
The machines are built at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.
NASA got involved with the help of U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Tent Lott, R-Miss.
, after Jacobson promised to mass produce the machines in Mississippi if he receives FDA approval.
Researchers must treat at least 135 patients in the study for the FDA.
About 70 of them are patients at two centers at West Boca Medical Center _ the Pioneer Services Medical Center and the National Medical and Research Institute.
The hospital says it has no affiliation with the research.
The companies say they rent space from the hospital.
About 120 people are being treated for illnesses that are not part of the FDA study.
Most of the patients are seen in suburban Boca Raton; the rest are being treated at clinics at West Gables Rehabilitation Hospital in Miami-Dade County and at Coastal Rehabilitation Medical Center in Gulf Port, Miss.
, Jacobson said.
The treatment is free to those in the FDA study.
It costs others about $100 a treatment.
And more research is being done at Cornell University in New York and University of Oklahoma.
In 1995, Jacobson promised 11-year-old Angelie Diya that he could cure her AIDS with his machine.
The young girl had won over many hearts when she told her classmates at Jupiter Farms Elementary School that she had the disease.
Diya has been to the clinic for pain-relief treatments, said Fank Caviano, chief operating officer of Pioneer.
In the case of Parkinson's, Jacobson theorizes that his machine's magnetic waves will awaken Ali's homeotic genes.
He says those are the genes responsible for making all your body parts what they are.
Making a liver, a liver; an eye, an eye; a brain, a brain.
They shut down after their initial work in young children.
Once the homeotic genes are stimulated, Jacobson hopes they will regenerate cells in Ali's brain and produce dopamine, which helps us move.
It is the lack of dopamine that results in Parkinson's.
``It's a tough case,'' Jacobson said.
``He is a monumental figure.
An icon.
We are doing everything in our power to help him''.
Although homeotic genes are described in some medical literature and universities' Web sites, they aren't listed in a widely-used medical dictionary or a term familiar to Dr.
Robert Brodner, a West Palm Beach neurosurgeon.
And Brodner, who has done brain surgery on about 60 people with Parkinson's, said that regeneration within the brain is ``minimal to nonexistent''.
``So personally, I don't know what this fellow is talking about.
I only hope that he does,'' Brodner said Friday.
``I don't quite believe this, but on the other hand it will be interesting to see the affect and see if this is successful.
Any treatment that doesn't have the potential to harm a patient can be considered''.
Without a miracle cure, the prognosis for people with Parkinson's is unknown.
Some can last years without any noticeable affects.
Some live for more than 40 years with the disease.
Others are almost immediately bedridden and incoherent.
These conditions make patients susceptible to other problems like choking, pneumonia and falls _ which can result in death.
One strike against Ali, a four-time heavyweight champ, is the relatively young age when the Parkinson's set in.
Now 56, he was in his early 40s.
Ali is not the only sports star to get Jacobson's treatment.
Professional Bowlers Association Hall of Famer Dave Davies// of Boynton Beach was in constant pain for more than three years after his right kneecap was broken.
His pain disappeared after a partial knee replacement last fall and after treatment at Pioneer.
Pro Golfer Doug Tewell, who works for the Golf Channel, also is amazed by the pain relief he's received.
He thought he was headed for surgery on his right elbow.
But after several treatments with Jacobson in the last month, he is holding off on the operation.
``I had trouble picking up glass with my right arm without severe pain,'' he said.
``I went from severe pain and possible surgery to winning $115,000 in two weeks''.

Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
NEW YORK (AP) _ Drug makers, eyeing Viagra's runaway success with profit envy, expect the drive for arthritis relief will yield the next wonder drug.
Some industry experts believe Celebra, a painkiller that cuts inflammation but avoids the stomach-damaging effects of aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, could outsell the impotency drug by millions of dollars a year.
Drug makers' ceaseless efforts to stock America's medicine chest have long plowed research money into trying to ease such ills as cancer, obesity and chronic pain.
But the road to a cancer cure is littered with promising treatments that fizzled.
And last year's recall of two diet pills left many dieters wary of weight-loss drugs.
Now comes a new class of super painkillers with a singular advantage: They could be on pharmacy shelves within months.
And industry watchers believe millions of Americans will gladly toss their bottles of common painkillers for an alternative that saves their stomachs.
Kathryn Howe already has.
Rheumatoid arthritis left the 51-year-old executive secretary's joints so swollen she couldn't type or take long walks.
Rolling over in bed hurt.
She kept the swelling under control with prescription-strength versions of drugs such as Tylenol and Advil.
But 15 years of them left her with an inflamed stomach and rectal bleeding.
Last year, her doctor asked her to test an unapproved drug called Celebra.
Now she walks, swims, does low-impact aerobics and even lifts weights comfortably with no apparent side effects.
``A person can shake my hand and I'm not in pain,'' the Eastlake, Ohio, resident said.
``I can hold a pencil''.
Some analysts predict Celebra will outsell Viagra, the lucrative Pfizer Inc.
impotency treatment that became the fastest-selling drug in history its first month.
``That's what I would put my finger on as the next blockbuster drug, not only in terms of medicinal value but in terms of cult following,'' said Stephen Tang, a drug industry specialist with A.T.
Kearney, a management consulting firm in New York.
Typical estimates call for annual Viagra sales to reach dlrs 3 billion by 2002.
Celebra sales could eventually top dlrs 4 billion, said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Christina Heuer.
With the global market for prescription painkillers, not including over-the-counter sales, at dlrs 5 billion, Ms.
Heuer predicts Celebra could be ``the most significant new drug introduction of 1999''.
Celebra is expected to be the first out of the blocks from a new class of drugs called cox-2 inhibitors, so named because they block the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase.
Aspirin and similar anti-inflammatory drugs do that too, but they go too far, also blocking the cox-1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining.
Doctors believe the new class of painkillers may also provide a significant side benefit.
Patients are more likely to get better faster, or improve more profoundly, if they're willing to take their medicine and stay on it.
When Mrs.
Howe was prescribed standard anti-inflammatory drugs that hurt her stomach, she conceded, ``I wasn't a very compliant patient''.
Celebra's manufacturer, Monsanto Corp.'s Searle unit, is expected to ask the Food and Drug Administration for an expedited six-month review by September.
If that happens, the drug could be on the market by early next year in the United States and late 1999 abroad.
Having tested Celebra's effects on rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and dental pain, scientists are now researching signs that Celebra might help prevent colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease, in which cox-2 is believed to play a role.
If it is approved for rheumatoid arthritis, the most severe joint disease, doctors would be free to prescribe it for a number of painful conditions.
Searle will have to move quickly.
Merck and Co.
is about six months behind in developing a rival painkiller named Vioxx.
Glaxo Wellcome PLC, Johnson and Johnson and Roche Laboratories also have cox-2 drugs on the way.
Already Merck and Searle are entangled in a legal battle over patents.
Monsanto, Searle's parent, has agreed to be acquired by American Home Products Corp.
, but the new owner won't be marketing Celebra.
Searle signed up Pfizer for that agreeable task long before the acquisition.
Whoever handles it, Wall Street appears to be betting on Celebra.
``Cox-2, that's potentially the next big blockbuster, and I think Monsanto and Pfizer have the upper hand,'' said Hemant K.
Shah, an independent drug industry analyst in Warren, New Jersey.
``The first product always has the advantage''.
Prozac's dlrs 2.6 billion in worldwide sales, for instance, makes it the best-selling antidepressant years after similar rivals _ Pfizer's Zoloft, Glaxo's Wellbutrin, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil _ came on the market.
In addition to the cox-2 class, Wall Street analysts recognize several candidates as wild-card contenders in the race for the next wonder drug: _ Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan.
Ms. Heuer estimates the drug could bring in dlrs 1.5 billion in 2002, matching 1997 sales of SmithKline's top-selling antibiotic Augmentin.
_ Avandia, an oral diabetes drug by SmithKline.
Analysts say it could become a blockbuster if it lacks the side effects of Warner-Lambert's Rezulin, which was pulled from the market in the United Kingdom after a few patients suffered liver failure.
_Leptin, Amgen Inc.'s weight-loss hormone.
Some patients lost 35 pounds in six months, but doctors remain wary of obesity drugs since last August's recall of the diet pills Redux and fen-phen, a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine.
Knoll Pharmaceuticals' new diet pill, Meridia, drew a lackluster 11,185 prescriptions last month, according to researcher IMS Health.
Leptin is also being tested on diabetes patients.
But even blockbusters will have a hard time topping Viagra, with an unprecedented 1.7 million prescriptions in three months.
``There's never been a drug like this so far in the history of the business,'' said Joseph P.
Riccardo, a drug industry analyst at Bear Stearns and Co.
in New York.
HOUSTON _ Orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, a clinical associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine, was skeptical about a commonplace operation performed on the painful knees of older patients.
The patients suffered from osteoarthritis, a crippling, irreversible condition in which the cartilage covering the bones has worn away with age.
It is the major cause of mobility loss among the elderly.
Arthroscopic surgery, in which doctors work through tiny incisions using a ``scope'' to see, is effective in repairing torn cartilage from injuries.
It cannot replace the missing cartilage in arthritic patients; doctors can only wash out the joint and scrape, or debride, the rough spots.
Yet nearly everyone said their arthritic knee pain decreased after surgery.
The question was, why?
In an unusual, groundbreaking study, Moseley and other Houston researchers are comparing actual surgery to phony, or placebo, surgery to see whether the operation really helps _ or if people simply believe it relieves their pain.
``Are they better because of the procedure or the placebo effect''? said Dr.
Nelda Wray, an internist who runs a research unit financed by Baylor College of Medicine and Veterans Affairs.
``(Moseley's) argument was, `we don't know why they hurt in the first place, and whether this works'''.
The placebo effect is a well-documented phenomenon in which people experience an improvement in their condition in response to a phony therapy, such as a sugar pill.
Scientists have recently begun looking at placebos in the context of surgery.
Initially, Moseley, who is best known as the team physician for the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, was interested in comparing the benefits of rinsing and scraping the knee joint vs.
rinsing alone.
He suspected that washing away debris was what actually gave people relief.
When Wray suggested that they also take a look at the placebo effect, Moseley was taken aback.
``We said, `What do you mean placebo?
This is surgery'''!
Moseley said.
``The more we learned about it, the more we realized surgery may have the strongest placebo effect of any intervention''.
A pilot study of 10 patients yielded intriguing results.
Five of the patients received placebo surgery, just three shallow nicks on their skin so their knees would look like the other patients'.
Two years after sham surgery, patients reported the same amount of relief from pain and swelling as those who had the real operation.
Four of the five placebo patients said the surgery was so worthwhile that they would recommend it to a friend.
One patient even requested the operation be repeated on the other knee.
``We know from the (medical) literature on the placebo effect that it is a significant effect, and the amount of the effect is greater with the magnitude of the placebo,'' Wray said.
``If the pill is bigger, you'll measure a bigger effect''.
Wray suspects that people get better just from an encounter with a surgeon.
The white lab coat, the dramatic setting, the declaration of ``I'm going to make you better'' have a powerful effect.
In the current study, the doctors are comparing 180 patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center divided into three groups.
The experiment gives patients a shot at a $2,000 to $5,000 procedure that the VA does not usually offer for arthritis because of its questionable benefit.
Sixty are getting their knee joints scraped and rinsed, 60 are getting the rinse only, and 60 are getting no surgery at all.
All of the patients are given a mild sedative and all awake 30 minutes later, but only the ones getting a surgical procedure receive full anesthesia.
Patients will be tracked for two years.
Initially, the doctors met resistance from hospital administrators when they proposed the study.
To answer concerns about informed consent, participants were required to state, in their own handwriting, that they understood there was a one-third chance they would get placebo surgery.
A more difficult question was how doctors could justify giving placebo patients a sedative, even if the risk of adverse reaction was tiny.
The answer came simply by looking at the question from another angle.
``The bigger issue to our mind is the 400,000 people a year getting the surgery without even knowing if it works,'' said Baruch Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor, who helped design the study.
Brody reasoned that the risks posed by an unproven surgical procedure were far greater than those from a sedative.
The study will be finished next year, with results scheduled to be published in October 2000.
If researchers find out the surgery is clearly beneficial, ``we should probably be doing it more than we're doing now,'' Moseley said.
But if sham surgery works as well as or better than real surgery, will doctors recommend that everyone get the placebo operation?
``That's not what we're going to propose,'' Moseley said.
``We'll have to say that as expensive as arthroscopy surgery (for arthritis) is, we probably can redirect those resources in a better way for treatment of arthritis''.
Marvin Gilbert, a VA patient who lives near Cleveland, Texas, signed up for the current study two years ago.
The 67-year-old water-well drill contractor recently completed his follow-up visits and learned he had actual surgery _ and he's convinced it worked.
A hand grenade in the Korean War paralyzed his left knee, and osteoarthritis in his right knee worsened over the years until he could only walk a few steps.
A few days after surgery, Gilbert was walking.
Soon, he could jump and run _ and he didn't care whether it was because of sham surgery or the real thing.
``It didn't matter.
It stopped the pain,'' he said.
``I didn't wonder what it was''.

LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) --Two universities in the United States said Thursday that they have received a five-year grant to establish a center for the joint study of mind-body interactions and health.
The focus of the center is to understand how the mind influences the development of and recovery from diverse diseases, including infectious diseases, osteoarthritis, early cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, said the University of Pittsburgh and Camegie Mellon University in a statement.
The grant of 10 million U.S. dollars the two universities in Pittsburgh have received was from the National Institute of Health (NIH), which funded four other centers for this initiative.
Prior to the establishment of the new center, researchers at both universities have undertaken individual studies of mind-body interactions and health.
They found that women with increased anger or hostility have a greater risk for coronary artery disease, and people who have a larger support network of friends and relatives get sick less often than those who lead solitary lives.
One study shows that osteoarthritis has the potential to compromise the health of family members as a result of the patient's negative responses to symptoms and the burden of providing emotional support and task assistance to the patient.
At the new center, researchers will study the risk for respiratory illnesses such as the flu which may be affected by the health of an individual's material and non-material relationships.
Focusing on older adults with osteoarthritis, researchers will determine if the patients and their spousal caregivers experience greater health benefits from an educational intervention targeted at both rather than just at the patient.
Doctors will also examine women's perception of stress, their attitude and coping responses as well as physiological reactions to the stress in their lives as potential markers of risk for cardiovascular disease.
Finally researchers hope to learn whether psychosocial interventions can be designed to enhance adjustment and lower recurrence and mortality among women with early breast cancer and to find out the psychological, behavioral and biological mechanisms through which the interventions operate.
IN the treatment of rheumatic disorders the mainstay drugs are initially for pain relief.
This is followed by drugs that stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation.
Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and pain-relieving medicines are used to control them.
They include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and locally applied linaments and ointments.
In the last five years, a better understanding of various rheumatic disorders has been created through immunology studies.
That has resulted in various drugs normally used in transplant treatment being applied in rheumatic disorders, for example, cyclosporin.
In the last two years, Cox-2 selective NSAIDs (meloxicam) have been introduced around the world for pain relief in rheumatic disorders.
They are said to be safer than existing NSAIDs in causing less gastrointestinal complications.
Up to now, all existing NSAIDs are known to cause gastric irritation.
A certain herbal product has been tried in rheumatic disorders in Denmark.
It is based on the patented ginger extract HMP-33 which is extracted from a special variety of ginger found only in one particular region in China.
Developed over six years by a Danish team led by biochemist Dr Morten Weidner, it comes in a soft gelatin capsule.
It was recently introduced here and is available over the counter.
Apparently, one capsule has properties equivalent to 6,600mg of dried ginger.
The largest and most recent trial to test the efficacy and safety of HMP-33 was conducted two years ago by a team of doctors from Copenhagen Municipal Hospital, headed by chief rheumatologist Dr Henning Bliddal and principal clinical investigator Dr Allan Rosetzsky.
Dr Bliddal and his team had carried out a random double-blind placebo-controlled study on 56 hospital patients suffering from osteoarthritis.
The findings revealed that the product can provide relief from bodily aches and seemingly without causing negative side effects.
Similar clinical studies are currently being carried out in Australia and the United States.
Generally, says a local doctor who requested anonymity, herbal products are not as well tested in clinical trials as medications which have to be registered for use in hospital pharmacies.
He adds trials with ginger extracts in rheumatic disorders have not been actively carried out in Malaysia and local doctors are awaiting confirmatory tests before recommending such products to patients.
Besides drugs to relieve pain, medication to stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation is also prescribed for rheumatic patients.
Some patients may need disease modifying drugs to prevent fibrosis of the tissues and joints and possibly internal organ damage.
Examples of such drugs include sulphasalazine, chloroquine, penicillamine, gold and methotrexate.
Steroids in the correct amount and for the proper duration of treatment are given to patients to reduce inflammation which may damage the body.
However, these are also the most commonly abused drugs because they are mixed illegally into herbal remedies.
Rheumatic disorders cover all medical diseases of the motoric system - bones, joints, muscles and tendons - as well as those related to the connective tissue.
The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
That means the treatment of each rheumatic disorder is individualised and aimed at the cause and source of the pain as well as underlying inflammation.
Based on Government hospital attendance records one in four Malaysians above 40 visits outpatient clinics for a rheumatic complaint.
This is probably the same in private clinics.
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) --Insurance companies warned here on Tuesday of enormous economic costs if global actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions come too slowly.
The warning was made by about 60 insurance companies in a position paper they presented Tuesday to an international negotiating conference on climate change resumed in Geneva on Monday.
The insurers expressed their concern that while the effect of climate change on the frequency or severity of extreme weather events remains unknown, it is clear that even small shifts in regional climate zones or storm patterns could lead to increased property damage.
They also pointed out that climate change could potentially have large implications for investment activities as society anticipates and adapts to new climate regime.
The insurers called on countries to take precautionary actions to reduce the risks of climate change.
According to them, the most efficient precautionary measure is an early and substantial reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
They also urged governments to promote scientific research that will establish what threshold level of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases should be considered dangerous.
According to industry sources, the insurance industry is currently under stress from a series of "Billion Dollar" storms since 1987.
This has led to dramatic increases in claims, reduced availability of insurance, and higher premiums.
"When a major industry such as the insurance sector starts to worry, so should we," commented Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Exective Director of the UN Environment Programme.
"While some industries think more about the costs of taking action against climate change, insurers know from experience how expensive it can be when people fail to protect themselves adequately from risks," she added.
How fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the focus of the latest negotiating conference, known officially as the second session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
In the treaty, which was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, industrialized countries agreed to take measures to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
But some environmental reports said almost none of them will meet that target.
While the UN and a number of non-governmental organizations are calling for drastic global action to reduce climate change, major industries in some countries are urging their governments to take a go-slow approach, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs and growth before the problem is better understood.
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) --Australian scientists warn that a deteriorating marine ecosystem in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions foreshadows further natural disasters caused by global warming.
Scientists at Macquarie Island near the Antarctic note that elephant seals and penguins were starving off because of feed shortage caused by shifting ocean currents and climate changes in the region, today's Age newspaper reported.
Meteorological records show that the average annual ocean temperature near the island has increased to 5.4 degrees from 4.5 degrees in 1912.
Jeremy Smith, leader of Australian scientific teams on the island, said that the annual temperature on Macquarie Island was rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world.
"Macquarie Island is a barometer, it's a measuring device for large-scale global changes," he said.
"Global change is now a certainty," he said.
Higher ocean surface temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect of the global atmosphere will alter the direction of ocean currents.
As a result, the number of plankton and fish will change as the marine ecosystem is disrupted.
Elephant seals and penguins population are collapsing as their prey stocks are moving away from the Antarctic waters.
Scientists on Macquarie Island found that the number of elephant seals and rock hopper penguins has dropped by half in the past few years.
Similar things have happened on Heard Island, 5,400 km west of Macquarie Island.
Worst still, the rock hopper penguin population on Campbell Island near New Zealand has crashed by 94 percent.
Cindy Hull, a zoologist at the University of Tasmania in Australia, also found the unprecedented fact this week that 16 percent of eggs of rock hopper penguins on Macquarie Island were infertile.
She said that this was an indication that female penguins were not getting enough food during their foraging in the ocean.
If food continued to disappear from the ocean, bigger penguins might also be affected, she said.
She said the decline in rock hoppers might be an indicator of the ecological impact of global warming.
Scientists on Macquarie Island fear that a one-degree change of global temperature would completely change one of the biggest ecosystem in the world.
In 1995, the sunniest December ever recorded on the island halted all major streams on it.
Scientists believe that the slightest hint of change at Macquarie is a clear signal that something significant is happening in the Southern Ocean.
The Southern Ocean stretches like a belt around the globe.
It is wedged between the Antarctic in the south, and the Australian, South American and African continents to the north.
"It saddens me to see, in a pristine environment like this, the deterioration of the natural ecosystem," Smith said.
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) --Huge tracts of Earth's surface could disappear under rising oceans, creating millions of" environmental refugees," British climate scientist John Houghton told a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The panel, which was set up by the United Nations in 1988 to investigate the pace of climate change and advise governments on potential risks, is meeting in Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand, with 120 experts participating.
Houghton said at the panel Tuesday that one estimate suggests up to 150 million people may be made homeless as oceans swell with warmer temperature caused by the greenhouse effect.
A rise in sea levels of up to one meter could happen by next century, affecting areas of Egypt, southern China and Bangladesh, he said, adding that a rise of one meter would wipe out the homes of up to 6 million people in Bangladesh alone.
New Zealand Environment Minister Marian Hobbs gave an opening speech at the meeting, pledging that her country would honor its international greenhouse gas control targets and take steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming.
She said New Zealand will introduce public education programs on climate change, greater investment in public transport and stronger energy efficiency measures.
At the top of the agenda of the three-day conference, which will end Thursday, is its next report on climate change, due to be presented to the United Nations in 2001, according to the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA).
The report will contain an assessment of the pace of climate change and strategies for governments to deal with it.
Two such reports were already submitted by the panel in 1990 and 1995.
NZPA reported that scientists estimate that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by about 30 percent since pre-industrial times.
If the present rate of emission continues,the amount of carbon dioxide will be double its pre-industrial level by the end of this century.
Evidence is mounting that emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation are affecting climate, it added.
There are 160 signatories to the U.N.
Climate Convention, an agreement designed to stabilize greenhouse gases at levels that would avoid catastrophic climate change.
WASHINGTON _ Global warming is not making some people in the nation's coldest state happy.
As higher temperatures melt some of the ice in Alaska, natives who live in or near the Arctic Circle said here Wednesday they are worried that their way of life will disappear.
Sterling Golongergen, 43, a community development worker in Savoonga, an island town in the Bering Sea, said at a news conference that as the ice melts, hunting gets more difficult.
``I have two sons who are being taught, hands on, by their father, uncles (and other elders) to hunt walrus, seal, whale, birds and fish,'' she said.
``But this year the ice packs left sooner.
There was very little game for them to hunt, (which) cut short our food supply'' and the time that her sons had to learn ``how to continue this way of life''.
She added: ``We do not really understand the science or the politics of environmental change, but it affects our lives''.
John Kulowiyi, 76, a whaling captain also from Savoonga, said ice around the village is slowly getting thinner year-round.
``We never go out (to hunt) this year by walking on the ice,'' he said.
``It's too dangerous for us''.
So in order to hunt, the men must travel 50 to 80 miles from the village, which makes the trips expensive for them, he said.
Amy ``Kalee'' Kreider, director of the U.S. global warming campaign for Greenpeace, an environmental organization which sponsored the news conference, said, ``In most of the lower 48 states, ice is seen as bad.
That's not the way things are seen in Alaska''.
A new report on global climate change released by Greenpeace said that as the seas warm up and glaciers melt, animals such as walruses seals, and caribous move north to colder temperatures.
These animals are a staple food for villagers in the Bering and Chukchi Seas region near Siberia.
The report said some plants are dying as tundra dries out because permafrost, ground that is frozen all year, is thawing and water is draining off.
Kreider also said the pesky sprucebark beetle has moved further north as temperatures climb.
She said it has already ``devastated a huge swathe of forest in southern Alaska (and)...
as far north as Fairbanks''.
The report cited interviews with natives in eight villages in the Bering and Chukchi Seas.
Kreider said Greenpeace expects Congress to hold hearings in January on the Alaskan climate change and that some of the people quoted in the report will testify.
She urged U.S. approval of the so-called Kyoto Protocol, an accord reached by negotiators around the world last December that would require industrial nations to make significant cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
The Greenpeace report noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,600 climate scientists from around the world, said Arctic sea ice has decreased 2.8 percent each decade since the late 1970s.
The panel also said that upper Arctic ice, which had been 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) to 3 meters (just under 9 feet) thick, now averages about 1.5 meters (under 5 feet) or less .
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) --South African Environment Minister Valli Moosa said on Friday that global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria.
Addressing a meeting in Cape Town of ministers and officials from the countries of Southern African Development Community (SADC), he said that in the past year South Africa had recorded the highest average temperatures.
He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
"It is more and more a matter which is impacting on all people".
One of the results of this had been a rise in the incidence of malaria, he said, adding that "this is a matter which is of grave concern to us".
The SADC meeting aims to formulate regional policies on matters such as desertification, climate change and biodiversity.
Countries attending the meeting, hosted by South Africa, include Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
WASHINGTON (AP --Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
``Whether the changes are related to global warming is not statistically clear, but it's what appears to be happening,'' said Jim Barry, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.
The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon.
It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds, they said.
``We don't fully realize what's happening...
but these are the sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National Department of Fisheries.
Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem''.
While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the reasons remain in dispute.
Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, including the El Nino phenomenon.
Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year.
Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past, he said.
And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said.
Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their energy and strength.
``We're starting to see a very troubling perspective on this,'' he said.
The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in the food chain.
The reduced size of returning salmon and the decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' they said.
Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, ``the early stages are already here,'' he argued.
As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, suggesting a broader climate change.
``What we're seeing now is unprecedented,'' agreed Barry .
WASHINGTON _ On the west coast of Canada's Hudson Bay, fewer and fewer polar bears are being born each year.
In the Maldive Islands, coral are bleaching and then dying.
And in the North Pacific, sockeye salmon seem to be losing weight.
These are a few of the signs that scientists say point to an increasingly inescapable conclusion: global warming is threatening marine life worldwide.
In a report scheduled for release Tuesday, the Redmond, Wash-based Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the World Wildlife Fund declare that ``global climate change is an additional stress on already stressed species, and may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for many types of marine life''.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
``The news is not good,'' said Elliott Norse, the biologist who heads the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
``The thing that screams out here is that from the inter-tidal zone to the open ocean, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, we are seeing worrisome things everywhere that seem to be most closely correlated with climate change''.
Norse offered a variety of recent examples of the impacts of global warming, from the encroachment of subalpine firs into the alpine meadows on Mount Rainier, to the marlin caught off Longview, Wash.
, to the appearance of Pacific dolphins off the Aleutian islands.
Even the recent spate of emaciated gray whales beaching themselves along the West Coast may be attributable to global warming, he said.
In virtually every example, Norse said, species such as fish or bears or whales appear to be suffering from a lack of food that is connected to a warming of the ocean.
Polar bears, for example, seem to be suffering from a decline in the amount of sea ice, which is a source of algae that form the lowest rung on the bears' food chain.
' The report says the Alaskan salmon population declined drastically in 1997 and 1998, and that salmon that survive are unusually small, suggesting that they were starved.
The report says that sockeye are particularly susceptible to temperature variations.
``Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and possibly for other salmon species as well,'' the report says.
The report was greeted skeptically by critics of global warming science.
``This doesn't surprise me, because they blame everything on global warming from tornadoes to droughts to heat waves,'' said John Carlisle, director of the environmental policy task force for The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.
``But there is no firm evidence that man-made global warming is even occurring.
The fact is that the Earth's temperature is naturally fluctuating''.
Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
But Norse said the evidence that global warming is harming marine life is overwhelming.
``Whether the warming we have been seeing is caused by people is unclear, but that is by far the most logical explanation for the fact that the weather is the warmest it's been for thousands of years,'' Norse said.
``The evidence is so strong, it's almost like the evidence for gravity.
The people who deny it are denying it for reasons that are not scientific or substantive, but because it goes against their beliefs or economic interests''.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Those gases trap heat, and although there is ongoing dispute about how that in turn affects the climate, there is no doubt that global temperatures are rising.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, over the past century mean global temperatures have increased 0.6 to 1.2 degrees, the global sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches, and the snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean have decreased.
The 10 warmest years of this century have occurred within the past 15 years.
What to do about global warming is controversial, both in Congress and in the international policy arena.
World diplomats meeting in Bonn have been bogged down in a dispute between the United States and Europe over how to address global warming.
And the Clinton administration has yet to ask Congress to approve the Kyoto Protocol it signed in 1997, saying that it is waiting for more developing countries to sign onto the pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The report also comes at a time when residents of the Northwest and the country are already spending millions of dollars and facing potential restrictions in development in order to address other factors thought to be harming Pacific salmon, such as overfishing, dams and hatcheries.
Evidence continues to accumulate that the frozen world of the Arctic and sub-Arctic is thawing, and the findings are spotlighting two increasingly important questions: Can what is happening in the Great White North touch off sudden shifts in climate that will transform weather and disrupt life throughout the Northern Hemisphere?
Is the Arctic a key to the way in which global warming might be translated into region-by-region climatic changes?
The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
The theory behind this view holds that the climate of the North Atlantic region, including Europe and eastern North America, is controlled by great ocean currents that transport heat northward from the tropics.
This oceanic conveyor belt is set in motion when saltier, and therefore heavier, surface water sinks to the deep ocean in the vicinity of southern Greenland.
It is replaced by warm water from the tropics that warms the North Atlantic region.
Without it, the relatively mild climate of England, for instance, might be as cold as that of northern Canada.
The worry is that a great influx of fresh water from the thawing Arctic might dilute the salty current and so either halt or weaken the heat-bearing conveyor belt.
This could result in a sudden, long-term drop in the North Atlantic region's temperature, a climatic disruption that would probably reverberate around the hemisphere by altering large-scale atmospheric circulation.
Last week, scientists reported that the current did indeed weaken or stop at least twice in the past, plunging the region, which each time had been warming, into cold comparable to that of an ice age.
Other researchers, focusing on the present, last week produced the latest in a lengthening string of studies documenting the thawing of the vast sheet of ice that covers the far northern seas, a potential source of fresh water that, once it melts, could help weaken the heat conveyor.
A third research group, using computerized simulations of the ocean-atmosphere system, concluded that the present-day thawing of Northern Hemisphere sea ice could not be explained by natural causes.
The most obvious possible cause, they said, is global warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, which result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
And they said the rate of sea-ice melting was likely to increase in the decades ahead if emissions of the heat-trapping gases continued at today's rates.
Sudden influxes of fresh water from the Arctic appear to have shut down or weakened the oceanic heat conveyor twice in the relatively recent geological past, according to a study reported in the current issue of Nature by Dr.
Carsten Ruhlemann of the University of Bremen, Germany, and colleagues.
By examining chemical clues in ocean sediments, they determined that in each case, the western tropical North Atlantic was relatively warm while waters farther north were relatively cold _ as would be expected if the conveyor stopped or weakened.
The apparent shutdowns occurred as the world was coming out of the last ice age.
The North Atlantic region's rebound was twice interrupted by sudden reversions to glacial conditions, once around 15,000 years ago and again around 12,000 years ago, before settling into the relative warmth that has prevailed for the last 10,000 years.
The first reversion to glacial cold coincided with an invasion of the North Atlantic by vast quantities of fresh water in the form of icebergs, which were released from North America as temperatures warmed.
Another influx is believed to have touched off the second reversion to cold, called the Younger Dryas event.
That event set off far-flung reverberations.
The climate of the Middle East dried out so much that food became scarce, forcing the invention of agriculture, many scientists believe.
The New York region became so chilly that cold-weather trees like spruce took over the landscape from species like oak.
Could an influx of fresh water brought about by global warming make that happen again?
Recent studies lend the question new urgency.
In one, reported in the December issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists analyzed data collected by sonar aboard nuclear submarines and found that the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean has become about 40 percent thinner than it was two to four decades ago.
nn In another, reported in the current issue of the journal Science, researchers led by Dr.
Ola M.
Johannessen of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway, used satellite data to measure the area of the Arctic ice sheet.
They found that the perennial ice cover had shrunk by 14 percent over the last two decades.
The third study, by nine researchers headed by Dr.
Konstantin Y.
Vinnikov of the University of Maryland, analyzed data from five different sources and found that sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole had decreased by about 7 percent in the last 46 years.
Computer models of the ocean-atmosphere system reconstructed this trend accurately, said Dr.
Alan Robock of Rutgers University, a member of the research team.
The model simulations also determined that the trend was much larger than what would be expected to result from the climate system's natural variability.
This assumes that the models can reproduce natural variability with some accuracy, an assumption that many experts question.
Nevertheless, Robock said, the study provides ``strong support for the theory that humans are causing the climate to change''.
If the climate is indeed warming because of human activity, many scientists say, the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic could increase.
Melting ice in the Arctic is not the only potential contributor.
Water from melting glaciers in Greenland and other Arctic and sub-arctic islands could also contribute.
Last year, scientists reported that the southern half of the Greenland ice cap was melting back by about two cubic miles a year, enough to cover Maryland with a sheet 1 foot thick.
(Runoff from melting glaciers contributes to a rising global sea level.
Melting sea ice does not; like an ice cube in a glass of water, its change in state does not raise the water level).
A third contributor to an influx of fresh water could be increased precipitation.
A warmer atmosphere causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, and some scientists believe that some of this increased atmospheric moisture would be transported to the far north, where it would produce a heavier runoff of fresh water into the North Atlantic.
This alone, some computer models indicate, would be enough to weaken the North Atlantic heat conveyor drastically in the 21st century.
How much fresh water might be necessary to halt, slow or weaken the conveyor is a crucial question that scientists cannot yet answer.
Nor do they know how close the world might be to an abrupt change in the conveyor's behavior.
``I don't think there's any accurate assessment out there that would tell us,'' said Dr.
Peter Schlosser, a geochemist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
If a warming atmosphere pumped enough fresh water into the ocean to shut down the conveyor, what would it mean?
Schlosser and others say the magnitude of the resulting climate change might be different from those observed in the last glacial cycle.
But, he said, ``It might put the system into a state that might be a precondition for further change''.
What might such a change entail?
Temperature and precipitation patterns could be drastically altered, much as El Nino alters them, and Schlosser says the alteration's effects would probably be felt throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
But exactly how the patterns would change and therefore what their down-to-earth effects would be, he said, is an open question.
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) --The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has undertaken various activities in Africa to address concerns of the continent in connection with climate variability and change, a UNEP official said Thursday.
At a press conference held here at the UNEP headquarters, Alex Alusa, program officer of UNEP atmosphere unit, said that UNEP had organized seminars to help African leaders in planning and preparing for droughts in Africa.
An ad hoc Working Group on the El Nino has been set up to review state of the science on El Nino and provide El Nino information to African countries as part of an Early Warning System, he added.
Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of countries.
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system".
The UNEP official noted that sustained increase in mean ambient temperatures beyond one centigrade degree would cause significant changes in forest and rangeland cover, species distribution, composition and migration patterns, and biome distribution.
Many organisms in the deserts are already near their tolerance limits, and some may not be able to adapt further under hotter conditions, he warned.
Alusa stressed that African continent is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution and over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture.
Although adaptation options theoretically are available, Alusa said, in practice the human, infrastructural and economic response capacity to effect timely response actions may well be beyond the economic means of some countries.
As farming depends entirely on the quality of the rainy season in most African countries, increased droughts could seriously impact the availability of food for the continent, he noted.
According to the UNEP official, a warmer environment could open up new areas for malaria and increase the incidence of yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.
He warned that Africa was expected to be at risk primarily from increased incidences of vector-borne diseases and reduced nutritional status.
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer also addressed the press conference, saying that he was committed to making UNEP an integral voice for the environmental policy.
He disclosed that the Global Environment Facility (FEF) had given UNEP a total of 750 million U.S.
Dollars to combat forest fires in Indonesia and Brazil.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ As the hurricane hunter plane swooped low over the ocean on a late October day, white caps and green foam flicked across the tropical waters, giving rise to Mitch.
Clouds grew.
Rain squalls massed.
And Tropical Depression No.
13 would become a killing machine whose 180-mph (290-kph) winds made it one of the century's strongest Atlantic hurricanes.
Reaching colossal heights, Mitch would blot out more than 10,000 lives across Central America with torrential rains, sending mudslides tumbling over villages and floodwaters to the sea.
Powerful hurricanes like Mitch, devastating droughts and torrential floods have long plagued humankind.
But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's undue warming.
The two-week summit was expected to conclude Friday with a framework for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which calls for reductions in heat-trapping gases by industrialized nations by 2012.
Skeptics insist there's no way to predict the weather, next week, next decade or even a century from now.
Environmentalists, too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming.
In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark report that ``the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate''.
In other words, mankind has some hand in the Earth's warming.
Picking up their cue from the scientific evidence, climate negotiators in Buenos Aires say there is more cause for concern.
``Every month so far this year has set a record high for global temperatures, right on the heels of 1997, the warmest year on the books.
And a powerful El Nino gave us a taste of the extreme weather we can expect from global warming: droughts and floods in Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, Florida and Mexico, and devastating floods in China,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the top U.S. climate negotiator.
Others reject that the globe is warming, and challenge the consensus that unfettered burning of coal, gas and oil will harm the Earth.
As the debate continues, record amounts of gases spew from power plants and cars.
New research shows that temperature changes can change more rapidly than previously thought, says Jeff Severinghause of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.
``We now have evidence that at the end of the last ice age, the climate warmed abruptly in less than 10 years,'' he said, reporting findings from 100-pound (45-kilo) samples extracted from Greenland's ice pack.
He said evidence suggests a rapid change 11,600 years ago, when temperatures rose about 14 degrees F (8 degrees C) in a mere decade or two.
He has documented at least one other sudden shift.
One U.S. atmospheric scientist, John R.
Christy at the University of Alabama, contends satellite and balloon data show significant global warming is not occuring now.
He has also argued that trying to discern patterns in ``extreme'' weather events is misleading.
And hurricane forecasters doubt extreme weather events such as Mitch show the influence of global warming.
``I think it's agreed that the globe is about 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer this century, but as far as its effect on tropical cyclones, we haven't been able to notice any difference,'' said forecaster Brian Jarvinen at the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
He said intense hurricane periods have cycled on and off roughly every 25 years in this century.
``You had intense storms in the 1920s, 30s and 40s,'' he said, but then a milder hurricane cycle from the 60s to the 80s.
Some governments warn they can't wait for a definitive answer to why the oceans are rising.
Seas have risen 2 centimeters (nearly 1 inch) in the past year in parts of the Pacific, shrinking shorelines and displacing coastal dwellers _ all blamed on global warming.
The prime minister of Tuvalu said his nation of 9,600 people _ spread over nine small South Pacific atolls, has already suffered.
``We are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable countries,'' said Bikenibeau Paeniu.
``We are spending millions of dollars to rehabilitate the devastation caused by the adverse effects of climate change''.
As for global warming, he added his islands average just 2 meters (6 feet) above sea level, and global warming is ``not a matter of economics and politics, but of life and death.''
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) --Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr.
James Baker, Director of U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Writing in the Washington Post Monday when the Fourth Session of the Conference of the Parties to U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change begins in Buenos Aires, the U.S. scientist said that global warming chould affect everything from energy use and transportation to water resource management and agriculture to international trade and development.
Baker said that over the past century, greenhouse gases have increased steadly: fossil fuel combustion now accounts for about 85 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
At the same time, agriculture, changing land-use patterns and deforestation are playing a significant role in altering the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Since 1860, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent.
Overall emissions of greenhouse gases have been growing at about 1 percent each year, he said.
On the risks of a warmer world, Baker said that a relatively small change in mean global temperature can lead to a large change in extreme events.
This year's El Nino has increased rainfall, flooding and droughts.
Increased duration and frequency of heat waves would heighten mortality rates, and the potential for transmitting serious infectious diseases would be increased, Baker said.
According to a scientific assessment, the globally averaged temperature will increase about 2 to 6 degrees by the year 2100.
The related rise in sea level will be about 6 to 37 inches.
With 50 percent of the U.S. population and 50 to 70 percent of the global population currently living in coastal areas, future sea level rises, alterations in storm patterns and higher storm surges could have devastating effects.
Even with current global populations, a 20-inch rise in the sea level without adaptive measures would directly threaten 92 million people, wrote Director Baker.

Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature'.
In the other scenario, the internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting to slow down.
With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,'' Oppenheimer said.
Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet, as early as next century, he said.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius during the next century.
Last year, scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature.
Over time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts, the scientists said.
To deal with this threat 38 industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012.
While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting'.
But Oppenheimer warned that, as countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date.
Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said.
Until recently, scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting.
Similarly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all.
Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating ice, he added.
In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of local atmospheric warming.
While most scientists agreed that the ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt and what the consequences would be.
In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
Each of the three most likely possibilities varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice shelves in the area.
Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.
While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the twenty-first century for several hundreds of years, the process could begin in as early as 50 years.
Some reports said the process already had begun.
In the other scenario, Oppenheimer believed that internal ice shifting within the ice sheet possibly could cause the melting to slow down.
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) --Some 1,000 world senior scientists at a summit here today called on world leaders to act immediately to prevent the potentially devastating consequences of human-induced global warming.
A consensus declaration "World Scientists' Call for Action at Kyoto," signed by more than 1,500 scientists, was presented to the U.S. government at the Summit on Climate Change in Washington, DC.
"Let there be no doubt about the conclusions of the scientific community: the threat of global warming is very real and action is needed immediately," said Nobel laureate Henry Kendall, chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
"It is a grave error to believe that we can continue to procrastinate".
Leading scientists came to the Science Summit to urge world leaders at their Kyoto Climate Summit in Japan in December to negotiate final agreement on a treaty to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are altering the climate.
The scientists meeting today was held six days before a White House conference to propose global actions on the issue.
The scientists' declaration urged all government leaders to demonstrate a new commitment to protecting the global environment for future generations.
The declaration stated that global warming is underway and the overuse of fossil fuels is partly to blame.
It said that climate change is projected to raise sea levels; increase the likelihood of more intense rainfall, floods, and droughts; and endanger human health by greater exposure to heat waves and encroachment of tropical diseases to higher latitudes.
Further, the declaration said, climate change is likely to exacerbate food shortages and spread undernutrition by adversely affecting water supplies, soil conditions, temperature tolerances, and growing seasons.
Climate change will also accelerate the appalling pace at which species are now disappearing, especially in vulnerable ecosystems, it said, adding that possibly one-third of all species may be lost before the end of the next century.
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent since preindustrial times.
Over the same period, atmospheric methane has risen by 145 percent, mostly from agricultural activities like growing rice and raising cattle.
As a result, the earth's average surface temperature will increase by 1.0-3.5 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years, in addition to the increase of 0.3-0.6 degrees Celsius that has already occurred since 1860.
Scientists predict that even if people stopped emitting heat-trapping gases now, the climate wouldn't stabilize for many decades because of the gases have already been sent into the atmosphere.
They hold that a strong treaty will be the "first step to protect future generations from dire prospects that would result from failure to meet our responsibilities toward them".
This is a wake-up call for world leaders.
Never before has the senior scientific community spoken so boldly on the urgent need to prevent disruption to our climate," said Nobel laureate Dudley Herschbath, professor of chemistry at Harvard University.
BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) --The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger because of the climate change.
The WWF and WFA experts told the press here that all the measures to increase the energy efficiency must be taken and less contaminating sources of energy should be used as a final solution to the problem.
All the countries, especially the industrialized ones, must commit themselves to take more stringent measures to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, they added.
The press conference was attended by Nigel Dudley, WWF independent consultant, and WFA Director Javier Corcuera.
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
He said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid climate change.
The WWF, the biggest organization in the world for the conservation of nature, has 4.7 million employees who work in 96 countries in the world.
The organization also has a status of official observer in the United Nations.
The Fourth World Conference on the Climate Change will be held here from November 2 to 13.
GENEVA (AP) --Cities including New York and Tokyo may face flooding; large swathes of Latin America will suffer from drought and Australia's Great Barrier Reef may be destroyed unless more is done to stop global warming, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature warned Tuesday.
The environmental group urged governments meeting in Germany next week to honor earlier pledges to cut emissions of carbon dioxide --one of the main greenhouse gases -- by implementing tough energy-saving policies.
``Evidence for the warming of our planet over the last 200 years is now overwhelming,'' said a WWF statement.
``With no action to curb emissions, the climate on earth over the next century could become warmer than any the human species has lived through''.
It said China's Giant Panda and the Arctic polar bear were among the species at risk of extinction from global warming.
WWF commissioned the Climatic Research Unit at Britain's University of East Anglia to conduct research into various climate change scenarios over the next few decades.
It projected that sea levels would rise between three-quarters of an inch to four inches per decade.
This would threaten low-lying U.S. coastal cities such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Miami with flooding.
The Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka --among others -- would also be at risk, it said.
Large areas of the Amazon would become more susceptible to forest fires.
Drought would also likely affect Argentina, southern Mexico and Central America.
Rising sea temperatures by 2010 threatened the very survival of the Australian Great Barrier Reef.
Scientists generally agree that temperatures are rising --with 1998 being the warmest year on record.
But there is no consensus on how much man is to blame.
``Although the precise contribution of human activities to global warming cannot yet be stated with confidence, it is clear the planet would not be warming as rapidly if humans were not currently emitting about 6.8 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year,'' said the WWF report.
Under a 1997 agreement reached in the Japanese city of Kyoto, industrialized nations agreed to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by five percent between 2008 and 2012.
Representatives from 150 countries meet later this month in Bonn to work on ways of implementing the Kyoto deal prior to a November 2000 meeting in the Netherlands.
While President Clinton signed the Kyoto agreement, he has not sought its ratification because of widespread opposition in the Senate.
Critics say it will cost too much to implement while developing countries will be allowed to let greenhouse emissions grow.
As Earth grows warmer, the prognosis for human health is darkening.
Skeptics still dismiss the doomsday scenarios of the so-called greenhouse effect.
But momentum is building for those scientists who contend that the time has come to investigate how global warming may hurt, not whether it's real.
Heat stress deaths in the United States may double by 2075, one researcher estimates.
More Americans will wheeze from pollution, sneeze from pollen and grow ill from contaminated water, according to some projections.
Recent studies showed that abnormal rainfalls boosted mice populations and likely sparked the 1993 hantavirus outbreak near Albuquerque, N.M., suggesting that climate shifts pose infectious disease threats in the United States.
The forecast is worse for those living beyond U.S. borders, where diseases may hitchhike on bugs thriving in the heat and epidemics may wash ashore on ocean plants blooming in warm water.
``It's happening right now,'' said Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard University's Medical School, who is among the most pessimistic of researchers.
``Glaciers are retreating, plants are migrating.
We're seeing West Nile virus in New York, dengue and malaria in northern India''.
The warming phenomenon is widely blamed on the atmospheric build-up of ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide, which are emitted during the burning of coal and other fossil fuels.
The gases trap heat, upsetting climate systems, many experts maintain.
The consequences to health are viewed through the lens of probability.
Rising temperatures, heavier rains and longer droughts would shake up ecological systems that influence human well-being.
Prolonged rains, for example, might cause new plant growth that would attract deer, which can carry ticks, which can carry Lyme disease.
Drought may slow rivers, creating stagnant pools for mosquito breeding.
The possibilities are riveting to specialists across the sciences, from experts in plant migration to researchers who peek inside polar ice cores for clues about prehistoric climate.
At least two groups of scientists are tracking possible health threats.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, assembled by the United Nations, has concluded that ``significant loss of life'' is possible.
Dengue, rift valley fever, cholera and other diseases may spread in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the IPCC reports.
The portion of the world population vulnerable to malaria may rise to 60 percent from 45 percent by 2100, according to the IPCC.
A group of U.S. scientists, meanwhile, is updating a report to Congress that will outline domestic threats from hotter air and oceans.
The resulting climate shifts would drench some regions in more intense and frequent rain, while others areas would get baked by drought, these scientists say.
The group recently warned that warmer air will increase ground-level ozone pollution, aggravating asthma and other breathing problems, plus increase allergy woes in areas where plants flourish.
The report, the health segment of the U.S.
National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, also warns that more people could get sick from contaminated water.
Floods may cause overflows at sewage treatment plants.
The specific impact will depend on a person's age and overall health, scientists said.
``With heat waves, it's the elderly,'' said Jonathan Patz, director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Health Effects of Global Environmental Change and a lead author of the U.S. assessment.
``With air pollution, if ozone increases, it's people with respiratory problems''.
Laurence Kalkstein, director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware, predicted that heat stress fatalities will double in the next 75 years if warming trends and other conditions persist.
About 2,000 to 3,000 Americans die each year from heat stress, he said.
Fatalities will be most common in cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where residents are unaccustomed to extreme, enduring heat, and where many people live in brick houses with tar roofs.
But people living in established hot spots may suffer, too.
``Let's assume it gets up to 120 or 125 degrees relatively regularly'' in Phoenix, Kalkstein said.
``You may get to the point where the heat just becomes intolerable''.
All the projections come with caveats.
For instance, other factors may prove more important than global warming in the spread of disease.
Expansions in worldwide travel and trade will be responsible for some epidemics.
So will weak sanitation, water and medical systems.
``A major problem is population growth,'' said Dr.
Donald Henderson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.
``Urban areas are growing at very rapid rates.
People in tropical areas are living in crowded areas with poor sanitation.
All these factors could allow an organism to grow, but they have nothing to do with global warming''.
Forecasts also are clouded by the limits of science.
Researchers cannot say, for example, exactly when and where disease will strike, or how severely.
Nor is it known how vaccines, more air conditioning or other measures will insulate people from illnesses.
But the worldwide climate has changed significantly, most scientists concur.
Air temperatures have risen between 0.7 and 1.4 degrees in the past 100 years, and new data show ocean warming down to depths of nearly 10,000 feet.
Palpable symptoms are emerging.
Global icecaps are melting.
Insects are migrating to higher elevations, and shrubs are taking root on the Alaskan tundra.
The scientific understanding of what role climate plays in health, meanwhile, is growing.
In Uganda, torrential rains have been blamed for malaria deaths.
A new study of more than 400 gastrointestinal disease outbreaks across the U.S. estimates that runoffs from heavy rains carried the bacteria one-third of the time.
``It is indeed an emerging science,'' said Rita Colwell, director of the National Science Foundation.
``Will we have cholera in the U.S.?
I doubt it.
Will we have more severe events in Bangladesh?
Possibly''. But most scientists say it's too early to confirm links between current human sickness and global warming.
Predictions that reach beyond the proof of science risk the label of irresponsibility.
``There are many, many reasons why malaria has gone higher in recent years,'' said Paul Reiter, a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specialist who has studied mosquitos at higher elevations.
``But none of them have been attributed to climate change.
It's just make-believe''.
Some scientists are guilty of oversimplification, said Hadi Dowlatabadi, director of the Integrated Study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change at Carnegie Mellon University.
If warming temperatures were such a powerful bridge to disease, Dowlatabadi asks, why did malaria epidemics sweep through England and other chilly locales in previous generations?
Missing from current projections, he said, are adequate emphases on public health factors.
Between 1995 and 1998, for instance, 50,000 people in northern Mexico fell sick by dengue fever, the mosquito-born disease that can cause fever, headaches and internal bleeding.
Only 50 people in nearby Texas, meanwhile, were stricken, Dowlatabadi said.
``You tell me: Does the climate change dramatically as you go the five miles over the Rio Grande''? he asked.
Researchers on the U.S.
Assessment team, while giving weight to such arguments, say they miss the larger point: With global climate shifting, risk is rising.
``There's not complete agreement on all the particulars,'' said Harvard's Epstein.
``But there is a clear consensus that climate plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact on public health in multiple ways''.
(OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) Researchers scratching away at the question said they've found a helpful tool in a familiar weather phenomenon: El Nino.
El Nino events, the natural climate cycles that cause regional temperature extremes, rainfalls and droughts, may be useful dress rehearsals for more permanent shifts.
``To the extent that El Nino can give you a short window into long-term events, it's a valid way to look at things,'' said Dr.
Brian Hjelle, a New Mexico scientist.
Hjelle is among researchers who have examined recent outbreaks of hantavirus, the illness that has killed dozens in New Mexico and other Southwest states in recent years.
When people became sick with flu-like symptoms in 1993, the cause was a mystery.
The afflicted got fevers, aches and chills.
Next came headaches, nausea and lungs filling with fluid.
Forty died.
Around-the-clock investigation blamed the white-bellied deer mouse, whose urine can carry the virus.
Seven years later, scientists maintain a climate shift was at work.
The deer mouse population boomed prior to the outbreak, according to a study authored by Hjelle, because El Nino-driven rains in 1991-92 increased vegetation, providing food and ground cover.
When conditions turned drier the next year, the mice sought food in homes.
Scientists said they're now refining the technique of using ``climate signals'' to prepare for health problems.
In East Africa, ocean temperatures and mountain greenery can be used to predict outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a disease that causes partial blindness in humans and forces pregnant livestock to abort fetuses.
And in the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, satellite imagery has shown that higher water temperatures cause plankton blooms that carry cholera epidemics.
``We really think we've made the linkage between climate variability, ecology and human health,'' said Patz, from Johns Hopkins.
``And this is where we need to go'' to understand risks.
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) --Climate change is likely to disturb various natural and ecological systems, posing serious threat to human health, said a report jointly released Tuesday by relevant United Nations specialized agencies at a session on global warming issue.
"In destablizing the world's climate and its dependent ecosystems, we are posing new and widespread risks to human health", said the report, which assesses potential health consequences of human-induced climate change, while conceding that much more research needs to be done.
The pace of climate change is predicted to be unprecedentedly quick due to the accumulation in atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.
The least direct health effects would be those due to socioeconomic disruption caused by environmental deterioration, the most direct would be those caused by heatwaves, storms and floods.
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as the climate is getting warmer and wetter.
Experts predict a 1-3 centigrade degree growth in global mean surface temperature by the year 2100, and that we would have higher sea level, more heavy rainfalls, more floods, more bushfires, as well as longer and more severe droughts.
Hot weather would lead to up to several thousand extra heat-related deaths annually by around 2050 in many big cities worldwide.
The increase would outweigh the decline in winter-related mortality.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
Climate change allows disease vectors to extend territory, helping infectious diseases spread and kill more people.
In the next century, it would increase the global incidence of malaria by 50 to 80 million additional cases annually, and the vulnerable population would rise from the current 45 percent to about 60 percent of the world's total.
The incidence of food-and water-related infections such as cholera would also grow, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, following changes in water distribution, temperature and the proliferation of microorganisms, the report added.
According to the report, by exacerbating the production of some types of air pollutants, climate change would result in the increase in the incidence of related health problems, such as cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders.
In some regions, warmer and wetter climate could also lead to higher concentration in air of various pollens and spores with a possible impact on allergic disorders, such as hay fever and asthma.
Sustained stratospheric ozone depletion --a factor closely related to climate change, which leads to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation, would cause increased cases of skin cancer, and possibly of ocular lesions, such as cataracts.
It may also impair human immune system, said the report, which was released at the July 8-19 session in Geneva of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
OTTAWA, April 18 (Xinhua) --The Arctic town of Sachs Harbour in Canada on the west coast of Banks Island is slowly sinking into the sea as a result of global warming, the National Post reported Tuesday.
Climate change in the past decade has brought milder winters, warmer summers and a later freeze-up to soften the permafrost that supports the Arctic town.
Rosemarie Kuptana, an Inuit leader, was quoted as saying the situation has made it difficult for hunters to travel over an increasingly muddy landscape.
"If this rate of change continues, our lifestyle may forever change because our communities are sinking with the melting permafrost," she said.
Kuptana is leading an international project to collect Inuit observations about climate change in her hometown of Sachs Harbour.
In the northwest reaches of the Arctic, she said that experienced hunters have fallen through unusually thin ice.
The region is also seeing the appearance of species such as robins, barn swallows, beetles and sandflies.
Some of the Inuit locals have begun to suffer allergies from white pine pollen, which has never before reached Banks Island.
She urged more attention to the issue of global warming, saying, "What happens in the Arctic environment is what is in store for other regions of the world."
MONTREAL, October 16 (Xinhua) --The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) today called for stronger actions to combat the threat of climate change to wildlife and natural ecosystems.
"Climate change as a result of global warming represents a serious threat to the survival of biodiversity and the protection, management and rehabilitation of protected areas," the WWF reaffirmed.
Governments and international organizations "have to stop hitting the snooze button on the alarm bell for action that global warming represents," said Adam Markham, director of the WWF's Global Climate Change Campaign.
"How many ecosystems must be threatened before we listen to this wake-up call"? he asked at a news briefing at the ongoing World Conservation Congress in Montreal, Canada.
Climate changes affecting the planet are caused mainly by the burning of coal, oil and gas.
Huge quantities of pollutants like carbon dioxide trap more and more heat in the atmosphere, ultimately disrupting the global temperature balance.
At the speed the climate is now changing, scientists predict the world will soon be warmer than at any time in the last 10,000 years.
According to a study by some 2,500 scientists of the world, atmospheric concentrations of Co2 are now 30 percent above the pre-industrial level and a warming trend in global mean temperature can be detected since 1860.
"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
Climate change is "getting worse," and it has already produced "severe" impacts on ecosystems, habitats, species, Markham noted.
In this fight against global warming, Markham emphasized that the industrialized countries should take on more responsibilities and keep their promises of Co2 emission reductions.
He singled out the United States, the world's biggest producer of green house gas emission, and Canada, the No.
1 country in per capita gas emission.
The two countries produce more than 20 percent of all gas emission worldwide, he said.
If the present level of ecosystem is to be maintained, at least 20 percent of Co2 emission will have to be reduced worldwide, Markham added.
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) --Global warming weather will critically undermine efforts for sustainable development in Lebanon and other Mediterranean literal states, the Greenpeace Mediterranean has said in a report.
Daily Star today quoted a report issued by Greenpeace Mediterranean in Lebanon on Thursday entitled "Climate change and the Mediterranean region" as saying that climate change will add to existing problems of desertification, water scarcity, and food production in the region.
As the world warms, global sea levels will rise as oceans expand.
The level of much of the Mediterranean could rise by close to one meter by 2100, the report said.
According to the report, the worst affected areas will be the Nile Delta in Egypt, Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in Greece as a consequence of the expected rise in sea level.
It said that the first impact of climate change will be felt in the Mediterranean water resource system.
Reductions in water availability would hit southern Mediterranean countries the hardest.
In Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Malta and Lebanon, water availability is already near the 1,000 cubic meters per person per year benchmark for water scarcity, and the report warns that live-stock production would suffer as rangeland deteriorates.
The 55-page report added that rising carbon dioxide (CO2) will also introduce new threats to human health, ecosystems and national economies.
As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and severity of drought could increase across the region.
Temperatures could rise by over four degrees centigrade by 2100 over many of the inland areas and by more than this over the Mediterranean Sea.
The report called on all Mediterranean states to immediately demand industrialized countries adopt legally-binding obligations at the Kyoto Climate Conference in Japan next month to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by 2005.
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) --Global warming in the 21st century will likely cause drastic changes in the climate of the United States, including potentially severe droughts, increased risk of flood, mass migrations of species, and widespread erosion of coastal zones, a new federal report released this week says.
The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
Among its key findings, the report indicates that continued growth in worldwide emissions is likely to increase average temperatures across the United States by 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.
Impacts such as heavier precipitation and increased drought will vary widely from region to region, and some natural ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, coral reefs, coastal wetlands and Alaskan permafrost, are likely to deteriorate further and some may disappear entirely, says the report.
Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change significantly.
Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on computer models and historical data, and "American society would likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts".
The program was authorized by Congress in 1990 and carried out by nine federal agencies.
The analysis was based largely on two computer simulations of future climate that often produce very different or even antithetical results.
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) --Experts attending the '97 China International Environmental Forum warn that failure to limit greeenhouse gas emissions will raise the global mean surface temperature by two degrees centigrades over the next 100 years.
This will in turn raise the sea level by some 50 cm.
, according to Raul Estrada Oyuela, chairman of Ad Hoc Group Berlin Mandate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
He added that many island states will disappear by then.
People threatened by storms and floods will be forced to migrate, and climate changes will aggravate risks of famine and disease, said Oyuela.
He cited a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which noted that stablization of the concentration of greenhouse gases by the year 2100 will nonetheless be accompanied by rising temperatures and higher sea levels.
Zou Jingmeng, former chairman of the World Meteorological Organization, stressed that further proof is needed to verify the prediction, but noted that people must pay great attention to the possibility of any increase in the global surface temperature.
Experts say the concentration of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, in the atmosphere will continue to rise due to the use of coal, petroleum, fertilizer and excessive deforestation.
Oyuela said the global mean surface temperature over the past one hundred years has climbed by 0.6 centigrades, with a rise in the sea level of between 10-25 centimeters.
He said that a 50 cm rise in the sea level will increase the number of people under the threat of flooding from the current 46 million to 92 million annually.
Climate changes will also increase the risk of heart disease, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the subtropical and tropical areas, according to experts.
An international climate conference scheduled for next month in Kyoto, Japan, will focus on greenhouse gas emissions.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Like an omen from the Book of Revelation, a wispy, silvery-blue noctilucent cloud hovered over Colorado late last month.
The timing couldn't have been more appropriate.
The cloud _ a harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
Researchers are increasingly convinced that carbon dioxide gas from the burning of fossil fuels is at least partly responsible for the marked warming of recent years.
And the warming is accelerating.
``Almost every climate model says the same thing,'' said ocean chemist Peter G.
Brewer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Monterey.
``In the next decade, we might see the same amount of warming that we saw over the last century''.
In the diverse world of global warming research, the latest projections suggest that: _ Coastal residents can look for rainier weather, and sea levels could rise one to three feet around North America.
Heavier rain and higher seas would increase coastal damage during storms.
_ The Pacific ecosystem, especially fish that benefit much of the West Coast economy, could be threatened.
``There's lots of data showing there are big changes in marine ecosystems from the tropics to the poles,'' said biological oceanographer James P.
Barry of the Monterey Bay Institute.
For example, ``if you look at the record from 1992 to now, there's just been a precipitous decline in salmon stocks _ they're smaller and have less fat''.
&QL; _ An ominous absence of icebergs in the Grand Banks shipping lanes off Newfoundland might be an early warning sign of global warming, Science magazine reported July 2.
_ New York City will suffer repeated flooding in the next century as global warming raises the sea level, soaking subways and turning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, said a report issued jointly on June 29 by the Environmental Defense Fund and Columbia University.
Global warming might seem like an unreal issue to residents of Northern California: They are shivering through one of the chillier summers in long memory.
Still, such short-term coolings can't obscure the long-term signal that it is getting warmer all over the Earth.
New projections of global warming indicate it might be even slightly worse than originally foreseen.
Previously, scientists expected an average planetary temperature rise of 1.4 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years.
Now they're looking at a rise of 2.3 to 7.2 degrees, said Tom Wigley, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
That 1-degree difference in projections might seem slight, but it equals the increase in average global temperature over the last century, Wigley said.
One reason for the worsened climate projections is the increased success in controlling another pollutant: sulfur dioxide.
While carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide cools it.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming.
Now that hope is fading as nations establish tighter controls on sulfur dioxide emissions, Wigley said.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
In the next century, the rates of rise in temperature and sea level might occur up to seven times as fast as in the 20th century, the Pew study adds.
Computer models have indicated that global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
In 1994, professor Gary Thomas of the University of Colorado at Boulder forecast that as the upper air cooled, beautiful noctilucent clouds _ common in polar latitudes _ would appear at southerly latitudes.
The clouds are wispy and silvery-blue, composed of very small ice crystals.
They resemble cirrus clouds, but are far higher, some 50 miles up.
&QL; On June 22, 50 miles in the sky over Boulder, a silver-bluish noctilucent cloud drifted overhead.
It is the farthest south such a cloud has been recorded, Thomas said.
The southerly drift of noctilucent clouds may be the miner's canary of global warming, a signal of bad times ahead.
``What we're seeing are some dramatic effects that are far greater than what the models are predicting'' he said.
Yet the national response to global warming remains sluggish and divided, in part because of fears that tough pollution-control measures could hurt a vibrant economy.
``We are astonished that some members of Congress continue to ignore warnings from the scientific community,'' said Walt Oechel, a biology professor and director of the Global Climate Change Research Group at San Diego State University.
``Climate scientists from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is real and could greatly disrupt society.''
LONDON (AP) --Global warming could fundamentally transform a third of the world's plant and animal habitats by the end of this century, threatening many species with rapid extinction, an international conservation organization warned Wednesday.
In a new report, researchers for the World Wide Fund for Nature --known as the World Wildlife Fund in the United States and Canada -- singled out the Arctic and northern latitudes as the most vulnerable to the changing climate.
They estimated 20 percent of the species there could die out due to shrinking habitat.
The report raises the specter of a tundra denuded of its walrus and polar bear populations and a New England stripped of its spruce and fir forests if the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Many scientists believe that high concentrations of CO2 and other so-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns.
''As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat,'' said the report's co-author, Adam Markham, executive director of the U.S.-based group Clean Air-Cool Planet.
''Some will just not be able to move fast enough,'' Markham said.
The northern latitudes of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where climate change is expected to occur fastest, could lose 70 percent of their habitat --a level that rises to 82 percent for Iceland.
In several countries --including Russia, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia -- and in seven Canadian provinces and territories, more than half the existing habitat is at risk, the report said.
More than a third of habitat is in danger in the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it said.
The projected habitat changes and species extinctions would not be limited to northern latitudes, however.
Coastal and island areas would be at risk from warming oceans and rising waters, the report said.
The exact nature and rate of global climate change remains contentious.
According to a study published in the July issue of the Dutch journal Climate Change, Arctic temperatures in the late 20th century were the warmest in four centuries.
But, critics of the global warming theory argue there's little evidence that forces other than natural temperature swings are at work.
They have also argued that while ground monitors have shown a sharp increase in Earth's temperatures, satellite and weather balloon observations have shown little or no warming --a discrepancy that has still not been fully explained.
Researchers evaluated data from 100 separate studies of environmental factors in North America, Europe and Asia, including air temperature measurements, air circulation, precipitation, sea ice, glaciers and plant growth.
They said parts of Alaska and Eurasia had warmed ''alarmingly'' --by as much as 11 degrees -- during winter months during the last 30 years.
''This compilation of research results make it undeniable that a major warming is affecting the Arctic environment,'' said Michael T.
Ledbetter of the National Science Foundation in Washington, which funded the study, co-authored by 11 climatologists from five universities in the United States.
Wednesday's report --written by Markham and University of Toronto professor Jay Malcolm -- used computer models to simulate global climate and vegetation change under a variety of conditions.
Its projections are based on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubling from pre-industrial levels by the year 2100.
And even that estimate is optimistic, the report said.
Current concentrations of carbon dioxide --the gas primarily responsible for global warming -- are about 30 percent higher than pre-industrial levels, and could hit double the pre-industrial level by 2050, the researchers said.
The loss of habitat would place many plant and animal species in a race for their lives, and scientists do not yet know whether they would be able to migrate fast enough to outrun the change.
The report estimates that some species of vegetation would have to migrate 10 times faster than during the last glacial retreat, about 10,000 years ago.
''A considerable portion of the globe could eventually become devoid of tree cover,'' the report noted.
The report said the most vulnerable species are those who live in isolated or fragmented habitats, including the Gelada baboon of Ethiopia; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the monarch butterfly, which spends its winters in Mexico; and the spoon-billed sandpiper of Siberia.
The report is designed to pressure politicians ahead of November's international climate-change summit in the Dutch city of The Hague, at which politicians will attempt to ratify the 1997 Kyoto agreement limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
''Many countries are trying to find loopholes in the Kyoto agreement,'' said Andrew Kerr of the WWF's Climate Change campaign.
''They should know that the problem is much more of an immediate threat than they realized''.
