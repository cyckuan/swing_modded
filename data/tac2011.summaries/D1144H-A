About 80 percent of the toys bought in the United States and about 65 percent of Mattel's toys are made in China.
Toy-maker Fisher-Price is recalling 83 types of toys -- including the popular Big Bird, Elmo, Dora and Diego characters -- because their paint contains excessive amounts of lead.
News that about 1.5 million wooden Thomas &amp; Friends children's toys were being recalled because they were made with lead paint raised some parents' anxiety levels.
The recall involves 967,000 plastic preschool toys made by a Chinese vendor and sold in the United States between May and August.
