China has reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area.
Soil conservation efforts have helped increase grain production by 18 billion kilograms a year and improved livelihoods for more than 13 million residents in areas affected by soil erosion.
China's hillside farm areas lose 1.5 billion tons of soil annually, about a third of the nation's total soil loss each year, said Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping

Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as excessive herding and farming have outpaced the government's conservation efforts.
