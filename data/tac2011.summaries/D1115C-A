A crane-carrying vessel slammed into a Hong Kong-registered oil tanker in seas off South Korea's west coast  causing the tanker to leak about 66,000 barrels of crude oil.
A tanker spilled more than 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea after being holed by a barge in what officials said was South Korea's worst oil spill.
The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying about 15,000 tons of oil, was berthed five miles off Mallipo, 90 kilometres (54 miles) southwest of Seoul, when it was pierced in three places.
The spill was believed to be South Korea's largest.
