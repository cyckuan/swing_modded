Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast.
Saturday's hijacking of the MV Sirius Star tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal.
The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
It was the largest ship pirates have seized, and the farthest out to sea they have successfully struck.
more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya.
