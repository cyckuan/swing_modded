The Army's surgeon general criticized stories in The Washington Post disclosing problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, saying the series unfairly characterized the living conditions and care for soldiers recuperating from wounds at the hospital's facilities.
A top Army general vowed to personally oversee the upgrading of Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Building 18, a dilapidated former hotel that houses wounded soldiers as outpatients.
``I'm not sure it was an accurate representation," Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley, chief of the Army Medical Command which oversees Walter Reed and all Army health care, told reporters during a news conference.
