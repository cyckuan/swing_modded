A gas well near Surabaya in East Java operated by PT Lapindo Brantas has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages, factories and fields.
An Indonesian minister claimed that a vast "mud volcano" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family.
Yudhoyono has ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420 million dollars) in compensation and costs.
Officials said the concrete balls would be lowered by crane into the main source of the mud spill near Surabaya, in East Java.
