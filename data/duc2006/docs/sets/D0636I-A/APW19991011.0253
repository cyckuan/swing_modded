<HEADLINE> UAW Wraps Up Three Auto Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With quick and peaceful negotiations, the United  
Auto Workers wrapped up three new contracts with American 
automakers that promise some 360,000 workers more money and 
security for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and  
DaimlerChrysler AG -- were rewarded, too, apparently winning won the 
freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers. 
</P>
<P>
	And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short  
what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who currently work for the automakers are all  
winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State 
University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if  
they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said. ``They probably 
assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker 
view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because 
the economy is doing so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract  
with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and 
improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker  
will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal. 
Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement 
reached Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a  
year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000. The 
figure for GM is not available. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts with DaimlerChrysler, GM and GM's former parts  
unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling 
off or closing factories or parts of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the  
automakers, which totaled about $22 billion in 1998. Analyst Scott 
Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. in New York said 
the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 
percent a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	But automakers might win that increase back and even save some  
costs by cutting jobs through retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve  
profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies. 
With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, 
automakers rely on retirement to shed workers. The average UAW 
autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of 
experience; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be 
eligible for retirement in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies  
to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many 
replacements must be hired to offset retirements. When retirements 
are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to 
replace one out of every three retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose 24 percent of  
its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would 
have to replace every additional retiree. 
</P>
<P>
	And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring  
instead to fill their needs with overtime. Last year, GM added 500 
hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average GM 
worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's  
highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,'' Merlis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off  
its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a 
separate company. Visteon's current workers would remain Ford 
employees, while future hires would be covered by a Visteon 
contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials had opposed a spin-off or sale of Visteon, fearing  
it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains there will likely be a spin-off, and this  
could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW 
relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be 
sustained,'' Merlis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler deal has been approved by workers, while GM  
workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week. Ford 
local union officials will hear details of their contract 
Wednesday.
