   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ In one of General Motors' sprawling auto
parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio
Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour
producing instrument panels and steering wheels for GM cars and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Until just a few years ago, U.S. workers earning close to $22 an
hour at GM's Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich., made the
instrument panels. And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw
produced the steering wheels.
</P>
<P>
   GM's shift of production from Flint and Saginaw to this border
city facing Brownsville, Texas, was part of a sweeping 20-year
transfer of its U.S. auto parts industry across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, GM has built more than 50 parts factories in Mexico,
which today employ 72,000 workers, making its parts subsidiary,
Delphi Automotive Services, Mexico's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies from the United States have, of course, also
moved plants to Mexico. Ford Motor Co. has 11 parts factories in
Mexico; Chrysler has none.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has
become a focus of the United Automobile Workers strike against GM,
which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East
factory. UAW officials in the United States have accused General
Motors of ``putting America last.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two
dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the
union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants and return its
parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte
Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros
factories. The plants have been partially idled by the strike in
Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our workers understand that they're doing work that
used to be done in United States factories because managers explain
that to them on the plant floor,'' Villafuerte said. ``And let me
tell you, the jobs are very welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   GM says that transferring production south has enabled it to cut
costs in labor-intensive assembly production, compete more
effectively against Ford, Chrysler and Japanese automakers, and
also to keep engineering and other operations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The financial advantages of producing parts in Mexico are
substantial, and some economists say that the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January 1994, has only
increased them.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants have no union, and those that do are represented by
the Confederation of Mexican Workers, which is controlled by
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and works with
the government to avoid strikes. The union has kept the UAW at
arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Mexican workers at GM and other U.S.-owned
factories live in dirt-floor shacks in slums ringing the industrial
parks where they work. Yet many say that they are delighted to have
their jobs, which often start at Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 a
day but can pay experienced workers several times that. A Delphi
spokesman said the company would in the next 18 months help 7,000
employees buy their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good job,'' said a 23-year-old woman who earns $1.36 an
hour painting buttons on car radios at Deltronicos de Matamoros, a
Delphi plant. The woman, who asked that her name not be used during
an interview at her one-room wood-frame shed in a gritty,
wind-blown Matamoros squatters' settlement, said the choking smell
of solvents at her work station gave her headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult work,'' she said. ``But I'm glad to have it.''

   GM opened its first factory in Mexico in 1935, assembling trucks
in the capital from parts imported from the United States. After a
1962 Mexican law required foreign automakers to increase the local
content of their vehicles, GM built three engine and vehicle plants
in the 1960s and '70s. The new plants, like similar factories built
by Ford and Chrysler, assembled vehicles for the Mexican market. In
the decades since, GM has continued to assemble vehicles in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1970s, in response to an earlier law encouraging
foreign manufacturers to produce goods here for export tax-free, GM
changed strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM began to see Mexico as a supplier for its U.S. vehicle
assembly plants, and in the 1980s built an entire parts industry
here,'' said Arnulfo Arteaga, a Mexico City professor who studies
the auto industry. ``Now, Delphi's Mexican plants basically turn
out parts once produced in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   GM erected its first Mexican parts plant, to assemble wiring
systems, in the large border city of Juarez in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is now Delphi Automotive had run into unprecedented
competition,'' said Michael Hissam, a spokesman at Delphi's Mexico
headquarters in Juarez. ``We embarked on a plan to reduce costs by
focusing final assembly in Mexico while keeping our more
capital-intensive engineering, tooling and prototyping activities
in the U.S. Did we come to Mexico for lower labor costs? Yes. But
we also found something else _ excellent Mexican management and a
dedicated Mexican work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch,
said General Motors had no choice but to seek lower-cost labor for
parts production. GM is not doing anything that their competitors
and that independent auto suppliers aren't doing,'' Lobaccaro said,
adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous pressure on parts pricing. To compete
in the global economy, you need labor to be paid commensurate with
value added. And you can't pay $46 an hour do wire harnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other GM parts plants would be built across northern
Mexico in the years that followed. In Matamoros, four Delphi plants
were built in an industrial park near the intersection of Ohio
Street and Michigan Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   One Delphi plant, Componentes Mecanicos, opened in 1980. About
10 years later, Delphi began shifting production of instrument
panels to the factory from Delphi East in Flint, said Larry
Mathews, a spokesman for Flint's UAW Local 651, which is currently
on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just crated the equipment, hoisted it onto a
tractor-trailer, and sent it away to Mexico,'' Mathews said.
``There's hardly anybody at this plant who hasn't seen machinery
moving out in a crate with an address on it that says Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Mathews added, the Delphi East plant had 13,000
workers; today, it has fewer than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   A 37-year-old worker at Componentes Mecanicos who asked that his
name be withheld, said in an interview outside his two-room
Matamoros home that if he qualifies for a weekly attendance bonus,
he earns about $1.90 an hour. Newly hired workers receive $1.05 an
hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife also works at a GM assembly plant in Matamoros, and by
pooling salaries, the couple has managed to rise slightly above
subsistence. They own a battered Ford pickup truck, and although
their home has no indoor plumbing, they have equipped it with a
television set and an electric fan. He coaches his three sons in a
soccer league.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Componentes Mecanicos is the Deltronicos plant,
built in 1979. In the mid-1980s, GM shifted much of its car radio
production from its Delco plant in Kokomo, Ind., to Deltronicos,
UAW officials said. The work force at Kokomo has dropped to 4,800
from 11,000 in 1977, the union said. The Deltronicos plant employs
5,400 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Deltronicos is a Matamoros plant owned by
Trico Products Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y., a unit of Tomkins PLC, which
supplies windshield wipers to GM as well as Ford and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of much of Trico's production to Mexico since 1987,
which came despite entreaties from Buffalo city officials, has
reduced Trico's Buffalo work force to 200 from 2,400, UAW officials
said. &QL;
