<HEADLINE> Automakers, UAW Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- National labor talks between Detroit's automakers  
and the United Auto Workers begin this week in the midst of 
record-breaking sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford 
Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial negotiations kick off today with ceremonial  
handshakes over the main bargaining table at Ford headquarters. 
Similar ceremonies are set for Tuesday at DaimlerChrysler and 
Wednesday at GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons  
learned from last year's devastating UAW strikes against GM 
decrease the chance for a walkout after this year's contracts 
expire Sept. 14, some industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got tough issues, but nobody wants to put the  
moneymaking on hold to sort it out,'' said labor professor Harley 
Shaiken at the University of California-Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's talks will cover about 407,000 UAW members at  
assembly and parts plants nationwide, down 15,000 from 1996. More 
than half work for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the  
assignment of work to outside suppliers are among the top issues in 
this year's talks, as they were during the last round in 1996. But 
since then, the industry has been through a tumultuous series of 
reorganizations, cost-cutting programs, acquisitions and mergers. 
Each of Detroit's automakers is financially stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to note that for all the changes this is a very  
healthy industry, one that has enjoyed record profits and sales on 
a sustained basis,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said. ``It's a good 
environment for negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though times are good, Detroit executives note that they remain  
under extreme pressure to keep costs down, invest heavily in new 
models and technology, and simplify the way they build and sell 
vehicles. With production capacity worldwide far exceeding demand, 
automakers can no longer simply pass on higher labor costs to 
consumers, as they did for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of their Asian and European competitors, meanwhile, compete  
directly on American soil with a growing number of modern, 
efficient, nonunion plants -- a sore point for Detroit and the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, the union is faced with the same problems  
that have challenged its leaders for the past 20 years: How do they 
slow the steady decline of high-paying assembly jobs as the 
industry becomes more efficient and needs fewer workers? And as 
suppliers take on a larger role in the design and assembly of cars 
and trucks, how can the union expand its influence? 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW only recently has begun to reverse its membership slide,  
largely by signing up more workers in non-automotive industries. 
More than half of its active membership is still employed by the 
Detroit automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last round of auto talks, the union won a conditional  
guarantee that at least 95 percent of UAW jobs at each plant would 
be maintained during the life of the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of focus this year will be on GM, which abandoned its  
combative stance toward the UAW after last year's strikes cost it 
about $2 billion and some of its U.S. market share. But GM has 
managed to continue offending UAW leaders as it seeks ways to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, GM had been publicly promoting ambitious plans  
to assemble small cars using ``modular'' assembly techniques. GM 
says it needs to make the change because its current small cars 
built in North America don't make money. 
</P>
<P>
	In GM's modular plants, most of the subassembly work would be  
done by lower-cost suppliers who would deliver preassembled parts 
clusters, such as an entire dashboard or interior module, to the 
assembly plant. Far fewer UAW workers would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has declared modular assembly a  
dead issue, but to some extent all three automakers have already 
adopted or are planning to use more modular techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and the union also will have to resolve the future of the  
42,640 UAW members at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the big 
parts unit the automaker divested last month. The union is 
expecting that those workers will remain under the next GM 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of parts workers will be an issue at Ford, too, which  
is preparing plans to spin off its Visteon parts unit. At Ford and 
GM, management is likely to seek a lower wage for new hires at the 
parts concerns so they can more effectively compete against 
nonunion suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	At DaimlerChrysler, the company that resulted from last year's  
acquisition of Chrysler Corp. by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, the UAW 
is seeking stronger assurances that the automaker won't hinder its 
attempt to organize the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama and three 
Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Though DaimlerChrysler's official position is that it's neutral  
in the organizing drives, executives realize it's a sensitive issue 
that could cause problems in this year's talks. And there is likely 
to be some concern among UAW negotiators about who's calling the 
shots at the Chrysler unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daimler is a company used to dealing with a union and  
negotiation, but it's not going to be the same as Chrysler,'' said 
John Revitte, a labor professor at Michigan State University. ``The 
fact that it's now a German company is going to change things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW, meanwhile, has sent signals that it will consider a  
longer-term contract, most likely a four-year deal. That would make 
the next contract expire in 2003, a year after the union's 
leadership is scheduled to change.
