<HEADLINE> UAW, GM Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers reached tentative  
agreements with General Motors Corp. and its former parts division 
Tuesday on contacts covering about 185,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the union's deals with GM and Delphi Automotive  
Systems Corp. were not released. The UAW said the terms would not 
be announced until after ratification votes. No date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal follows a lucrative four-year contract the UAW  
negotiated with DaimlerChrysler AG. And it leaves Ford Motor Co. as 
the only automaker still to finish a contract with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler deal was a four-year pact with 3 percent  
raises each year, a $1,350 signing bonus and improvements in 
pensions. The UAW traditionally negotiates the same basic terms for 
all contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been working on improving relations with the UAW after  
last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories. The 
strike virtually shut down the automaker's North American 
production, costing GM about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk 
of market share it has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes were largely over plant work rules and the loss of  
work to outside suppliers, issues certain to be back on the table 
in these talks. GM has said it needs to be more flexible and 
efficient to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also has spun off its Delphi parts unit into a separate  
company with 42,000 UAW employees. GM said Delphi could be more 
profitable and compete better if it went after business from other 
automakers -- something it couldn't do as a division of GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal came after two days of intensive talks involving UAW  
President Stephen P. Yokich and GM Chairman Jack Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW represents about 143,000 workers at GM, about 80,000  
fewer than it did in 1990. The job losses have come from GM closing 
factories, using fewer workers on assembly lines, relying on 
suppliers for more work and not replacing workers as fast as they 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Consequently, the UAW has made protecting jobs a major goal. The  
DaimlerChrysler contract includes clauses aimed at keeping job 
levels near current totals. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also proposed a ban on outsourcing and the right to  
strike over sourcing issues -- including sending new work to a 
supplier that a GM factory could do. And it asked for an ``America 
First'' pledge, saying GM should invest in plants in the United 
States rather than expand in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW also wanted Delphi workers covered under the GM national  
contract for the foreseeable future. Other demands included adding 
compensatory time off to overtime pay and giving the UAW a seat on 
GM's Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to wage improvements, the DaimlerChrysler contract  
also improves pensions -- an important goal for the UAW's older 
workforce. The average GM worker is 48 years old, and some 32,000 
workers have 30 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks at Ford were continuing at a lower level this week. The  
UAW has said it was very concerned that Ford wanted to spin off its 
Visteon parts unit as GM did with Delphi.
