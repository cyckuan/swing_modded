LABOR TENSION RISES AT FORD, EASES AT GENERAL MOTORS  
 (HLW)

   DETROIT _ After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Co. is
facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor
relations at the General Motors Corp. are finally starting to
improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials
and auto executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it
less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers
union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a
pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry,
they said. The UAW conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and
1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that
helped it and hurt GM and the Chrysler Corp., which has since
become part of DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Ford wants to sell or spin off its auto parts division and has
been reluctant to commit itself recently to building more vehicles
and engines at less efficient factories. Both moves have alarmed
local union officials, who have put pressure on the UAW's national
leadership to take a tough stance.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been negotiating lately to merge the auto parts unit
with the Lear Corp. as part of a complicated stock deal. Those
talks are now focused on finding a way to make sure that the
transaction is tax free, but no deal is likely until after the
expiration on Sept. 14 of the UAW's contracts with Ford, GM and
DaimlerChrysler, people close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears possible, although still not certain, that the
UAW will negotiate first this year with DaimlerChrysler, leaving
for later in the autumn the difficult issues at Ford and the
complicated but less contentious issues at GM. The union has taken
a renewed interest in the talks at DaimlerChrysler despite the
death earlier this month of Jack Laskowski, the union's vice
president for DaimlerChrysler issues.
</P>
<P>
   The talks at GM, while complicated and hard to resolve quickly,
have been going well. ``They seem to want to work with us,'' much
more so than in the past, said a UAW negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, said in an interview that he wanted to hold talks first with
Ford this autumn. This would make it unlikely that the UAW would
also negotiate first with Ford. The American and Canadian unions
have a history of not negotiating with the same auto maker at the
same time because the American union is so much bigger that the
Canadian union might then receive short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said that if the UAW chose Ford, he would most likely
choose another auto maker. But Hargrove works closely with the UAW,
and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford
so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the
UAW will not select Ford, although he added that he did not know
what the UAW would do.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union also tends to hold short strikes every three
years before reaching contracts, often against the first company
with which negotiations are held. That is mainly because Canadian
labor laws effectively prevent local units of unions from staging
walkouts in the middle of a contract. But the result may be to ruin
Ford's remarkable string of strike-free years.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McAlinden, the manager of automotive economic studies at
the University of Michigan and an adviser to the auto makers and
the UAW, said that the Canadian laws made it likely that Hargrove
would call a strike at Ford. ``It forces him to do some sort of
walkout every three years to show he has some teeth,'' McAlinden
said.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's contracts do allow such strikes for health and safety
reasons. UAW local units in Flint, Mich., cited such reasons a year
ago in a strike against GM that crippled the company's North
American operations for nearly two months and measurably slowed the
American economy during the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada and in the United States, the unions are demanding
substantial wage and pension increases in addition to continuing
the job security provisions that have been a staple of national
contracts over the last two decades. The auto makers are enjoying
record sales and have accumulated huge cash reserves _ $24 billion
in the case of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are doing very, very well,'' Hargrove said.
``The companies are making a lot of money and the workers are
entitled to share it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher wages would put Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler at a
disadvantage in competing with imports from countries like Korea
and Germany. But Japanese auto makers now assemble the majority of
their vehicles in the United States and tend to match wage
increases in Detroit so as to forestall unionization of their
American factories.
