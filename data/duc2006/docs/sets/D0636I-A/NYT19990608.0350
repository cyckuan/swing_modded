BIG 3 AUTOMAKERS AND UAW MAY SEEK NATIONAL CONTRACT OF 4 OR MORE
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>

   DETROIT _ With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler
scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile
Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek
a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest
such deal since the 1950s, auto executives and union officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against GM in Flint,
Mich., and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay
produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager
to avoid another showdown this year. Serious differences could
still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are
now using the tamest rhetoric in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades of declining inflation rates have tempered
union fears that workers' pay would be ravaged by rising prices
during a long contract. For their part, the automakers would
welcome the ability to predict long-term costs. The current
contract expires Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   By departing from the traditional three-year contract, the UAW
would also be able to avoid having the next round of auto labor
talks in the summer of 2002, when the union could be locked in a
power struggle. Longtime UAW president Stephen Yokich must retire
when his current four-year term ends in June 2002 because he will
become 65 next year. The union's rules require that candidates for
the presidency, an elected position, be younger than 65, and Yokich
has no heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A longer contract would not assure labor peace in the auto
industry, however. Unlike most unions, the UAW won from the
automakers long ago the right to hold factory-level strikes for
health and safety reasons at any time, even while a contract is in
force. Last year's strike in Flint involved such a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Key issues in talks to replace the current contract are certain
to include job security, particularly for workers at auto parts
subsidiaries that are being spun off, as well as modest changes to
the automakers' health care plans and other employee benefits,
executives and union officials said in interviews and public
appearances in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has traditionally negotiated a contract with one auto
company first, and then demanded that the other two sign virtually
identical pacts. The company that negotiates the first pact has an
advantage, in that it can tailor an agreement to its own needs
while driving up its rivals' costs. Ford and GM seem to have a
better chance of being chosen by the union to negotiate the first
agreement than does DaimlerChrysler, but no decision has been made
yet, a person close to the union said.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives in particular have softened their criticisms of
the union and called for reconciliation, in the hope of avoiding
another strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working hard with all our unions to nurture a more open
relationship,'' said GM chairman and chief executive John Smith at
the company's annual meeting Monday in Wilmington, Del. ``We want
to build on common strengths, improve our cost competitiveness and
work through our differences without costly work stoppages.''
</P>
<P>
   But GM has in the past shown a peculiar knack for offending the
UAW, sometimes unintentionally. The automaker announced Tuesday,
six days before the contract negotiations formally open next
Monday, that it would spend $1.8 billion to buy a commercial
lending business from the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although union leaders had no immediate reaction today, they
have criticized diversification moves by the automaker, calling on
the companies to invest more money in new equipment and factories
instead.
</P>
<P>
   All three automakers' current, three-year national contracts
with the UAW expire at midnight on Sept. 14. Since the Eisenhower
administration, national auto labor contracts have lasted for three
years, and the triennial negotiations have been closely followed as
a barometer of wage pressures in the U.S. economy. While the
automakers are no longer the nation's largest private employers _
Wal-Mart overtook GM two years ago _ the wages and benefits set in
their contracts still strongly influence the rest of the
manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of the
nation's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation and obscure accounting rules discouraged the union and
the companies alike from pursuing longer agreements. Inflation
caused by the Korean War ravaged the earnings power of auto workers
during a five-year pact in the 1950s and prompted union leaders
then to vow that future deals would not exceed three years, a
decision followed until now.
</P>
<P>
   Recent contracts have only partly protected workers against
inflation, guaranteeing that, in addition to wage increases,
workers will receive an extra 1 percent raise for every 2.6
percentage points of inflation. But the decline in the inflation
rate has reduced union worries on this score.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules also require the companies to charge certain
pension concessions against their profits in the first year of an
agreement, and the cost of these concessions rises with longer
agreements. But with all three automakers posting record or
near-record profits, they are in unusually strong financial
condition to take such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich mentioned the possibility of a longer contract at a news
conference in May. ``With all the money they've got, they might be
able to put enough money on that table that we have to take a
4-year or 5-year or 6-year or 10-year'' contract, he said, speaking
of the automakers.
</P>
<P>
   While auto executives dismiss the idea of a 10-year contract,
which would limit their options through at least two generations of
new cars, they have been receptive to the possibility of a four- to
six-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been quarreling with DaimlerChrysler over how much
help the automaker should give the union in organizing a Mercedes
factory in Alabama and a DaimlerChrysler heavy truck factory in
North Carolina. With union leaders also nervous about a showdown
with German executives they barely know, the union is expected to
negotiate the first contract with GM or, perhaps more likely, Ford.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford goes first, it would probably try to work out the terms
of an eventual spinoff of Visteon Automotive Systems, its auto
parts unit. Such a settlement could have major implications for GM
In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM
contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire
within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits
from the automaker, not the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In May, GM spun off its 200,000-employee auto parts unit, Delphi
Automotive Systems. A big question now is whether Ford will agree
to accept huge numbers of workers back from Visteon if it is ever
spun off. While Ford could use those workers in its expanding sport
utility vehicle factories, GM has too many workers already and does
not need more from Delphi. But if Ford signs a pattern-setting
contract first, the UAW may force GM to accept the same terms or
face another costly strike. &QL;
