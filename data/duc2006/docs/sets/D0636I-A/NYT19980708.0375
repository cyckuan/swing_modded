   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators worked steadily Wednesday to resolve
a monthlong strike at General Motors auto parts factories here, but
more signs emerged that any deal would address local disputes and
might not produce big improvements in GM's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. has used the strike as an occasion to warn
that it may close car factories and eliminate car models while
focusing more on high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks _ a shift in direction that Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have already made and that Wall Street analysts would like to
see GM duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American
car operations, said in a message to employees this week that GM
was working on a ``detailed rationalization plan'' for its
factories and models.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the
UAW, told several reporters Wednesday that little attention had
been given to any such move. ``We haven't had really focused
discussions on that whole subject,'' he said Wednesday afternoon
during a lull in top-level negotiations at a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker strongly hinted that factory closings could lead to
more strikes. ``If as a result of this strike they decide to close
facilities, that obviously would not improve the relationship and
it would go a long way to continuing confrontations,'' he said.

<P>
   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations,
arrived in Flinton Wednesday afternoon for further discussions with
Shoemaker but declined to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   GM's problem is that as the strike has dragged on, expectations
have risen on Wall Street that a settlement will break the pattern
of inconclusive deals in a dozen other local strikes over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had better come up with something this time that is more
than `we invest $50 million and agree to give them 100 jobs,''' the
typical settlement in other local strikes, said Maryann Keller, an
analyst at Furman Selz in New York. ``If it's something along those
lines, it won't be enough'' to satisfy institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker also warned GM on Wednesday not to sell Delphi
Automotive Systems, the automaker's parts division. GM and the UAW
reached an understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up
to 20 percent of the division, possibly through an initial public
offering, he said, but a sale of the entire division would not be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably set the stage for a hell of a battle,''
Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   GM estimates that the strikes here have already cost it $1.18
billion through June 30, with further losses likely in the coming
days. The strikes at two parts factories have forced GM to close 26
of its 29 North American assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   GM and UAW bargainers have been conducting long meetings for the
last week, with each day's sessions lasting a little later into the
evening as both sides struggle to reach a deal by Thursday or
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A deal by that point would allow time for the 9,200 striking
workers to vote on ratification over the weekend and reopen the
struck auto parts factories Monday, the day when GM workers would
normally return from the company's regularly scheduled two-week
summer shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the parts factories do reopen then, it could take
another two weeks for enough parts to be produced to allow the
reopening of the 26 GM assembly plants.
