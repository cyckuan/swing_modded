<HEADLINE> UAW Deals Put Pressure on Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers  
appear to have patched up their relationship with a lucrative 
four-year contract -- but at steep price for GM, industry experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal puts even more pressure on Ford Motor Co., the last of  
the major automakers still negotiating with the UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreements reached Tuesday between the UAW, GM and  
its former parts division Delphi Automotive Systems provide 185,000 
workers with 3 percent pay raises each year for four years and a 
signing bonus of $1,350, a source close to the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG had a similar contract approved for 75,000  
workers last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower-level talks with Ford have gone on while the UAW worked on  
contracts with GM and DaimlerChrysler. The UAW typically expects 
all three automakers to accept the same terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Ford, basically the writing's on the wall that they're  
going to take the same deal,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said with record sales and profits at all three  
automakers, both sides were eager to avoid a strike. That gave the 
union an opportunity to craft better deals while putting some 
pressure on the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	For GM, ``the deal is expensive,'' Girsky said. ``The UAW got a  
great deal from Chrysler and the number of things GM could do were 
limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has not announced a date for a ratification vote, and  
said it would not release any details of the agreements until then. 
The companies also declined to release any details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi contract allows workers to transfer back to GM when  
openings occur, a union source said, and gives them until Jan. 1 to 
retire with GM pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press said GM also agreed to a provision in the  
DaimlerChrysler contract governing how quickly it must replace 
workers who retire. Under that clause, the companies could replace 
one of every two or three workers who retire as long as employment 
stayed above certain levels. 
</P>
<P>
	While the union and Ford have enjoyed warm relations over the  
past several years, there appear to be strains over its Visteon 
parts unit. The union opposes a spinoff of Visteon, which has about 
28,500 UAW members, saying it could lead to pay cuts, plant 
closures and fewer union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Labor Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried  
signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within.'' And the 
DaimlerChrysler contract contains a promise from the company not to 
close, sell or spin-off any factory or business unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts said it was unlikely the UAW could stop a  
Visteon spin-off, but the union could help shape the deal by 
requiring pension and job protections like those at Delphi. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they stop Ford when everyone else has already spun off  
parts divisions, they could seem hypocritical,'' said Dale 
Brickner, an emeritus professor at Michigan State University's 
School of Labor and Industrial Relations. ``They have the political 
problem of people (working) in Ford being very upset. It may be a 
trade of dollars for principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been working to mend fences with the UAW after last  
summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories. The strike 
virtually shut down the automaker's North American production, 
costing GM about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk of market 
share it has yet to recover.
