<HEADLINE> Delphi Progressing Before Spinoff </HEADLINE>

	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the  
auto-parts manufacturer soon to be independent from General Motors 
Corp., has no more money-losing plants, is getting cooperation from 
its unions to cut costs and is winning more non-GM business, its 
chairman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the world's largest parts-maker, Delphi also plans to be a  
major player in the industry's consolidation through an aggressive 
acquisition drive, J.T. Battenberg III told reporters before 
departing on a worldwide roadshow to raise his company's profile 
among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi was once a disparate collection of parts operations that,  
with parent GM, was near bankruptcy in the early 1990s. Though it 
lost $93 million last year because of several one-time costs, 
Delphi earned $284 million in the first quarter this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is cutting Delphi loose to focus on its core business:  
building cars and trucks. Delphi executives say they expect their 
business to grow as other automakers no longer have to fear working 
with a supplier owned by their biggest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's evidence that's already happening, even though the  
spinoff won't be completed until May 28. In the first quarter, 
Delphi won $4 billion in new contracts with GM and a surprising $2 
billion worth of non-GM contracts. Delphi stock price increased 18 
percent in its first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock has performed well,'' said analyst Jonathan Lawrence  
of Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``They're certainly winning business, and 
that's picked up since their announcement of the spinoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., and Battenberg will face their  
first big test come summer when they will work out details of a new 
contract with the company's largest union, the United Auto Workers. 
Talks already are under way with some UAW locals and Battenberg 
said there has been progress. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM's  
North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $450 million. Both 
companies are trying to repair their long-contentious relationship 
with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Battenberg declined to comment in detail on that relationship  
but said he was in ``personal touch'' with UAW leaders. Though 
company insiders say UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has been 
cooperative, publicly he has criticized the spinoff and urged GM to 
retain 51 percent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi-UAW talks will coincide with the union's triennial  
contract negotiations with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit 
of DaimlerChrysler AG. The UAW is expected to demand that Delphi's 
hourly workers get virtually the same deal as GM's hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi no longer has any plants that are unprofitable, in some  
cases because its unions agreed to relax restrictive work rules, 
Battenberg said. In Kokomo, Ind., for example, the UAW agreed to 
work rule changes to allow the electronics plant to operate 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Battenberg said Delphi plans to focus on acquiring companies  
that can supply future technology, especially in the area of 
high-tech electronics as computers and satellite telecommunications 
become more integrated into the design of car and truck interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at Delphi becoming an electronics company that makes  
products for vehicles, which is a lot more attractive than a 
traditional auto-parts company,'' Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Delphi has been trimming its work force through  
attrition, the company may end up adding workers if it meets its 
goals to increase new business, Battenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this month, Delphi will debut a $1 million TV-and-print  
advertising campaign to coincide with the Indianapolis 500 auto 
race. The campaign and 20-city roadshow are intended to make Delphi 
a brand known outside the auto industry.
