   DETROIT _ Nearly 6,000 workers went on strike on Thursday
evening at a General Motors spark plug and speedometer factory in
Flint, Mich., joining fellow strikers at a nearby GM plant in an
increasingly bitter fight that could close all of the leading
automaker's North American assembly plants within days.
</P>
<P>
   GM had already closed seven of those assembly plants and
temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts from the
initial strike last Friday at a metal-stamping plant in Flint. Most
of GM's other 22 assembly plants in the United States, Canada and
Mexico are now expected to quickly run out of the spark plugs,
speedometers and other parts made by the giant factory where
workers walked out on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Angry over what they called unmet demands for job security and
improved health and safety conditions, hundreds of workers chanting
``UAW!'' and toting red placards identifying their local union unit
mobbed the spark plug factory's gates on Thursday evening. They
were joined by workers from the metal-stamping factory, who struck
over the same issues.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the picketers were UAW members from across
Michigan and even Ohio and Illinois who had come to show their
anger at GM, which has contended with steadily worsening labor
relations in trying to make its factories run as efficiently as
those of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   GM said in a terse statement that it was disappointed by the
broadening of the strike to a second parts factory. ``We have
committed, talented people and we encourage the union to join
management leadership at both facilities to urgently reach
settlements that help us effectively work with them to improve GM's
competitive position in the marketplace,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials at both factories have cited health and safety
concerns for their strikes, because the UAW's current contract with
GM limits most other walkouts and does not expire for another year.
</P>
<P>
   But union officials have acknowledged a broader agenda as well.
The spark plug factory workers have been increasingly alarmed in
recent years as GM has bought more basic auto parts from outside
companies, including some in Mexico, while selling its own
factories or cutting back employment.
</P>
<P>
   The metal-stamping factory workers have been worried that GM
management is assigning other factories work on vehicles not yet in
production, possibly signaling the stamping plant's
obsolescence.The strikers have also been infuriated by GM's
decision to remove, over the Memorial Day weekend, many of the
casting dies needed to stamp hoods and other metal parts for GM's
new full-size pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   As in eight other local strikes over the last three years, GM
executives have vowed to proceed with their long-standing plans to
cut costs. But senior UAW officials have increasingly come to see
this confrontation as an emotional struggle, perceiving a threat to
the union's long-term survival in GM's willingness to remove
equipment from plants where workers are about to go on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to the UAW said that with the broadening of the
strike to a second factory, the overall walkout could easily last
until the end of June. Union leaders will face pressure to settle
so that UAW members can collect full pay during the industry's
annual summer vacation in early July.
</P>
<P>
   National leaders of the UAW almost never visited the picket
lines during eight local strikes against GM over the previous three
years. But they have been doing so daily this week. While senior
UAW and GM officials refrained from criticizing each other in
public during the previous strikes, both sides have been doing so
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Even people close to the UAW concede that the metal stamping
workers in Flint have had one of the most generous special deals in
the auto industry. Its provisions allowed some workers to draw a
full day's pay for half a day's work. Workers agreed two years ago
to give up many of these provisions in exchange for further GM
investment in Flint. The union now contends that the investment has
not been forthcoming, an accusation denied by GM.
</P>
<P>
   The truck parts metal-stamping equipment was transferred by GM
to an Ohio factory with a more efficient work force. GM has been
planning to build the pickups initially in Oshawa, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   But Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers
Union, warned in a telephone interview on Thursday morning that GM
should not count on Canadian worker willingness to accept parts
produced by equipment taken out of the Flint factory. The Canadian
workers were angry that GM managers had made such a presumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not noted much for strike breaking,'' Hargrove said.
``If anybody says they're moving those dies and that's your
livelihood, logic no longer plays any part of it, it's emotion.''

   GM executives have said repeatedly this year that the company
must become more efficient to stay competitive. While Ford and
Chrysler now derive most of their automotive sales and profits from
pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, with relatively
little competition from foreign brands, GM still sells mostly cars
and faces heavy pressure from imports and from non-union factories
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That pressure has only increased as the dollar's value has
soared in global foreign-exchange markets this year, which makes it
even cheaper for foreign automakers to sell their cars in this
country with generous discounts.
</P>
<P>
   GM's stamping operations are particularly inefficient compared
with those of rivals. The company gloated last summer that its cost
for producing new dies was only twice that of GM's most efficient
competitor _ but used to be eight times higher.
</P>
<P>
   The stamping factory in Flint is among the least efficient of
all, and under great pressure from GM to improve its results or
face closure.``They have 14 stamping facilities and they probably
need 9 or 10,'' said David Bradley, an analyst at J.P. Morgan and
Co.
</P>
<P>
   A successful introduction of the new pickup truck is considered
vital to GM, which earns up to half its worldwide profits just from
sales in North America of full-size pickup trucks and the Suburban,
Yukon and Tahoe sport utility vehicles, which share the same
underbodies. GM plans to introduce new versions of the sport
utility vehicles a year after the new pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian law puts more restrictions than American law on the
ability of unions to strike in between contract negotiations, and
the current Canadian labor contract runs until late 1999. But the
Oshawa workers are among the most militant in the North American
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1996 strike, GM sent a flat-bed truck with a police
escort to the Oshawa factory and tried to remove parts-making
equipment similar to the equipment removed from the Flint factory.
Hundreds of Canadian auto workers blocked the front gates and
refused police orders to disperse. GM sought a court order against
the union action but later dropped it as part of a broad strike
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said that no parts from the moved Flint equipment had
arrived yet in Oshawa, and he declined to speculate on what would
happen if they did. GM officials said that they had begun producing
the pickup parts at another location but refused to identify where
or say whether the parts were being shipped to Canada.
