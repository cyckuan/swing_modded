<HEADLINE> GM, UAW Leaders Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- When leaders of General Motors Corp.  
and the United Auto Workers met Wednesday to start the long process 
of negotiating a new national contract, there was no sign of the 
acrimony that has long marked their relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite: It was all smiles and comments chosen to  
offend nobody. Quite remarkable, too, since just last summer the 
world's largest automaker and its biggest union were embroiled in a 
pair of costly strikes that only made their bad relationship worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the days of everybody beatin' the drum and rattling  
the swords are gone,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary L. Cowger, the executive GM brought in to repair its union  
relations, repeated the policy that GM adopted shortly after the 
strikes, which cost it about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk 
of market share it has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said since last summer that it is of utmost importance  
to the top leadership of this company to improve our communications 
with the UAW,'' Cowger said. ``We continue to work on that and 
continue to make that a focus and a priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even cynical UAW leaders said they were now convinced GM was  
serious. Richard Shoemaker, the union's chief GM negotiator, said 
the relationship has changed considerably since the strikes, but 
that the change has yet to filter down to the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's where it ultimately has to get to for it to  
be successful, and I think it would be premature to say it's 
reached that point yet,'' he said. ``I also think it would be 
unfair not to say that I believe there's a sincere interest in 
doing just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM had good reason to dump its get-tough stance. It need only  
look to rival Ford Motor Co., which has not had a national contract 
strike in 23 years and is the industry's poster company for good 
union relations. Ford today is the most profitable of Detroit's 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's strikes were largely over plant work rules and the  
loss of work to outside suppliers, issues that will be back on the 
table in these national negotiations. The focus of the work-rule 
debate is expected to be GM's plans to adopt ``modular assembly'' 
techniques at its small-car plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Modular assembly uses outside, lower-cost suppliers to do more  
subassembly work. The suppliers deliver to the plant large parts 
``modules,'' such as an entire preassembled door or dashboard. As a 
result, fewer high-wage UAW workers are needed for final assembly 
of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of workers at GM's former parts subsidiary, Delphi  
Automotive Systems Corp., also is a key issue in these 
negotiations. GM divested Delphi in an initial public offering and 
stock transfer earlier this year, over the union's objections. 
</P>
<P>
	As a concession to the union, GM and Delphi have agreed to keep  
Delphi workers under terms of the new GM contract for at least the 
next three years, according to sources on both sides who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial contract talks with Detroit's automakers began  
Monday at Ford Motor Co. and were followed Tuesday by an initial 
meeting at DaimlerChrysler AG. The talks will continue through the 
summer and intensify in early September when the union will pick a 
lead company to negotiate economic issues. The current three-year 
pacts expire Sept. 14.
