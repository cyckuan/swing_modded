   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ General Motors chairman and chief
executive John Smith said Wednesday that the world's largest
automaker would build a new generation of highly efficient assembly
plants in North America. The plants would use far less labor than
current assembly plants as outside suppliers, many of them with
nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by GM
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the new plants would be modeled mainly on GM's
efficient new operations in Brazil, and to a lesser extent on other
GM factories overseas. Those factories rely on outside suppliers to
produce large chunks of vehicles, like fully assembled dashboards,
instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together
on the assembly line. That is in keeping with GM's move this week
to become a company that designs, assembles and markets cars and
trucks but makes few of the parts.
</P>
<P>
   GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new
assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile
Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two
months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. Four out of
every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are
not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on
the industry and erodes its membership.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials were studying Wednesday's announcement and had no
immediate reaction. But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing
the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these
meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders are pleased that GM is interested in investing
at all in the United States instead of overseas, but deeply
troubled by the kinds of factories that GM plans to build. The new
factories could use half as many workers as the current factories.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare speech and news conference in Traverse City, the
usually reclusive Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants
for the first time, part of a broad vision to change GM, the
world's largest company in terms of sales and share of global
economic output.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced Monday that it would turn its vast auto parts
subsidiary into an independent company, with stock in the
subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, to be distributed next year
to GM investors. GM announced Tuesday that it would combine the
corporate staffs of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and
Pontiac into a single marketing organization that might be able to
sell cars more effectively, although the names on dealerships and
car models would not change.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said this week's moves had long been planned and that the
strike had only delayed them a little. But Smith has also been
under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to
make GM more competitive.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts even asked publicly during the strike
whether Smith was the right person to lead GM, suggesting that
while he had led the company back from the brink of bankruptcy
after taking over in 1992, he had taken few bold moves since then
and had not laid out a vision for the company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Many institutional investors had expected GM to inflict a
crushing blow to the UAW at the end of a strike that cost the
company $3 billion in after-tax earnings, and have pushed down the
company's stock in response to the very limited settlement that
actually resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Smith discussed his plans for the company in Traverse City at
midday and GM stock closed at $68.375, down $1.125.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refused to discuss Wednesday when or where GM would build
its new assembly plants, which would be its first in the United
States since the construction of the 7,000-employee Saturn factory
in Spring Hill, Tenn., in the 1980s. ``We are planning on building
some new assembly plants to replace and consolidate older plants,''
Smith said. ``The new plants will be lean and agile in every
respect, operating 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   After describing the large role that suppliers play in Brazil,
Smith said, ``We believe that vehicle manufacturing will evolve in
this direction here in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Harbour, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich., said
GM would probably start by building one of the new type of assembly
plant, which could take a couple of years, and then watch how it
worked before building more.
</P>
<P>
   Next to each new assembly plant, GM plans to put a factory that
could stamp hoods and other automotive body parts from sheets of
steel, Smith said. That plan sheds new light on GM's strong stand
against the UAW during the recent strike in Flint, Mich. GM tried
unsuccessfully to stop investing in a low-productivity stamping
factory in Flint that would be a logical candidate for closure if
GM builds new stamping factories.
</P>
<P>
   In an olive branch to the powerful UAW, Smith said Wednesday
that he wanted to develop a closer relationship with union leaders
and planned to discuss how the new factories would work.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the University of Michigan's annual auto industry
conference here in this Lake Michigan resort, 200 miles northwest
of Detroit, Smith also promised repeatedly that GM would not lay
off anyone in the coming years, but would rely instead on allowing
workers to retire without replacing them.
</P>
<P>
   GM has already eliminated 125,000 hourly jobs in the United
States since 1990 by not replacing people who retire or leave for
other reasons, and thinks that it can continue reducing its work
force this way, he said, adding, ``We're not talking about layoffs
or anything like that, we're talking about working within the
window of our attrition rates.''
</P>
<P>
   With a steadily shrinking market share, GM has hired few
employees since the late 1970's and has 220,000 hourly workers left
in the United States, mostly represented by the UAW The automaker
has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival
automakers in terms of the number of autos that each worker
produces annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we close the productivity gap without costly work
stoppages is the clear focus in my head,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes in Flint severely hurt GM's sales in July. The
company said Wednesday that its sales of cars and light trucks
dropped 37.7 percent, as car sales plunged 45.0 percent while sales
of sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans fell 28.1 percent. GM's
overall share of the light-vehicle market decreased to 21 percent,
trailing Ford Motor Co., at 27.5 percent, for the first time since
a two-month strike in 1970 also crippled GM's production.
</P>
<P>
   GM's plans to build efficient new factories might well provoke a
flurry of offers of tax incentives and other financial assistance
from state governments, Mexico and Canada. Smith avoided saying
whether GM would put any of the new assembly plants in Mexico. But
he did say that GM was considering the construction of new plants
close to existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's contracts with the Big Three automakers give workers
the privilege of turning down transfers to work sites more than 50
miles away, and the workers have virtually guaranteed lifetime
employment.
