GM PLANS TO SPIN OFF PARTS DIVISION

<P>
   General Motors Corp. announced Monday that it planned to spin
off its gigantic auto parts subsidiary to its shareholders next
year, a move that could reignite the labor troubles that led to
nearly eight-week-long strikes that ended only last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away
from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company
produces most of the parts as well as the final product. Through
the 1970s, GM promoted its vertical integration as a source of
financial strength and savings.
</P>
<P>
   But John F. Smith Jr., the GM chairman and chief executive, said
Monday that General Motors wanted instead to be a company that
assembles and markets cars, but does not necessarily make a large
proportion of the parts inside. The spinoff of the auto parts
subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, ``represents nothing less
than a fundamental shift away from vertical integration,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Automobile Workers union reacted furiously to GM's
announcement Monday afternoon, which followed a regularly scheduled
board meeting. ``Should GM decide to proceed with the sale as
announced, the UAW's record is clear: we can and will aggressively
work to protect the rights and interests of UAW members impacted by
the sale,'' Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM
issues, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' national contract with the union expires in
September 1999, and the union could try to stop the spinoff of
Delphi then with a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Through strikes and the threat of strikes, the UAW has sometimes
forced GM to postpone or cancel factory sales and closings over the
years. Robert Stempel, the former chairman of GM, announced in
December 1991 the closing of two dozen factories and the
elimination of 74,000 jobs, but some of those factories are still
open and the jobs still exist.
</P>
<P>
   But a spinoff of Delphi could be an attractive move for General
Motors and its shareholders. The UAW currently forces GM to pay the
same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and
parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay
only half as much to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   An independent Delphi could try to pay lower wages to its
American workers who are members of the UAW. It might be able to
sell more parts to other auto makers, which have been reluctant to
order from Delphi for fear that it would share parts designs and
other competitive information with GM.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers
and parts workers, but they disposed of many of their parts
factories piecemeal in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when their
survival was in doubt. Japanese auto makers pay close to $19 an
hour to their assembly plant workers but buy the great bulk of
their parts from outside suppliers with much lower wages.

   Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American
personnel, had said last Tuesday, when a tentative settlement was
reached with the UAW in Flint, Mich., that the automaker wanted a
closer relationship with the union and would begin holding regular,
top-level meetings with union officials. Knechtel said then that
the strike could only be judged worthwhile if it produced a lasting
improvement in the relationship. Workers ratified the settlement
last Wednesday and returned to work, but GM lost $3 billion in
after-tax profits because of the strike, or nearly half a year's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said at a press conference Monday that GM's board had been
planning for months to decide on the spinoff of Delphi at its
August meeting, but that the company had not told the union until
after the Flint strike had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even if GM divests Delphi, it will still be somewhat vertically
integrated. GM factories that produce engines, transmissions and
exterior sheet metal are part of GM's auto assembly and marketing
divisions, and would not be divested with Delphi. The Delphi
division makes hundreds of smaller parts, from spark plugs to
dashboards to seats, that are less important to a car's exterior
appearance or road performance.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes in Flint affected two parts factories, a Delphi
factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs and other parts and
another, non-Delphi factory that stamps truck hoods and other parts
from sheets of steel.
</P>
<P>
   But GM's planned spinoff of Delphi nonetheless represents a big
decision. Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., is the world's largest auto
parts maker, with slightly greater annual sales than Intel Corp.
Delphi's 200,000 employees around the world include 50,000 UAW
members in the United States, a sizable number for a union with
around 730,000 members. There are another 150,000 UAW workers in
GM's other operations that will not be divested.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said that it planned to dispose of Delphi in two
steps. During the first quarter of next year, GM plans to
distribute to shareholders as much as 20 percent of Delphi's stock.
The automaker said it would dispose of the rest of Delphi later
next year, by distributing shares or by exchanging GM shares for
Delphi shares, or possibly by a combination of these approaches, in
a transaction that is intended to be tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors announced its plan late in the afternoon. GM
shares rose 37.5 cents Monday, to $72.6875.
