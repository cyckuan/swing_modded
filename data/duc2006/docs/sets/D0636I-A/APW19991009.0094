<HEADLINE> Ford, UAW Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and Ford Motor  
Co. reached a tentative agreement Saturday on a new contract, hours 
after a handful of workers walked off the job when a strike 
deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement announcing the deal contained no details, and  
officials declined to provide any, pending ratification meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the agreement followed the pattern set by the UAW in deals 
with General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG -- four-year 
agreements with raises of 3 percent each year and a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unknown how the contract dealt with Visteon Automotive  
Systems, the parts division of Ford that the company is expected to 
either spin-off or sell. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials have said they were opposed to the company's plans  
for Visteon, which employs 23,500 UAW workers. Officials were 
concerned a separate Visteon could cut pay and jobs and even close 
plants to compete against other parts companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike deadline of midnight Friday was a first in U.S. auto  
industry negotiations this year and a sign of strain in what had 
been billed as a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the union said it did not authorize any work stoppages  
and workers at only a handful of plants walked off their jobs when 
the deadline passed. Plants scheduled to operate on Saturday were 
back in business by the day shift. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary walkout was designed to be ``kind of like a  
wake-up call'' to Ford, said Larry Senyard, treasurer of Local 325 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkouts came at Ford plants in St. Louis; Claycomo, Mo.;  
Flat Rock, Mich.; and St. Paul, Minn. There was no word on how many 
workers were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had made $6.6 billion in 1998, thanks to a lack of work  
stoppages and bulked-up production at truck and sport utility 
vehicle plants. The average worker's profit sharing payment was 
$6,100. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication what issues might have held up  
agreement on the contract for about 100,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Labor Day parade in Detroit, UAW workers carried signs  
depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' -- an orange monster 
busting out of the Ford logo. 
</P>
<P>
	And UAW President Stephen P.Yokich told union members in a taped  
message earlier in the week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about 
accepting contracts agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiated some terms with DaimlerChrysler, GM and  
Delphi Automotive Systems that experts say could have applied to 
Ford and Visteon. The contracts included promises from the 
companies that they would not spin off, sell or close any division 
or factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also  
allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan. 1 
with a GM pension. Other terms include a $1,350 signing bonus, 
improved pensions and better cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on their  
new contract by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The last national strike by the UAW against Ford was 1976; it  
was also the last time the UAW struck during negotiations. A local 
union in Atlanta struck Ford in 1986. The UAW has not held a 
national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, 
including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut 
down most of the company's North American production.
