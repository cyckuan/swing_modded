<HEADLINE> Wages Key in UAW Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has signaled to Wall Street  
that it expects the United Auto Workers to make a stronger push for 
wage increases in this year's contract talks with Detroit's 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mark a shift from previous negotiations in the 1990s,  
when the union sought relatively benign wage hikes in exchange for 
job security. It means automakers may have to give workers more of 
their growing revenues to ensure labor peace, a change that has 
some on Wall Street fearing a possible inflationary effect on the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent meeting with about 40 major investors and analysts,  
GM chairman Jack Smith said the UAW felt it missed out on this 
decade's real wage growth and would likely place a higher priority 
on wage increases this year, according to investor sources who 
attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	GM declined to comment. ``It's our policy to negotiate with the  
union behind closed doors, which means we don't intend to begin 
negotiating in the public, with the media or analysts,'' spokesman 
Tony Cervone said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW did not return phone calls for comment. But the strategy  
expected by GM is in line with the collective bargaining resolution 
the union approved last May, arguing that its members deserve a 
larger share of the profits that GM, Ford Motor Co. and the 
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG are making on U.S. sales. The 
automakers are on track to set an annual record for earnings in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``These staggering profits and the market inroads the Big Three  
have made justify our demand for real wage gains over the course of 
the next agreement,'' the resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current three-year contracts expire Sept. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	Analyst John Casesa of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who did not attend  
the Smith meeting, said there is some concern on Wall Street that 
automakers will be so fearful of a strike in a booming market they 
will give too big a wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest concern is that they're going to sign a contract  
that's going to not just spook the auto industry, but spook 
everybody to say, `Geez, it's inflationary,''' Casesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor professor Harley Shaiken of the University of California  
at Berkeley said auto contracts historically have set wage trends 
for the nation because of the industry's size and the attention the 
deals receive. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see a larger 
wage hike this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations began in June and will intensify around Labor Day,  
when the UAW is expected to target one company to negotiate an 
economic package that will set the pattern for all three. Before 
the unexpected death last week of the UAW's chief negotiator with 
DaimlerChrysler, Jack Laskowski, conventional wisdom was that the 
UAW would select DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Now analysts suggest Ford might be the lead company. Ford's good  
relations with the union are being tested by its talk of spinning 
off its big parts unit, Visteon Automotive Systems Corp. The union 
opposes a spinoff and has set a national strike-authorization vote 
for Tuesday to drive that message home.
