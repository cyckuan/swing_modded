<HEADLINE> UAW Turns Attention to GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With a set of precedent-setting contract terms  
from DaimlerChrysler AG in its pocket, the United Auto Workers 
appears ready to focus on negotiating a new contract with General 
Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will be expected to match many terms of DaimlerChrysler's  
apparent agreement -- a four-year contract with 3 percent raises 
every year, a signing bonus and clauses aimed at protecting union 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that given the industry's record sales and  
profits, the UAW could win more than in the past -- and that all 
sides would work to avoid costly national strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think at this point that (UAW President) Stephen  
Yokich would have signed off on anything that wasn't a pretty good 
deal,'' said John Revitte, a professor at the Michigan State 
University School of Labor and Industrial Relations. ``He wanted 
something that would give him leverage at GM or at Ford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Edd Snyder said lower-level talks with the UAW took  
place Thursday. The GM contract covers 222,000 workers, including 
those at Delphi Automotive, GM's former parts division. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement on a new national contract for 75,000  
DaimlerChrysler workers came after three months of talks and more 
than 40 hours of marathon bargaining. Terms of the tentative 
agreement were not released by company or union spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	But local union officials in Indiana and New York said the deal  
was a four-year contract -- rather than the standard three-year pact 
-- with a 3 percent annual wage increase plus a $1,350 signing 
bonus. Recent contracts had in some years paid lump sums rather 
than percentage increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported the base  
wages for assembly workers would reach $22.63 per hour in the 
fourth year, up from the current $20.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Brown, president of Local 550 in Indianapolis, also said  
he had been told the deal includes a statement by DaimlerChrysler 
emphasizing its neutrality in union organizing. The union has said 
it would like to organize DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz sport 
utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 workers and Freightliner 
commercial truck plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of  
the UAW's contract. But by stating its neutrality in the contract, 
DaimlerChrysler could stay on good terms with its largest union. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Brown said the deal includes an agreement not to  
spin off any parts of the company into independent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a clause might be aimed more at GM and Ford than  
DaimlerChrysler. GM has spun off its Delphi parts unit, and Ford 
would like to spin off its Visteon parts unit, a move the UAW 
opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Scott Stanton, vice president of Local 624 in  
Syracuse, N.Y., also said the deal includes improvements in retiree 
benefits. Nearly half of the UAW's 407,000 active autoworkers at 
GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are eligible for retirement within 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That part of it sounds good,'' said Brown, whose local  
represents 1,350 workers at a DaimlerChrysler foundry. ``The rest 
of it we'll have to wait and see when we go to Detroit next week on 
Monday or Tuesday for an informational meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanton said a ratification vote was scheduled for Sept. 25.  
</P>
<P>
	Workers interviewed leaving DaimlerChrysler's truck plant in  
Warren on Thursday afternoon said they had heard little about the 
agreement because of the secretive nature of the negotiations. Some 
said they were pleased with what they had heard so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing well. We're working a lot of overtime. We're  
building a good product,'' said Matthew Lyons, 46, of Macomb 
County's Macomb Township. ``Chrysler has been good to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the company, the average assembly worker at  
DaimlerChrysler is 43 years old, has 16 years of experience and 
earns about $70,000 a year, thanks to overtime and profit sharing. 
The same worker gets 37 paid vacation days a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of  
record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more 
than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with  
the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts 
factories. The strike virtually shut down the automaker's North 
American production. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher  
wages, and has sought better overtime compensation with more money 
and extra time off. In recent years, automakers have held down 
employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker 
adds about 9 hours of overtime a week. Union newsletters also said 
GM had proposed a lifetime employment guarantee for workers with 
more than 10 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest issue between Ford and the union appears to be  
Ford's plans for Visteon and the unit's 23,500 UAW workers. The UAW 
fears a separate parts company would try to cut jobs and lower 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Brickner, a retired Michigan State University labor  
professor, said the no-spinoff clause might be aimed at Ford and 
GM, which spun off its Delphi parts unit, rather than 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that's going to weigh heavily in the Ford and GM  
unit talks,'' he said. Brickner said the UAW may tell the companies 
``you have to pay a price for doing something else with you parts 
companies.''
