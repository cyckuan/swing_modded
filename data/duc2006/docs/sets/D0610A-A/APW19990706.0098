	DENVER (AP) -- When Sherie Ferguson learned two teen-age gunmen  
opened fire at Columbine High, she jumped in her car and sped 
through traffic to find her daughter, a 15-year-old freshman at a 
neighboring high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, with the death toll in the Littleton school  
massacre at 15, Ms. Ferguson decided she would teach Brandi at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sending her back to Bear Creek, where security is virtually  
nonexistent, to me that's gambling,'' said Ms. Ferguson, a single 
parent. ``Look at all the copy cats. I don't think it's going to 
stop. How can it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is too early to know how many parents will opt for home  
schooling, but educators in Colorado said there was a 30 percent to 
40 percent increase in interest immediately after Dylan Klebold, 
17, and Eric Harris, 18, went on their rampage April 20. The two 
seniors killed 12 classmates and a teacher and injured 25 others at 
Columbine before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, was accused of wounding  
six students at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga., amplifying 
jitters about school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tension out there, and parents are very curious what  
they can do about it,'' said Brian Ray of the National Home 
Education Research Institute in Oregon. ``Many people see home 
schooling as a way to protect children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the number of headline-seizing, multiple-victim attacks  
recently has gone up, government figures show a general decline in 
school crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released last year, the Education Department found  
90 percent of schools reported no serious violent crime in 
1996-1997. Fewer students brought weapons to schools, based on 
surveys beginning in 1993 of students in grades 9-12. And the 
overall crime rate at schools dropped between 1993-1996, based on 
surveys of students 12-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that it is not the safety issue as much as that  
that was the last straw,'' said Michael Kasson of the Colorado Home 
Educators Association. 
</P>
<P>
	For most parents, the decision to home school can take years and  
is based on numerous factors, including the quality of public 
school education, the specific needs of a child, a wish to 
emphasize moral or religious guidelines, or distance from the 
nearest school, particularly in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, however, parents are citing security as a reason  
for turning living rooms into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly was a stick in the fire,'' said Terry Deharsh, a  
locksmith who attended the Christian Home Educators of Colorado's 
recent statewide conference on home schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is an elementary school across the street from  
the Deharshes' home in Greeley, Deharsh and his wife, Lindee, plan 
to home school their 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thrill-seekers are going to look for a group,'' Deharsh said.  
``If someone wants to kill my daughter at home, they have to know 
her, they have to have a reason to kill her and they have to come 
looking for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Columbine, the number of home schoolers has  
increased 7 percent to 15 percent nationally in the past five 
years, with up to 1.6 million children home schooled in 1998, 
according to National Home Education Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzy Parker, director of the Colorado Department of Education's  
home schooling program, said she received five calls a day, twice 
the normal amount, from parents seeking information in the month 
that followed the Columbine shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In several states with fatal school-related shootings -- Pearl,  
Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; and 
Springfield, Ore. -- there may have been an increase in interest in 
home schooling, but not necessarily in numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What comes mostly is we get more opportunities to speak, to go  
talk to people about it,'' said Richard Karman, chairman of the 
board of the Oregon Christian Home Education Association Network. 
``Those requests are up probably, a ball park figure, maybe as much 
as up a third.''
