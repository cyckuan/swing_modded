   POLYGAMIST (Colorado City, Ariz.) - School opens in Colorado
City. Nearly 700 students don't show up, as the fundamentalist
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints begins its ambitious
home-schooling and private schooling project. Church leaders warn
about the evils of the outside world. Parents kept their students
out of school, the latest in a series of events of the church
saying they want to withdraw from society and to keep alien ideas
out of the town. Meanwhile, as 350 students did go school, dozens
of students from the fundalmentalist families were riding
motorcycles and tractors around town. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will
move in the ``A'' category.
