   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Education reformers of conservative or
libertarian stripe are already hanging crepe for the school voucher
initiative on the California ballot next month. It will be a major
blow to their movement nationally if voters in the most populous
state reject, for the second time in less than 10 years, the idea
of giving public money to parents to help students escape public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are an intellectually interesting but largely untested
article of faith for many in the camp that correctly diagnoses the
poor state of public education but then often fixates on teachers
unions, vehement opponents of vouchers, as the taproot of a problem
that has far more diverse causes.
</P>
<P>
   The California initiative, Proposition 38, would give parents
$4,000 for every school-age child that could be spent for any form
of currently sanctioned education _ including parochial, secular
private, charter school, home schooling. It's the brainchild of
high-tech venture capitalist Tim Draper, a guy with more money than
political skill.
</P>
<P>
   Draper unwisely rejected pleas of some voucher supporters to
target the proposal for the poor or on demonstrably wretched
schools (which are virtually one and the same thing). He also did
not seek to insulate the measure from criticism that helped doom a
similar California initiative in 1993, especially a lack of rules
to guarantee equity and access in private education.
</P>
<P>
   Draper has pledged to spend up to $20 million on the campaign.
And with the issue tanking, he has offered Hawaiian vacations,
computers and shopping sprees to folks who'll sign up supporters.
But it seems a lost cause, Stanford political scientist _ and
voucher supporter _ Terry Moe told a Hoover Institution seminar
staffed by what the professor called ``a small band of
nonconformists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is supporting this? No one,'' Moe said. ``It's a bump
along the road that didn't have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statewide survey of the Public Policy Institute
of California showed more than a majority of likely voters already
oppose Prop. 38 _ a near-fatal standing for a ballot initiative a
month before an election. The PPIC analysis is that the measure
``faces an uphill battle in large part because it is not viewed as
a solution to improving schools or student performance.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate may await a voucher initiative next month in
Michigan, where even Republican Gov. John Engler opposes the
proposal, which at heart is a repeal of the state's constitutional
ban on public aid to private schools. The Michigan plan would
provide just over $3,000 of state money per child in districts that
graduate less than two-thirds of their students _ a formula that
would include the giant (and egregiously problem-ridden) Detroit
system and about 30 others statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Among the initiative's biggest backers is the self-interested
Roman Catholic Church, operator of the state's largest private
school system. Model sermons are being drafted for pre-election
exhortations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, the nation's largest
teachers union, is, as usual, playing tough. At its national
convention in July, the NEA instituted a &QL; 
$5-a-member assessment to fight voucher programs, $3 of which (or
some $6 million) is earmarked for the ``no'' campaigns in
California and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50,000 students are in voucher programs, meaning
suggestions of success are anecdotal at best and provide far too
sketchy findings on which to base wholesale changes in the nation's
education system, even as troubled as it admittedly is.
</P>
<P>
   Given vouchers' political baggage and the prospect of
approaching bad luck at the polls, it seems that incremental
advances with smaller, experimental programs, for vouchers as well
as other proposals, would be a better way to go. But that
suggestion from the Hoover audience drew what seemed to be an
unappreciative sneer from some of the crusading ``nonconformists.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn, a Vanderbilt professor and Manhattan Institute
fellow who was a Reagan administration Education Department
official, said that reaching for something bold and extreme
sometimes allows the merely interesting to bubble up. That could be
a desirable cause and effect, but there is little evidence that
it's actually occurring.
