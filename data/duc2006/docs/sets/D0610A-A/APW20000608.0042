<HEADLINE> Home Schooler A Spelling Success  </HEADLINE>

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When other kids were reading Dr. Seuss or
Winnie the Pooh, George Thampy was curled up with Noah Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could sit with the dictionary for hours and hours, and
still enjoy life,'' said his mother, Bina Thampy, laughing. ''I've
never heard him in all these years say 'I'm tired,' 'I'm fed up,'
'Mommy, another day.'''
</P>
<P>
   George started with the dictionary at age 6 and kept on reading
it because ''I just really want to be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off last week when the 12-year-old from Maryland
Heights, Mo., won the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee by
correctly spelling ''demarche'' -- a step or maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   According to George's parents, the key to his victory wasn't the
time he spent with the dictionary or the hours of preparation. It
was the hours he spent as a home-schooled student.
</P>
<P>
   ''We teach these children the art of studying,'' said K. George
Thampy, George's father. ''If I give him a new thing today, I'm
confident he'll become a master of it in a very short period of
time with very little help.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, George's second-place performance in the
National Geographic Bee a week before the spelling bee. He began
preparing just four months before the finals.
</P>
<P>
   George's successes, along with those of other home-schooled
students in such high-profile and high-pressure events, are
bringing attention to the home-schooling movement. The top three
finishers at this year's spelling bee were home-schooled, as were
four of the 10 finalists in the geography bee, the most ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Events like those of the last week have really helped drive
home a strong message that people need not worry about our academic
quality,'' said Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal
Defense Association in Purcellville, Va. ''We're going to do just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Home Education Research Institute estimates the
number of home-schooled children somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7
million, a number that's growing by at least 7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Thampys became part of those statistics while living in an
area of Houston where public schools had installed metal detectors.
That wasn't the kind of school environment the two immigrants from
India had pictured for their children.
</P>
<P>
   They made the decision to home-school six of their seven
children. Mrs. Thampy does most of the teaching, working during the
day on languages, economics, social sciences. Thampy, a fellow in
endocrinology at Washington University, works with his kids on math
and science at night.
</P>
<P>
   George's brother Eapen was a national finalist in the geography
bee in 1997 and 1998, and sister Mallika finished sixth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we can provide an all around education, an all
around development of the child,'' Thampy said.
</P>
<P>
   Farris cites a study that found home-schooled students scored
higher than public and private school students on two widely used
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just a few kids that really excel, but that the
average home school kid is a top student also,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   There are critics. The National Education Association, the
nation's largest teachers' union, doesn't believe home-schooling
can provide students with a comprehensive education.
</P>
<P>
   But NEA spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons admits there are obvious
advantages to home-schooling. ''What a great class size,'' she
said. ''Every teacher in America would like that.''
</P>
<P>
   George's education stresses the three Rs, as well as public
speaking, personal hygiene and health. He takes field trips with
other home-schooled students to museums, farms and his dad's
endocrinology lab at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he learns in a group with his siblings, but often he
is taught individually and frequently he does in-depth research on
subjects via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no trouble relating to kids who go to conventional
schools. They don't think I'm strange because I'm home-schooled,
especially since we study the same subjects, only in a different
way,'' George wrote in a letter published Wednesday in The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   His parents caution that it's not as easy as it might sound. The
couple put in long hours into teaching their children -- as well as
forging an extremely close, personal relationship with each of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle is the time,'' Thampy said. ''It is extremely
expensive in the aspect of time. You never can do all the things
you want for the children. Your work gets behind.''
