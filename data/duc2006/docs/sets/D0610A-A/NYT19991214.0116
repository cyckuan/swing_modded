   PURCELLVILLE, Va. _ The dormitories are still under construction
in the hilly fields, but Patrick Henry College already has a few
rules: Students will wear uniforms. They won't drink. They won't
date, unless their parents ``are informed of the potential
romance'' and approve.
</P>
<P>
   All of which will set the college apart when it opens next fall.
Yet what is drawing national attention to the school is not its
strict code of conduct, but its future student body. Almost every
undergraduate entering Patrick Henry College will have been
home-schooled.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them graduates of one of the most controversial
movements in American education, one that gained steam in the 1980s
amid a series of legal battles pitting parents against the
government. Now that the first wave of the country's 1.5 million
home-schooled children is reaching college age, there is a new
debate: When, and how, should they be thrust into the ``real
world''?
</P>
<P>
   Critics of home-schooling have long argued children need
exposure to the outside world and peers to grow into well-rounded
adults. And home-schoolers freely admit their aim is to ``let
children be children'' by sheltering them from the harsh realities
and temptations of the modern world. But when do children stop
being children? How do they make that transition? And what kind of
adult lives will home-schooled children be prepared to lead?
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Patrick Henry College, believed to be the first
ever to target home-schoolers, think they have found an answer in
their curriculum: The only major for incoming freshmen will be
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their classes, students will write legislative
papers for US congressmen, which they hope will then be used as
actual guides for congressional staffers. Students will also
participate in Capitol Hill ``apprenticeships,'' all to train them
for a future in the most unsheltered of careers: politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the real world means Capitol Hill, they'll be as prepared
as anyone,'' said the school's founder, Michael P. Farris, who has
home-schooled his 10 children, the oldest of whom is 24. ``If it is
defined as the college bar scene? No, they're not going to be
prepared for that a bit. It would be fair to say we're skipping one
phase of wildness. We're skipping them straight into adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   This intertwining of politics and home-schooled students is
bound to draw notice, especially since the home-schooling movement
is so often depicted as antigovernment. In the last 19 years
advocates for home schooling have filed hundreds of lawsuits in
more than 40 states, according to the Home School Legal Defense
Association. The purpose of the litigation, in most cases, has been
to get government out of citizens' educational lives.
</P>
<P>
   But to Farris and his colleagues, the vision is entirely
consistent. Patrick Henry College will be a breeding ground for the
next generation of crusaders _ who may abstain from partying with
the rest of the world, but will still work to change it. The
school's promotional material states the goal: ``Eventually, these
highly-qualified public servants will themselves begin to run for
elective office and will have the opportunity to lead our nation
back to its constitutional roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those roots do not exclude religion, in Farris's view, and
fundamentalist Christianity is clearly at the core of what the
college hopes to stand for. Students will attend daily chapel. They
must ``show evidence of a personal relationship with Jesus
Christ,'' the school pamphlet says, and must subscribe to a
seven-point statement of faith that includes believing in the
literal resurrection of Christ. Emblazoned on the blue-and-white
folders being distributed to prospective students is a school
motto: ``For Christ &AMP; For Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris's vision for student relationships is also closely tied
to faith. He hopes to develop a ``practice of courtship,'' in which
students ``engage in the activity of seriously looking for God's
partner in life.'' Students who find themselves attracted to one
another will be required to call their parents to discuss it. The
role of parents, Farris said, is ``to help them make a wise choice
of whether they will marry.''
</P>
<P>
   Campus life is still just a dream, of course. The main hall is
little more than a steel frame in the middle of a muddy field,
surrounded by cranes and construction material. The administrators,
including Farris, work out of a cluster of townhouses in a
subdivision of this tiny town in western Loudon County, whose other
inhabitants include a Dunkin' Donuts and a McDonald's along a
two-lane main road.
</P>
<P>
   But, if all goes well, the state higher education council of
Virginia will recommend Patrick Henry be approved to enroll
students, a final step toward opening its doors in 2000. Farris
said he hopes to send out applications as early as this week. And
he is in the midst of fund-raising to help pay the school's $50
million in long-term costs; since June, he said he has raised close
to $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have helped is the Republican Governor of
Virginia, Jim Gilmore, who signed copies of a Patrick Henry
biography at a party to raise funds, Farris said. There are other
political connections, too: Janet Ashcroft, the wife of Republican
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, is on the school's board of
trustees. And Farris considers Representative Steve Largent, an
influential Republican from Oklahoma, a ``good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Those political ties will become increasingly important if the
apprenticeship system is put into practice, as some of the 100 to
140 students begin to write legislative papers for congressmen. But
there are those who wonder whether integrating home-schooled, and
to some degree ``home-colleged'', students into the political
culture of Capitol Hill will be as easy or productive as Farris
makes it sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their experience is of being cut off, to a large extent, from
people with different values and different backgrounds,'' said Mark
Rozell, a professor of politics at Catholic University. ``Once
anyone goes into politics, to be successful it's necessary to know
how to converse with different people and to know how to work
effectively with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Brad Jacob, the school's provost, that is exactly why
schools like Patrick Henry are in demand. ``We see this college as
a transition from the home, and from a home school, into the real
world of living on your own,'' he said. ``We don't think it's
necessary to make that transition by dumping an 18-year-old cold
turkey on a college campus. We're trying to make that transition in
a controlled way.''
