   WASHINGTON _ The fast-spreading home schooling movement got
another boost from this year's national spelling and geography
bees.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, at least 5 percent of the
participants in the National Spelling Bee were being educated by
their parents at home, rather than in a public or private school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess cream rises to the top,'' joked Bry(cq) Conley of
Newark, Calif., as she discussed the strong showing by her son Sean
and the dozen other home schoolers among the 249 students in the
spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   In the televised climax Thursday, two of the eight finalists
were home-schooled. They were Ann Foley, 13, of Marion, Ohio, who
tied for sixth, and George Thampy, 11, of Maryland Heights, Mo.,
who tied for third.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, five of the 55 contestants in the National Geography
Bee were home schoolers, and David Beihl of Saluda, S.C., became
the first home schooler to win the geography bee. In the spelling
bee, the first and only home schooler to win so far was Rebecca
Sealfon of Brooklyn, N.Y., two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spelling and geography bees offer confirmation that home
schooling can work very well indeed,'' said Michael Farris,
president of the Home School Legal Defense Association in
Purcellville, Va., which helped topple many legal barriers to home
schooling. ``I think the movement's coming of age.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing by home schoolers really beats the odds. U.S.
Department of Education studies indicate that their numbers have
more than doubled in this decade, and now probably exceed 1
million. But that is still less than 2 percent of all children of
school age.
</P>
<P>
   Home schooling ``is excellent for a very few parents, with very
strong motivation,'' said K. George Thampy, shortly before his
son's third-place finish Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thampy works as a biochemist and physician, and his wife Bina
teaches young George, his two brothers and three sisters at their
home near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision to home-school our children was scripturally
based,'' Thampy said. ``We wanted their education to stress
character development and godly values which are not promoted in
local schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley, on the other hand, said she and her husband, Mike, a
software engineer, were primarily interested in creating
``customized educations'' for Sean, 11, and his two younger
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool about home schooling is that you can pick up
whatever method, subjects or approaches work for your family and
for your kid,'' said Conley. She said her sons will sometimes
concentrate on one to three subjects for two to three months in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents who try to reproduce the factory-school system _ you
sit at the kitchen table and study the same courses as regular
schools from 9 to 3 _ burn out after two or three years,'' Conley
said. ``But that's what's great about home schooling: If you don't
agree with me, you can do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of all home schooling parents are motivated by
religion, usually Christian,'' said policy analyst Kevin Welner of
the graduate school of education at the University of Denver,
Boulder. ``But there is great diversity within that group, and
among the rest of the home schoolers, both in pedagogical theory
and in (ideological) orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, some wouldn't want their children to
compete in bees.
