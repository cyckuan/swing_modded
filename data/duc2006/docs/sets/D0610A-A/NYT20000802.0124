<P>
   Once upon a time, immigrant families turned to the public
schools to Americanize their children: teach them English,
introduce them to the broader culture, and point them in the
direction of the streets paved with gold.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as the melting pot metaphor is eclipsed by
multiculturalism, more and more Americans are rejecting public
schools and turning to home schooling in an effort to safeguard
their children's cultural and religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims, one of the United States' fastest-growing populations,
are following the lead of other groups, including evangelical
Christians, in opting out of American public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing up as Americans, and they have to integrate,
but we want them to keep their Islamic identity intact, and not
have it washed away or assaulted,'' said Beverly Beresford, a
36-year-old Muslim mother of three teaching her children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in home schooling is part of a broader trend in which
many Americans driven by moral as well as educational concerns are
choosing religious, charter, and pilot schools for their children.
For some, it's a development that raises fundamental, even
troubling, questions about the future of public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living at a time in which the schools are under attack,
and people are seeking alternatives,'' said Arthur E. Levine,
president of Teachers College at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of socialization has also changed,'' he said.
``Once the hope of people entering was that they would become
Americanized and indistinct from the pack. Now we're having a
battle over how much we want in common and how much we want to be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim home-schoolers scoff at the suggestion that their
children might somehow be isolated from the larger culture because
they are home schooled. Their children play in sports leagues with
non-Muslim children, go on field trips with non-Muslim children,
meet with non-Muslim home-schoolers, and are inundated with
mainstream American culture, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to withdraw or create a shell _ that's
unrealistic and unfair to the children,'' Beresford said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Beresford and other parents say, is communicating
Islamic faith, history, and values to their children in the face of
the broader and more dominant culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslims are a new, emerging community, and a number of them
are not happy with the public-schooling system, either because they
feel that the schools are not really teaching their kids right or
they object that they are not paying attention to moral issues,''
said Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim
Council, who said education is the top concern of Muslims in
America. ``There is a secular turn in public schooling that Muslim
families are not happy with, and some of those who are not able to
join Muslim schools do home schooling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim home-schooling movement resembles, and in some ways
piggybacks on, the wider home-schooling movement popularized by
evangelical Christians since the 1980s. The Christian
home-schoolers cite many of the same reasons as Muslims _ a desire
to inculcate their children with values and behavioral norms that
are off-limits in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person has a strong belief in the area of religion,
they're going to want to pass it on to their children, and the only
effective way is to teach them at home,'' said Michael Smith,
president of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
</P>
<P>
   The organization estimates that 1.7 million American youngsters
are now home schooled _ a number contested as too high by some _
and although the majority are thought to be white evangelical
Christians with highly educated parents, Smith said his group is
seeing rapid growth in home schooling among other religious groups,
such as Muslims and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But for American Muslims _ an ethnically diverse and
fast-growing group whose population is estimated to be 6 million to
7 million _ it is not yet clear whether home schooling will be a
permanent part of the landscape or a temporary phenomenon until the
community builds more private schools. Already there are two Muslim
grade schools in Greater Boston, the Al-Hamra Academy in
Northborough and the Islamic Academy of New England in Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics about the numbers of Muslim
home-schoolers in this country, but it is clear that most Muslims
still send their children to public schools and depend on weekend
Islamic schools for religious instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are several organizations devoted to the
topic, including the Muslim Home School Network
(www.muslimhomeschool.com), which is hosting a home-schooling
convention in Sharon on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is directed by Cynthia Sulaiman, a mother of
four, who started her eldest children in the public schools but
then decided to teach her family at home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sulaiman, Beresford sent her eldest son to public school
for a year before deciding to try home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local school is quite good, but we felt that because in
Islam, you want to integrate religion into all aspects of life, we
could achieve that better by home schooling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford and Sulaiman teach their children at home for some of
the same reasons cited by other home-schooling parents: a desire
for safety, a concern about the secular nature of public schools,
and a hope their children will do better with individual attention.
But they have other, less familiar concerns: They want their
children to pray five times a day, they want their daughters to be
able to cover their heads without fear of teasing, and they don't
want boys mixing socially with girls.
</P>
<P>
   They teach the basics _ reading, writing, and mathematics _
alongside Islamic history, culture, and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford and Sulaiman are both converts to Islam who married
immigrants from Islamic countries. Scholars say home schooling has
been particularly popular among American Muslim families in which
at least one parent was born in the United States, perhaps because
the home-schooling phenomenon is most familiar to Americans, and
perhaps because of a concern that children of converts are thought
to be less likely to retain their parents' chosen faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more parents who want to do it, but feel they are
not equipped, and those who are equipped are often African-American
or Euro-American Muslims,'' said Shabbir Mansuri, executive
director of the Council on Islamic Education, a California-based
organization that works to improve and expand the depiction of
Islam and Muslims in textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Variations of home schooling, such as groups of families
teaching their children together, have been popular particularly
among African-American Muslims, said Ilyas Ba-Yunus, a sociologist
at State University of New York at Cortland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people are new converts who are very unhappy
with the drugs and guns and dating and sex that they consider to be
un-Islamic,'' Ba-Yunus said. ``They think their own teaching at
home will be morally strong, and that they will be able to counter
whatever immoral things are happening in school. They're not always
successful, but this is their logic.''
