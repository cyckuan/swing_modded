<P>
   The technology of home schooling has provided business
opportunities on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy and Dan Kihlstadius, a Bloomington, Minn., couple with
seven home-schooled children, established an online computer
reselling business and software review publication catering to
Christian home schoolers in the early 1990s
(www.homecomputermarket.com).
</P>
<P>
   Their reselling business now averages about 100 orders a month,
with business from Appalachian hill families as well as affluent
home schoolers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their first computer guide was published in 1993 with only four
pages and was handed out free at home-schooling conventions. Today,
they charge $7 for their ``Home-schooler's Computer Guide,'' which
is more than 100 pages long and contains reviews of more than 300
educational software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Their annual catalog includes a section called ``100 Programs
You Should Not Buy'' and notes if a title features witchcraft,
magic or aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with aliens as long as they're not mean
or nasty, but some of our readers don't like software with
aliens,'' Mrs. Kihlstadius said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy and David Orth, a Cherry Valley, Mass., couple with six
home-schooled children, have built the gigantic, Homeschool
Publishing House(bravewc.com/hph), which produces the ``Homeschool
Seller'' catalogue. The Orths list home schoolers' used supplies in
the catalog at no charge, and when a sale is made, the home
schooler pays them 15 percent of the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays its own bills, but my husband certainly can't quit his
day job,'' Mrs. Orth said. Most of the items listed are
Christian-themed.
</P>
<P>
   Major educational publishers are eyeing the scene, but so far
few heavy hitters have embraced the home-schooling market. The
notable exception is Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. Vulcan
Northwest, his 12-year-old umbrella organization for his business
ventures, is backing a new online tutorial called APEX (Advance
Placement Excellence).
</P>
<P>
   APEX, an advanced-placement tutorial, is in its pilot phase
(www.apex.netu.com). The first course is advanced placement
calculus. This winter, the curriculum will be expanded to include
microeconomics and American government.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to add five more courses next year and five more
each each subsequent year. The courses have been designed in
cooperation with the College Board, which oversees advanced
placement classes _ college-level courses offered to high-school
students that can count toward college credits.
</P>
<P>
   The company's is aiming to attract business from both the
home-schooling and the institutional schooling markets. For $300
per semester, a student can tap into a library of 15-minute
teacher-narrated tutorials with multimedia animations of key
concepts; participate in bulletin board discussion sessions, and
complete both online and off-line homework.
</P>
<P>
   The activities go into a database and can be reviewed, critiqued
and ``debugged'' by the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus course involves more than 250 learning activities.
Between 30 and 40 students are taking it this fall, but as many as
150 could participate in the microeconomics and government courses.
