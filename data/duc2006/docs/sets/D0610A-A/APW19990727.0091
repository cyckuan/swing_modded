<HEADLINE> Bauer Wants Home-Schooler Vouchers </HEADLINE>

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Gary  
Bauer said Tuesday that school voucher proposals should be expanded 
to cover the cost to parents of educating their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer noted that most school voucher proposals provide funds for  
moving children to private schools or public schools outside the 
home district but don't include home schooling. ``The politicians 
didn't think very much about this particular alternative,'' he 
said. ``This is a legitimate choice and I want to make sure the 
playing field is level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal came as Bauer met with a group of parents who  
home-school their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher programs allow parents the freedom to take the education  
funding earmarked for their child and use it to pay the costs of 
attending a school other than their neighborhood public school. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the debate is over whether tax money for public school  
students should be used for tuition at private schools. Public 
school advocates say that undermines public education, but most 
conservatives favor that step. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer favors voucher programs for private schools, but expanded  
that Tuesday to include home schooling. He said parents could use 
the money for curriculum material, or to hire help in areas where 
they don't feel competent to teach. 
</P>
<P>
	Home-school advocates won a years-long legislative battle that  
allows them to teach their children at home. Many are religious 
conservatives unhappy with the public school curriculum and the 
lack of religious instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer is appealing to these conservatives in his bid for the  
Republican presidential nomination. He made it clear he would favor 
home schooling if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never allow the federal government to get into the  
business of regulating home schooling,'' said Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that there's some history of youngsters who are taught  
at home, and they measure up well against students taught in both 
private and public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the parents are engaged, the children are in pretty good  
shape,'' said Bauer. ``Those of you who are engaged in home 
schooling are doing something incredibly important for your 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Iowa law, parents do not have to be licensed teachers to  
home-school youngsters. They register youngsters with the local 
school district, which has staffers who will offer assistance and 
advice. The youngsters are tested periodically and can take part in 
some extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said advocates won that law by pressuring politicians, and  
demonstrated effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, politicians fear unemployment more than  
anything,'' he said.
