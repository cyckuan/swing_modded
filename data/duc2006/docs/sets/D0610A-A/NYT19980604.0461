   CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans teaching their own children has more
than tripled since the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the
natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower
children soon had strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian
fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and
moral education.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who
are dissatisfied with public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude
survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the
regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction
with the public schools was a more common answer than religious
preference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at
the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home
schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe,
effective public schools for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and
strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as
truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation
varies enormously.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly,
and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are
not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and
Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time
basis if they ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   In California, children can enroll in an independent study
program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school
administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected
to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their
concerns are so well-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, schools are financed according to the number of
pupils attending. ``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come
in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president
of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either. The
National Education Association handbook declares that ``home
schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive
education experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
</P>
<P>
   They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on
Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their
child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the
case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law
requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck
down as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every
congressional office within a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards
education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of
those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent
who approved.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had
fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep
into mainstream magazines. Amazon.com, the biggest Internet
bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on
average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school
peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that
the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap
grows.
</P>
<P>
   The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose
parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public
schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of
dullards.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over
the past two decades. ``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific.
They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the
senior admissions officer.
</P>
<P>
   Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name,
since many of its most successful students have taken some courses
in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a
mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not
do justice to the idea, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop
socially without ever going to school?
</P>
<P>
   Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children
and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at
home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of
other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated
herds.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled
applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The
exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately
withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
</P>
<P>
   One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow
at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota,
has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny
minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated. ``There are
some real haters,'' says Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for
bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have
already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and
other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in
the home-schooling shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their
children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon
the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they
are right.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the
whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is
time to bring some about. &QL;
