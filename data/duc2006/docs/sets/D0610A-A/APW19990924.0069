<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Like Home Schooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing home school movement commanded an  
audience Friday with five of the nine Republicans running for 
president, each proclaiming that if parents want to teach their 
children at home, the government should let them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view home schooling as something to be respected and  
something to be protected,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush told a 
conference of the Home School Legal Defense Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Respected for the energy and commitment of loving mothers and  
loving fathers. Protected -- protected -- from the interference of 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates, who appeared separately in the Daughters of the  
American Revolution auditorium, were unanimous in their salute of 
the movement's progress. An association-sponsored study last spring 
showed that home-schooled students, numbering an estimated 1.5 
million, score well above the national median on standardized tests 
and often study above their normal grade level. 
</P>
<P>
	``No parent in America should be forced to send their child to a  
lousy school. Period,'' said publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've shamed the regular school systems with what you've  
achieved. For those who have carped and criticized and said, 'What 
about socialization?' ... you look at some of our schools, you call 
that socialization?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, an undersecretary in President's Reagan's Education  
Department, promised, ``When I'm in the White House, you will have 
a reliable friend for home schooling sitting in the Oval Office.'' 
Home-schooling parents are ``on the front lines, the cutting edge 
of the education debate,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker's roster of presidential candidates, including  
Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, plus independent New 
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, was testimony to the potency of education 
in this campaign and the growing appeal of home schooling among 
religious and political conservatives disenchanted with public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the association was founded in 1983, when home schooling  
was not even legal in all 50 states as it is today, the number of 
children whose parents eschew schools for at-home lessons grew from 
a couple hundred to today's estimate of 1.5 million to 1.7 million, 
said HSLDA spokesman Richard Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
	During a musical slide show between political speakers and  
prayer offerings, the audience -- sprinkled with baby strollers and 
slouched children in play clothes -- burst into applause when the 
screen flashed Patrick Henry's immortal line, ``Give me liberty or 
give me death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farris, president of the Virginia-based association,  
said his 65,000-member families -- up from 29,000 in 1993 -- have 
just one message to Washington policymakers: ``Leave us alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered just a couple sentences on home schooling before  
launching into his standard stump speech. ``I know this might not 
be the proper forum for a political speech,'' Bush said. ``But I 
can't resist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He encouraged activism by his religious audience. ``The role of  
the president is to say to people of faith, 'You're welcome to help 
change America because changing hearts will change America for the 
better,''' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Childress, visiting from Kalona, Iowa, with her  
home-schooled son, sported a Keyes campaign button. But, after 
hearing Bush, she told a reporter: ``Maybe it won't be so bad if he 
is elected. I'm beginning to feel like I can more trust what he's 
saying.''
