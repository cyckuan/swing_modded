	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Kim Dunderdale doesn't have to worry about  
her kids running into violence at school -- they're at home, like 
thousands of others across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first decided to home school our oldest daughter, we  
didn't say we wanted to keep our children out of public school and 
away from all the horrible things that go on there,'' said 
Dunderdale, a Pittsburgh woman who teaches three of her five 
children, the oldest of whom is in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``But over the years, we are glad our children are shielded from  
those things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's shootings at a Littleton, Colo., high school that  
left 15 people dead reminded the more than 700,000 U.S. families 
that teach their children at home why they chose to take their 
children out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	Many abhor what they consider immorality, violence and peer  
pressure in the nation's school systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am trying to shelter them from negative influences, foul  
language, lack of respect for authority, lack of respect for 
themselves or others. It is those kinds of things that led to the 
Littleton thing,'' said Kurt Boese of Lodi, Calif., where he home 
schools his three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching children at home has gradually moved into the  
educational mainstream. Unlike 15 years ago, each state now 
recognizes the parental right to home school and all states have 
legislation or case law governing academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1.7 million children are taught at home across the  
country, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons given by parents are varied -- religious guidelines,  
the desire to spend more time with their kids, a better education, 
concern about morals taught at school. It is a burden, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home schooling your children because you fear violence and  
fear what will happen to them will not take you through the rough 
times,'' said Cindy McKeown, a mother of four from Middletown. ``It 
is a tremendous sacrifice of time, finances. You have to home 
school because you believe it is the best option for this child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And home schooling cannot prevent tragedy or keep kids from  
growing up, said Ruth Blount, who home schools her six children in 
Nantucket, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a risk with children. Something horrible could  
happen in our family even if we home school,'' Mrs. Blount said. 
``At a certain point, your kid's going to have to choose on their 
own. But when you home school, you have the time with them to plant 
those seeds more easily.''
