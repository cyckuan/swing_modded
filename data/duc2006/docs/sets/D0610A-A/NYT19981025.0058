 &HT;    State law allows home schoolers to play sports, music
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One problem with home schooling: There
are too many parts in the school play for one little family.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Kaemmerle Fitzpatrick must be a red-scarfed sailor
set sail for Roanoke Island, as well as an aproned lady expecting
the first English baby in the colony. She and her sister,
10-year-old Annika, the white-wigged captain, take off for the New
World on a lawn chair.
</P>
<P>
   But it's their mother, Freya Fitzpatrick, who thinks of herself
as the real pioneer in this suburban Lantana back yard. She has
taught her two girls at home for the past seven years _ before the
home-schooling magazines sold, the Orlando conventions opened, and
the trendy (and home-schooled) Hanson brothers inspired widespread
teen love.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzpatrick sisters are two of the 2,240 Palm Beach County
students who may sit barefoot at their kitchen desks this year,
while their parents put on teaching caps. Since 1994, their numbers
have tripled in Palm Beach County and nearly doubled statewide.
There were 31,440 Florida students home schooled last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, home-schooled students must register with
the district superintendent's office. State law also requires them
to keep a portfolio that can be shown to the superintendent on 15
days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly increasing numbers may be due, in part, to new state
laws. In 1996, home-schooled students were allowed to participate
in sports and music programs at high schools. And as of May 1997,
they may apply to two-year colleges with merely an affidavit signed
by their parent.
</P>
<P>
   The school district doesn't keep figures on how many
home-schooling students participate in public school activities or
enroll in high school classes, but a few do, said district
spokesman Nat Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   The home-schooling community here offers at least six support
groups from Boca Raton to Palm Beach Gardens. They meet weekly for
martial arts in Royal Palm Beach; they buy blocks of tickets for
Kravis Center events; and they hold their own spelling bees. There
are chess and stock market clubs, field trips to the Space Center
and SeaWorld, and special classes taught by parents: How to measure
temperature using a cricket.
</P>
<P>
   As the home-schooling community has grown, it has become more
diverse. It is not exclusively white or Christian anymore. And the
reasons parents are choosing it also are becoming more varied.
</P>
<P>
   When state specialist Mary Lou Carruthers started talking to
home-schooling parents three years ago, there were mainly two
reasons for their choice: They had wanted the little ones to learn
about Christ in the classroom, or they worried about drugs, knives
and guns. More and more, parents talk about the latter, the safety
issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, parents also talk about crowded classrooms
and they worry their children might not get their teacher's
attention, said Beth Kramer, local director of the Florida Parent
Educators Association, who has taught five children at home.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding to home school, Freya Fitzpatrick considered
Indian Pines Elementary, less than a mile from her home. But
administrators said no when she asked to spend a day in a
kindergarten class, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not willing to let me see school in action, I'm not
comfortable sending my daughter there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, who has a master's degree in education, taught five
years in public and private schools. When she first heard about
home schooling, she thought it was a terrible idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it just had to be one of the craziest things that
parents who weren't educators could think they could teach. It was
presumptuous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But out of desperation, she bought alphabet posters and
measuring cups, and then realized she'd have plenty of help. Her
father gives tennis lessons, her former Latin professor advises,
and other parents offer geology and Spanish classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the general contractor and I know how I want the house to
turn out. Not everybody wants to build a Christian child; they
might want a non-religious or Muslim child. That's the nice thing
about home schooling, you can choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For an educator like Fitzpatrick, it's an exciting opportunity.
She can build an entire human being as if she were painting a whole
picture, not just the corner, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their day starts at 8:15 a.m. with violin lessons. At 8:30,
Fitzpatrick and her girls kneel under a homemade time line that
notes both Moses and William Tell, and recite the Lord's Prayer.
They belong to the New Church _ the girls' father and grandfather
were missionaries _ which broke from the Methodists 200 years ago.
The church emphasizes independent thinking, Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick's schedule, which she plans months ahead, sets out
15 or 30-minute blocks for Russian, Swedish, Spanish and
traditional subjects like math and dictation. When they fall
minutes behind, she says, ``We're wasting time! And that's what
life is made of.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all home schoolers are so organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unschoolers,'' who believe learning should be naturally led by
the children, wouldn't have planned classes. They might spend a
week learning about bats, if their children felt like it, and go to
the zoo, build a bat house, and read bat books.
</P>
<P>
   During spring break, home-schooled students can take a
standardized test, or a certified teacher can gauge their progress
by looking at a student's portfolio at the end of the year. The
Florida Parent Educators Association encourages parents to find a
teacher who ``understands home-schooling philosophies.'' The
students only have to show appropriate progress for their age,
according to state law.
</P>
<P>
   The state has never been able to compare the achievement of
home-schooled students against public school students, as much as
they'd like to, Carruthers said. One national study shows the
average home schooler scores at the 73rd percentile on the Iowa
Test of Basic Skills. The national average is 50. Those results are
unreliable because the students in the study were selected by the
researcher, a home schooler himself, Carruthers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoons, Annika has chemistry _ she wants to live
on a Mars colony some day _ and she skips around the kitchen
wearing safety glasses. For an experiment on the atomic weight of
magnesium, the Fitzpatrick's gas stove must be a home-schooling
Bunsen (cq) burner.
</P>
<P>
   Annika would be a fifth-grader, if enrolled in public school,
but she works at a sixth-grade level, sometimes seventh- and
eighth-grade, her mother said. Socially, she may not be comfortable
with her peers in a public school unless they were gifted, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The girls do socialize. They take karate on Monday afternoons
with 30 other students and roller skate on Fridays. They belong to
a New Church youth group, a home-schooling aviation club and 4-H
Explorers Club. When neighbor kids stop by, Annika flops down on
the carpet with a board game and offers to teach the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need sixth grade, I've already done all their work and
some of the work I do is high-school work,'' Annika said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her sister work unsupervised for much of the day. Freya
Fitzpatrick wants them to learn responsibility, as well as their
spelling words. Kaemmerle still needs a little help.
</P>
<P>
   Each plastic block holds one flea, according to today's fanciful
lesson plan, but Kaemmerle has no idea how many fleas fit in her
seven-story hotel. (It has four rooms on each level.) She doesn't
remember yesterday's math equation _ volume equals height times
area _ and she doesn't want to admit it. So she cries at the dining
room table and snaps at her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't taught me,'' she accuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I haven't taught you, you don't remember,''
replies Freya Fitzpatrick. ``We've talked about this before, but
every so often you get confused, which is OK. It's why we're
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick has uncommon patience, but it breaks occasionally.
She is the only authority for her children for much of the day.
When they stop listening to her, it might be time for regular
school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls say never.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like home schooling. We can have some decision in what we
learn and she can focus on just us, not a whole class,'' Kaemmerle
said. ``She's our mother, we have her attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But their mother is clear-eyed about the whole adventure.
Someday her children might need lessons that she's unable to teach.
Someday her husband, an accountant at Office Depot, might not want
to shoulder the financial burden alone. But right now, she believes
there's no better education for her girls.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Kaemmerle figures it out _ yes, it's 28 fleas _ and
tosses the paper across the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy?'' the 9-year-old asks her mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' comes the reply.
