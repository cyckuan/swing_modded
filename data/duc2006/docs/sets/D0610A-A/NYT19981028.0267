<P>
   They are pioneers, in a way: the first wave of the modern
home-schooling movement, the first generation of children to be
taught primarily by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 years after states began legalizing home schooling in
earnest, these early graduates are starting to make their way in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some have found the transition challenging, especially when
trying to convince colleges and employers that home school is as
good as high school, or when trying to get used to working in
groups and socializing with peers. Others have had easy success,
building on talents nurtured in their home incubators and drawing
on a sense of competence fed by their teacher-parents' undivided
support.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these young adults have paved the way for the
increasing numbers of children coming after them. Following years
of court battles, home schooling is now legal in every state. While
there are no exact figures, estimates suggest that the number of
home-schooled children has jumped to anywhere between 500,000 and
1.5 million today, from 15,000 in 1970. Many, if not most, go to
college, and schools like Harvard and Yale now have policies for
evaluating their work. The Internet has vastly broadened the range
of home curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many mainstream educators remain wary _ about
socialization skills and about the potential inability of parents
to give their children the rigor and depth they need in all
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   There are two major trends in home schooling: one philosophy is
rooted in religious objections to the secularization of schools and
to teaching subjects like evolution; the other, the more free-form
philosophy called unschooling, initially embraced by families who
considered themselves part of the counterculture, encourages
independent expression and exposure to a broad menu of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, home schooling is appealing to more conventional
families, too _ parents who worry that their children are not
getting enough individual attention in school and are either
excelling faster than their classmates or need more help in certain
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Today home schooling can involve strong links to local schools:
consultations with teachers, playing on school sports teams, even
attending a class or two. Many states now require standardized
tests or portfolios of work for evaluation by state authorities or
certified teachers, mainstream benchmarks that were up to parents
to accept or reject in the earlier years of modern home schooling.
Still, some families have almost no dealings with schools and view
grading systems as inadequate or irrelevant to real learning. Other
parents take care to immerse their children in extracurricular
programs so they will meet children their own age. Still others
encourage individual activities, including internships and
volunteer work, which help make their children comfortable with
adults, but not always at ease with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   All of these decisions shape the way home-schoolers adjust to
the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Big Achievements, High Expectations &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other kids always asked Tad Heuer why he wasn't in school and if
he spent his days watching television. Sometimes in his hometown,
Holliston, Mass., west of Boston, he'd get stopped by a police
officer who would ``try to get me for truancy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Heuer, now a 20-year-old senior at Brown University, loved
being able to study American history and music without having to
switch subjects every 50 minutes. He also loved going on a
monthlong tour of Civil War battlefields and coal mines. ``I'm sure
there were points when I was just miserable and said, `How could my
parents do this to me?' '' he said, ``but I don't think there was
ever a time that I wanted to be in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of contemporary home-schoolers, Heuer
had an education that was constantly intertwined with the
conventional school system. His mother, a former elementary school
teacher who thought she could do better than the schools, made sure
he and his younger brother took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and
enlisted certified teachers to review her sons' work.
</P>
<P>
   Heuer took science classes at the high school, partly because,
he said, ``it's not easy to buy one frog in formaldehyde'' for home
study. In 11th grade, he took an English class. He had violin
lessons at the school, played on the basketball team and worked on
the school newspaper. These activities connected him with children
his age and with what they were learning.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he had to work hard to be accepted by the
world of mainstream education. When he decided that he wanted the
``credential'' of a high school diploma, the Superintendent of
Schools and the school committee were reluctant, suggesting he take
a year of college first or seek a high school equivalency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of inherent mistrust of someone who's been
home schooled _ `How do you know you did the same thing everybody
else did?' '' Heuer said. He persisted: he deserved a diploma
because of his strong links to the school and community, he said,
and the officials gave in.
</P>
<P>
   He had less trouble being embraced by the working world. At 15,
he spent a summer working for a Democratic Massachusetts State
Representative, Barbara Gardner, after she wrote him a letter
praising an article on term limits he'd written for a local
newspaper. Ms. Gardner said he seemed more well-rounded and mature
than others his age.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he worked for the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of
Mark Roosevelt, a Democrat, impressing the staff so much that he
was promoted from making copies to doing research on the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess would be home-schoolers would give you pause if they
seemed to be a person of average talent,'' said Michael Gritton,
Roosevelt's former communications director, now policy director for
a nonpartisan think tank, the Massachusetts Institute for a New
Commonwealth, where Heuer also worked after the Roosevelt campaign.
``You'd be thinking, `Who is this person? What have they done? What
do they know?' You'd think to yourself, `Are they, like, coming out
of a cult or something?' But he's so talented, you think, `Well,
geez, maybe this home-schooling thing is something to consider.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With a combined SAT score of 1290 (the national average is
1017), Heuer applied to nine colleges, improvising a 55-page
application that detailed the work he had done and included
exhibits _ a science paper on Canada geese, a tape of his viola
playing. The transcript his parents created was 30 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Heuer was rejected by Harvard and Yale but accepted by Johns
Hopkins, American University, Catholic University and Brown, where
he is pursuing a bachelor's degree in public policy and a master's
in political science. Last spring he won a $30,000 Harry S. Truman
Scholarship, one of 105 such awards given annually nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Heuer felt comfortable at college immediately, introducing
himself at orientation. ``No reason I was going to be any different
than anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His home-schooling background has made him interested in a
career involving education policy, trying to ``transfer the
schooling I got into the public schools,'' he said. But he's not
sure he'll end up home schooling his own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could save the world and home school my kids at the same
time,'' he said, ``no question I would home school my kids.'' But,
he added, ``Am I going to please everyone who's expecting me to go
off and do great things, be a high-powered lawyer or whatever? It's
weighing the advantages that we've received from home schooling,
and do we put that back into home schooling?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Now, a Drink or Two - and Evolution &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Julie Vickery's parents pulled her out of school in the
sixth grade, she was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was something they did in the 1800s,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vickery grew up in Central, S.C., near Greenville, and had
been one of the better students in her elementary school. She was
convinced that she was going to be a failure because she wasn't
going to regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, she explained, decided on home schooling primarily
for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were quite fundamentalist in their approach to
life,'' said Ms. Vickery, now 23. ``They thought the public schools
would brainwash the kids, not teach them how to read and write, but
teach them all this horrible liberal thought. They were concerned
about creationism versus evolutionism and the move away from the
phonics approach to reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious home schooling tends to be structured more like a
classroom setting, with the mother serving as teacher and using
religious materials to supplement more standard academic lessons.
Ms. Vickery's mother, a homemaker, tried that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two weeks,'' Ms. Vickery recalled, ``I said, `Mom, you
don't know anything. Let me do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Ms. Vickery was allowed to choose her own textbooks _
ones that approached history, science and art from a biblical
perspective _ and she became an indefatigable learner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a core curriculum based on scriptural principles,''
said Norma Vickery, Julie's mother. ``At the same time that we were
doing the academic study, we were also incorporating the biblical
principles that went with them.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Vickery's social world turned upside down. ``My
three or four best friends all told me, `My mommy and daddy don't
want me playing with you anymore,''' she said. ```They say your
parents are really strict.'''
</P>
<P>
   That hurt. But Ms. Vickery, who had also been teased at school
because she was a brainy, nonathletic child, said she soon had an
experience common to many home- schoolers: she began making friends
outside her age group. She asked the Clemson University professors
who lived in her neighborhood about geology or history. She played
piano at a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of missing out on socialization,'' Mrs. Vickery said,
``we probably were more selective in the kind of socialization she
was getting. Sometimes in the school situation, they can socialize
with the wrong kind of people, people with entirely different
values or no values, or just troublemakers and that sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To broaden her experiences, her father took her on a ride with a
truck driver, on a tour of an automobile factory and to see how a
newspaper worked. Going to the grocery store became a lesson in
math.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Vickery was 14, she had ``finished every high
school course that was recognized by the state of South Carolina,''
she said, and had taken the SAT's and scored a combined 1390. She
spent the next two years researching and writing papers, mining the
libraries of five nearby universities.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Ms. Vickery and her parents decided she would go to
college. ``You're not going to gain acceptance in the world if you
don't have the credential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She chose Northland Baptist Bible College, a small, religious
school in Dunbar, Wis. ``I think if I had gone to a larger
setting,'' Ms. Vickery said, ``I would have had more of a problem
getting adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, she felt more comfortable socializing with the staff
than the students. The hardest part was learning to ``work as part
of a team,'' she said. ``That was very difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In one course, for example, Ms. Vickery, who was majoring in
education, had to collaborate with other education students to
determine the best way to tutor a child. ``One person wanted to
complete the textbook,'' she said. ``One person wanted something
else; not all of those ideas could work. At the beginning I was
hesitant to express my ideas to others. I thought, `I haven't been
through the system; they have. I don't know how students are
supposed to learn, I just know how I learned.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Things improved as she became more comfortable. But she was
still hesitant to talk about her home-schooling experience. Her
faculty adviser did not find out until her sophomore year and, she
said, ``He just about choked. He said, `You couldn't have been home
schooled, you can read and write.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Ms. Vickery went to Korea to teach at a
private language institute affiliated with a church. Told she would
be teaching English-speaking high school and college students, she
was disappointed to find that her students were Korean-speaking
preschoolers. At the end of the year, she returned to this country
and formed a group called Teachers for Christ International, a
religiously based educational organization geared toward giving
young teachers more control over their educational careers
overseas. She plans to return to Korea but is spending this year
getting a master's degree in education at Bob Jones University, a
conservative Christian institution in Greenville, S.C., that
emphasizes religion.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that her home-schooling background can help her
teach effectively because she can see classroom problems from an
``outsider's perspective.'' But now she wants to learn the
insider's ropes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vickery said she is not as conservative as her parents. She
allows herself to wear pants in public, for example. She also
allows herself an occasional drink or two. And while she does not
believe in evolution, she would teach the theory as part of a
science class.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she has a group of friends her age and goes on
casual dates.
</P>
<P>
   She does not unequivocally recommend home schooling. She has
seen other home-schooled children who, at 10, cannot read and spend
their days running around outside, saying they are looking for bugs
for a science lesson. ``There are some kids who are so social, they
thrive on team sports,'' she said. ``You lose that if home
schooled.''
