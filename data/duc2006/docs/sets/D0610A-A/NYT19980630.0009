<P>
   My daughter isn't ready for kindergarten yet. Which is good,
because neither am I.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question _ public vs. private education _ quickly
breaks into myriad other questions, all crucial and all confusing.
As dissatisfaction with the state of American education grows, the
alternatives also grow, creating a plethora of hard-to-evaluate
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Public education has deep roots in our society. A vast empire
involving almost 50 million young people, 88,000 schools and
trillions of dollars, public schools long have been the social
balancing wheel of society, fostering diverse interests, dreams and
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Americans stood by public education through integration in the
1960s, the burgeoning magnet and alternative schools in the 1970s
and the draconian financial cuts of the 1980s. But attitudes have
shifted in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study titled ``Where Connoisseurs Send Their
Children to School,'' Denis Doyle, educational analyst and senior
fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, reported that urban
public-school teachers are more likely to send their children to
private schools. In Jersey City, N.J., 50.3 percent choose private
schools. In San Francisco, it's 36.7 percent, Cleveland is at 39.7
percent and Chicago at 36.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And let's not forget home schooling,'' Doyle says. ``It's the
fastest-growing trend in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda and Tommy Teepell of Baton Rouge, La., have home schooled
their four sons, now ages 23, 22, 17 and 14. The boys were in a
Christian school when the Teepells decided to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted more of our family values to be part of our
children's lives,'' she says. ``The boys participated in plenty of
outside activities, such as sports and the 4-H Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life simply turned into a big classroom,'' she adds. ``If we
went shopping, the boys calculated prices. Traveling was a rich
history lesson. The boys matured faster than their peers, and are
extremely independent young men.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1.2 million children are home schooled, according
to the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic schools, because of their affordability and diversity,
remain a leading private option for middle-class parents. And
parochial schools score high academically. Between 1993 and 1996,
parochial enrollment increased by almost 590,000, according to the
Washington-based National Catholic Educational Association.
</P>
<P>
   Private institutions are flourishing across the country. The
Hudson Institute says there are 28,000 private schools nationwide,
with 5.9 million children enrolled, and that private enrollment has
risen faster than public for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, private education is not everyone's favorite option.
Many parents and educators insist that public education is the
cornerstone of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is not just academics _ it's socialization, real
America with all its glory and depravity,'' says Michael Castleman,
a public-school advocate and an author who specializes in health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous commitment,'' adds Castleman, whose two
children survived a difficult search for a public school in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has 15 alternative sites and 59 regular elementary
schools. Castleman and his wife, Anne, along with several hundred
hopeful families, opted for an alternative program. The couple
investigated a dozen schools, keenly aware that their chance of
obtaining a spot in one of the city's five most sought-after
alternatives was slim.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has open enrollment, a process that offers a
modicum of choice: An application places the child's name in a
lottery. Only a handful of families get into their schools of
choice, but the lottery takes certain ZIP codes, a previously
enrolled sibling and ethnic balance into account.
</P>
<P>
   In their search, the Castlemans uncovered an alternative school
that many of their peers had overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco Community Alternative School sits in the middle
of San Francisco's working-class stew,'' Castleman says. ``It's
ethnically and economically diverse. It's not everybody's first
choice, due to location and no after-school care. We were delighted
to receive our letter of acceptance without having to contend with
the arduous appeal process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Gjedsted and her husband, Al, did not fare well in the
open-enrollment lottery. They also were reluctant to gamble on an
appeal, so they enrolled their two daughters in an ecclesiastical
girls' school. Within a year, however, they moved them to a
private, secular, coed school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric and the reality of the prestigious girls'
institution didn't match,'' Gjedsted says.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Gjedsteds' third child entered preschool,
tuition for three hovered around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hefty chunk of our salaries, but I can't quibble with
the education,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Educator Joe Nathan, director of the Center for School Change at
the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of
Public Affairs and author of ``Charter Schools: Creating Hope and
Opportunity in American Education'' (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996),
thinks public schools have failed to help many youngsters reach
their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who also co-founded the charter-school movement, says
the cards are stacked against children's being steered toward their
highest potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Achievement and accountability are not emphasized,'' he says.
``Schools receive no extra federal or state monies for parent
participation or high test scores _ many innovative educators feel
stifled.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan cites numerous examples throughout his book of teachers'
successes which have been marginalized, their ideas ignored or
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Nathan helped spearhead the Minnesota charter-school
movement, a reform in public education that has spread to 29
states.
</P>
<P>
   Charters are public schools in which teachers, parents and
community members work together to decide on educational programs
and curricula. As public schools, receiving tax money, they are
accountable to the state, as well as to the parents and the
community, for academic results. But they operate independently of
most district and state regulations, cutting through bureaucratic
red tape that may hinder other public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Not every parent feels the need for such innovations as charter
schools, open enrollment or lotteries. Lloyd and Lori Thacker of
Portland, Ore., sent their elder son, Jacob, to a suburban
neighborhood school. They feel lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a perfect school, but Jacob received a solid
education,'' says Lloyd Thacker, who himself is a counselor at a
Jesuit-run private high school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lori Thacker admits she wonders if 5-year-old Sam will get
the same education as his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel burdened by recent local tax attitudes,'' she says.
``People don't understand the relationship between the polls and
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Portland followed a growing trend: Like one in four
local districts nationwide, its voters rejected higher property
taxes _ a boost for property owners, but a blow for schools, which
are funded by federal money and local property taxes. Fiscal cuts
often mean fewer enrichment programs and more leaky roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The educational schism isn't likely to disappear anytime soon.
More choice, not less, is the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   These dichotomies have taught me to prioritize and become
proactive in my search. I've learned to compare schools and family
needs, to look into after-school programs, computers, art,
libraries, physical education and more. I've become accustomed to
asking questions, talking to principals and networking with other
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, the process isn't simple. Even with the amount of
data I've uncovered, I'm still not sure which route _ public or
private _ my daughter will take when she starts school.
