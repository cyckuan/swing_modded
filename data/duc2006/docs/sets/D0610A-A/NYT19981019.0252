WE ALL HAVE AN INTEREST IN HOW OTHERS ARE EDUCATED

   America must never give up on public education. The surest
predictor of any nation's future is the priority it gives to
educating its young. Nations, like families, express their
priorities in the things for which they're willing to spend their
money. Excellence in education can be expensive, Lloyd Bentsen once
remarked, ``but not half as expensive as ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the policy disagreements that kept Congress and the
president at loggerheads for months this year was whether to budget
$1.1 billion to help states hire 100,000 more classroom teachers
and thus reduce the widespread overcrowding that handicaps
learning.
</P>
<P>
   The item was finally accepted. But other goals, like
computerizing every classroom, making sure every child reads by the
third grade, and making two years of junior college as standard as
a high school diploma went unfunded. Legislators who assent without
murmur to annual military budgets approaching $300 billion and
multibillion-dollar highway bills seem pickier when it comes to the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some hark back to pre-World War II days, when federal monies
played practically no part in educating America's children. States
and school districts had virtually the entire responsibility.
Glaring disparities were widespread. Massachusetts, for example,
apportioned eight times as much for each of its students annually
as did Mississippi. For low- to medium-income families throughout
America, the quality of educational opportunity became an accident
of geography.
</P>
<P>
   Then modern war taught us that the general level of learning was
as essential to our national survival as the quality of our arms.
By President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, it became a matter
of national pride to ensure the humblest American child a
birthright to a first-class education.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every American profited in some way from the GI Bill
of Rights that sprang from World War II. It may have been history's
most massive transfusion of money into education. That program paid
rich dividends to the nation. The percent of America's youth
finishing four years of college increased in one generation from
4.5 percent to 21.5 percent. America boomed economically and
bloomed intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   As a financial investment, the GI Bill paid for itself at least
40 times over. Because college graduates earn more, they've paid
more taxes. As a direct result of America's enhanced earning power,
the coffers of the U.S. Treasury have been enriched enormously. And
every one of us is a beneficiary of the discoveries, inventions and
technologies flowing from the fountains of knowledge that bold
experiment unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviets beat us into space in 1957 with Sputnik, it
shocked us into the sudden realization that we'd neglected
scientific studies. Uncomfortably apprehensive at being behind, we
launched our massive space effort, which ultimately overtook and
surpassed that of the Soviets. With a sense of national survival at
stake, Democratic and Republican members of Congress submerged
their differences and joined hands, not quarreling over credit.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy now bursting upon the scene must convince us
that our quality of life depends more than ever upon a high level
of education, broadly shared. A handful of geniuses won't suffice.
The widespread diffusion of knowledge and modern job skills among
ordinary Americans will be our surest salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Some haven't yet comprehended the truth that it matters to all
of us how the rest of us are educated. Here in Texas, some
residents of affluent neighborhoods appear to resent the state law
that shares a part of their property taxes with our state's
impoverished school districts. A few school boards have sought ways
to circumvent that law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some critics are almost ready to give up on the
public schools. Conscientious parents, eager to have the best for
their children, increasingly resort to home schooling. Both
national and state legislators, looking for an easy fix, want to
abdicate the responsibility of providing excellence in public
education. They'd prefer to offer vouchers, subsidizing private
schools while further draining public school systems, relegating
them to second-rate status.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to admire in parents who are willing to oversee
their children's education personally on a daily basis. Parental
guidance is vital. It takes patience and perseverance to teach
one's own child, at home, all those things that an enlightened
educational curriculum requires. My hat is off to those who try.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, however, daily home schooling would present
insurmountable problems. The vast majority of parents today
couldn't manage that. The average American family now has two
bread-earners, not one. What comforts will they sacrifice so that
one can be at home all day, every day, teaching the children all
the good things they'd otherwise learn in school?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I believe that a vital part of the learning comes from
the mixing. A broad education cannot be administered in a vacuum.
For most children, the elementary grades have been our most
important introduction to the wide world of other people. And in
this increasingly global environment, nobody and no nation can
survive indefinitely within a protective shell.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I do not rue the property taxes we pay on our
residence to the Crowley school district, or resent any portion
that may end up helping children in El Paso or the Rio Grande
Valley. It could tap some wellspring of undiscovered genius from
whose works mankind will benefit. What better use of money could
there be?
