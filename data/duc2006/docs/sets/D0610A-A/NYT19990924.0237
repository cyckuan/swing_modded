   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas faced an audience of
more than 1,600 home schoolers Friday, offering encouragement but
stopping short of supporting tax credits or vouchers for parents
who choose to bypass public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we think home schooling is something to respected
and something to be protected,'' the Republican presidential
front-runner told the first national meeting of the Virginia-based
Home School Legal Defense Association. ``Respecting the energy and
commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers. Protecting them
from the interference of government.''
</P>
<P>
   That line got rousing applause from the audience, many of whose
members are fearful that any government help might come with
strings, such as testing and curriculum requirements. The
association supports tax credits, but not vouchers, said Michael
Smith, the group's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing Bush could say about home schooling is
``nothing,'' said Bob Mann, 42, of New Jersey, who home-schools his
five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of New Jersey has no laws regarding home schooling,
and I would like to keep it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's home schooling message met with applause Friday, but he
has departed from conservatives on key education points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he proposed a limited program of vouchers _
giving parents tax money for educational choices other than public
schools _ that some Republicans said doesn't go far enough. And he
has proposed placing the federal Head Start program under the U.S.
Department of Education, expanding a federal agency that is
anathema to many conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush delivered a variation of his stump speech
designed neither to alienate nor appease an audience unsure about
whether his ``compassionate conservative'' message is conservative
enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group of people who have rejected the educational
system as it is,'' an unconvinced Mann said afterwards. ``All he
did was uphold ideals of government sponsored education. ... He's
trying to be all things to all people. ``
