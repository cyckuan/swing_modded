<HEADLINE> Vt. Home-Schooling Mom Freed </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- A home-schooling mother was released from  
jail Tuesday after spending nearly two weeks behind bars in a 
dispute with public school officials over her son's special 
education needs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case closely watched by advocates of school choice, Karen  
Maple was set free by the judge who had jailed her on contempt 
charges on Sept. 1. She had refused to follow an order to take her 
15-year-old son, Trevor, to Vermont's child protection agency so 
his education needs could be evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	In setting Ms. Maple free, Judge Michael Kupersmith threatened  
to fine her $100 a day if she doesn't take Trevor to the agency on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maple said she didn't know where her son was, although she  
believed he was staying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want my son locked up and treated the way I've been  
treated for the last two weeks,'' the 36-year-old single mother 
said, weeping, after the hearing. ``He's now considered a fugitive 
and he's just a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Young, the commissioner of the child welfare agency,  
said officials had no intentions of locking up Trevor. ``Many of 
the children in our custody are at home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has drawn wide attention and sympathy for Ms. Maple.  
About 30 people demonstrated in her support outside the courthouse 
Tuesday and then lined the spectators' gallery during her hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial last Friday in The Wall Street Journal said cases  
like Ms. Maple's extend ``beyond the issue of home schooling to the 
fundamental rights of families to raise their children the way they 
see fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont parents are allowed to school their children at home but  
must submit an annual report to the state Department of Education 
describing the academic program. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Maple and her local school district in Bakersfield were  
unable to agree on an education plan for Trevor, and administrators 
decided Trevor needed special education services because he was 
behind on reading and other language skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maple says her son loves science, is a whiz at math and that  
they're working on his language skills. She said she's agreed to 
have a tutor brought in to help Trevor with language skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maple has said she resented school officials' intrusion into  
her family's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Kupersmith granted Ms. Maple's release Tuesday on a motion by  
the state Department of Corrections, which argued that the state 
needs its scarce jail beds for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is supposed to be about the best interests of the  
child,'' the judge said. ``While Ms. Maple is incarcerated, all of 
T.M.'s (Trevor Maple's) interests are being ignored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupersmith also acknowledged that continuing Maple's  
incarceration ``is not likely to ensure the appearance of her 
son.''
