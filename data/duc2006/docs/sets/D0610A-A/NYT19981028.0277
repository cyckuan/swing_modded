   After bouncing in and out of so many schools in Europe, Africa
and the United States that he can't remember all their names,
Simone Liverani found himself in Kolokani, a town in Mali, the west
African country where his mother worked for a company drilling
water wells. There was no diplomatic or international school
anywhere nearby, so he tried a local high school.
</P>
<P>
   Liverani, an Italian who also speaks English and understands
some French, had been told classes would be taught in French, but
most teachers spoke Bambara, the native language. ``This was the
last straw,'' he said. ``It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   An official at the United States consulate suggested the
Independent Study High School, based at the University of Nebraska
in Lincoln. Founded in 1929 as a correspondence program to educate
rural Nebraskans, the school has one of only a few fully accredited
distance-education programs offering high school diplomas; other
well-known programs include the North Dakota Division of
Independent Study in Fargo and Texas Tech University Distance
Learning in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   They offer an option for the children of diplomats and
missionaries, or those who can't or don't want to go to a
schoolhouse every day. Among young athletes and actors who have
studied through Nebraska are Michelle Kwan, the Olympic silver
medalist, and Lisa Bonet, a star of ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   While most students take courses to fill gaps in their school
records, some 3,400 students have received diplomas from Nebraska
since 1968. With the emergence of home schooling as a viable choice
for teen-agers, enrollment has increased almost 50 percent in the
last decade, according to James Schiefelbein, the Nebraska school's
principal. Today there are some 5,000 students at any given time,
representing more than 130 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the new wave in distance education, the school has begun
offering on-line courses and is developing a complete on-line,
four-year curriculum with the help of a $15 million grant from the
federal Department of Education. For now, students must take a mix
of Web and correspondence courses to meet diploma requirements,
which are 40 courses, or 200 course hours.
</P>
<P>
   A course can be completed in as little as five weeks of
intensive study, or stretched out for as long as a year.
Assignments are submitted by mail, fax or e-mail to 9 permanent
teachers, who grade them with help from 10 to 15 part-timers. When
written examinations are required, a proctor approved by the school
administers the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids do very, very well post- secondary,'' Schiefelbein
said. ``They are not dependent on somebody to tell them what to do
and when, so they have a little bit of an advantage on their peers
because they have become more self-disciplined workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The school designed a program for Liverani, now 28, that allowed
him to finish his diploma requirements in a year and a half. From
his remote home, he sent assignments by mail, and they were graded
and returned that way. ``They managed to make you feel that you
were part of a school,'' said Liverani, who worked this past summer
in New York City as an intern at The Economist and is hoping for a
journalism job in Europe. ``I sent in a lot of material, and it
would be corrected. They would write a lot. That was important
because it was a continuous relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Rizzuto, of Omaha, an Independent Study graduate,
remembers getting a big box of experiments in the mail for physical
science class. ``It's kind of funny, because you are in the kitchen
with a bunsen burner and you have to do all these experiments by
yourself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rizzuto, worried that attending a traditional school until 3
p.m. would derail her career, had convinced her parents to let her
take correspondence courses so she could sing in a folk-pop group
with her three older sisters.
</P>
<P>
   She studied from 8 a.m. to noon for four years, spending
afternoons practicing or touring the county and state fair circuit.
In May her group, Mulberry Lane, named for the street the sisters
grew up on, released a debut CD, ``Don't Cry _ Til You Get to the
Car,'' which they recorded themselves in their home studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to be self-motivated,'' said Ms. Rizzuto, now 22.
``In correspondence school, every textbook you get, you have to
finish the whole thing. You read every page of the book.''
