   BOSTON _ When naming their three black boys, Michelle and Alan
Shaw chose words that would underscore treasured roots and
religion: Chinua, Nigerian for God's own blessing; Yesuto, Ghanaian
for belongs to Jesus; and Obasi, Nigerian for in honor of God.
</P>
<P>
   So, when it came to selecting the best school for their boys,
the Dorchester couple _ she an attorney with a Harvard law degree,
he a computer expert with a master's and doctorate from MIT _ took
the same care.
</P>
<P>
   Home, they decided, was the best place to teach their children
strong academics, religious values, and instill their own sense of
ethnic pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For black people in this country, there is a need for not
letting our kids forget their history,'' saidAlan Shaw, whose sons
are 3, 6, and 7. ``We shouldn't look to something that's been
designed by the state as a way for us to teach our kids about their
past and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a desire to rescue their children from academic
failure and neglect at the hands of overburdened public schools and
determined to weave tight-knit families, more African-Americans and
other minorities nationwide are deciding that when it comes to
school, there's no place like home.
</P>
<P>
   This, even as they are accused of abandoning the very public
school system that for decades minorities who fought to overcome
separate and unequal education have been told is the ticket up and
out of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them have recognized that academically the public
school system has not saved them,'' said Brian Ray, president of
the National Home Education Research Institute, a nonprofit based
in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no concrete figures, anecdotally, experts say
there is a growing diversity in homeschooling. Single parents are
venturing into it, and it is proving to be a sanctuary for many
interracial couples. In the past, homeschooling has been a choice
made mostly by white, middle-income families who could afford
setting themselves apart from the traditional educational system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeschooling has now become so prevalent that it has gotten
to the point where it is not seen as wacky or nutty,'' Ray said.
``So it makes it easier for minorities to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that there about 1.3 to 1.7 million K-12
homeschooled children nationwide, about 1 percent of those black
and a lesser percentage Hispanic. ``I think over the next five
years, you're going to see real growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion and growth in use of the Internet also has
meant plenty of inexpensive resources for homeschoolers, easing
some socioeconomic barriers. A book written in 1996, ``Freedom
Challenge: African American Homeschoolers,'' even features essays
by 15 families that serve as a road map.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in homeschooling is growing so much that Joyce and
Eric Burges of Baker, La., are creating a national networking group
that encourages African-Americans to homeschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I want to put a beacon of light out there that
says this is an option, this is a choice you have,'' said Joyce
Burges, an executive secretary who homeschools three children.
Missy and Rick Parker, who have been homeschooling for 16 years,
created a similar group in 1994 in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of commitment,'' said Missy Parker, a Southern
Baptist who homeschools to teach religious values. She estimates
that at least 200 African-American families in Detroit are
homeschooling. ``Most African-Americans wouldn't venture to do it
because they didn't feel they were equipped. But, that's what the
support group is for, so you don't have to do it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeschooling, however, doesn't come without challenges or
criticisms as any family, black or white, knows. These include fear
of the unknown, lack of support from relatives and friends,
financial belt-tightening and questions about the legitimacy of
homeschooling.
</P>
<P>
   And for African-Americans the accusation of black flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that we take away from the public schools, especially
in the cities has a detrimental effect,'' said Steven C. Leonard,
headmaster of the Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester. ``I
would much rather have minority parents, black parents, all
parents, fight to strengthen the public shcool systems because like
it or not that's where the bulk of the students who compose our
future will be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Other African-American educators believe students lose something
when parents chose to school at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great benefits of public schooling is that we teach
people, children how to both ask for help from others as well as to
give help to others who need it,'' said Charles Willie, a Harvard
professor emeritus and one of the designers of Boston public
school's controlled-choice assignment plan. ``These are valuable
learnings that are difficult to replace in an isolated learning
environment''
</P>
<P>
   Still, minorities are choosing to homeschool for reasons as
diverse as the ways in which they are teaching their children.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the Shaws, say the public school system is failing
African-American children, who often end up at the bottom of
achievement assessments. Results by race on the 1999 Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System showed black and Latino students
behind whites in every category for every grade.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Shaws point to a 1997 study by Ray and the Home
School Legal Defense Association showing less of a disparity
between achievement rates in math and reading among minority and
white homeschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lamenting the loss of close-knit black communities,
some parents say homeschooling allows them to fortify their
children in nuturing environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This early stage is critical to establishing what is
important, what we believe in,'' said Alan Shaw, a computer
consultant who works from home.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Kevin Brooks, a divorced father in Arlington, say
they are homeschooling to compensate for school systems that allow
too many children to fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a researcher for Motorola, pulled his 14-year-old son
Kristoff out of public school in February when he found he was
spending hours trying to help his son through course work the youth
should have already mastered. This year, Brooks also plans to
homeschool Kristoff's twin sister.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a network of friends, black and white, to help teach
Kristoff. ``One of my challenges, and it will increase, is feeling
comfortable having someone who isn't black talk to my kids about
issues of race one-on-one,'' said Brooks, who shares custody with
his formerwife.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent homeschooling session, one of Brook's white
friends and Kristoff had a complex conversation on how black people
are sometimes portrayed negatively in cartoons. It taught Brooks a
lesson: ``When you are learning from the world, outside the
classroom system, you are exposed to more things,'' he said. ``So
talking about stuff is a lot more important now.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment that Beverley Foreman, a Jamaica native, set
foot in this country in 1976, she had trouble with traditional
schools. It started with her youngest son, who at 5 was already at
a second-grade level, able to read and write in cursive. Here, he
was placed in kindergarten and put in a corner to play with blocks,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became so distracted and disinterested in school,'' she
said, and watched as he was bused out of his community to a school
with special needs students, and told her son might have attention
deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually graduated high school, but after that Foreman
pulled her other children out of public schools. The Maynard mother
of four boys was ``terrified'' when she began homeschooling seven
years ago, but she got over her fear and is still homeschooling her
youngest son using libraries and museums as classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The teachable moments, insist the families, proves it is worth
it over and over again. The Shaws, for example, were there when one
son assumed God was white. They told him God has no color but
people generally project on Him an image with which they identify.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was their parents' choice, some minority homeschool
children also applaud the move.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Burges, 15, values the one-on-one attention. ``If I were
in school now, the average teacher has to teach about 30 kids in
one classroom. With my mom, it's only three,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And self-esteem, Burges said, is nurtured at home. ``Sometimes
African-American students are underestimated in school and they are
teased and people really don't know who they really are,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Shaw, who attended public schools, says he never envisioned
homeschooling his children. But, back in college he was one to go
against the grain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been hoping there would be some alternative to
mainstream life,'' Shaw said. He found it at home.
