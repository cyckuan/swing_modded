	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus  
told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and 
take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software 
providers, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a  
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was  
mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on 
his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer 
meltdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's  
initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to 
study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, 
the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of  
computer engineering at the Institute of Technology. Chen has since 
graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering  
college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when 
downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the 
police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid  
detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool 
of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus 
programs that proved useless,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact. He  
regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26,  
the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to 
erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system 
settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer  
viruses can face up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Chen will be charged. Computer  
experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to 
spread the virus. But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking 
millions of dollars of damage compensation.
