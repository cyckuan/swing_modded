   We are entering the plague years of computer viruses. In recent
weeks a number of new, malicious and destructive viruses have been
detected on the Internet and in the networks of several large
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the director of the FBI's National Infrastructure
Protection Center, Michael A. Vatis, said the agency was on alert
for a possible flurry of computer attacks, including viruses, timed
to coincide with the already difficult year 2000 transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural to expect there might be people doing stupid
things with computers,'' Vatis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team at
Carnegie Mellon University, a project that receives part of its
financing from the Department of Defense, said: ``We are
anticipating a lot of date-triggered viruses because of Jan. 1.
This is really a time to be diligent'' in following standard
antivirus procedures, Ms. Fithen said, ``but it's not a time for
panic.'' The team maintains a computer security Web page at
www.cert.org/y2kinfo.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the newer threats, including viruses called Prilissa
and Mypics, are scheduled to do their nastiest work in coming
weeks, in Prilissa's case when someone opens an infected e-mail
attachment on Christmas Day, and when Mypics detects the computer's
clock changing to 2000. Other viruses are expected to emerge in
coming weeks as their twisted creators try to capitalize on
Y2K-related confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these viruses can reformat your hard disk drive,
permanently erasing all the files on it. Some can mail themselves
to your friends and associates by commandeering your e-mail address
book. There is even one that can alter your system and notify the
hacker via e-mail when your computer is vulnerable to further
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So, it is time for a refresher on viruses and the simple,
prudent precautions you can take to minimize the chances of your
computer becoming infected. Although the risk of receiving a virus
is relatively small for home computer users, there is a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are frightening to many novice computer users in part
because they are relatively rare and not well understood. (Viruses
are also frightening to many experienced computer users who
understand viruses all too well, not because they are particularly
dangerous, but rather because they are a major pain to deal with.)
There is no need to panic. There are plenty of unavoidable
annoyances that come with computers these days, so it seems a shame
to waste more time and energy on viruses and worms, which are so
easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have no reason to believe their systems have been
infected: 1. Back up (make copies of) all your important files.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get in the habit of making regular backups.
</P>
<P>
   3. Get an anti-virus program and use it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Update the program frequently by downloading new virus
signature files from the software maker's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   People who suspect their computer may be infected should start
with steps 3 and 4, make sure their systems are virus-free, and
then do steps 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a surge in virus hoaxes in coming weeks, many
of the world's anti-virus software makers are offering fully
functional, 90-day trial versions of their programs, including free
updates, until Dec. 31. The Microsoft Corp. has assembled links to
these free programs on a Web page at
www.microsoft.com/y2k/antivirus/antivirus.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Many new computers come from the factory loaded with an
anti-virus program, so you may not need to buy one. But whether the
program comes already installed or from a store shelf, it should be
updated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, several significant viruses and worms have
been detected for the first time, including Prilissa, Babylonia and
Worm.Explore.Zip(pack), alias the MiniZip worm, which is
particularly nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Many people install an anti-virus program and assume,
erroneously, that they are safe from future infection. This is like
installing smoke detectors in your home and then never changing the
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   I use Symantec's Norton Antivirus for both my Windows and
Macintosh computers. (While early disk-based viruses typically
targeted one type of computer or another, newer e-mail-based
viruses attack different kinds of computers impartially.) Norton
Antivirus 2000 version 6.0 for Windows costs $39.95 and the
Macintosh version 6.0 is $69.95; they can be downloaded from
Symantec's Web site (www.symantec.com). Another highly regarded
anti-virus program for is McAfee's VirusScan 4.0, which costs
$29.95 and is available at www.mcafee.com/centers/anti-virus/).
</P>
<P>
   The most prevalent villains on the virus scene are so-called
macro viruses, which typically arrive in e-mail attachments. Virus
writers seem to be particularly fond of Microsoft products,
including Windows, Word, Outlook and Outlook Express, so users of
those programs should be especially vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   In general, simply reading an e-mail message will not infect
your computer, even if the subject line of the message says,
``There is a mean, ugly, nasty virus hidden in this message.''
</P>
<P>
   The real danger is in opening file attachments that come
appended to e-mail messages. You should never, ever, under any
circumstances, open an attached file unless you are absolutely sure
you know from whom it comes, what it does and that the person who
sent it intended to send it to you.
</P>
<P>
   If the attachment contains one of these macro viruses, opening
the file can cause the infection. If there is any doubt whatsoever
about the nature of the attachment, just dump it in the trash. Then
empty the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Second, turn off the functions in your computer that open
so-called macro applications automatically. Your software manual
will tell you how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the newer viruses arrive as e-mail attachments,
viruses can come from any number of sources, including commercial,
shrink-wrapped software. It is prudent to check all new software
before installing it. It is annoying, but not nearly as annoying as
losing files and rebuilding a hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   There. That wasn't so hard.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Now, copy this article and send it immediately to the first 50
people in your address book, and tell them all to do the same. If
it reaches two million people by Jan. 1, Bill Gates will send
$1,000 and free tickets to Disneyland to everyone on the forwarding
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Stop! This is a hoax, and it is one of the most common stupid
things people do with computers. Gates is one of the most generous
philanthropists of our time, but he does not pay people to clog the
Internet with inane e-mail messages that replicate like computer
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   As a home computer user you are far more likely to be the
recipient of a virus hoax than you are to be the recipient of a
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The typical hoax letter says that there is a new and
particularly nasty virus on the loose, confirmed by (insert the
name of some completely irrelevant organization like the Federal
Communications Commission), and that if you open an e-mail message
with a certain subject line, a virus will delete all the files on
your hard drive. In almost all cases, the hoax letter will urge the
recipient to pass this important message along to as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't do it. Instead, go to the Internet site
ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html, which lists the most common
hoaxes in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that computers can do weird things and mess up
your files without the aid of a virus. I have a friend who
immediately suspects computer viruses whenever the printer stops
working or her system crashes. As far as I can tell, the only thing
that is infecting her computer is Windows 98.
