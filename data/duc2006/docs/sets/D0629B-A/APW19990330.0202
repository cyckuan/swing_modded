<HEADLINE> 'Melissa' Computer Virus Mutating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several mutations of the fast-moving computer  
virus called Melissa surfaced in cyberspace Tuesday, but 
researchers said none seems to be as effective as the original in 
clogging e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, an executive of a small software company in  
Cambridge, Mass., said he had found clues linking the virus to a 
still-unidentified writer who uses the computer handle 
``VicodinES''. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, a firm that makes  
operating systems and software tools, said he thinks the virus 
writer distributed it using an account stolen from America Online 
15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa showed up Friday and spread rapidly around the world on  
Monday like a malicious chain letter, causing affected computers to 
fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues and 
swamping e-mail systems. While there have been no reports of 
permanent damage from the virus, it disrupted the operations of 
thousands of companies and government agencies whose employees were 
temporarily unable to communicate by e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus arrives to its victims disguised as an e-mail from a  
friend, with a note in the subject line saying that an important 
document is attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The attachment is a document in Microsoft's Word format that  
lists Internet pornography sites. Once the user opens that file, 
the virus digs into the user's address book and sends infected 
documents to the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the variations that appeared Tuesday -- carrying the name  
Melissa.A -- leaves the subject line blank, a change that can foil 
electronic filters that are designed to detect and delete the 
original message, said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing 
for Trend Micro Inc., an anti-virus company in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Another variant, ``Papa,'' appeared Monday afternoon. It  
attaches a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document which, when opened, 
sends out 60 e-mails, however Papa has bugs that sometimes prevent 
it from working. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our analysis we don't feel it's anywhere near the threat  
that Melissa is,'' said Steve Trilling, a director of research at 
Symantec, a maker of virus detection software. 
</P>
<P>
	A third virus, called ``Mad Cow Joke'' has also appeared,  
Schrader said, and works like Melissa, sending itself to 20 people 
in the victim's e-mail address book. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of all the variants is that virus writers will find  
them on the Internet, correct the bugs and distribute them further. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the amateur cybersleuth who has apparently gotten close  
to finding the author, is the same man who a month ago revealed 
that the popular Microsoft Office software applications place a 
secret serial number in documents that can be used to identify a 
particular computer user. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith theorized that this ``digital fingerprint'' might be  
useful in finding the author of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith posted this theory on an Internet discussion group Friday  
and received an e-mail from a Stockholm University student, who 
pointed out similarities between the work of a known virus writer 
who used the computer name VicodinES and Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also discovered that in December 1997, the same America  
Online account that sent out Melissa had posted a similar virus. 
Smith found digital fingerprints linking the virus writer called 
VicodinES to that virus. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed reporters to call the owner of the VicodinES Web  
site, who have since told him they may have actually talked to 
VicodinES and who described him as a teenage boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith passed his information onto the FBI, which has declined to  
comment, although it is investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
	VicodinES also is the name of a narcotic painkiller made by  
Knoll Laboratories. At company headquarters in Mount Olive, N.J., 
spokeswoman Linda Mayer said Tuesday that all she knows about 
Melissa is what she's read in newspapers.
