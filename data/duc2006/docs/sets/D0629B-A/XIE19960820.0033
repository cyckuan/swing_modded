JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The highly destructive
Hare KRSNA computer virus is poised to strike on August 22, said
sources obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
According to South Africa's Computer Virus Helpline
Co-ordinator Ian Melamed, Hare KRSNA is at present the most
widely reported computer virus in the country and could wipe out
all information stored on the hard drives of infected computers
on that date.
</P>
<P>
The European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus has warned
earlier that the virus was spreading world-wide through the
internet.
</P>
<P>
The warning also mentioned specifically infected files on the
Internet News Groups Alt.Sex.
</P>
<P>
Technically, the Hare KRSNA Virus is a multi-partite, stealth,
slow polymorphic virus which makes it particularly destructive,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The helpline is offering a free, 24-hour advisory service
countrywide for the detection and removal programme of the
virus, the local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The disk from the helpline would detect and remove more than
9400 other computer viruses.
