	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that can erase a computer's hard-drive  
and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on 
Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection, and several companies are offering free 
inoculation tools on their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl because its most common  
version was programmed to activate on computers using Windows 95 
and Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the nuclear 
disaster in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Another, less common, version, strikes computers on the 26th day  
of any month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much just another virus. It's been around for  
quite a while,'' said Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer 
Emergency Response Team, or CERT, at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh. ``As long as people stay current with their antivirus 
software, they should be in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The viruses, believed to originate in Taiwan, attempt to erase a  
computer's hard-drive and write gibberish to the computer's system 
settings, called its Bios, preventing the machine from being 
restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	But warnings from many experts lacked any sense of panic or  
impending doom because the virus was discovered last summer, giving 
antivirus companies many months to develop free software updates to 
identify and destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of those products will be protected only if they've  
retrieved the free updates. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Associates Inc., for example, said its popular McAfee  
software recognized Chernobyl as early as June 1998, and Symantec 
Corp. said its Norton Antivirus program identified Chernobyl before 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT issued a warning this week about the virus because of  
questions from computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting requests for information about it rather than  
reports of machines infected with it,'' Fithen said. ``This has 
been around so long that the antivirus vendors have picked this 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the recent ``Melissa'' scare, which automatically  
propagated via e-mail, this virus doesn't spread as quickly because 
it requires a person to launch an infected program file to 
contaminate a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec's Antivirus  
Research Center, said one big risk stems from a potential infection 
on a company's computer network, which could then spread to 
individual computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets on a corporate network and the volumes are not  
protected, it could spread very, very rapidly,'' Nachenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Hodges, a vice president for security at Network  
Associates, said the company was hoping for the best but bracing 
for the worse. ``It can be fairly significant,'' he said. ``You 
don't know until the bomb actually goes off.''
