<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Urged to Pass Anti-Cyber Crime Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government asked the
congress Tuesday to pass a law that would impose stiff penalties
on cyber crimes following a delay in the arrest of the suspected
creators of the "love bug" computer virus.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora underscored this need in a
radio interview as he pointed out that the "Iloveyou" virus, which
was allegedly launched in the Philippines, caused much damage not
just here but around the world.
</P>
<P>
Zamora quoted reports as saying the computer virus, which was
allegedly created by a Philippine couple using Internet access
cards,has caused up to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in damage to
computer systems in more than 20 countries in Asia, America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the virus caused much damage. We were not
affected that much, but the Philippines was used as the base to
launch the virus," said Zamora.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has acted swiftly on
the case, and with the cooperation of Internet service providers,
was able to pinpoint the suspected origin of the virus.
</P>
<P>
However, the authorities had to dig up a legal basis for the
arrest of the suspects and finally came up with the 1988 Access
Device Act,which aims to protect consumers from scams involving
the use of credit cards or personal identification numbers.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said it is urgent that the congress comes up with an
anti-cyber crime measure to shield the business community from
hackers who may attempt to cripple the country's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
On his part, NBI Director Federico Opinion said it is not clear
whether the Philippines will allow foreign governments whose
computers were damaged by the virus to pursue civil liabilities
against the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"The crime was committed here. We have no law for this
particular offense. We have to examine all facts pertaining to the
case," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine couple, Rommel Lamores and Irene de Guzman, who
were allegedly responsible for the spread of the virus, have not
been charged yet.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, employees of two separate banks in Manila, were
nabbed one after the other in NBI operations Monday.
