   On Monday, Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., made a phone call to the FBI. Smith thought he'd
figured out the identity of an electronic criminal _ the malevolent
hacker who'd created the notorious Melissa computer virus.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't absolutely certain of the virus writer's identity,
but after long hours of investigation he'd come up with two names.
One of them was that of a man he'd never met and certainly wasn't
related to _ David L. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, the FBI reached the same conclusion,
arresting 30-year-old computer programmer David L. Smith of
Aberdeen, N.J., and alleging that he distributed the Melissa virus.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and New Jersey State Police tracked David Smith
to his brother's house in Eatontown, New Jersey, and charged him
Friday with interruption of public communications, conspiracy, and
third-degree theft of computer service. After his arrest, David
Smith was released on $100,000 bond. He is scheduled for
arraignment on Monday. If convicted, Smith could receive up to 40
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard
time,'' said New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero. That
should sit well with computer network administrators across the
country who've spend the past week scrambling to stave off the
effects of Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Disguised as a list of pornographic Internet sites and allegedly
named after a stripper David Smith once knew, Melissa is a ``macro
virus,'' a document with a malignant computer program built in.
People who read the document using Microsoft Word, the popular
word-processing program made by Microsoft Corp., could infect their
computers. If the infected machine had a copy of Microsoft's
Outlook e-mail program, Melissa would send a copy of itself to the
first 50 people in the Outlook address book.
</P>
<P>
   Since both Word and Outlook are so widely used, the Melissa
virus spread with shocking speed. It first appeared on a
sex-related Internet bulletin board last Friday. By Saturday, major
corporations such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. were shutting
down their Internet access to cope with torrents of unwanted mail,
or simply to ensure their machines didn't get infected.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by sheer curiosity, Richard Smith has spent the last week
in the hunt for Melissa's author. But the FBI apparently didn't
need his help. The agency tracked down David Smith with the aid of
America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider,
computer network, and with old-fashioned police procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith had hoped to use a more radical approach. Last
month, Smith shocked privacy advocates by finding a secret serial
number, called a GUID, embedded in documents created by Microsoft
Word. Since the Melissa virus lurks inside a Microsoft Word
document, Smith hoped he could identify its author by reading
Melissa's serial number.
</P>
<P>
   A tip from a Swedish computer expert sent Richard Smith to a Web
site run by a virus writer who identified himself with the screen
name of VicodenES. Smith downloaded copies of the viruses posted on
the site. Then he used a ``hex editor,'' a piece of software that
lets programmers read the raw data hidden inside a computer file.
Smith planned to use the ``hex dumps'' of the VicodenES files to
check for the file's GUID. Sure enough, he found that some of these
files had the same serial number as Melissa. But along the way, he
also checked a feature of Microsoft Word that stores the names of
people who create or modify files.
</P>
<P>
   A number of names appeared again and again. Some were plainly
phony ones, like Ben Dover. But others seemed more believable. And
in three separate files, he found the name David Smith, or the
initials DLS.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New Jersey attorney general's office said
Friday that David Smith was ``definitely not'' VicodenES.
Investigators believe he took one virus from VicodinES and combined
it with another virus to create Melissa. Richard Smith's
examination of the Microsoft GUID serial number led him to the same
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith got an e-mail Wednesday from Rishi Khan, a
19-year-old senior in computer engineering at the University of
Delaware. Khan told him that the contents of the Melissa file were
nearly identical to a virus called Shiver that was released
sometime last year by someone calling himself Alt-F11. Smith and
Khan found that Shiver and Melissa had the same Microsoft serial
number, and even the same list of pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was obvious to Smith. Melissa's creator started
out with Shiver, then modified it _ a common practice among virus
writers. ``He wrote the Melissa virus in a separate file,'' said
Richard Smith. ``When it was all written, he needed some bait to
catch people with.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith believes that the virus writer merely removed the
polluted code in Shiver and replaced it with his own. Richard Smith
has no idea whether Alt-F11 and the creator of Melissa worked
together, or if they're only connected by their love of
virus-writing. But he hopes the FBI will try to find out. ``There's
someone else running around who may be material to this case,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he neglected his successful software business and
stayed up into the wee hours in an effort to track down the author
of Melissa. The FBI had it somewhat easier _ it had more manpower
and the cooperation of America Online. The Melissa virus had been
posted onto the Internet using an AOL account belonging to Scott
Steinmetz, a civil engineer in Lynnwood, Wash. Steinmetz proclaimed
his innocence and AOL concluded that someone had stolen access to
his account. Together AOL, the FBI, and New Jersey law enforcement
officials traced the identity theft back to David Smith. FBI and
AOL officials won't say how they did it, but Richard Smith suspects
that AOL uses a Caller ID system that tracks the source of all
incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith wasn't quite able to nail down the identity of
Melissa's creator, but he got pretty close. Now Smith hopes the
information he's gathered will enable the government to build an
airtight case against David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richard Smith's company is trying to get some new
industrial control software out the door, and he plans to focus on
that for awhile. ``I've got a real day job, which has been sadly
neglected this week,'' he said.
