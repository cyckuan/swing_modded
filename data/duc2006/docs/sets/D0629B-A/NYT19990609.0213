   The first virus known to hit personal computers was called the
Brain. Distributed via floppy disks in the mid-1980's, the Brain
was relatively innocuous and easy to track. Today, there are an
estimated 40,000 computer viruses, many far more harmful. Here are
some recent viruses; all of them can be blocked by anti-virus
software.

<P>
   Chernobyl
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS: Gets in via e-mail, floppies or downloaded
software. The virus attacks Windows 95 and 98 files, overwriting a
computer's hard drive. The date April 26 _ the Chernobyl disaster
anniversary _ triggers it.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT: As many as one million computers in Southeast Asia were
hit by Chernobyl on April 26. Hundreds of attacks were reported in
the United States. Many more computers may have since picked up the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   STATUS: Authorities in Taiwan identified a computer-engineering
student at the Tatung Institute of Technology as the virus' author.
His college punished him by giving him demerits, but he has not
been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS: Makes its way into computers as an e-mail
attachment and then sends itself around the Internet using
addresses found in a recipient's computerized address book. Can
infect Word and Excel documents.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT: More than 100,000 computers affected worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   STATUS: Prosecutors in New Jersey have accused David L. Smith, a
computer programmer from Aberdeen, N.J., of writing and sending out
the virus. Smith has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Happy99
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS: Often arrives via e-mail, infecting computers once
it is executed or run. To the user, the program looks like an
animated fireworks graphic. But it can destroy data and make public
confidential files from your computer.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT: Possibly tens of thousands of computers affected. Steven
Trilling, director of research for Symantec's Antivirus Research
Center, said his center had more than 3,000 messages from people
submitting the virus.
</P>
<P>
   STATUS: Author unknown.
