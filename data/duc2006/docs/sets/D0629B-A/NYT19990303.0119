Let software do its job in helping you do yours

<P>
   When last we talked, my computer was beset by the Happy99
virus/worm, which was being passed back and forth on one of my
mailing lists like a cold in a grade school class.
</P>
<P>
   If you just tuned in, and don't spend much time on the Internet,
Happy99 is a relatively benign virus in that it doesn't destroy
anything. It mainly wriggles into your Internet software and joins
every message you send as an attachment. You, however, are unware
of this until you begin getting angry messages from your e-mail
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Like any virus, it is an executable program, and isn't supposed
to work at all unless you execute it. To the best of my knowledge,
I never did that, but the thing suddenly turned into a kind of hand
grenade; every time it came wafting into my computer by way of
e-mail, as soon as it was downloaded, it caused the computer to
seize up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I erase it by any normal means; only Norton AntiVirus
was able to get rid of it. And I had to use a painfully slow
Web-based mail program to get into my mailbox and throw it out.
Eventually, it dawned on me that Norton ought to be able to catch
the thing creeping into my system and stomp on it right there.
</P>
<P>
   So, going into the Norton configuration program, I changed a
couple of settings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus, it was
ordered to delete the thing on sight. And instead of examining only
.EXE files, it was told to examine everything.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure which of these changes did the trick _ maybe both
were required _ but upon downloading a group of messages which I
knew contained the virus somewhere, everything went fine. No
lockup. Upon examining the messages, the Happy99.exe attachment
brought in by one of them was covered with a bright red X.
</P>
<P>
   I relate this mainly as a lesson in trying to make a program do
something you think it ought to be able to do. It doesn't always
work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have so many
user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is my recent test drive of Explorer. It wasn't
presenting pictures and other images at Web sites I knew had
graphics. A quick check showed it was set to refuse graphics to
speed up operations. This, however archaic, was apparently the
default setting.
</P>
<P>
   If incidentally, you have executed the Happy99 virus, it's not
hard to get rid of. There are lots of places on the Web with
instructions, among them http://www.geocities.com

   During all the unHappy furor, I installed the latest upgrade to
Eudora Pro, the outstanding e-mail program published by Qualcomm. I
had been using Version 3.0; the latest is 4.1. It's a very
worthwhile upgrade. The program hasn't changed drastically, but
lots of things work better. The main screen is divided into two
windows now. The top window shows a list of your mail, and merely
by bringing the cursor to any message, the text appears instantly
in the lower window. No more tiresome double-clicking, and the
presentation is much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Eudora now makes the mail available in batches. If
you have 200 messages waiting, it gives them to you 20 or so at a
time so you don't have to wait for the entire mailbox to download
so you can begin reading. I have yet to see a mail program I like
as well.
