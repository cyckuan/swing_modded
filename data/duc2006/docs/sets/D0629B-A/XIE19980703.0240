<HEADLINE> Virus to Hit Computers on World Cup Final Day </HEADLINE>

<P>
MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Spanish computer experts have
discovered a computer virus set to become active on July 12, the
day of the World Cup finals in Paris.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Panda Software company said Thursday that
the virus was "very complex and destructive" and could erase all
data on the hard disk and automatically print unwanted documents
to printers.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which targets Microsoft Office 97 Word documents,
will show a flashing banner of "Vive la coupe de monde!" (Long
live the World Cup!) on the screens of infected computers when a
user tries to open an MS Word file.
</P>
<P>
A dialogue window will then pop up and the user will be asked
to choose which football team will win the game, while the virus
will be working in the background.
</P>
<P>
The company spokesman added that the virus was probably created
in France as all of its files were written in French.
