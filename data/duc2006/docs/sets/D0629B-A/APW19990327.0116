	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A new computer virus can allow documents to be  
e-mailed to other people without warning, a potential security 
breach that should worry businesses and governments, an expert at 
Carnegie Mellon University said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Melissa macro'' or W97M--Melissa virus spreads via infected  
e-mail and attacks computers loaded with Microsoft's widely used 
Word 97 or Word 2000 programs, according to CERT -- or Computer 
Emergency Response Team -- Carnegie Mellon's Department of 
Defense-funded computer security team. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT first heard of the virus Friday afternoon and its members  
worked through the night to analyze the virus and develop a fix, 
CERT manager Katherine Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting so many reports from across the world, that we  
know this is going to be a huge problem come Monday,'' Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that since CERT was founded 10 years ago, this is only  
the second time it has considered a virus important enough to 
warrant a public announcement. The first, in 1994, warned of a 
virus that allowed computer burglars to collect passwords. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT has not determined where the Melissa virus originated.  
</P>
<P>
	Fithen said she is not allowed to say whether any governmental  
agency has suffered a security breach as the result of Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said company programmers worked  
with CERT and manufacturers of anti-virus programs to develop an 
antidote. 
</P>
<P>
	If a computer user opens an infected Word-format document, the  
virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book 
and sending an infected message to the first 50 entries, CERT said. 
</P>
<P>
	The message can include the contents of any Word document that  
is open on the computer, Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the virus reproduces and sends so much unwanted e-mail  
that the volume can overload some mail servers, the computers that 
distribute e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it apparently causes no direct damage to a computer's  
memory or programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Infected documents are sent as attachments to e-mails most  
frequently bearing a header: ``Subject: Important Message From'' 
the name of person whose computer relayed the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the message says ``Here is that document you asked  
for ... don't show it to anyone else ;-).'' 
</P>
<P>
