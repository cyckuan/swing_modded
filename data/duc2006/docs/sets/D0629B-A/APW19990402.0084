	NEW YORK (AP) -- The close-knit underground of computer virus  
creators split into two camps at the news that one of their own may 
have been arrested for releasing malicious Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole community has really been shaken up by this,'' said  
B.K. Delong, who follows the virus scene. ``The first group is one 
that wants a better reputation. Then there's the community that 
wants to retaliate and come up with even more destructive 
viruses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a  
computer chat area where they swap ideas and gossip. Most are 
programmers interested in viruses and computer bugs. They often 
write viruses and swap them among themselves, Delong said. 
</P>
<P>
	They refer to themselves as ``Black Hats,'' interested in doing  
damage, and ``White Hats,'' often crack programmers looking for 
possible security hazards. The Black Hats sometimes release viruses 
through e-mail or Usenet newsgroups. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released on behalf of the VX Underground, as it's  
often called, the group warned the media and investigators not to 
quickly condemn the author of Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead they should be more interested in the person who  
released the bug which caused the spread of the virus,'' said the 
statement, which was e-mailed to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa was originally posted on two sex discussion groups a  
week ago Friday, according to an online search. The VX Underground 
said it was highly unlikely those two posts out of thousands could 
have led to Melissa's vicious cascade. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, once released others posted the Melissa source code  
to additional newsgroups, Web sites and listservs (mailing lists), 
which meant anyone could turn it into the virus and continue to 
spread it,'' the statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Friday and  
charged with originating the destructive Melissa, which infected 
hundreds of thousands of computers and swamped hundreds of 
companies' e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in  
Microsoft Word documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known 
virus writer who calls himself VicodinES. 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Malley, spokeswoman for the New Jersey state attorney  
general's office said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person known 
by that handle. Instead, Smith took two viruses, one of which came 
from VicodinES, and combined them with another virus to create 
Melissa, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the Black Hat programmers) are looking for someone to  
blame,'' said Delong. They resent the treatment VicodinES 
supposedly received at the hands of the media, and they're rallying 
around their own. They said he is a really nice guy.''
