<HEADLINE> Christmas Computer Virus Discovered </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A computer virus timed to strike Windows PCs on  
Christmas Day has yet to pose a significant threat because of its 
low prevalence, but anti-virus software makers are gearing up to 
help computer users combat it. 
</P>
<P>
	The new virus, named W32/Kriz.3862, is designed to damage  
Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT machines. The virus 
overwrites data on hard drives and destroys the memory that stores 
a computer's setup, sometimes making a computer unbootable. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two cases of the virus have been detected ``in the wild''  
so far, said Sal Viveros, group marketing manager in the virus 
defense division of Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Network Associates, 
maker of the McAfee virus protection software. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Associates ranks the virus as a ``medium risk'' because  
of its low prevalence. Viveros said Network Associates would 
upgrade the assessment if more cases of the virus are reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus contains a profane, anti-religious message, Viveros  
said Thursday. ``That could be why it may hit on Christmas,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another maker of virus protection software, Central Command  
Inc., said the W32/Kriz virus is more destructive than the 
Chernobyl virus that recently attacked 300,000 computers in Asia 
and the Middle East. That virus did not affect Windows NT machines, 
used by businesses, as the W32/Kriz virus does. 
</P>
<P>
	``This virus contains lethal instructions,'' said Keith Peer,  
president of Medina, Ohio-based Central Command. ``Unlike the 
Chernobyl virus, it can infiltrate a business environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have developed software that detects and disables  
the virus.
