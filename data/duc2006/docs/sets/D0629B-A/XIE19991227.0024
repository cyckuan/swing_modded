<HEADLINE> First Bangladeshi Computer Virus Created in 1991 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Home-made computer viruses are
not new in Bangladesh, as the country's first locally-produced
virus, the Dhaka Virus, was created in 1991, The Daily Star
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which was created by a local programmer and later
renamed T-virus, was not destructive but intended to disturb the
MS-Word working environment on the screen.
</P>
<P>
The virus used to erase the screen for a few seconds and then
an instruction box appeared to suggest pressing T to go back to
the working environment.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were quoted as saying the virus had affected
computers of several organizations. Some young programmers later
developed remedial programs to get rid of the virus.
</P>
<P>
Another local virus, the White Lion, which spread during 1992-
93, was destructive as it erased document files in the MS-Word
environment.
</P>
<P>
The local viruses have faded out of people's mind because of
their less-destructive nature and the frequent invasion of
international viruses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But computer experts feared that more locally-created viruses
would affect machines across the country as more students enrolled
in computer courses. "It will soon be a reality in Bangladesh
where the local virus creators would reign," computer expert Anko
Shohel was quoted as saying.
