<HEADLINE> New "Love Bug" May Have Originated in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer anti-virus experts in
Jerusalem Sunday expressed their suspicion that a new, but even
dangerous type of "I Love You" virus may have originated in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Network Associates, an Israeli hi-tech start-up company,
reportedly was hit by the virus on Thursday, which is earlier than
any other reports of such virus throughout the world, according to
a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the company had begun its internal investigation to check
whether an employee of the company had written the virus code and
distributing it, currently known as "NewLove Bug".
</P>
<P>
The previous "Love Bug" rapidly spread throughout Europe, Asia,
and the United States earlier this month, affecting thousands of
computers and causing disastrous damages.
</P>
<P>
The "NewLove Bug", a modified type of "Love Bug", is using the
same mechanism to spread itself by sending e-mails to persons in
Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express software's address book.
</P>
<P>
At first look, the only difference appeared that the new bug
randomly chose its attachment filename but always has a .vbs
extension.
</P>
<P>
In a more sophisticated examination, however, it is found that
the new offshoot of the virus is much more dangerous as it will
attaches itself to every file on the victims' computer drivers,
while the previous bug reportedly written by a Filipino only
attacked selected multimedia files.
</P>
<P>
The destructive move could be accomplished between 20 seconds to
one minute, wiping out all files and only leaving a user with a
blank hard disc once attempting to reboot.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new deadly virus will also mutates and adds lines
of code to itself upon each infection in order to prevent anti-
virus software's detection.
</P>
<P>
All these characters had made computer security experts put the
lethality of such "NewLove Bug" at the dangerous end on the scale
of 1 to 10. In contrast, the original "Love Bug" only ranks at 5 on
this scale.
</P>
<P>
Numerous experts had issued warnings here that anybody should be
very watchful when he wants to open an e-mail attachment,
especially with a .vbs, .vps, or .vns extension filename.
</P>
<P>
There were already infection reports in the United States, while
U.S. experts had said that the most critical time will be Monday.
Only if the damage does not prove to be too severe by then, could
the computer business breathe a sigh of relief.
