<HEADLINE>  `Melissa' Suspect Appears in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The man accused of spreading the so-called  
``Melissa'' computer virus appeared in court for the first time 
Thursday, answering the judge's questions with a nod of the head or 
``Yes, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge advised David L. Smith, 30, of the charges against him  
and informed him of his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are charged with some serious offenses,'' Judge John A.  
Ricciardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested last week and  
charged with originating Melissa from his New Jersey apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the virus, which clogged e-mail accounts and  
shut down computer networks worldwide, was named after a topless 
dancer in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with interruption of public communications,  
conspiracy and theft of computer service. The maximum penalty for 
the offense is 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains free on $100,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith did not answer questions as he entered and left the  
courthouse. His lawyer, however, spoke with reporters and 
questioned whether the virus was as destructive as authorities 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this more akin to a graffiti artist or an international  
cyber terrorist?'' said Edward F. Borden Jr. ``Whoever authored the 
Melissa virus probably fits the former rather than the latter.''
