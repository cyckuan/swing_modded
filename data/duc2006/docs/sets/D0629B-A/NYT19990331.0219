MELISSA AND HER COUSINS

<P>
   Melissa is a new and spectacularly promiscuous computer virus,
one that has infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide
since its discovery less than a week ago. It has already cost
millions of dollars in lost productivity, experts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   And what a bargain it has been, because Melissa is relatively
sweet, as viruses go. The next time around _ and there will be a
next time _ a Melissa-type virus could be much more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa has focused the computing world's attention on the
rapidly growing threat of computer viruses in the Internet era and
underscored the need of all PC users to take virus protection
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, as the new viral vixen was named by its creator _ as
yet unknown _ combines elements of both a computer virus (spreading
from file to file) and a worm program (spreading from computer to
computer over a network). It is only one of several recent viruses
designed to prey on an otherwise useful feature of Microsoft Word
that enables macro programs _ automated scripts that trigger one or
more actions in the host computer _ to be started from within a
file.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa is mainly a nuisance. It will not erase your files,
demagnetize the stripes on your credit cards, reset your VCR clock
to flash 12:00, remove your mattress tags or hide your car keys. It
is not destructive, except to the extent that it clogs e-mail
systems and forces system administrators to spend most of their
time cleansing the virus from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively benign, easy to detect and simple to
disable, at least in its current form, Melissa is alarming to many
virus experts because it represents the first worm program to sweep
through common desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa typically enters a computer hidden in a Microsoft Word
97 or Word 2000 file attached to an electronic mail message. It can
also travel via diskettes and downloaded files, but electronic mail
is an exquisitely more efficient carrier, given the millions of
e-mail messages that traverse computer networks every day.
</P>
<P>
   This particular worm virus' preferred mode of travel is
Microsoft Outlook 98, the part of the popular Office suite that
handles electronic messages. Computers without Outlook 98 can be
infected, but they cannot pass along the virus to others except on
disk. If Outlook is installed but is not the user's primary e-mail
program, Melissa will try to seduce Outlook into helping it along.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how it arrives, Melissa can infect any computer that
uses Microsoft Word, including Macintoshes (but Macs cannot pass it
along via Outlook). Once in the computer it will infect any Word
files that the owner opens or creates, and it will rifle through
his or her Outlook address book and send a copy of itself, embedded
in a Word document, to the first 50 people or groups on the list.
</P>
<P>
   If the victim is unfortunate enough to open or create a
sensitive file using Word 97 when Melissa kicks in, it will
surreptitiously send that file, infected with the virus, to those
50 addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those who open the document could potentially send it to
50 others, and so on. The damage is amplified if any of the
addresses are to mailing lists, like ``A-team,'' ``book club'' or
another list early in the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients will receive a message with the subject line
``Important message from (your name)'' and the message ``Here is
the document you asked for. ... don't show anyone else ;-).'' An
infected Word file is attached to the message.
</P>
<P>
   The original virus file was called list.doc and was a list of
passwords to pornographic Web sites. As the virus spreads, the file
certainly will change. Keep in mind that computer viruses can
mutate quickly and alter their modus operandi. There is already
evidence that Melissa variants are in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the attachment triggers the virus, unless an updated
antivirus program is on guard to stop it. Dont open it. And if the
program asks whether you want to allow macros to run, just say no.
</P>
<P>
   If Melissa succeeds in infecting the computer, once an hour it
can insert a snippet of dialogue from a ``Simpsons'' television
episode into any Word 97 document that is open at the time:
``Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus 50 points for
using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With some simple modification, Melissa could have copied
critical data from the victim's computer and sent it to Bulgaria,
reformatted the hard disk, changed random zeros to ones in a
spreadsheet and perhaps even erased any trace that it had been
there. But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Because Melissa is not destructive, there might be a temptation
to shrug it off as a transient blip in Internet security. Instead,
it ought to highlight how vulnerable all computers are to viruses
as the world's communications and commerce systems become more
dependent on the Internet each year.
</P>
<P>
   So the first rule is to install a tough antivirus program. No
computer connected to the Internet should be without one.
</P>
<P>
   An antivirus program is designed to recognize telltale virus
signatures and to intercept and destroy the rogue code before it
has a chance to infect the computer. But such programs are useful
only on viruses the software has been trained to catch. When a new
virus like Melissa appears, it could slip past any antivirus
program that has not been updated to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   The two best antivirus programs I have used are Norton Antivirus
5.0 from the Symantec Corp. (www.symantec.com) and Virus Scan from
the McAfee division of Network Associates (www.nai.com). Both are
about $50 and include a one-year subscription for online updates,
and both quickly posted Melissa updates on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   The second rule is to update the software frequently. New
viruses are being created all the time. Jeffrey Carpenter, team
leader at the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie
Mellon University, said reports of virus attacks have increased
significantly since last August.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the major antivirus programs can easily be updated
over the Internet, through a relatively quick download that updates
the program's database of known virus signatures. In some cases the
user does not have to do anything; the downloads are performed
automatically. Not using this feature in effect defeats the purpose
of the software.
</P>
<P>
   The third rule is more Draconian: Never open e-mail attachments
or download files unless you are absolutely confident of their
contents, even if they are not Word files. It would be trivial for
a malicious programmer to modify Melissa to affect Excel files, for
example, and apparently someone has done just that, in a new virus
called Papa.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional advice is never to open any attachment sent by
a stranger, but with Melissa, and with several other new viruses
designed to propagate via e-mail, the files almost always come from
acquaintances, even friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you use Word 97, go to the Word toolbar and click Tools, then
Options, then General, then make sure there is a check mark in the
box labeled ``Macro virus protection.''
</P>
<P>
   More tips are available from several Web sites, including
www.microsoft.com and www.cert.org. It might be a good idea to
bookmark them, because Melissa is unlikely to be the last such
virus we will see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by far the most prolific threat I've seen in a long
time,'' said Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at the Symantec
Antivirus Research Center in Santa Monica, Calif., adding that
future virus worms will spread faster as more PC users connect to
the Internet through always-connected high-speed phone lines and
cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed hope that once Melissa's author is identified
and tied to the whipping post, others will be deterred from
releasing such viruses into the world.
