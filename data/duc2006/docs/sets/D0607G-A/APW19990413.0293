<HEADLINE> China Expects 7 Million Jobs Lost </HEADLINE>

	BEIJING (AP) -- Seven million Chinese workers will lose their  
jobs in state factories as China pushes ahead with reforms of the 
debt-ridden government-run industrial sector, a Chinese newspaper 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Minister of Labor and Social Security Wang Jianlun said the  
government would limit layoffs to 7 million, or 1 million people 
fewer than last year, the China Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to reform its state factories, China needs to lay off  
even more workers. Government leaders, however, have warned the 
layoffs must be restricted to prevent unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The government expects to spend 24.5 billion yuan ($3 billion)  
to retrain and provide stipends for laid-off workers this year, 
Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers who lose jobs in China's state-owned factories get  
monthly allowances of 140 yuan to 380 yuan ($17 to $46) when they 
enroll at training centers, the report said. The allowances are 
paid by the government, an unemployment insurance fund and the 
state factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang acknowledged that some of the troubled factories had been  
failing to pay pensions. He said the government would ensure at 
least 50 percent of the pensions owed would be paid by the end of 
the year.
