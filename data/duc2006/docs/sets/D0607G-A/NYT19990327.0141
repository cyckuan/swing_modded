A SECRETIVE ARMY GROWS TO MAINTAIN ORDER IN CHINA

<P>
   BEIJING _ In late 1997, President Jiang Zemin announced that
China would cut the People's Liberation Army, then 3 million
strong, by half a million troops as part of China's drive for a
leaner, more advanced military that could both defend the homeland
and reinforce China's image as a power in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   What the president did not say was that as the army shrank,
another, more secretive branch of the military, dedicated to
internal stability, was already expanding. At the very time of
Jiang's speech, it was absorbing 14 army divisions, or more than
100,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the People's Armed Police, a national force
trained in riot control, reflects the leaders' growing
preoccupation with domestic unrest. It also reflects their wish to
avoid having to resort to army combat troops to quell popular
demonstrations, as occurred in 1989 around Tiananmen Square with
disastrously bloody results.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, according to witnesses and other accounts,
armed police units were called out to help the ordinary police
contain many of the hundreds of demonstrations and protests
reported around China. The armed police have also battled ethnic
separatists in the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang, and have
long been used to help control Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The protests bubbling up around China, almost always centered on
economic complaints, have generally been small, and dispersed
peacefully. But with urban unemployment soaring and farmers restive
over high taxes and corruption, Jiang has proclaimed domestic
stability as this year's No. 1 priority. And he apparently looks to
the force he has built up _ now 1 million strong, Western analysts
say _ to keep any unrest from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a major force for maintaining state security and social
stability, the People's Armed Police shoulders a massive and
formidable burden,'' he said on a visit to an armed police barracks
in Beijing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two China experts from the U.S. military stated the
force's purpose even more baldly.
</P>
<P>
   ``By increasing the size of the People's Armed Police, the
leadership in Beijing implicitly acknowledges that internal unrest
is a greater threat to the regime's survival and Chinese economic
modernization than is foreign invasion,'' said John F. Corbett Jr.,
an American officer, and Dennis J. Blasko, writing in China
Strategic Review, a journal published in Washington. Corbett, who
works in the Pentagon, and Blasko, now a consultant, both
previously served as military attaches in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Officers of the People's Armed Police, which was formed in the
early 1980s from a combination of army and public security units,
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Western riot policemen, the People's Armed Police officers
are supposed to control demonstrations with minimal violence _
preferably with intimidation, shields and sometimes tear gas,
although they carry guns and have heavier weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion and upgrading of the force accelerated after 1989,
when it may have numbered about 600,000. That year, the armed
police's failure to disperse student demonstrators in Beijing
forced the leaders to call in combat units, which killed hundreds
of civilians and did lasting damage to China's image as well as to
army morale.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian police sometimes carry weapons too, but operate under
command of the Public Security Ministry rather than the military,
as most People's Armed Police units do.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been only too happy to shed an unpopular mission
for its regular forces. Freed from worry about crowd control, which
requires entirely different skills and equipment, the People's
Liberation Army ``can concentrate on becoming a modern, externally
oriented force,'' said David Shambaugh, a China expert at George
Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the armed police may also give Jiang, who had
no military experience, an important personal base of power,
outside experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   Deployments of the armed police to quell unrest are rarely
announced, but there is evidence that they have been in action
numerous times around China in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   State news media often portray the armed police in more benign
roles _ like working alongside regular soldiers to pile sandbags
during last summer's record floods.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, 9,000 armed police were sent to help existing
forces ranged against a violent separatist movement in the western
province of Xinjiang. In rural Hunan in January, hundreds of armed
police officers dispersed a crowd of many thousands of angry
farmers by lobbing tear-gas grenades and charging with clubs,
villagers said. One man was killed by an exploding gas grenade and
dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Most demonstrations have ended peacefully. But Western analysts
question whether the People's Armed Police would be up to its job
in the event of large-scale unrest, particularly if the job of
controlling it falls to the underequipped, poorly trained units
deployed in areas far from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is whether the People's Armed Police is up to
the task,'' said a Western analyst who has closely studied the
armed police, and spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Because of a
limited budget and long-term quality and management problems, i's
still debatable whether they can perform well in a major crisis.''

   In Beijing, armed police officers guard embassies and constantly
patrol Tiananmen Square. Other armed police units are involved in
border defense, and guarding power plants and important sites like
gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   But some 730,000 of the 1 million armed police are primarily
charged with maintaining public order, according to the latest
estimate by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1989 debacle, numerous army units have transferred to
the armed police, mostly the lowest-ranking infantry and artillery
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the dregs'' of the army, said James Mulvenon, a
military expert with Rand Corp. in Washington, of the 14 divisions
shifted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much training and support these transfers and
new recruits have received for their increasingly delicate role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see much evidence'' that the People's Armed Police
``has really improved its operational capabilities very much since
1989,'' Mulvenon said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, in an apparent effort to improve management
and training, control of most units was shifted from the Ministry
of Public Security to the Central Military Commission. The top
officers have been drawn from the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But outside experts believe that command is relatively
decentralized, and that provincial political leaders have
considerable say over how the armed police troops are used.
</P>
<P>
   As with the regular army, corruption and extensive involvement
in outside businesses have weakened many units, and the armed
police have been ordered to relinquish business activities.
</P>
<P>
   The armed police were already chronically underfunded, Mulvenon
said, in part because they must draw money from several different
sources that have no control over their operations. The costs are
shared among provincial governments, the Ministry of Civil Affairs
and Public Security Ministry, among others.
