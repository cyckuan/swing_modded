U.S. BLASTS CHINA FOR HUMAN-RIGHTS FAILURES

   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ One year after saying China had improved its
human rights record, the Clinton administration on Friday issued
one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described
some of the most serious human rights violations in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright's departure for China, at a time when President Clinton
has been criticized for being too easy on the government in
Beijing, the State Department's annual report on rights said that
the country's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere
to international human rights conventions and instead decided last
fall ``to nip in the bud'' attempts to form independent democratic
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The government also imprisoned several thousand political and
religious dissidents, tortured prisoners, suppressed Chinese of
minority faiths, especially Christians, and imposed new
restrictions on the press, including the Internet, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was
continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights
document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the
effectiveness of the administration's policies of engagement with
China. Last year's rather mild description of China's human rights
policies provoked criticism that the administration was
overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the
issue as an obstacle to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, ``There is a considerable
indignation about the Chinese government's renewed human rights
abuses, its proliferation of military technology and its threats to
its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution
co-sponsored by Wellstone and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., asking
the administration to condemn China's human rights record at an
upcoming U.N. meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the hesitation of following up on this strong report
with a strong condemnation _ unless commercial interests trump all
other interests in this administration,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is unlikely to go along with that
suggestion. In a speech in San Francisco on Friday, President
Clinton defended his administration's policy of engagement with
China and suggested China was ``moving away from the rule of fear,'
even though it was ``not yet rooted in the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials are worried that China is
becoming a tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting
very nervous about dissidents and the opposition,'' said a senior
official in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the report, Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary
of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Ms. Albright
would discuss the report's finding with Chinese leaders when she
travels there this weekend but cautioned that even the most
``robust'' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in
Chinese behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake to conclude that the human rights in
China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is,'' Koh said.
``The question here is, how can developments within China, which
have led to greater economic freedom, and efforts at legal reform,
which could bring about sweeping change, be pressed and pushed
through a process of engagement?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the
State Department report.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, scholars and leaders of human
rights groups all agree that underlying the Chinese government's
fears about social unrest is the downturn in the country's economy.
China's annual double-digit economic growth is a thing of the past,
and Chinese leaders are worried that the growing ranks of the
unemployed will join forces with political dissidents and angry
farmers and create a situation beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't had the growth they need to continue with their
economic reforms,'' said a senior administration official involved
in China policy. ``Their economy is flat. Exports are flat and
there is a real increase in labor unrest. That's why the regime is
very very anxious about political unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report gave China high marks for continuing to open up the
economy and thereby opening up society. ``Over all, average
citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom than
ever before: higher disposable income, looser economic controls,
greater freedom of movement, increased access to outside sources of
information, greater room for individual choice, and more diversity
in cultural life,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But it went on to say that economic reform has not brought
political freedom and that Chinese who try to dissent ``live in an
environment filled with repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Friedman, a China scholar at the University of Wisconsin,
said, ``The hard-liners in the Chinese government are increasingly
in control and the economic liberalizers have to be more
circumspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Chinese earned praise from the
administration for signing two major international conventions on
economic, cultural, civil and political rights that include
guarantees of the freedom of association, speech, assembly and
religion. China's leaders have said they would respect the spirit
of the law until the national legislature ratified the treaties, a
promise they broke with this year's violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a complete disparity in the commitments China
has made by signing the various treaties and their practice of
flagrantly violating their citizens' rights,'' said Mike
Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's report to Congress on the military balance
between China and Taiwan highlighted how Beijing's deployment of
short range missiles aimed at the Taiwan Straits was meant to
intimidate and threaten Taiwan. While the report said there have
been no recent increases in the number of missiles targeted at
Taiwan in the past year, it added that China's plans to increase
its cruise and ballistic missiles to attain an ``overwhelming
advantage'' over Taiwan by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as
well as tensions between China and its southeast Asian neighbors
over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the
overall deterioration in relations between China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues, as well as the ongoing repression in Tibet, will
be discussed by Ms. Albright in China next week in preparation for
the visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the coming months a series of anniversaries in
China could spark unrest that might further test the leadership's
tolerance of dissent. June 4 is the 10th anniversary of the
military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square in Beijing, and on Oct. 1 the country will celebrate the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China as well as the Chinese are very anniversary conscious,
and the leaders will definitely want to avoid unofficial
demonstrations,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``A leadership that's already
focused on stability has become obsessed by it.''
