Protests in city on Clinton's itinerary

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Several hundred disgruntled residents staged
protests Wednesday in Xi'an, the Chinese city famed for its
terracotta warriors that will be President Clinton's first stop in
China later this month, according to a Hong Kong-based human rights
group.
	   The peaceful demonstrations by two groups with different
grievances against the government began Tuesday morning. A group of
about 150 people were protesting the government's failure to
allocate them new housing after they were evicted from their homes
for redevelopment, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   They were soon joined by some 200 pedicab drivers protesting the
city's decision ahead of Clinton's June 25-26 visit not to allow
them to work as taxi drivers, the group said.
	   Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their
jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other
goods for their livelihood.
	   Police did not intervene, and the demonstrators dispersed at
about 6 p.m. Tuesday. They resumed their protest Wednesday morning,
the human rights center said.
	   Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests
had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited
pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
	   Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial
capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests
in recent months.
	   The Hong Kong-based group reported last week that police in
Xi'an had beaten one of the thousands of onlookers watching a
sit-in on June 2 by 200 workers from the No. 1 Construction Co. who
were protesting layoffs.
	   The demonstrations are the latest in steady outbursts of unrest
as reform-minded Chinese leaders allow bankrupt state industries to
lay off millions of workers. In cities throughout China, many of
the unemployed have taken to driving taxis and pedicabs to make
ends meet.
	   In May, some 500 taxi drivers surrounded Xi'an government
offices to protest licensing fees they believed were unfair.
