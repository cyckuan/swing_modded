Pensioners rally in central China demanding pay 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A thousand retirees from a nearly bankrupt state
auto maker disrupted traffic in a central Chinese city Tuesday to
protest a lack of pension payments, a human rights group reported.
	   The protesters from Wuhan's Light Auto Works General factory
blocked streets for 2 1/2 hours before city officials agreed to
give them three months of overdue pension payments, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Duty officers with city agencies, reached after hours by
telephone, refused to confirm the demonstration.
	   The protest was the sixth this month in the ailing industrial
city and is part of a nationwide wave of unrest by workers as state
factories cut jobs to cope with government-ordered market reforms.
	   The Light Autoworks, like many state enterprises, suffered from
bad management and bloated payrolls, the Information Center said.
