After police show of force, Chinese farmers call off protest

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Threats by officials and a show of force by
police forced farmers outside a south China provincial capital to
abandon a planned protest Thursday, a rights group reported.
	   Farmers outside Changsha city blocked construction of a science
park last month after the well-connected developer was three months
late in paying them for their land, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Authorities sent 700 regular and armed police to clear away the
protesters in Tianmashan village on Sept. 22, and police arrested
six farmers and beat more than 20, some severely, the Hong
Kong-based group said. It gave the following account:
	   When more than 300 villagers marched on the Hunan provincial
government the following day, officials agreed to provide
compensation. But the villagers were not satisfied, saying the rate
was well below the market price, and they vowed to stage another
protest Thursday, China's National Day.
	   Local officials threatened the villagers against staging the
protest, saying the government ``was not made of bean curd,'' the
Hong Kong-based group said.
	   An official with the city police department denied the report.
``Nothing like that happened in Changsha. It's a rumor,'' said the
official, who gave only his surname, Li.
	   China has been hit by hundreds of mostly small-scale protests
over the past two years by farmers and workers upset over layoffs,
government policies and perceived official indifference or
corruption.
	   The Information Center said one of those connected to the
science park development was the brother-in-law of Wang Maolin,
Hunan's Communist Party secretary.
