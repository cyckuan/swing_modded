Chinese farmers block traffic with tractors to protest taxes

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Farmers upset over high government taxes drove
their tractors into an eastern Chinese city to block traffic in
protest, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported Wednesday.
	   The demonstration Tuesday in Bengbu marked the latest outburst
of discontent by farmers and workers who feel harmed by China's
capitalist-style reforms and neglected by an indifferent or corrupt
officialdom.
	   About 100 farmers from Mopanzhang village outside Bengbu pulled
their tractors in front of the city's government office building
Tuesday morning, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   One unidentified demonstrator told the rights group that the
government had raised taxes and fees despite an appeal by China's
legislature in March ``to reduce the peasants' burdens.''
	   Large numbers of police were sent to the scene and the farmers
agreed to leave peacefully around noontime after meeting with a
city official to discuss their grievances, the rights group said.
	   A spokesman for Bengbu's police department refused to comment on
the demonstration.
	   Farmers and workers were once treated as protected,
revolutionary classes by the ruling Communist Party. Their current
disaffection threatens to further undermine the party's tattered
legitimacy and poses a challenge to its continued rule.
