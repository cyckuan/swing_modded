AS `BIRTHDAY' GIFT, CHINA ANNOUNCES PAY INCREASES

   BEIJING _ The Chinese government on Sunday night announced
sweeping increases in salaries, pensions and welfare payments for
84 million people, describing the move as a birthday gift as the
country prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Officials clearly hope the raises will help their attack, as yet
futile, on a stubborn case of deflation that is holding down
economic growth. Insecure about their financial prospects,
consumers are saving rather than spending and the retail price
index has declined for some 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increases, which are generally in the range of 15
percent to 30 percent and are retroactive to July 1, will go to
workers and retirees in government offices, schools and other
state-funded facilities. In addition, monthly subsidies to millions
of unemployed workers and urban poor people will increase by an
average of 30 percent, according to the announcement on national
television news Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   As for beleaguered state-owned enterprises, the announcement
said they must decide on wages ``according to their efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was not a surprise because officials have
publicly said in recent weeks that a raise was in store.
</P>
<P>
   The raise will cost the government more than $6 billion for the
second half of this year, said the finance minister, Xiang
Huicheng, in a television interview Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The average increase for public workers will be only $15 a
month, officials said. Many senior bureaucrats and college
professors earn little more than $100 a month in cash salary, plus
bonuses and other benefits. At the same time, many workers face
rising rents as the government tries to reduce housing subsidies
and create a commercial housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first half of this year is said to be 7.6 percent,
just under last year's annual rate, but many experts say these
figures are significantly overstated. Slowed growth and rising
unemployment in the last two years have contributed to social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to goad people into spending more, the
government said last week that it would begin taxing the interest
earned on personal savings accounts. Many Chinese are not
accustomed to paying income tax and that measure was greeted by
much grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also continuing to issue bonds for
infrastructure projects, but as it runs out of options it may also
have to consider devaluation of the yuan in the coming year to get
the needed economic jolt, some foreign economists say.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Sunday night, Xiang, the finance minister, said
he hoped that the raises would stimulate consumption and help to
reduce the growing ``irregularities'' in salaries _ a reference to
the huge gulf in compensation between middle- and upper-level civil
servants and people in the growing private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the raises had been timed with the Oct. 1
anniversary in mind, Xiang replied, ``Yes, of course. The 50th
anniversary is a time when all of China is celebrating.''
