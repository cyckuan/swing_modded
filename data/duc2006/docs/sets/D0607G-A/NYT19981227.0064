CHINA JAILS MAN FOR INTERVIEW ON U.S.-BACKED RADIO NETWORK
</HEADLINE>

   BEIJING _ Dealing out the fourth lengthy prison term to
political dissenters in a week, China Sunday convicted a man for
``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations'' because
he gave an interview about farmer protests to the U.S.-financed
Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
</P>
<P>
   After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan
that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang,
42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group
Human Rights in China, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang previously spent seven years in prison for organizing an
independent labor union in 1989. This year, before his detention in
July, he had formed a group to protect laid-off workers and tried
to register it with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities, fearing social unrest at a time of rising
unemployment, appear to be especially fearful of any labor
organizations outside Communist Party control, and of any efforts
to link up disaffected workers with democracy campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, as part of the most severe crackdown on
dissidents here in two years, three longtime activists who promoted
a new China Democracy Party, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai,
were convicted on subversion charges and given sentences of 11 to
13 years.
</P>
<P>
   At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was
charged with ``illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign
organizations and persons,'' according to his lawyer and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment specifically named a telephone interview Zhang
gave last March to Radio Free Asia in which he discussed a protest
against high taxes by 70 to 80 farmers in one Hunan county, and
another incident in which a farmer who refused to pay a tax was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous such farmer protests have been reported around the
country in recent years and top national leaders have spoken out
against high, unfair burdens put on peasants by local and county
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Free Asia, which was set up in 1996 and receives all of
its funds from Congress, broadcasts news and other programs into
China from transmitters in Central Asia and the Pacific. The
Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some
success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize
democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret this action,'' said Daniel Southerland,
executive editor of Radio Free Asia, speaking by telephone from
Washington Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the March interview, Southerland said, journalists called
Zhang to verify reports of the farmer protests and ``he didn't say
anything that wasn't widely known _ certainly it wasn't national
security information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to do someone in like this, they can always find
an excuse,'' Southerland said. Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts in
native languages to eight countries where news is censored,
frequently quotes Chinese residents on its programs, though does
not use names when it appears the speaker would be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are
now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of
a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In general, only those who have been actively involved in
organizing the new political party or independent worker groups
have been imprisoned for any length of time. In contrast to earlier
decades, Chinese people today are fairly free to voice dissenting
opinions in private _ so long as they do not act on them.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media,
President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the
overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that
any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be
``annihilated in the early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   Western governments as well as democracy advocates here had
hoped that China's signing this year of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, which calls for free speech and
assembly, would lead to a softening of political controls.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the government has made it clear that any
actions perceived to imperil Communist Party rule will be defined
as threats to national security _ and therefore outside the purview
of the global treaty and other human rights conventions.
