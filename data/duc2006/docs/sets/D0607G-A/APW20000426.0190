<HEADLINE> Official: China-Taiwan War Unlikely  </HEADLINE>

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- China's stepped up bomber flights and
naval maneuvers set off a dispute Wednesday between Taiwanese
defense officials and experts on whether the moves were an attempt
to intimidate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the military activity detected by Taiwan's
intelligent services made the front pages of the island's leading
newspapers Wednesday, sending Taiwan's jittery stock market down
4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the drills might be a prelude to
threatening war games to intimidate the island as its new
president, Chen Shui-bian, prepares to take office May 20. Chen has
said he has no plans to seek independence unless China attacks to
force a reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Tao-yu, vice-minister of defense, doubted that the recent
military maneuvers were unusual. He said China holds exercises
every spring because of good weather.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun said the military had to inform the public ''to remind
the people of the concept of national defense'' on the island that
split with China 51 years ago amid civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Ting Yu-chou, chairman of the National Security Bureau, said
Taiwan's military ''was jumping to conclusions,'' the United
Evening News reported. Ting said the air drills were normal and
there were no indications of large-scale ground exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Chong-pin, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
which handles Taiwan's China policy, said the maneuvers were part
of the mainland's psychological warfare against the island. Beijing
repeatedly has threatened to attack if Taiwan refuses to reunify
and declares independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, an expert on China's People's Liberation Army, said Beijing
was trying to intimidate Taiwan into starting reunification talks
because Chinese leaders lack the confidence to act on their threats
of an all-out war with the island.
</P>
<P>
   War, Lin said, was unlikely because China's leaders fear war
would bring social unrest, economic upheaval and threaten their
hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders also realize that war with Taiwan would involve
the United States, which has shown ''a more positive attitude''
toward the island despite its recognition of Beijing, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   Former military chief Hau Pei-tsun, who was visited by
president-elect Chen, said that the drills ''looked like normal air
force exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen in turn urged China to use peaceful methods to improve ties
. ''We want peace, harmony, cooperation,'' he said.
