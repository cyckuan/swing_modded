   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   In a step recalling Maoist political re-education campaigns,
Beijing has sent 1,200 officials belonging to the Falun Gong
spiritual movement to special schools to study Communist literature
and recant their allegiance to the group. That is disturbing
behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to
economic reform and modernization and that signed the International
Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese
citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a
popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a
remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's
omnipresent police. Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has
now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained
thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Special factors may explain the vehemence of Beijing's moves
against the Falun Gong. Rapidly growing religious cults are
particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their
historical role in sparking unrest. New religious groups have grown
in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the
suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void. The
Falun Gong's emergence also coincides with economic strains. Growth
rates are falling and unemployment rising. New reforms advocated by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji like slimming state enterprises and
liberalizing trade threaten further dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   None of this justifies the persecutions now under way. For most
of its followers, the Falun Gong is not about protest but
traditional Chinese techniques of exercise, breathing and
meditation believed to channel the body's spiritual energy. Those
who have attended protest rallies are simply exercising
internationally recognized rights of association and expression for
which they should not be punished or forced to submit to
ideological training.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's repression may only deepen public disenchantment with
the authorities, and could divert energies from carrying out needed
economic reforms. China cannot arrive at the modern future it wants
by returning to the ideological monitoring and indoctrination
methods of the past.
