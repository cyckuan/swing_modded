EDITORIAL: SOCIAL COMBUSTION IN CHINA

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   Reports are only now reaching the United States of serious
unrest in the northeast Chinese mining city of Yangjiazhangzi
almost six weeks ago. An account in The Washington Post this week
described three days of violent rioting over job cuts and
corruption that overwhelmed local police forces and continued until
regular army troops arrived.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the kind of social upheaval that terrifies the
leadership in Beijing, who well know that protests by disenchanted
citizens could someday escalate again into a serious threat to
Communist rule. Hundreds of economic protests, some of them
violent, have erupted across China in recent years, rarely, if ever
reported in the Chinese news media.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangjiazhangzi events were unusually unruly, but worker and
peasant protests have become increasingly frequent. Market reforms
like the privatization of large state companies produce
unemployment and social dislocation. When this takes place in an
atmosphere of pervasive government corruption, popular anger is
understandable. Unless Beijing enforces higher ethical standards on
local officials, unrest could soon become even more widespread.
State companies are scheduled to lay off more than 10 million
workers before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Anger over alleged corruption seems to have played a major role
in Yangjiazhangzi. Miners, a formidable protest group in many
societies, were already aggrieved over economic issues. A large
state-owned molybdenum mine there stopped issuing paychecks early
last year. Last November, most of the mine was shut down, but some
of its facilities and equipment were apparently transferred to new
private owners alleged to be friends of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   What detonated the violence was the belated announcement of an
extremely modest severance package for the laid-off workers. The
contrast between what looked like an undeserved windfall for the
well connected and the shabby treatment of longtime employees
became even more of an affront when mine authorities refused to
show up at a peaceful protest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, Communist leaders in Beijing have seemed
haunted by fears of explosive social unrest. Their answer has
generally been repression, along with strident nationalist
campaigns designed to distract the country's attention from
economic grievances. Instead, Beijing should crack down on the
corruption that has grown worse with the progress of economic
reform. Show trials of a few spectacularly corrupt individuals have
not been enough to discourage others on the take.
</P>
<P>
   Market reforms have benefited China and brightened economic
prospects for many of its workers and peasants. But the current
phase of selling off state factories and mines is creating
hardships for many longtime employees. When they see local party
officials drawing illicit profits from their sacrifices, they are
sure to protest. Beijing should heed the message from
Yangjiazhangzi.  &QL;
