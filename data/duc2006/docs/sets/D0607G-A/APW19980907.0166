Unpaid workers demonstrate in southwestern China

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Five hundred state factory workers, unpaid for
four months, broke a police line Monday and marched in protest
through an impoverished southwestern Chinese city, a rights group
reported.
	   The workers demanded back pay and shouted slogans decrying waste
and corruption by state factory managers as they marched through
Dujiangyan in Sichuan province, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Officials with the Chengdu city government, which oversees
Dujiangyan, confirmed the protest but refused to provide details.
	   The Information Center gave the following account: At 11:30
a.m., 500 workers from the Min River Timber Machinery Factory
gathered near a bridge in the city's center and began to march.
Dozens of police tried to block them from a main thoroughfare. But
the angry demonstrators pushed through and police did not try to
use force to stop them.
	   Two trends converged in sparking the unrest, the third
demonstration by angry workers in Dujiangyan in 13 months.
	   The city, a famous scenic spot in Sichuan's western foothills,
60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of Chengdu, is home to many
bankrupt state industries. Throughout China, hundreds of protests
have erupted as uncompetitive state industries founder on
capitalist market reforms.
	   In the case of Min River Timber, the money-losing venture was
serving a logging industry in severe decline after decades of
unrestrained clear-cutting of forests.
	   Last week, the government imposed a ban on logging in western
Sichuan to stop the environmental damage that compounded disastrous
flooding this summer.
	   Workers from the 2,000-employee Min River Timber appealed many
times to the Dujiangyan government about their owed wages, but
never received a reply, the Information Center said.
