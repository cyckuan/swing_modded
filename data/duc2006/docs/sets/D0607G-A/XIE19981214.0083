February 26,1989 -- Stability is an overriding issue among
China's problems, Deng Xiaoping pointed out while meeting with
the then U.S. President George Bush.

on April 15, Hu Yaobang passed away. Various mourning
activities were held by people and students. But, a small number
of people took advantage of this to spread rumors, attacking the
Party and state leaders, inciting the people to oppose the
leadership of the Party and the socialist system.

The People's Daily, the organ of the CPC Central Committee,
carried an editorial saying that there must be a clear-cut stand
against unrest on April 26. That unrest developed into turmoil
because of the support and connivance of Zhao Ziyang. The
so-called "Federation of Autonomous Student Unions", an illegal
student organization, urged its supporters to stage a hunger
strike in Tian'anmen Square beginning on May 13.

The State Council decided to declare a martial law in parts of
Beijing starting from May 20. However, the organizers of the
unrest and those scheming in the background took advantage of the
restraints of the government and troops, and went about organizing
various illegal activities which led to a counter revolutionary
rebellion. The State Council repealed martial law conditions on
parts of Beijing on January 11, 1990.

On May 16, 1989, Sino-Soviet relations were normalized
according to an announcement made by Deng Xiaoping during his
meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, the then president of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the then general
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
