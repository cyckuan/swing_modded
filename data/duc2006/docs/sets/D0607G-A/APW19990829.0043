<HEADLINE> China To Raise Unemployment Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will raise stipends to unemployed workers  
by 30 percent as part of a series of measures intended to arrest 
the economic slide and brighten public sentiment ahead of the 
country's 50th anniversary of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor and Social Security Minister Zhang Zuoji promised that  
increased payments would begin before the Oct. 1 anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pensions are also to be raised by varying degrees, Zhang told  
the executive committee of China's legislature, according to state 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements were made as Beijing prepared its second  
large-scale rehearsal of the planned Oct. 1 parade and performance 
by a half-million people on Tiananmen Square. Police closed off 
streets leading to the square late Saturday, and buses brought in 
students and others for the practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has soared as once centrally planned industries  
trim bloated payrolls to cope with free-market reforms. With 
millions of Chinese trying to survive on meager stipends, the 
communist leadership has worried about the potential for unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang told the Standing Committee of the National People's  
Congress that more than 7.4 million urban workers lost their jobs 
in the first half of the year, and 5.4 million of them have not 
found new work. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have fallen for 22 months in a row, unaffected by  
interest rate cuts that have failed to ignite consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the welfare increases, the average jobless worker  
received a $20 stipend and another $10 for life, medical and 
unemployment insurance, the Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zhang said 300,000 workers laid off this year never received  
their stipends. He noted that many local governments had been 
unable to collect sufficient revenues to cover the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has announced a 30 to 40 percent pay  
increase for civil servants, and halved a tax on fixed-asset 
investments.
