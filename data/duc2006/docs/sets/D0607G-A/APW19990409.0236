	BEIJING (AP) -- A shortage of tear gas and rubber bullets forced  
China's military to open fire 10 years ago on demonstrators in 
Tiananmen Square, a former top Communist Party member said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping to the party's official version of the controversial  
1989 melee, Zhu Muzhi said troops were justified in firing on 
``thugs'' who killed soldiers and threw rocks and gas bombs. But he 
acknowledged that ``innocent'' people were also killed in the 
crackdown on democracy advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu suggested that with better anti-riot equipment and more  
experience in dealing with civil unrest, the Chinese government 
might have avoided heavy loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never imagined there would be such an incident, that so  
many thugs would surround and beat the People's Liberation Army,'' 
Zhu, then a member of an advisory commission of party elders, told 
reporters. ``The police at the time had no rubber bullets, no tear 
gas canisters, they had nothing. In the end, the only weapon they 
had at hand was guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the assault, ``many people on the streets who were watching  
the goings-on possibly were hit by flying bullets. They, in fact, 
were innocent,'' said Zhu, who now heads a government-backed 
society for human rights studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds were killed when Chinese troops shot their way through  
Beijing on June 4, 1989, to quell seven weeks of peaceful protests 
in Tiananmen Square calling for democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the protests were an anti-government  
rebellion that needed to be put down with force. It has never given 
a credible account of the number of dead and injured, or of the 
thousands imprisoned in the wave of arrests that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 10th anniversary of the protest movement drawing near,  
Chinese authorities are particularly nervous about any attempts at 
public commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness to the crackdown disputed Zhu's claim that police  
lacked riot gear. Robin Munro, formerly with Human Rights Watch, 
said he saw Chinese police with riot shields, helmets and leather 
boots in Beijing after martial law was declared on May 20 -- 16 days 
before the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had no justification in sending in the army. Period,'' he  
said. Zhu's claims are ``just an excuse to justify the 
unjustifiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Foreign Correspondents'  
Club of China, Zhu recalled seeing ``thugs'' chase a group of 
soldiers during the crackdown and throw one of them off a highway 
overpass. The crowd burned the body, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests ``had evolved into the stage where the people  
wanted to overthrow the government,'' Zhu said. ``I understand why 
at last the PLA soldiers were forced to shoot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under further questioning, Zhu conceded that police did have ``a  
little'' tear gas at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	China has beefed up its riot and paramilitary police,  
particularly in Beijing, since the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade of uninterrupted economic growth since 1989 proved the  
crackdown was correct, Zhu claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the handling of June 4 had been totally wrong then these  
past 10 years would have been difficult. China would definitely 
have been in total chaos,'' he said.
