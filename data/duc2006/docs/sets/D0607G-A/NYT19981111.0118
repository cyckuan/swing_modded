   HONG KONG _ Even before China regained sovereignty over this
former British colony 16 months ago, authorities began to remove
the face of Queen Elizabeth II from stamps, redesign the flag and
repaint royal-crested mailboxes. Yet today, one of the most obvious
signs of British rule remains. Emblazoned in huge letters on the
local headquarters of China's People's Liberation Army is a
strikingly inappropriate name: the Prince of Wales Building.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1997 handover, pundits predicted that China would rip
the letters from the harborside tower as soon as People's
Liberation Army troops arrived. The troops are here, but the name
remains on the barracks. China's decision to leave it there seems a
deliberate move to remain as discreet as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Here in Hong Kong, where one in six people
marched to protest the 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters
around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, distrust of the Chinese soldiers
ran deep. Half of Hong Kong's residents are refugees from China or
descendants of refugees, and many worried that the new government
might use troops to curtail their liberties.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, doomsayers' predictions have fallen flat. Far from
cracking down on demonstrators, the People's Liberation Army has
become all but invisible here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been told to lie low, stay in their barracks, not to
mingle with the public, and for this they were rewarded with medals
and citations when Jiang Zemin visited on the anniversary of the
handover,'' said Willy Lam, China editor of the daily South China
Morning Post. ``They were rewarded for doing nothing, for staying
out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the People's Liberation Army image problem, China has
kept its armed forces so low-profile that some Hong Kong residents
now want to see more of them.
</P>
<P>
   The growing, if guarded, trust in the soldiers here reflects the
growth of Hong Kong's confidence in China's promise to let the
capitalist enclave maintain civil liberties that are unavailable on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, military analysts warn that if massive social
unrest were to grip Hong Kong, something hard to imagine under
current conditions, the People's Liberation Army would undoubtedly
act in the event that Hong Kong's 27,500 police officers could not
handle the situation, or if they refused to move against the local
people.
</P>
<P>
   The primary role of the estimated 4,700 troops here and 5,300
across the Chinese border ``is to create a degree of good will or
trust to convince Hong Kong that they have nothing to fear from the
handover, that being part of China is not going to impinge on their
lives,'' said Ronald Montaperto, a Chinese security specialist at
National Defense University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that mission appears to have succeeded. A survey by
Chinese University of Hong Kong found that the percentage of people
satisfied with the People's Liberation Army has risen from 30
percent in July 1997 to more than 50 percent this past June.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Leo Tang, a 17-year-old student who visited
the naval barracks recently. ``We all know of Tiananmen Square, so
I wondered if they would act the same way here if there were
protests,'' Tang said. ``But it seems China has gone out of its way
to choose a special group of soldiers here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll by the University of Hong Kong, as approval
of the People's Liberation Army grew, satisfaction with the Hong
Kong police has dropped, from 79 percent a year ago to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the few occasions when demonstrators have denounced China or
rallied for banned causes such as independence for Taiwan, it has
been the police who have drowned out slogans with loud music or
hauled protesters to the station.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, soldiers have been restricted to barracks except
for rare field trips in civilian clothes. Ironically, their absence
from bars and restaurants that depended on the patronage of British
troops has aroused complaints from pub owners who a year ago
worried that Chinese troops might intimidate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even official business has been kept almost comically
low-profile. When the US Navy invited top Chinese officers onboard
the visiting USS Blue Ridge, the Chinese were concerned about
boarding the ship because they would have to walk through a busy
shopping mall. To avoid alarming civilians by marching through a
public area in uniform, the Chinese asked US officials to devise a
route to enter as unobtrusively as possible _ via a parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   According to law, the People's Liberation Army can assist
authorities in a crisis _ a natural disaster or unrest _ but only
if requested by Hong Kong's Chief Executive and approved by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine social unrest extreme enough to
destabilize Hong Kong. But Tai Ming Cheung, a People's Liberation
Army specialist, cautioned, ``If you asked me in 1988 if they'd
have any reason to intervene on the mainland, I would have said no.
But in 1989, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, controversies involving the army here have been
small-scale: a dispute over customs checks, a few traffic
accidents, and a misunderstanding over nighttime firing practice in
villages in rural Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Liberation Army remains secretive, however. It set
up a telephone line for the media that goes unanswered, and it
ignores interview requests. Democratic politicians say that the
army should be more open and have more contact with society because
soldiers who befriend locals would hesitate to act against them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet mixing with locals would be difficult on a soldier's salary
of $66 a month. That is hardly enough for dinner for two in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   So contact has been limited to posing with locals for pictures.
The most startling exception occurred during a bizarre Open House
at the barracks on National Day, Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of curious locals stood in line for hours to get
tickets, and the atmosphere resembled a family picnic more than a
military tour. Parents pressed babies up for photos with soldiers.
Officers sang, danced, showed how they make beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this ... they seemed so severe and fierce. Now I'm
changing my opinion. They're quite friendly, singing and dancing,''
said Kwok Yuk-may, a 43-year-old housewife who joined in karaoke
with soldiers. ``Why should we be afraid of them? We're all
Chinese.''
