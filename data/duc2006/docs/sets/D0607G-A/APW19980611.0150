Central government to elected village officials: Operate openly
</HEADLINE>

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's villages must be run more openly and
democratically, top government and Communist Party leaders say in a
new order sent to rural communities, state media reported Thursday.
	   The circular says village leaders can no longer make decisions
in secret about spending public money for development projects,
leasing out farm land, birth control and distribution of relief
funds.
	   Democratic and open village government is needed to improve
relations between the ruling Communist party and the people and to
promote rural development and stability, according to the new
order, which was issued by the party's policy-making Central
Committee and the State Council, the highest government body.
	   China has had a national law establishing elections at the
village level since 1987. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has
promoted secret ballots, candidate speeches and fair election
procedures throughout the country.
	   But the new order suggested that elections alone have not
guaranteed that villages run their affairs democratically or have
been able to rid themselves of local bullies.
	   It also showed that the central government wants to ensure that
the countryside does not erupt in unrest. The order was played
prominently on the front page of the People's Daily, the main
newspaper of the Communist Party.
	   Rural people, who make up 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion
people, are the Communist Party's ``reliable force'' and ``the
broadest and deepest mass base for political power in our
country,'' the government's order said.
	   It called for several specific improvements in how China's 1
million villages are run.
	   Each village must post a report about village affairs at least
every three months. Villagers also are supposed to keep tabs on
their leaders by forming congresses of all village residents or
representatives. Leaders should make decisions based on the
majority's views, the order says.
	   Officials also are ordered to make public their own salaries and
performance reviews. The order also warns that vote buying is
illegal.
	   ``Malpractice by a few officials acting willfully regardless of
the villagers' wishes must be corrected resolutely,'' it said.
