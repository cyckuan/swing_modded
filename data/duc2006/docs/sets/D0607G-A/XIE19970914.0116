<HEADLINE> Employment Issue Not To Cause Social Unrest: Labor Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that although deepening economic reform will cause certain
pressure on employment, it will by no means touch off social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in
state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on
employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling
capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also minister of labor, quoted the report delivered
by Jiang Zemin at the congress as saying, "With the deepening of
enterprise reforms, technological progress and readjustment of the
economic structure, it would be hard to avoid the flow of
personnel and lay-off."
</P>
<P>
"But no such 'disastrous outcome' as predicted by some overseas
figures will go off," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
As far as Li was concerned, the employment situation in China
faces both challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Li explained that while the number of laid-off workers is to
increase in the wake of further reforms in state businesses, rapid
development in non-public sectors and joint stock partnership
businesses, on the other hand, will undoubtedly offer more job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The abundant labor resource in China, which totals 834 million
in number, does pose quite a headache to the country's employment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Each year, there are 10 million more people seeking jobs in
towns and cities. Many of them come from surplus factory worker
forces, which stand at a staggering 20 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, approximately 130 million peasants have become idle
in the rural areas, and may compete with urbanites for jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored
great achievements. Each year from 1992 to 1996, the newly
employed outnumbered the laid-offs by a margin of eight million,
thus maintaining an annual unemployment rate in urban areas at
about 3 percent throughout.
