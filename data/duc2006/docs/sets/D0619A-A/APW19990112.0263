<HEADLINE> Gay Renominated for Ambassadorship </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has renominated James Hormel  
as ambassador to Luxembourg, and a White House official said 
Tuesday the administration hopes ``fairness will prevail'' in the 
new Congress so he can be approved for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last year refused to vote on the nomination of Hormel  
after several conservative Republicans accused him of promoting 
homosexual views. The White House accused lawmakers of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, who is gay, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., didn't 
allow his nomination to come to the floor in the face of scattered 
GOP objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, expressed confidence Hormel  
would be approved by the full Senate this year because a majority 
back the 66-year-old San Francisco philanthropist and heir to the 
Hormel Meat Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the support of over 60 senators for the nomination in  
the last Congress and we felt that it was unfair that his 
nomination was not brought to the floor for a vote,'' Toiv said. 
``But we are hopeful that in the new Congress fairness will prevail 
and he will have a chance to have his nomination voted up or down. 
He is very well-qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's renomination was first reported in Tuesday's editions  
of the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Hormel was among a number of renominations Clinton  
submitted to the new Congress, which began its work this month. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, Hormel would be the first openly gay U.S. envoy.  
</P>
<P>
	Christian right groups had attacked Hormel, a vocal supporter of  
gay rights and AIDS causes, over his sponsorship of a gay and 
lesbian center at the San Francisco Public Library that bears his 
name. Republican critics called some of the material obscene and 
feared Hormel might promote a ``gay agenda'' as ambassador to the 
tiny European nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Senate last year, however, Hormel said he had  
no control over the books in the library and he rejected the notion 
he would promote gay rights while representing the United States 
overseas. He also promised not to bring his partner to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel must go through the entire nomination process again,  
including approval at the committee level before a Senate vote.
