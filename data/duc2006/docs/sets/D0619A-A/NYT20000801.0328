KOLBE BREAKS GOP ANTI-GAY BARRIER &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The content of Rep. Jim Kolbe's speech on
international trade Tuesday night at the Republican National
Convention was considerably less compelling than the fact that he
gave it at all.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-term representative from Tucson, Ariz. is the House of
Representatives' only openly gay Republican. His pre-prime-time
talk on trade relations might have gone down as yet another
unmemorable convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe's appearance itself was remarkable, given the strongly
anti-gay platform that Republican delegates approved Monday
objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed
extension of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a request by gay Republicans in April, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush invited Kolbe to speak at the convention's second
evening dedicated to the theme of ``Strength and Security with a
Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe told the convention in prepared remarks that if elected
president, Bush would expand trade. ``He will work to launch an
ambitious new round of global trade talks, and he will enforce
trade agreements and trade laws,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives had considered walking out when Kolbe
took the podium. However, Cathie Adams, a Texas delegate from
Dallas, said that instead, she would bow her head during the speech
to pray for gays to give up their ``unhealthy lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Wildmon, vice president of the Mississippi-based
American Family Association, commented that ``the things that these
homosexual advocates push for are contrary to everything that 90
percent of Republicans stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of this fazed Kolbe, 58, he didn't show it. When the Bush
campaign considered inviting him, ``they didn't say well, gee,
you'd be the right person to speak about trade, but we can't have
you do it because you're an openly gay Republican,''' he said in a
brief interview before the speech. ``The fact that it's a non-issue
is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to speak was seen as an effort by the Bush
campaign to show that platform notwithstanding, Bush means what he
says about being a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some social conservatives sought to downplay the significance of
Kolbe's speech. ``We're pleased with the substance in the platform
on the (gay) issue,'' said Charles Donovan, chief executive of the
Washington-based Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``this convention as a whole could send some
messages better than it's doing.'' He noted that while a gay person
_ Kolbe _ had been given a chance to address the convention, no
anti-abortion advocate received the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event.
``He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about,''
said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
Republican organization.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there is a future for gays in the Republican
Party, Kolbe responded: ``Of course there is. The fact that I'm
speaking tonight is evidence of that''
