EDITORIAL: REPUBLICANS AND THE GAY VOTE

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 12:
</P>

   Gay men and lesbians may be born homosexual, but they aren't
born Democrats. They have often voted that way, however, because
the national Republican Party has been so hostile. Now, in the ebb
of the great cultural wars mounted by conservatives for the last
two decades, that seems to be changing. The most prominent
Republican candidates for president in the next election, as
Katharine Seelye reported Wednesday in The Times, are taking
positions that are ``subtly but fundamentally more inviting'' to
gay and lesbian voters than at any time before.
</P>
<P>
   Some, boiled down, are not all that subtle. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush Jr. has said he would have no qualms hiring homosexuals.
Elizabeth Dole has declared that she would not turn away money from
a gay Republican group, as her husband did in the 1996 campaign.
The plain-spoken Sen. John McCain said he could envision a gay
president someday. But even the more subtle changes in the
candidate field are remarkable. When asked how he would react if
one of his children were homosexual, former Vice President Dan
Quayle, the standard-bearer of the religious right, said he would
be supportive ``whatever they are.'' The pugnacious Patrick
Buchanan, who declared ``a cultural war'' aimed squarely at
homosexuals from the podium of the Republican National Convention
in 1992, has not made the subject an issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a sea change. It was the Republican Party that
first turned anti-homosexual attitudes into a political weapon. It
was among Republicans in the Senate in the McCarthy era that the
witch hunt for homosexuals in government and the military began. It
was President Dwight Eisenhower who signed the executive order
making homosexuality grounds for rejection or dismissal from
federal employment, a directive that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, local
police and local Republicans and Democrats alike turned into a
decades-long hunt. It was the television preachers of the religious
right, reacting against the gay rights movement in the 1970s, who
began to set the social agenda for the modern Republican Party 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The height of their influence came with Pat Buchanan's and Pat
Robertson's speeches at the Republican Convention in 1992, but that
spring Bill Clinton reached out to homosexuals in a single
appearance at a gay fund-raiser in Hollywood. No nominee had done
that before, and the opposing party views produced a national gay
vote for the first time in the 1992 presidential election. It went
Democratic, and in states like Georgia, which Clinton won by only
16,000 votes, it may have been decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Republican oratory has been growing more moderate ever since. In
Congress, where Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi, have solid fundamentalist voter bases back home,
mean-spirited talk about homosexuals has continued. But Ralph Reed,
president of the Christian Coalition until last year, never made
homosexuals a national campaign issue after 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 15 months for this new tolerance to be tested.
But for now it is refreshing to listen to the voice of an important
preacher in the Republican Party, Rich Tafel, an ordained American
Baptist minister and the head of the national gay Log Cabin
Republicans. For years, he and other gay Republicans have been
feeling unwanted. Now, he says, ``the tone has totally changed.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be music to the ears of Democrats like Vice
President Al Gore, who has spent years being friendly to
homosexuals. But after half a century of jeers and police whistles,
it is a hopeful sound indeed.
