GAY RIGHTS SUPPORTERS IN HOUSE PREDICT DEFEAT OF HEFLEY AMENDMENT

   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican lawmakers predicted
Tuesday that the House will reject legislation that would nullify
President Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies from
discriminating against people based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to vote on the issue this week when Rep.
Joel Hefley, R-Colo., offers it as an amendment to a $28 billion
appropriations bill funding different government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will defeat Hefley,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
the only openly gay House Republican and a critic of the measure.
``But I never take these things for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said he ``wouldn't be surprised'' if the
Hefley measure is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some very hard work being done'' to defeat the
proposal, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said he expects the 20-minute debate on the Hefley
amendment to stay focused on the topic of discrimination against
gays and lesbians. Republican leaders, concerned that their party
could be perceived as anti-gay, had hoped to focus the debate on
presidential powers. To that end, the GOP House leadership had
combined Hefley's proposal with legislation to nullify another
executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of
state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Clinton last week rescinded the executive
order dealing with federalism, thus blunting the Republican move to
convert the gay-discrimination debate into a dry discourse on
constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual and a
leading congressional spokesman for gay rights, also predicted that
the Hefley amendment ``is likely to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about discrimination,'' Frank said. ``I think
most people don't want to be associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., who was among a group of Republicans
counting votes on the Hefley amendment, also predicted it would
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a number of members have looked at it and come to the
conclusion that it was mean-spirited,'' Foley said. He opposes the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., said Clinton's executive order
barring federal agencies from discriminating against gays ``is the
kind of thing we need to see more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's May executive order added ``sexual orientation'' to a
1969 executive order by President Richard Nixon, which bars federal
agencies from discriminating based on race, color, religion,
gender, national origin, disability or age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Democrat or a Republican issue,'' Bilbray said.
``When it comes to the workplace, we shouldn't tolerate any
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
advocacy group, said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the
Hefley amendment will fail because of opposition among House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress ``are being confronted with this issue
head-on without an escape hatch,'' Ivers said. ``This vote is
unlike any vote we've seen in years. It is a complete confrontation
between those who believe in discrimination and those who oppose
discrimination against gays. There is no middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House approved a measure aimed at San Francisco's
``domestic partners'' law. That ordinance requires private
contractors who do business with the city to bestow the same
benefits _ mainly health insurance coverage _ on the unmarried
partners of their employees as they confer on the spouses of their
married employees.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco policy was enacted two years ago after intense
lobbying by gay rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   By a 214-212 vote, the House approved a measure sponsored by
Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., that would bar San Francisco from
spending federal money unless the city revokes the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The Riggs amendment is expected to fail in the Senate.
