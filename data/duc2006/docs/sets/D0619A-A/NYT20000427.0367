 &HT;    Anti-gay group seek audience with Bush

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Anti-gay rights groups concerned about Gov.
George W. Bush's recent meeting with gay Republicans now want the
probable GOP presidential nominee to meet with them so they can
enlighten him about ``the homosexual political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The homosexual agenda is incompatible with family life,'' the
groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention, told Bush in a
letter saying he should meet with them to ``demonstrate your
commitment to the family by ... meeting with those of us who
believe that homosexual activism poses a serious threat to our
marriage-based culture and to the freedoms of speech, religion and
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush meets with pro-family
leaders ``all the time'' but no decision has been made on whether
he would sit down with the groups who sent the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He agrees with them on the importance of families and the
sanctity of marriage,'' McClellan said, adding, ``Governor Bush is
running an inclusive campaign and he welcomes the support of all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting request comes as Bush steps up his efforts to offer
a bipartisan and inclusive image that includes inviting support
from gay voters. After months of declining to meet with leaders of
the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, Bush earlier this
month huddled privately with 12 gay Republicans hand-picked by his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Included was former U.S. Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, who
said the session meant that ``never again will a major-party
candidate be able to run for president without addressing gay and
lesbian issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gunderson criticized the letter from the groups as
something less than a request for ``dialogue or honest
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a desire for a confrontation and an ultimatum,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson said the letter is indicative of how tricky the
equation is as Bush tries to put a more tolerant face on their
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the struggle within the Republican
Party is to hold together an increasingly diverse coalition,'' said
Gunderson. ``And we all need to help manage it. I would hope that
could be done in ways other than public debates through press
releases.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 groups said they want to tell Bush ``the facts behind the
homosexual political agenda that often go unreported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexual activists are trying to use the Republican Party,
much like the Democratic Party, as a vehicle to achieve their
strategic objective of harnessing government and corporate power to
impose acceptance of homosexual behavior,'' the groups told Bush,
adding that gay groups ``seek nothing less than the ability to
mandate teaching to schoolchildren that homosexuality is normal and
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal attack on the Boy Scouts is the most visible example
of where this agenda will lead if it is not firmly _ and actively _
opposed,'' the groups told Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments in a case
sparked by the Boy Scouts' expulsion of a New Jersey leader who is
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foray into gay issues also comes as some conservative
groups are angered over the Vermont Legislature's approval this
week of marriage-like ``gay unions,'' and shortly before Sunday's
``Millennium March'' in Washington that is expected to attract
300,000 supporters of gay rights. Organizers hope the rally will
highlight the issue in a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried to reach out to gay voters without embracing
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting with the gay Republicans, Bush said his
message to conservatives upset about the session would be, ``I
welcome gay Americans into my campaign. ... But I want the
conservative Republicans to understand that we judge people based
upon their heart and soul, and while we disagree on gay marriage,
for example, we agree on a lot of other issues and it's important
for people to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was a ``better person'' for having met with the gay
Republicans, and that their life stories were ``very compelling.''
Though he said he welcomed gay voters into his campaign, Bush
reiterated his opposition to initiatives of importance to that
community, including same-sex marriages, adoptions by gay couples
and expanding anti-hate crime laws to treat homosexuals in the same
manner as racial and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting upset some conservative Republicans, including
former presidential contender Gary Bauer who said it ``elevated the
gay rights agenda to a level of recognition within the Republican
Party that contradicts our long-standing commitment to pro-family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Bush, the conservative groups, including the
Family Research Council, the American Family Association and
Concerned Women for America, indicated that they agree with Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find that homosexual activists will not be satisfied
with the civil rights all Americans enjoy. They do not want
tolerance; that's what they have. They demand acceptance of their
lifestyle and protection for their practices. This will devastate
family life and wholly undermine your plans to restore the morale
of our military,'' the groups told Bush.
