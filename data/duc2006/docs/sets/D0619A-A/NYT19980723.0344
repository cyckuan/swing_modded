GOP LEADERS SEEK A WAY TO AVOID HOUSE DEBATE ON ANTI-GAY PROPOSAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders, nervous about possible
anti-homosexual remarks during floor debate on anti-gay
legislation, said Thursday that they have devised a strategy to
smother any fiery rhetoric on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to convert the debate over an anti-gay proposal into a
dignified discussion about presidential powers. And they will limit
the entire debate to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The touchy legislation, sponsored by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo.,
would nullify an executive order issued in May by President Clinton
that bars federal agencies from discriminating against gays.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in the House has combined the Hefley
proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order
expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a dry-as-dust constitutional debate about states
rights rather than a potentially emotional confrontation over the
hot-button issue of gay rights. The planned debate is expected as
early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual, said the
brevity of the scheduled debate ``shows how embarrassed (the
Republicans) are by this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very oppressive, outrageous and undemocratic way to
talk about things,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., who said it was his idea to blur
the debate over Hefley's amendment, said 20 minutes of debate was
more than enough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think five minutes is plenty on this issue,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee
responsible for helping elect House Republicans this November,
Linder said he ``did not want to see a debate on the floor over the
gay issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to see the debate be on the broader issue of
executive orders,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., the only openly gay House Republican,
agreed with Linder that an all-out debate on gay rights made him
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Koble said he was ``not anxious for a long debate on this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is not going to be terribly pleasant,'' Kolbe said.
``I don't think anybody's mind is going to be changed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Republican leaders resorted to the bundling tactic
because they realized there wasn't sufficient support among House
members for Hefley's anti-homosexual amendment if it stood alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hefley amendment became the damsel in distress,'' Frank
said. ``They're trying to use the other one to rescue Hefley.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said GOP leaders decided to combine the proposals
because they both deal with what Republicans claim is Clinton's
abuse of executive orders to circumvent Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the gay advocacy
group the Human Rights Campaign, said ``the Republicans sensed
defeat and then they backtracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay and lesbian issues are not a recipe for defeat'' for
Republicans, Stachelberg said. ``I think those who support equality
for gays and lesbians are more appealing to voters back home.
Voters want their members to treat people fairly and not to
discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans agreed with those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who isn't shy about taking
potshots at the GOP leadership, said in an interview he has been
``offended'' by his party's efforts to push through the Hefley
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment is designed to placate our so-called base,''
Shays said, referring to conservative Christian groups opposed to
homosexuality. ``I am being more and more offended by what people
feel our base is. I am pretty determined to speak out against any
statement that goes after gays and tries to dehumanize them for the
purpose of gilding our base. That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said the Hefley amendment ``comes off
as mean-spirited,'' adding: ``I saw this as a potentially explosive
issue.''
