<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the final days of his race for U.S. Senate in
California, Republican Matt Fong's stance on gay rights has become
a dominant concern.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub over Fong's recent contribution to an avowedly
anti-homosexual organization is delighting incumbent Sen. Barbara
Boxer and her fellow Democrats, who see the issue distracting Fong
and dividing Republicans before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was kicked up again Tuesday as religious
conservatives, led by a Sacramento lobbying group, attacked Fong,
the state treasurer, for pledging to support what it called a
``homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a candidate to cave in to the gay activists in the final
days of the campaign shows a complete lack of conviction,'' Michael
Bowman, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came a day after Fong signed a pledge to support
gay causes such as benefits for domestic partners and
anti-discrimination laws, part of an effort by Fong to quell the
anger of gay Republicans over his $50,000 contribution to the
Traditional Values Coalition, which is led by the Rev. Lou Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   The national Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, reaffirmed its
support for Fong. But the San Francisco chapter of the organization
withdrew its endorsement, citing Fong's link to Sheldon, an ardent
gay-rights opponent who at one time suggested quarantining people
with AIDS in ``cities of refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has pitted religious conservatives, who are active in
Republican politics, against gay and socially moderate Republicans,
who want the party to take a softer line on issues of concern to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   And Fong, who has sought to find a centrist position, finds
himself being attacked by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser in the Chinatown section of San Francisco
Tuesday night, Fong said he would be a ``unifier'' and bring the
state together, but steered clear of any direct mention of the
controversy over his donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a tremendous state made up of diversity,'' Fong told
300 supporters at the $200-per-person event. ``America is a great
country because we've always chosen hope over fear. We've always
chosen unity over division.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fong was less than eager to face questions related to his
$50,000 contribution. He canceled a public event and avoided
reporters at the Chinatown fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the candidate wasn't worried
about losing votes, either from gay Republicans or conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives have been with us from the beginning and will
continue to be with us,'' Schmidt said. ``No one has pulled their
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, however, criticized Fong for agreeing to support
domestic partnerships, or unions of unmarried people, which he said
promote homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the leading candidates both support the homosexual
agenda to weaken families and society, conservative voters don't
have much of a choice on Election Day,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials have tried to capitalize on the
division in the Fong camp. On Monday, Democratic strategist Bob
Mulholland faxed to gay groups around the state the story of Fong's
$50,000 contribution. On Tuesday, when Fong pledged his support for
gay issues, Mulholland faxed the story to Christian radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets squeezed on this issue,'' Mulholland said. ``Here it
is the last week, and this is what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials tried to downplay the issue, which
they described as a fringe struggle between GOP groups that will
never agree on a common agenda on gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters believe there are more important issues,'' said
Mike Madrid, political director for the Republican Party. ``The
people who this concerns made up their minds years ago.''
