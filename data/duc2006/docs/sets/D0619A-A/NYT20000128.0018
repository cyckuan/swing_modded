 CONNERLY OPPOSES ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Exposing a deep political fissure in the Republican
party, UC Regent Ward Connerly and several other prominent GOP
party members announced their opposition Thursday to Proposition
22, a measure on the March 7 ballot that would ban gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which was put on the ballot by state Sen.
William ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, is broadly supported by state
Republicans. But Connerly, who led the campaign for the
anti-affirmative action Proposition 209, said gay rights are a
matter of personal freedom and not an area where the government
should be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support two people having the right to do whatever they want
to do,'' said Connerly.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement by Connerly, GOP Senate candidate Tom
Campbell, and state Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose, comes on
the heels of several other public battles within the Republican
Party. Only last year, for example, a splinter group of moderate
state Republicans held an alternative convention to adopt a
pro-choice platform.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also comes as leaders are hoping the rank and file
will unite behind the party's candidates. In less than two weeks,
the state GOP will meet in Burlingame to adopt a party platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is symptomatic of the problems the party
has had for the past five years,'' said GOP consultant Mike Madrid.
``The base of the party has remained unchanged, while the
demographics in California have changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how do you broaden the base of the party when
the core is so intense on certain key issues?'' Madrid said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 22 deny that there is any division
among Republicans, citing the support of the California Republican
Party and 56 GOP members of the Legislature and congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all surprised to see the author of Prop. 209, one
of the most divisive measures ever introduced against Latinos, has
chosen to join forces with a campaign against marriage,'' said
Julio Calderon, a spokesman for the proposition, citing a survey
showing 67 percent of Latino voters support Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the California Republican League, a group
that promotes inclusion in the party, said such issues hurt
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this notion that we put this stuff on the ballot as a
`wedge' issue and promote wedge-issue politics _ it feeds the
notion that Republicans are into dividing people,'' said Gary
Zlotnick, the league's president.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly also said Republicans suffer from their public image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a more difficult time than the Democrats because
some think it is written somewhere that we should oppress gays,''
he said. ``Some people invoke the Bible and don't think it through.
But Democrats come out against the initiative and then dance around
the real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic presidential hopefuls, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have come out against the initiative
but oppose same-sex marriage.
