 &HT;    GAY REPUBLICANS SEE KOLBE SPEECH AS VICTORY

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Homosexual Republicans rejoiced, but religious
conservative delegates sat in silent protest Tuesday as their
party's only openly gay congressman addressed the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona did not mention sexual orientation in
his three-minute speech on free trade. But gay delegates and their
supporters said his presence on the podium in prime time was proof
that presidential candidate George W. Bush is serious about making
the GOP more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The gay Republicans are also heartened that the GOP presidential
campaign seems to be welcoming Mary Cheney, 31, the openly lesbian
daughter of vice-presidential pick Dick Cheney. She appeared with
her father in the convention hall on Monday night to the cheers of
the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty vivid reminder that gays are part of the
American family,'' said Kevin Ivers, communications director for
the Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' David Catania, an openly gay delegate and
councilman from the District of Columbia, said of Kolbe's speech.
``This is something that means a great deal to gay Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But other delegates disapproved of Bush's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the opportunity for radical gay rights advocates to
claim victory for their agenda,'' Texas GOP chair Susan Weddington
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of delegates in the Texas delegation sat with their heads
bowed and eyes closed as Kolbe spoke. One held up a sign saying,
``There is a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform opposes gay marriages, gays in the
military and express legal protection for sexual orientation.
Applause for Kolbe was restrained in comparison to the raucous
reception given to most speakers. The muted reaction was as close
to dissention as the convention has come in two evenings devoted to
showing a new, more tolerant face of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   After years of political rejection, gay Republicans and their
backers said the choice of Kolbe as a convention speaker furthered
the message of inclusion that Bush is sending through the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to see changes taking place at our convention,''
said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
In 1992, there were two openly gay GOP delegates, he recalled,
while this year there are 18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party that's trying to expand its base,'' said
Catania, who was among a dozen gay Republicans who met with Bush in
Austin in April. That meeting ended with disagreement on a lot of
issues, he conceded, ``but the governor agreed to keep an open
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great step in the right direction,'' said Fred
Ronstadt, Linda's cousin and a Tucson city councilman whose wife
works on Kolbe's campaign. ``Our party needs to be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, Kolbe
stressed he was chosen to speak because of his economic views and
not his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew there was such an interest in trade by the
media,'' joked Kolbe, as TV crews jostled for position in the
packed room. ``I want to thank Governor Bush for sending a message
of inclusion because I had been a McCain supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe, 58, acknowledged being gay in 1996, but has not been an
outspoken activist on gay issues. As chairman of an Appropriations
subcommittee, he has led overseas trade missions. In recent
sessions, he pushed for approval of the North American Free Trade
Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   For the convention, ``he was well chosen to be the spokesman for
free trade,'' said Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md.
