   WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans strongly opposed to elements of the
party's platform are running into roadblocks erected by social
conservatives who on Tuesday vowed to defend language opposing
same-sex marriages and homosexual service in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Traditional Values Coalition and the
Family Research Council, both conservative bastions of opposition
to gay rights, met Tuesday with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson,
chairman of the GOP committee that gathers in Philadelphia later
this week to hash out they party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt good about overall tenor of meeting, and it did sound
as if (the platform committee) would address some of our major
concerns,'' said Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's
vice president for public affairs. ``They don't want to sound
harsh. We're trying to work with them to find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans ``want to neuter the platform so that next time
they can come in and say homosexual marriage is OK and gays in the
military are OK,'' said Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the
Traditional Values Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   A platform that does not oppose gay rights would be ``a defeat
for pro-Christian, pro-family voters who are inclined to vote
conservative Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with other contentious social issues such as
abortion, the gay rights issue is something of a thorn in the side
of Republicans and their presidential hopeful, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Bush is intent on reaching out to voting blocs
such as Hispanics that have not traditionally been courted by
Republicans. On the other hand, reaching out to gays would cost him
critical support from social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the social conservatives want to block efforts
to eliminate the 1996 platform's stand against giving gays
protection under civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, an association of gay Republicans,
and their supporters want to excise language favoring a ban on gays
in the military, and supporting the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act,
which permits states not to recognize same-sex marriages performed
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute goes into its final stages this Friday and Saturday
when the GOP platform committee hashes out the final draft of the
party's 2000 platform in Philadelphia. Republicans attending the
convention then vote on the platform on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, gay Republicans say they give the Bush campaign
high marks for steering the party away from a confrontational tone.
Hostility to gays, for instance, surfaced in the 1992 GOP
convention when conservative candidate Patrick Buchanan called for
a ``cultural war'' against advocates of gay rights and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind there's effort by the Bush camp to
send a message,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin
Republicans, noting that for the first time an openly gay member of
Congress, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., will address the convention.
``We appreciate their efforts. We understand it's a hassle for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 GOP platform states: ``We reject the distortion of
(civil rights) laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the
Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to
recognize same-sex unions.''
</P>
<P>
   It also says: ``We oppose Bill Clinton's assault on the culture
and traditions of the Armed Forces, especially his attempt to lift
the ban on homosexuals in the military. We affirm that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service.''
</P>
<P>
   In line with Bush's effort to reach out, Thompson met with the
Log Cabin Republicans earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's spokesman, Kevin Keane, did not hold out much hope
for the gay Republican strategy. ``It all comes down to the 107
(platform committee) delegates who vote on what's in, and what's
not in, the platform,'' he said. ``I suspect it'll be tough to
change anything because the 107 delegates are from the more
conservative end of spectrum.''

   Bush himself met with 12 prominent gay Republicans in April and
declared himself ``a better person'' for having listened to their
pleas for greater inclusion in the GOP ranks. Still Bush did not
change his views, which run mostly parallel to the 1996 GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
   The gays in the military issue is an exception. Bush has said he
supports the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy that
permits gays in the military as long as they don't engage in
homosexual activity, and he opposes a return to a total ban on gays
in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tafel said gay Republicans are trying to look past the
Republican platform debate to the convention itself and Bush's
campaign against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some language unites and some pushes people out, and my sense
is (Bush) wants language that unites,'' Tafel said. ``The language
there now doesn't do that. But at the same time it's not something
the (Bush campaign) completely controls.''
