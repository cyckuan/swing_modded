   And Merante notes that there are some benefits to being an
openly gay candidate. ``It can be easier to raise money and recruit
volunteers, and a more moderate candidate can gain support among
some liberal non-gay voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Money, obviously, plays an important role in campaigns. And in
California, San Diego City Councilor Christine Kehoe, a
congressional candidate and lesbian, had raised $705,624 through
the end of June, as compared with GOP incumbent Brian Bilbray's
$650,123, according to Federal Election Commission figures.
</P>
<P>
   That cash is expected to give Kehoe _ the Democratic nominee _ a
strong chance to become the first openly gay woman elected to
national office. It is a title that Tracy would like, as would
Tammy Baldwin, in Wisconsin, or retired Army Colonel Margarethe
Cammermeyer in Washington, who was discharged from the military in
1992 after saying she was a lesbian. Both are running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other congressional candidates, they are offering
themselves as candidates who happen to be gay, not gay candidates.

   In 1974 _ the year after the American Psychiatric Association
erased homosexuality from its compendium of mental illnesses _
Elaine Noble, openly gay, was elected to the Massachusetts
Legislature. She is believed to have been the first openly gay
person ever elected to a state office anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a trickle of openly gay candidates,
and more like Frank, who ``came out'' after serving in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any minority that feels oppressed is going to be more
politicized than the mainstream,'' says Merante. ``Issues such as
family life, taxes, and inheritance are problems if you are gay and
tend to make people think and act politically.''
</P>
<P>
   But one reason for the gay community's relatively quick fluency
in politics is AIDS, say gay activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS brought gay people to the fore like no other thing had,''
says Mary Bonauto, civil rights director for Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders. ``The community was ravaged and had to
come out to their families, interact with the medical system in a
way they had not before. Doctors and nurses saw committed, caring
relationships between men, people caring for their partners to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank says he doubts he would have won his tough first election
if he had announced in 1980 that he was gay. But, he says, the more
that people come out, the more it diminishes prejudices. ``It is a
very powerful force, a very successful reality check, and the
average American is a lot less homophobic that he or she thinks
they are supposed to be,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the double-digit number of gay candidates in
Massachusetts is that it is, well, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Victory Fund, there are 12 openly gay elected
officeholders in the state, from municipal officials in Cambridge
and Northampton to state Representative Liz Malia and Frank. It is
the highest number of gay officeholders, per capita, in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay and lesbian candidates feel they no longer have to hide in
the closet, especially within the Commonwealth,'' says Dana
Hilliard, a candidate from Newburyport running for a state
legislative seat. ``It is a sign of how accepting this state is.''
Hilliard has served three terms as a state representative in New
Hampshire _ but when he campaigned in the Granite State, he was not
open about his sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller says that ``Massachusetts is a special case; the
political atmosphere here is more open. Michael Duffy is running on
the Republican ticket'' for state auditor. In fact, the only other
Republican candidate in either the Massachusetts or congressional
races who is openly gay, is US Representative Jim Kolbe, of
Arizona. Like Frank, Kolbe announced his sexual orientation after
several terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also credits former Governor William Weld, a Republican
who supported the gay movement, with helping make Massachusetts a
more tolerant state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working on `In Search of Gay America,' I went to
Mississippi to interview a gay Republican, and when word got out
that he might be gay, he withdrew from the race,'' recalls Miller.
``Almost all of these people are Democrats, and that is really
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goshko, the local president of the Log Cabin, an
organization of gay Republicans, notes that recruiting candidates _
gay or straight _ to run for office has been harder for Republicans
than Democrats. ``In Massachusetts, the Democratic Party has much
higher registration, and recruiting GOP candidates has been a
general problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Goshko says, ``This is the year that the
floodgates have opened for gay candidates. Until this year really,
fairly few people would run.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Noble, the pioneer in 1974, think about the number of
candidates?
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand,'' she says, ``it surprises me there are so
many, and on the other, it saddens me there are so few. And it is
sad that folks say `You are gay' before they say `What are your
stands on the issues?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I feel like a grandmother sitting off in the
corner, clucking. Win, lose, or show, they do advance issues
tremendously, and they are all smart and bright. Even if they come
in last, they have won by being there.''
