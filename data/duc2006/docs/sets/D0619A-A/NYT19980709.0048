 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Homophobia and demagoguery in the GOP
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget all that stuff about hating the sin but loving the
sinner. House Republicans are about to go after the sinners. A vote
is imminent on a provision supported by the leadership, and thus
likely to pass, that would cancel President Clinton's recent
executive order barring discrimination against gays and lesbians
who work for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Most federal agencies already had nondiscriminatory policies,
though with slight differences here and there. The main effect of
Clinton's order is to impose uniformity, so what's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   The big deal is that in its thralldom to the religious right and
its increasing tilt to ideological rather than to pragmatic
conservatism, the Republican Party has gone from being just a
little cracked about homosexuality to being outright peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly cited as evidence of that have been the recent
declarations by Senate and House Majority Leaders Trent Lott and
Dick Armey that homosexuality is a sin, but both men were only
answering questions they didn't seem pleased to have been asked and
sin is a religious, not a political, judgment. They are welcome to
it.
</P>
<P>
   (Though Lott also seemed to think homosexuality is a mental
disorder or an addiction. The American Psychiatric Association
concluded otherwise 25 years ago, in effect finding that most folks
are heterosexual but a few are not and there you are.)
</P>
<P>
   Far more disturbing is the worsening demagoguery of the party
and its candidates in demonizing gays and lesbians as a shortcut to
office.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the U.S. House of Representatives on the verge of all but
endorsing job discrimination against gays and lesbians by
disallowing an order forbidding that.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican Party recently denied recognition at its
convention to the Log Cabin Republicans, a sobersided club of gay
Republicans. And when the group complained, delegates unleashed a
torrent of abuse, with state leaders comparing it to the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is blocking the appointment of a gay as ambassador to
Luxembourg. (In the course of which issue Sen. James Inhofe,
R-Okla., likened the nominee to the former KKK Grand Wizard David
Duke. Klan analogies apparently are going around.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's GOP gubernatorial primary in Nebraska sank into a
contest in homophobia, with candidates competing in the vigor of
their oaths to block homosexual marriage, which the conservative
state legislature has never even considered.
</P>
<P>
   Republican primaries in South Carolina, too, have set off a
bidding war in anti-gay rhetoric, most bizarrely with a would-be
agriculture commissioner declaring homosexuality a threat to family
farms. ``You can't have farming based on having Bob and Bob being
married,'' said Jim Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   All this posturing is put about as a defense of morality but it
is no such thing. Republican candidates in many places no longer
can win without certification from fundamentalist Christian
pulpits, and as one GOP ally put it, when Republicans are quoting
the Bible and Democrats are citing the American Psychiatric
Association, Republicans win.
</P>
<P>
   Count on it: When politics is talking about saving souls, it is
thinking about counting heads.
