   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of influential Christian groups has
launched a national ad campaign attacking homosexuality, igniting a
firestorm of protest Tuesday as the religious right gears up for
the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader from
Mississippi who recently likened gays and lesbians to alcoholics
and kleptomaniacs, the $200,000 ad blitz characterizes homosexuals
as sinners in need of Christian healing.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial campaign, widely seen as an effort by the
Christian right to provide indirect support for congressional
candidates who promote the movement's agenda, sparked outrage among
gay rights leaders and produced the unintended consequence of
exposing a major rift in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP candidates facing tough elections in key races tried
to distance themselves from the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really wrong for both the Republican Party and the
country,'' said Peter G. Torkildsen, a Massachusetts Republican
trying to regain the seat he narrowly lost in 1996 to
Representative John F. Tierney, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that it serves any useful purpose at all,''
Torkildsen said. ``It incites fear in people, and it is not the
traditional Republican role for the government to intervene in
people's private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign is funded largely by the Christian Coalition,
whose chairman, Pat Robertson, sought the GOP nomination for
president in 1988, and the Family Research Council, whose leader,
Gary Bauer, is considered a prospective Republican contender for
the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In full-page ads this week in the New York Times, the Washington
Post and USA Today, the coalition promotes the highly disputed
theory that people become homosexuals by choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is not a sex issue, it's a heart issue,'' one ad
stated. ``There are problems for homosexuals even condoms can't
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, which advocates gay and lesbian rights, said numerous
medical and mental health groups have agreed in recent decades that
homosexuality is not a product of personal choice. Birch asserted
the ads were part of an effort by the Christian groups to promote
their agenda in association with GOP congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recently met with Lott and other key Republicans in
the House and Senate to push for the religious right's priorities,
as did James Dobson, who heads the Family Research Council's parent
group, Focus on the Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're seeing some of the fruits of that alliance,'' Birch
said. ``They are using these very manipulative ads to throw red
meat to the firebrand, extreme-right, grass-roots wing of the
Republican Party. It's nothing more than a crass political move in
an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said the Human Rights Campaign was buying a full-page ad
in today's editions of USA Today to counter the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Owens, a Christian Coalition spokesman, denied the ad
campaign was aimed at providing support for Lott and other
congressional leaders who have stepped up their criticism of
homosexuality since Robertson and Dobson visited Capitol Hill
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This message is not emanating from the GOP,'' Owens said.
``It's a non-partisan message based on the mainstream concern about
the decline of morality in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said the advertising campaign would continue, although he
declined to provide details. He asserted the impetus for the
campaign was to defeat the push for broader homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subject most Americans, including us, would rather
not have to address, but since it is being advanced by the gay
lobby, somebody needs to respond and provide some leadership,''
Owens said. ``The pro-family movement is doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's Washington Post, the ad displayed a photograph of a
large group of people who claim they no longer are homosexuals
because of ``God's healing love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're standing for the truth that homosexuals can change,''
the ad stated. The ad thanks Lott and former Green Bay Packers star
Reggie White, among others, ``for having the courage to speak the
truth about sexual sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is one
of two openly gay members of Congress, challenged the assertion
that individuals choose their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anybody who told me they decided to be
homosexual or heterosexual,'' he said. ``Virtually every gay man or
women I know was terribly upset when they first figured it out. The
notion that people voluntarily choose this is just nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said studies have shown that people who believe
individuals choose their sexual orientation are more likely to
discriminate against homosexuals. He asserted the ads were aimed at
building opposition to antidiscrimination initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homophobia is losing the cultural war,'' Frank said, ``so they
are doing this to try to pump up their side in the political
arena.''
