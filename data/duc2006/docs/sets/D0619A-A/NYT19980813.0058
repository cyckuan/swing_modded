GAY REPUBLICANS VENTURE DEEP INTO ENEMY TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans call it the Selma of their own
civil rights movement: Dallas, where the religious right dominates
the GOP the way liberals dominate politics in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Dallas two months ago that the spokesman for the Texas
Republican Party, Robert Black, called the Log Cabin Republicans a
``deviant group'' like the Ku Klux Klan and denied the gay
organization a booth at the state party convention. ``We don't
allow pedophiles, transvestites and cross-dressers, either,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a gay Republican in Texas is a little like being a black
Democrat in Mississippi in the 1950s,'' said Dale Carpenter, Texas
director of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``You're involved in a party
that doesn't really want you, where you're excluded, discriminated
against, segregated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Log Cabins protested their exclusion from the
convention, they were met with venomous counterprotesters who
shouted slurs, shoved and pushed them and waved signs saying ``God
Hates Fags.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is in Dallas this weekend that about 200 Log Cabin
Republicans from around the country will gather for the group's
national convention, challenging the GOP to come to terms with the
gays and lesbians in their own ideological family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the radical statement of the gay civil rights movement
is that you can be gay and be anything,'' said Carpenter. ``We are
everywhere in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Log Cabin Executive Director Rich Tafel said gay Republicans
should fight rather than switch parties _ to prevent the GOP from
becoming a Republican version of George Wallace Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a Republican and you believe in individual rights,
less government and free markets, the Republican Party holds those
principles still,'' Tafel said. ``Gay Republicans are simply
saying, `We're staying and fighting for those principles.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpening the irony of the debate, the Log Cabin Republicans
have invited two conservative icons to address their convention:
University of California Regent Ward Connerly and Washington
political pundit Arianna Huffington. Connerly once said that the
vitriol he heard when announcing his support for gay domestic
partner benefits was worse than anything he heard in his battles to
end affirmative action. Huffington has rebuked her fellow
conservatives for their intolerance of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The group also invited Andrew Sullivan, a prominent gay Catholic
activist who advocates gay marriage as a conservative family value.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gay rights is part of a larger _ and more
politically dangerous _ battle over the direction of the Republican
Party. Connerly and his allies in the party's libertarian wing
believe that the GOP should represent limited government, low taxes
and individual freedom _ including the freedom to live as a gay
person. On the other wing are the social or religious
conservatives, whose greatest concern is what they see as America's
moral decline, reflected by crime and the breakup of the
traditional family unit.
</P>
<P>
   For social conservatives, homosexuals embody all that is wrong
with America _ a deviant lifestyle that in their view subverts
religious and family values. Like abortion, the gay movement evokes
the kind of emotional force that can bring social conservatives
running to the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just what the GOP needs this November, when control
of the House of Representatives will hinge on which party can best
energize its core supporters. A net loss of just 11 seats would
return the House to the Democrats and deliver a devastating blow to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservative activists such as Gary Bauer, head of the
Family Research Council and a potential presidential contender, and
James Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show, have
made homosexuality a major campaign theme, running full-page
advertisements in major newspapers about how ``ex-gays'' renounced
their homosexual lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that the party is very uncomfortable
with,'' said an aide to a high-ranking House Republican. ``For some
segments of the party, the whole gay issue is taboo, and the Gary
Bauers of the world exert a lot of influence on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But some party leaders are taking steps to address the matter
head-on. For the first time, the chairman of the Republican
National Committee, Jim Nicholson, will meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy the support not just of straight Republicans and
straight Americans, but gay and bisexual Americans as well,'' said
party spokesman Mike Collins. ``We want their support. They want
lower taxes, they want a balanced budget, they want to take people
off welfare and give them jobs. We're doing that. And we welcome
their support.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Collins' comments reflect a considerable fear within the party
that anti-gay rhetoric will cast the GOP as intolerant or bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   A former official in President George Bush's administration who
is homosexual contends that some party conservatives see the gay
issue as a way to ``throw some red meat to the religious
conservatives, at minimal risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that even former Christian Coalition head Ralph
Reed is urging Republicans to back away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tone of intolerance and exclusion plays very badly in
today's America, and only somebody with a political tin ear would
think that you improve your position by gay bashing or anyone-else
bashing. . . . Every time you have this sort of `we want to tell
you how to run your life' behavior, it makes it harder for
Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest to gain ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pinkerton, a former political strategist for Bush, said that
while religious conservatives may think promoting anti-gay views is
a good idea, the Republican Party as a whole does not.
</P>
<P>
   The party is having a difficult time accommodating both sides.
And the public itself is of two minds: Polls consistently show that
a large majority of the public condemns discrimination but at the
same time does not approve of homosexuality _ or bringing ``queer
values to suburbia,'' as Pinkerton put it.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton argues that Republicans do need the support of social
conservatives. ``But they should find better ways to do it,'' he
says, ``by promoting such issues as school choice that animate
religious conservatives, libertarians and minorities alike who are
dissatisfied with public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay Republican in the
House, said many of his colleagues ``sincerely wish this thing
would not come up and not be voted on, because of the obvious
conflicts it puts them in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Republicans see no conflict. Party spokesman Robert
Black defended the decision to exclude the Log Cabin Republicans
from the GOP convention, saying individuals are free to participate
in the state party, but not ``narrow special interest groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Christian Coalition was allowed a booth, Black
said, ``OK, let me redefine that. A special interest group that is
so fundamentally at odds with the core principles of the Republican
party. Republicans, at least here in Texas, by and large are
against homosexuality. That's not really news. It's in our
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tafel said that is why the Log Cabin Republicans will be in
Dallas this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really view Texas as the frontlines of the gay movement,''
Tafel said. ``It's important for the gay community, in general,
that gay Republicans stay and fight because that's the frontlines,
that's where the battles are taking place.''
