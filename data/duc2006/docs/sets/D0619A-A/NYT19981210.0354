LAWMAKER BACKS BILL BANNING GAYS FROM ADOPTING CHILDREN IN TEXAS

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A West Texas legislator is sponsoring a bill
that would ban gays and lesbians from becoming foster parents or
adopting children in state custody, prompting a sharp attack from a
gay Republican group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is offensive, and I think any fair-minded individual
will find this bill to be offensive,'' said Steve Labinski,
president of Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, which advocates equal
treatment of homosexuals in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, filed this week by state Rep. Warren Chisum,
R-Pampa, would direct Child Protective Services not to place
children in homes with homosexual parents and defines their sexual
practices as ``deviate.''
</P>
<P>
   Private adoptions would not be affected, but thousands of
children at risk could be. Currently the state oversees 17,578
foster children and last year approved 1,548 adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Labinski called Chisum's proposal ``unrepublican'' and said it
hardly echoes the concept of ``compassionate conservatism''
championed by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Chisum, however, maintains that his research shows homosexual
parents place children at risk of an unhealthy lifestyle, illegal
activity or an unstable home life. Chisum considers homosexual acts
illegal under the state's sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is not about any rights of gays and lesbians to be
parents,'' said Chisum, who sponsored an unsuccessful bill in the
1997 legislative session that said Texas would not recognize gay
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill ensures that the state will provide the best
possible homes for children who have already been abused and
neglected,'' Chisum said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could erupt into a divisive debate should it hit the
floor of the Texas House when the Legislature meets next year.
State Rep. Glen Maxey, an Austin Democrat and the only openly gay
legislator, has said any law or policy that authorized such a
``witch hunt'' would ``create a world of hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill responds to a dispute last year when Dallas CPS
caseworker Rebecca Bledsoe was disciplined after abruptly removing
an infant from the home of a lesbian foster parent. Bledsoe said
she was told she had failed to show respect for the foster mother.
She filed a lawsuit against the state in September, and the
American Civil Liberties Union intervened the following month to
argue against Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   CPS officials have said Bledsoe wrongfully removed the child,
violating agency policy because she did not notify the child's
foster mother or the child's attorney first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a placement that is going to best meet these
kids' needs who have been abused or neglected. We simply do not
screen based on sexual preference or sexual orientation,'' said
Marla Sheely, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Protective
and Regulatory Services, the umbrella agency for CPS.
</P>
<P>
   Homes are screened to ensure safe environments, whether the
parents are ``green, purple, gay, straight, whatever,'' Sheely
said.
