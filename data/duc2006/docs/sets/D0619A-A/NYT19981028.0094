 &HT;    Ebner accuses Maxey of gay bashing in race for Texas House
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Because the Texas House race between Democratic
incumbent Glen Maxey and Republican challenger Fred Ebner is the
first in Texas history to feature two openly gay candidates, you'd
think the two men would find it difficult to feud over the issue of
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign for Austin's District 51 has taken a strange
turn in its final days: Ebner and other gay Republicans are
accusing Maxey _ the only openly gay member of the Texas House and
an outspoken gay rights advocate _ of gay-baiting. Maxey,
meanwhile, says Ebner is misleading voters about his sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   A recent campaign mailing by Maxey sparked the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet points out that Ebner is gay, highlights his
membership in the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and notes his
support for expanding the state's anti-discrimination laws to
include sexual orientation. It also points out that Ebner is
pro-choice and supports the legalization of marijuana for medicinal
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey ``supports these issues too,'' the leaflet says, but
unlike Ebner, Maxey ``will tell you where he stands.'' It doesn't
say that Maxey is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Ebner and the Log Cabin Republicans say the leaflet appears to
have been sent only to people who voted in the Republican primary,
and was intended to dampen GOP turnout by highlighting Ebner's
sexual orientation and some of his socially moderate stands. Maxey
declined to identify the target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like very much for him to have distributed the same
thing in Clarksville and Travis Heights,'' said Ebner, referring to
two neighborhoods that are particularly liberal in a district that
is among the most Democratic in the state. ``I'd like them to know
that he's indulging in gay-bashing in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebner said he considers his sexuality to be ``a private and
personal matter which is irrelevant to holding public office,''
while Maxey has ``made a lifetime career of advocating a
left/liberal approach to gay issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said he sent the mailing because Ebner attacks him for
being a gay advocate when he speaks to broader audiences, but tells
gay groups that he can better represent their interests. He said
the leaflet didn't mention that he was gay because it is already
well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said he isn't gay-baiting because it was Ebner who
injected sexual orientation into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard him twice now call me a professional gay
activist,'' Maxey said. ``He's put up by the Log Cabin Republicans,
a gay group, and then criticizes me for being a gay activist? Give
me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said the Log Cabin Republicans recruited Ebner to ``spit
in the eye'' of the Republican party by showing that a gay,
socially moderate Republican could do better against Maxey than an
anti-gay conservative one. The platform of the Texas Republican
Party states that homosexuality ``is contrary to the fundamental,
unchanging truths that have been ordained by God'' and opposes gay
marriage and the repeal of sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans deny they recruited Ebner, who ran for
Austin City Council in 1987. Steve Labinski, who is president of
the group's Texas chapter, dismissed the idea that Ebner's campaign
is designed to send a message to the Republican Party. He said
Ebner ``honestly believes that a mainstream Republican can better
represent the voters of District 51 than Glen Maxey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mailout was identical to a mailout that would be sent by
the Christian Coalition or the Texas Family Association for the
same purpose: to inflame voter homophobia.'' Labinski said. ``This
is gay-baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Hardy-Garcia of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of Texas,
which doesn't endorse candidates, questioned why a gay Republican
would want to target an outspoken defender of gay rights. She said
the leaflet was ``hard-hitting, and a little bit harsh,'' but
declined to describe it as gay-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen's borne the brunt of being a gay politician in this state
for a long time, so I imagine that he's frustrated about Ebner not
being open about it,'' she said. ``Maybe there will be a day when
sexual orientation won't make a difference and I look forward to
that day. But it hasn't happened yet, and no one knows that more
than Glen Maxey.''
