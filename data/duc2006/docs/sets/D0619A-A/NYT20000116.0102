 &HT;    Bush sends mixed signals on gay, lesbian policy

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush has vowed to bring minority groups into the GOP fold. But
members of one minority group _ gays and lesbians _ still aren't
sure whether Bush's emphasis on inclusiveness includes them.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent debate, Bush said he would appoint people based
on their qualifications, not their sexual orientation. But he has
refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP group.
Gay-rights advocates hold positions in the Bush campaign. But the
governor promised a group of Christian conservatives that as
president he wouldn't appoint people who espouse a homosexual
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's mixed signals reflect the complexities of cultivating a
relationship with the gay community. If he embraces it, Bush could
lose Christian conservative votes in the GOP primaries or, in the
general election, against a socially conservative third-party
candidate such as Pat Buchanan. But exit polls suggest that gay
voters make up about 5 percent of the electorate _ about the same
as Hispanics _ and they are concentrated in electoral-vote-rich
states such as California, New York, Illinois and Florida.
Conceding so many votes to the Democrats could be politically
perilous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of gay people who by tradition and heritage
would be much more at home in the Republican Party, were it not for
things like George Bush being embarrassed to be seen with
homosexuals,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor
at Hunter College in New York City who studies gay rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the country becomes increasingly tolerant of homosexuality,
Bush's lukewarm attitude may alienate heterosexual voters as well,
Sherrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strikes me as a classic example of what happens when a
candidate adopts a strategy that's designed to win the nomination,
even at the cost of losing the election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley haven't been bashful about courting the gay vote,
which could be especially critical in their fight for the
Democratic nomination. People who identify themselves as gay make
up between 8 percent and 9 percent of the Democratic electorate
nationwide, and slightly more in the crucial primary states of New
York and California.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent debate, both Democrats argued that the current
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military isn't
working and that gays should be allowed to serve openly. Gore and
Bradley are cognizant of polls that show 70 percent of Americans
support that view, although 76 percent of senior military officers
oppose it. Furthermore, in the wake of several high-profile murders
of gays, people are increasingly sensitive to the dangers of
discrimination. Even the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Virginia preacher
who founded the Moral Majority, has called for an end to anti-gay
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent GOP debate, several Republican candidates said
gays should be banned from the military and characterized them as
immoral. But Bush and his closest rival, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, declined to criticize homosexuality and said they support
the current policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, however, McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans.
Asked during a television interview to explain his refusal to meet
with the group, Bush said he didn't believe in ``group thought'' or
``pitting one group of people against another.'' Many were puzzled
by that explanation, given that Bush frequently meets with other
political and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan shed little light on that
response, saying Bush refused to meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans because they politicize gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not believe in politicizing the issue, and this is a
group that wants to politicize it,'' McClellan said. He added that
Bush didn't see the point of meeting with the group because he
disagrees with its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the Bush campaign say whether the governor agrees with
the Texas GOP's platform position on gays and lesbians, which is
that ``homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental,
unchanging truths that have been ordained by God.'' Instead,
campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that Bush believes that
``it's not his place to judge other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Texas legislative record also is open to interpretation.
Rep. Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas
Legislature, describes Bush as ``pretty benign'' because whatever
his policy positions, he hasn't resorted to anti-gay rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a Jesse Helms,'' Maxey (D-Austin) said in a reference
to the conservative North Carolina senator. ``But at a time when
there's a tremendous rise in hate crimes, and discrimination in the
workplace still abounds, the fact that a leader would not see gay
and lesbian issues as important or take a position one way or the
other is troubling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When state lawmakers last year proposed a bill barring gays and
lesbians from adopting children in state custody, Bush said he
believed that children were better off in homes with traditional
couples. But the state already favors such arrangements, and Bush
wouldn't say whether he supported the bill, which would have
removed children from gay and lesbian homes. The legislation never
reached his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also declined to take a firm position last year on a
hate-crimes bill that would have listed homosexuals as a protected
group. He argued that all violent crimes are hate crimes and noted
that Texas already has a hate-crimes law, albeit one that doesn't
specify who is protected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to consider the latest version if lawmakers
approved it, but he declined to help break the legislative deadlock
that eventually killed the proposal. Gay rights groups suspected
that the bill's protection of gays was behind his failure to
support the bill, but Bush denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Like presidential candidates from both parties, Bush opposes
same-sex marriages. The Democrats want to guarantee legal and
financial benefits to gay and lesbian partnerships, but they
maintain that marriage is a religious and cultural institution
reserved for a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has had a fair record, and many gays believe he's been a
good governor. But he does need to move more on some gay political
issues,'' said Steve Labinski, who heads the Texas branch of the
Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Texas Republicans note that during the party's 1998
convention, Bush urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin
Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey suspects that some of Bush's positions are the result of
political considerations rather than his personal views. He points
to a conversation he had with Bush last spring on the floor of the
Texas House. Maxey said the governor told him his stance on the gay
adoption bill had nothing to do with his view of Maxey, whom he
``valued as a person.'' Based on that talk, Maxey believes that
Bush is a lot more tolerant of gays than his record might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, said later that the two discussed children's
health insurance, not homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Madison Project, a conservative political action
committee, came away from a September meeting with Bush with a
different impression than Maxey. Michael Farris, the chairman of
the group, said he asked Bush about his comment that he wouldn't
fire an aide he discovered to be gay. Farris was reassured by
Bush's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I'm not going to appoint people who are open advocates
of the homosexual lifestyle because their policies aren't likely to
be my policies on issues,'' Farris said. Openly gay people serve on
some of Bush's state steering committees, but Farris said he is not
bothered by that because the panels are mostly honorary.
Furthermore, Farris believes that Bush has genuinely conservative
views ``in his heart'' about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Republicans hope Farris is wrong and that Bush is simply
doing what he must to win the GOP primaries. They say he may be
more receptive to gays once he's the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the national Log Cabin Republicans,
said Bush should be well aware of the importance of creating a
tolerant image for the GOP in the general election. Ivers argues
that Buchanan's anti-gay remarks at the 1992 Republican convention
tarnished the party, helping to seal the failure of President
George Bush's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the Republican Party deals with gays and lesbians is an
indication of how it's going to deal with this persistent problem
they have of being labeled as intolerant,'' Ivers said. ``The gay
issue is the most hot-button issue of all the minority issues in
this election.''
