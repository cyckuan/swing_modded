GAY GROUPS DIFFER OVER WHETHER GOP WAS GOOD FOR THEIR CAUSE &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As Republicans wrapped up their convention
intended to highlight inclusiveness, gay political organizations
squared off Thursday over whether the party has a newfound
moderation toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the nation's largest gay political organization said
the GOP national convention demonstrated ``meanness'' toward gays
and that the election of presidential nominee George W. Bush and
his running mate Dick Cheney would be a setback for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict is in,'' Winnie Stachelberg, political director
for the Human Rights Campaign, said as Bush prepared to deliver his
acceptance speech. ``A Bush-Cheney administration has the potential
to be very harmful for gays and lesbians. ... It is clear that the
kinder, gentler face we see at the convention is nothing more than
a facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, the group's executive director, said that the
four-day affair was disappointing, even though the GOP sought to
soften hard-line opposition to homosexual rights by allowing Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., to address delegates. Kolbe is openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   The gay rights officials spoke at a news conference in
Washington, D.C. The Human Rights Campaign already has endorsed
Vice President Al Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said she was ```very disturbed'' by the GOP platform,
which included language gay Republicans wanted removed. Birch said
``a kind of meanness won out'' when the platform was finalized on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The platform defines marriage ``as the legal union of one man
and one woman.'' It says that ``federal judges and bureaucrats
should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as
marriages.'' And the platform further says that homosexuals should
be exempt from anti-discrimination laws and that homosexuality is
incompatible with military service.
</P>
<P>
   Stachelberg said a low point for gays at the Republican
convention was on Tuesday as Kolbe spoke to delegates in a
four-minute speech on international trade. Several members of
Bush's own Texas delegation removed their cowboy hats and bowed
their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Birch noted the irony of the Republican position, saying that
Cheney's daughter Mary is openly lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of Mary Cheney as an openly lesbian person shines
a light on the fact that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have
positions of grave concern to gay and lesbian people in this
country,'' Birch said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the
country's largest organization for gay Republicans, said despite
the Kolbe incident and the platform, the convention was by far the
most successful ever for homosexual Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ivers said that the ``old social conservative paradigm'' in the
Republican party this week ``is showing signs that is is
crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen real advances this week,`` he said, pointing to a
platform committee that had initially removed the anti-gay
language, only to be overruled by conservatives. The fact that
Kolbe was asked to speak by Bush was a significant attempt at
reaching out to gay Republicans, he said, adding that most of the
2,066 convention delegates applauded Kolbe heartily.
</P>
<P>
   One other indication that the party is warming to gays: there
were more openly gay convention delegates (19) to this GOP
convention than at any previous. There were five gay delegates in
1996 and two alternates in 1992, Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week was a success. We are at a turning point (in the
Republican Party) on gay and lesbian issues,'' Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's relationship with gays and lesbians has been strained.
During the Republican primaries, Bush at first refused to meet with
gay rights groups. But in April, he met with gay Republicans saying
afterwards that he was ``a better man'' for it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also note that Cheney, while secretary of defense in
1991, supported his spokesman, Pete Williams, when he announced he
was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have operated on the basis, over the years, with respect to
my personal staff that I don't ask them about their private lives.
... As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in
a responsible manner, their private lives are their business,''
Cheney said.
