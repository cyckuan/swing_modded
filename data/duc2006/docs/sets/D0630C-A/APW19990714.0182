<HEADLINE> Bookseller Urged To Amend Ad Slogan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Challenging Barnesandnoble.com's claim that ``If  
we don't have your book nobody does,'' a division of the Council of 
Better Business Bureaus has called for the online bookseller to 
discontinue or modify the slogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to interpret the slogan literally, it would  
discourage searches from other sources,'' Nicholas Vianna, 
advertising review specialist with the group's National Advertising 
Division, said Tuesday. ``In the book industry there are private 
books, local publishers, all kinds of books. Some of the 
independent sellers make their livelihood on that special niche 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association, which filed a complaint  
last December, compiled a list of 100 out-of-print titles and found 
24 that were available only through competitors of 
Barnesandnoble.com. They included such obscure works as ``Cartels, 
Combines &AMP; Trusts in Post-War Germany'' and ``Studies in 
Machiavellianism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of independent booksellers complained because that  
slogan just wasn't accurate,'' said Richard Howorth, president of 
the ABA, whose membership consists overwhelmingly of independent 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Barnesandnoble.com agreed to comply with last week's  
decision, as of Tuesday the slogan still appeared on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagreed with the NAD's recommendation but chose to comply  
because we were moving away from that advertising slogan,'' said 
Mary Ellen Keating, a spokesperson for Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. ``We 
agreed to remove or modify the slogan over the next several 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vianna had hoped for a quicker response.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would hope the changes would happen as soon as possible,''  
Vianna said. ``The agreement calls for compliance within a 
reasonable period of time. And several months seems too long, 
especially in the case of a Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Advertising Division is a self-regulating body  
established by the advertising industry. Compliance with NAD 
decisions is voluntary, but some cases end up referred to the 
Federal Trade Commission.
