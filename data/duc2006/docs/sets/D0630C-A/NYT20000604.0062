   BRITISH AIRWAYS IN EARLY TALKS WITH KLM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to consolidate,
British Airways has had informal merger talks with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, executives close to both companies said. While the
executives stressed that the discussions are preliminary, it
underscores the frenzy among airline operators to seek partners
hoping to increase profit in an industry that has seen its margins
steadily erode. The informal talks take place amid the proposed
acquisition of US Airways by UAL for $4.3 billion and overtures
from AMR to Northwest about combining their businesses.

   IBM IN VENTURE WITH SALESFORCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Salesforce.com, which offers software for managing sales
data like contacts, leads and follow-ups, as a subscription service
from its Web site, plan to announce a partnership intended to help
small businesses transform themselves into e-businesses.

   TECHNOLOGY'S BAD DEALS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In no sector of the technology business have more companies with
less revenue been acquired for richer sums than in communications
equipment. On the surface, many of these deals look good for
everyone, and they often are. But not every deal can be a success,
and as the pace of acquisitions grows, so may the number of bad
deals.

   SEPARATING INTERNET OPERATIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many traditional retailers have vowed that by integrating their
Web operations into their physical stores, they will eventually
bury Internet-only merchants. But even as these companies preach
the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the
best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their
Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate
businesses _ and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of
maintaining separate operations.

   MOVIE TO BE TRANSMITTED DIGITALLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for the first time ever, a movie will be digitally
transmitted across the country over the Internet and then digitally
projected to a cinema audience, going from the studio in Hollywood
to a theater in Atlanta without ever touching film. The idea is to
demonstrate the potential of digital distribution _ which many
think will one day supplant traditional canisters of celluloid.

is in talks to acquire about 10 percent of Chello Broadband, a unit
of United Pan-Europe Communications.

   SMALL BOOKSELLERS TAKE FIGHT TO WEB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war
against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking
to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites. On
June 6, the American Booksellers Association will introduce
Booksense.com, a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual sites
created and maintained by local stores. Next to come, in early
July, is Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected
booksellers will provide editorial content. ``Booksense.com and
Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent
booksellers have a valuable voice,'' said Roxanne Coady of R.J.
Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who is participating in both sites.

   After uncertainty about the possible consequences, ABC will
again pit the hottest show of the season, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' against CBS's highly promising newcomer ``Survivor''
on Wednesday night.

   SALON'S REDESIGN Of ITS REDESIGN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to soothe ruffled readers, the online magazine Salon
pulled back its site redesign, which had elicited an immediate
chorus of e-mail boos and hisses from readers, and introduced
another new design.
