   NEW YORK _ With competition intensifying among electronic
booksellers, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. announced Thursday that it would
sell shares to the public of its money-losing online venture, which
trails in sales behind the pioneering leader, Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to
sell 20 percent of the online venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which
generated $14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's
$147.8 million. The initial public offering could take place in the
next 30 days, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the IPO to televise that they have online
capability, and secondly to enrich the value of Barnes &AMP; Noble
stock, which is going to retain 80 percent'' of the online venture,
said Linda Killian, portfolio manager for Renaissance Capital Corp.
in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 7.5 percent Thursday, or $2.8125,
to $40.0625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. While the
overall stock market has recently slumped, some new issues of
Web-based businesses, like Geocities, have risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its plans for a public
offering, the company said that its loss for the second quarter
tripled, primarily because of a $23 million loss from the online
venture. Barnes &AMP; Noble reported a loss of $5.7 million, or 8 cents
a share fully diluted, compared with a loss of $1.37 million, or 2
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.3
percent, to $675 million. The results were in line with Wall Street
analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Security and Exchange Commission restrictions, Mary Ellen
Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New York, declined to
answer questions about why the company intends to make the offering
or how the proceeds would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when a company spins off a division it could mean
that the unit's executives will get more independence and stock
option incentives that give them more of a stake in the company,
Ms. Killian of Renaissance Capital said. ``It would make them more
competitive with Amazon.com,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Barnes &AMP; Noble hired several top executives
for the online venture, including a new chief financial officer,
and two vice presidents in marketing and international strategies.
One of the new executives, John Rindlaub Jr., comes with marketing
experience from Shoplink Inc., a PC-based grocery shopping and home
delivery company. The chief executive of the online venture will
remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, whose
roots are in traditional bookselling.
</P>
<P>
   The number of users of the company's Web site
(www.barnesandnoble.com) has continued to grow, with 720,000
customers by early August, compared with 500,000 last May. These
gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer
one-click ordering. The online division is also preparing to
introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected
1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million. The New York
office of TBWA Chiat/Day was named last month to handle the
account.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition among online bookstores could intensify with
the entry of the German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG, which
is expected to open its online store, Booksonline, in Europe and
the United States in the fall. The Borders Group Inc. started its
online bookstore earlier this year although the company, the
second-largest bookstore retailer, has been concentrating more on
overseas expansion with the opening of conventional bookstores in
London and Singapore.
