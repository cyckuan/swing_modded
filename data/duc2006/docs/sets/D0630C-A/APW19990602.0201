<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble Halts Ingram Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble, the world's largest bookstore  
chain, called off its $600 million purchase of the world's biggest 
book distributor Wednesday because of opposition from antitrust 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram Book Group said they worried that  
their businesses would suffer during a prolonged review by the 
Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Some FTC staff members had concluded that the merger could give  
Barnes &AMP; Noble an unfair competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The review process has been disappointing to us,'' Ingram  
chairman John R. Ingram said. ``The events of the last several days 
have made it clear that some staff hold an outdated view of the 
marketplace, making an objective analysis of the transaction 
impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has been under fire since it was announced in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics said it could allow Barnes &AMP; Noble to delay delivery of  
best sellers to independent stores and big rivals such as Borders, 
or gain access to its competitors' buying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble, however, had said the acquisition would have  
allowed Ingram to distribute a wider selection of titles and Barnes 
&AMP; Noble to deliver books faster and at lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400  
independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent 
of the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that David can beat Goliath sometimes,'' said Oren  
Teicher, chief operating officer of the booksellers group. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this proposed deal was first announced, virtually nobody  
predicted that this deal could be stopped. Small booksellers wrote 
letters, made phone calls, did everything to raise awareness of 
this issue, and against extraordinary odds, they have succeeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky did not deny that the commission  
was considering blocking the deal. He cited concerns about whether 
small bookstores and Internet merchants would be injured if the 
merger were permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble isn't the only company looking to expand its  
distribution network. Many booksellers, including Amazon.com, are 
building and acquiring centers around the country to make it easier 
and faster to get any book to any customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram, a subsidiary of privately held Ingram Industries Inc. of  
Nashville, Tenn., distributes trade books, audio tapes, textbooks 
and specialty magazines through 11 distribution centers around the 
nation. It ships 115 million titles every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble said it will use the $600 million it had  
earmarked for the merger for other investments and acquisitions. It 
will also go forward with plans to build two new distribution 
centers of its own, one in Reno, Nev., the other in Memphis, Tenn.
