   Five months after Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. rattled the book industry
with the seismic announcement of its acquisition of the nation's
largest wholesaler, Ingram Book Group, the proposed merger is
undergoing intense federal scrutiny and is now being investigated
by the California attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   When the $600 million purchase was announced in early November,
Barnes &AMP; Noble's top executives confidently predicted that the
merger of the nation's largest bookseller and wholesaler would be
completed in 35 to 45 days, but the Federal Trade Commission's
antitrust review has lingered longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers, meanwhile, have organized one of the
most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the
book industry, with so many petitions, e-mails and telephone
appeals to the FTC that the agency has set aside a special line
just to record calls about the Ingram deal. (``If your call is in
reference to the proposed Barnes &AMP; Noble-Ingram merger, please
press one,'' its voice-mail system tells callers.)
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's acquisition of Ingram, a unit of Ingram
Industries, is undergoing a level of scrutiny from the FTC that is
known as a ``second request review,'' in general a rare move that
allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive
impact of a proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   The length and type of the review does not necessarily mean the
merger is in deep trouble. Other recent book industry deals have
faced intense reviews from Federal regulators but still were
eventually approved.
</P>
<P>
   The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of
inspection for its purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education unit,
which was ultimately approved. Bertelsmann AG's successful
acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also
received additional attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Ingram deal has galvanized strong opposition from
booksellers in California. There, a spokeswoman for the state
attorney general said Friday that the agency was reviewing the
deal. ``We're investigating,'' said the spokeswoman Sandra
Michioku, the director of public affairs for the attorney general,
Bill Lockyer. ``The process is to look at what would be the impact
of the merger and to make a decision whether it's
anticompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FTC approves the merger, California can ask a
federal judge to block it, said Ms. Michioku, who declined to
comment on what prompted the state to get involved. She said she
knew of no other state that was investigating the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut attorney general's office is monitoring the FTC
review, although it is not conducting one itself.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New
York, said the company was not aware of the California
investigation, although it did receive a letter from the state
requesting information that the bookstore chain was providing to
Federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not uncommon for a state attorney general to be
interested in a transaction like this, because there have been
concerns raised about this,'' Ms. Keating said. She noted that the
company was ``confident that this acquisition will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts, Barnes &AMP;
Noble's chairman and chief executive, Leonard Riggio, said that he
expected a decision by the FTC in 60 to 90 days, which would be
sometime in June.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, based in Nashville, is the dominant force in book
distribution. Privately held, it does not disclose its market
share. Barnes &AMP; Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the
consumer book market.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the merger's opponents are worried that the Ingram
purchase will give Barnes &AMP; Noble access to the sales data of
independent competitors or allow it to stock its stores with
popular books that might be in short supply while making a
competitor like Amazon.com wait for the same title.
</P>
<P>
   After the many recent mergers in the book industry, some
opponents of the Barnes &AMP; Noble-Ingram deal said they believed it
was getting more serious attention because they were being asked by
the FTC to provide formal declarations of opposition. The agency
declined to comment on the status of its review.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that we've been asked for declarations,
and nothing like this has happened before with the struggle with
Simon &AMP; Schuster and Bertelsmann and Random House,'' said Letty
Cottin Pogrebin, the president of the Authors Guild in New York,
which challenged the other mergers.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Cooper, a Washington antitrust specialist who is not
involved in the case, said the request for declarations indicated
that the federal review had reached a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests that they did reach a stage where they have
problems and they are willing to go ahead and seek a preliminary
injunction,'' Cooper said. ``I think that they have problems and
they're trying to work those out.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that declarations are normally collected in preparation
for an injunction request or for use in persuading FTC
commissioners to block a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the merger took comfort from Ingram's
announcement in March of a stategic alliance with Entertainment
Marketing Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Book Scan unit, EMIS will take over the collection
of sales data from independent bookstores that were previously
polled by Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   This move, in the opponents' view, represents an effort to
address the concern that Ingram might pass along information about
independent booksellers to Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y.,
independent booksellers have conducted a letter-writing campaign
against the merger that has delivered the signatures of more than
115,000 book buyers to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The independent booksellers also have held meetings with elected
officials, which have resulted in letters from officials like Sen.
Michael DeWine, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, urging the federal
agency to review the merger closely.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council in Berkeley, Calif., passed a resolution
supporting the effort of independent booksellers to block the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, a long-distance telephone and credit card
company, Working Assets, organized a telephone campaign by its
customers that resulted in 35,000 calls to the FTC to oppose the
merger, according to Janet Nudelman, a director at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Booksellers are not a particularly political group of folks,''
said Oren Teicher, who has been organizing the opposition for the
American Booksellers Association. ``They tend not to be involved in
this kind of lobbying. But in this case we have found the inverse
to be true. Booksellers are enormously responsive.''
