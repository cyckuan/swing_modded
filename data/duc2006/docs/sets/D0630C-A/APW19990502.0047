<HEADLINE> Bill Murray Says He's a Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I'm a writer now,'' Bill Murray announced  
to a crowd of publishers and booksellers, ``and in order to give 
you a feeling for the book that I've written I have come completely 
unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, co-author of the golf book and memoir ``A Cinderella  
Story,'' was speaking Saturday at BookExpo America, the industry's 
annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I became a writer,'' he continued, ``back in 1999. I had  
approximately, uh, the rest of the month to finish it. And those of 
you who know the month of February know what I'm talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He joked about his inability to meet deadlines, apologized for  
exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to 
all the independent booksellers in his own special way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never gone to the Internet and sat down and read  
anything,'' he said. ``But I've never gone to the Internet and 
shoplifted, either.''
