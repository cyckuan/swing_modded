<P>
   Less than a year and a half after buying the nation's premier
publishing house, the Bertelsmann media conglomerate is poised to
form a partnership with an American icon of popular literature,
Time Inc.'s Book-of-the-Month Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann _ which is based in Gutersloh, Germany, and
purchased Random House last year _ is negotiating to create a joint
venture that could bring together the two largest book clubs in the
United States, the Book-of-the-Month Club and Bertelsmann's
Literary Guild, according to publishing executives who asked to
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Both clubs have been pondering how to compete against online
booksellers in a book market radically changed from the days when
judges made Book-of-the-Month Club selections over sherry that had
the power to spread literary culture to readers isolated far from
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's Doubleday Direct, of which the Literary Guild is a
part, has been negotiating with Time Inc. for more than six weeks
in an effort to strike a deal this month.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides have not reached an agreement yet on the
financial terms or determined which company would operate the club,
according to publishing executives close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have made tentative plans to create a six-member
board presiding over the joint venture that will be evenly divided
between executives of Bertelsmann and Time Warner, Time Inc.'s
corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Bertelsmann and Time Inc. refused to discuss the
negotiations. ``We are declining politely, but firmly, to
comment,'' said Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc. Liz
Young, a U.S. spokeswoman for Bertelsmann, also would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, one publishing executive familiar with the negotiations
said that a joint venture would enable the two book clubs to cut
costs by sharing ``back end functions'' such as distribution and
warehousing. The problem is that book club sales growth has been
hurt by ``a couple of factors, most prominently online book
sales,'' he said. ``In the case of the Book-of-the-Month-Club,
they've really been struggling over the last couple of years, so
this is an opportunity to put some operational systems together.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fierce competition obviously did not exist when the
Book-of-the-Month Club's founder, Harry Scherman, invented the book
club in the United States in 1926 with a gimmick that relied on a
literary stamp of approval from experts like Heywood Broun and
Christopher Morley, who selected the best new books for a reading
public hungry for literature.
</P>
<P>
   The general book club strategy has been to entice a reader with
promotional offers like a four-book purchase for $2 if the customer
agrees to buy a specified number of other titles at regular prices.
For readers living far from a bookstore, the system offered a
convenient alternative. But with the rise of online bookselling and
instant purchases at the click of a computer mouse, book clubs in
the late 1990s were forced to offer something more than discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous costs in finding new members,'' said
Albert N. Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham
University who tracks book publishing. ``If these two clubs could
cut down on their promotion and mailing costs they could save a lot
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s consolidation narrowed the chief players in the
book club business to three companies, Bertelsmann's Doubleday
Direct, Time Inc.'s Book-of-the-Month Club and Rodale Press' &UR;  &LR; six
holdings, including the health-oriented Prevention Book Club. To
counter online competition, the book clubs refined their marketing
techniques and promoted their ability to filter choice books on
specialty topics for harried readers who did not have the time to
do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Book-of-the-Month Club sells general hardcover titles, but
it also includes eight other clubs that offer books in niche
markets like the One Spirit Christian Book Club or the History Book
Club. Together all of the clubs have a combined membership of 4.5
million members, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Book-of-the-Month Club's revenues were estimated
at about $280 million, roughly comparable to the revenues of
Doubleday Direct. Doubleday says it has a membership list of 4.8
million with book clubs that include the Literary Guild, as well as
a collection of other smaller clubs like the fast-growing Christian
club, Crossings, and a children's book club.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statistics from the Association of American
Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their
own, but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as
online booksellers. Mail order companies like Readers Digest that
have suffered from a free fall in sales, which have plunged as much
as 20 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the year through October, net sales for book clubs had
reached $950 million, an increase of 4.5 percent over the
comparable period a year earlier. Last year, with $1.2 billion in
book club sales, that category accounted for 5.4 percent of the
total $22 billion book market that includes consumer books,
textbooks, and professional titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann also has a substantial stake in the online business,
with a 40 percent interest in Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tentative plans, Bertelsmann and Time Inc. will allow
the two literary clubs to remain in their present locations with
separate identities _ the Book-of-the-Month Club in Manhattan and
the Literary Guild in Garden City, N.Y. &QL;
