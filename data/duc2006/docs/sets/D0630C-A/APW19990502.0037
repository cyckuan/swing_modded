<HEADLINE> Author Criticized for Superstore Ad </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unhappy with an author they once honored,  
independent booksellers overwhelmingly approved a resolution 
criticizing Frank McCourt for appearing in a television ad for the 
on-line superstore barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association, with a core membership of  
some 3,300 independent stores, voted Saturday at BookExpo America 
to draft a letter to McCourt expressing disappointment. He is the 
author of the hugely popular ``Angela's Ashes'' and the upcoming 
sequel ``Tis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never asked for an apology in my life and I've never  
given one. What I do I do. ... If I get a letter from them it'll go 
back unopened,'' said McCourt, a featured speaker at BEA. 
</P>
<P>
	The expo, a three-day exhibition and trade show that ended  
Sunday, is the publishing industry's annual national convention. It 
was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA's letter will be sent to a beloved writer, and not just  
with readers. Two years ago, the association presented McCourt its 
annual ABBY award, given to the author whose book they most enjoyed 
selling. His memoir was a surprise success and he has given a lot 
of the credit to independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they (independent stores) had wanted me to do a commercial  
I would have done one for them, too. I'm not a politician. I just 
did what my publisher requested,'' McCourt said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is actually far lighter than the original  
proposed by independent seller Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books 
Inc. in Berkeley. Ross, condemning the ``hypocrisy of writers and 
intellectuals,'' had wanted the ABA to call for McCourt to give 
back his ABBY award. 
</P>
<P>
	The booksellers overwhelmingly rejected that idea as too harsh.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really offered this resolution in a spirit to generate  
discussion,'' Ross said. ``They (writers) talk about independent 
booksellers at cocktail parties, but they're afraid to speak up. 
The chains have become so powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other writers appearing in ads for barnesandnoble.com include  
Tom Clancy and Stephen King, another vocal supporter of 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, I understand how they feel, but I never really  
anticipated it,'' said Susan Moldow, vice president and publisher 
of Scribner, an imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster that publishes both 
McCourt and King. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd do another superstore ad, McCourt said ``I'd be  
very careful the next time. From now on, I probably won't do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA action highlighted a weekend of tough talk. The  
association aggressively promoted its answer to Amazon.com and 
other on-line sellers, BookSense.com, to be open for business late 
summer. And individual members accused Barnes &AMP; Noble, Amazon.com 
and other ``bad corporate citizens'' of everything from false 
advertising to stealing customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fighting for our lives,'' said ABA president Richard  
Howorth. 
</P>
<P>
	Booksellers received both bad news and good news at BEA. A new  
consumer survey said that adults in the U.S. bought 30 million 
fewer books in 1998 than the year before. The apparent culprit was 
an odd one: A good economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In good times, consumers seem to spend their money on other  
kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods. In 
tighter economic times, consumers once again think about books,'' 
said Sandra Paul, managing agent of the Book Industry Study Group, 
which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ABA, which has lost nearly 2,000 stores over the past  
decade, also reported a long-hoped for statistic. In March of this 
year, the number of stores increased slightly, the first monthly 
improvement in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been going against us for a long time, but it's going to  
go the other way,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the ABA's chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was still plenty of time to talk about books.  
Major upcoming releases include McCourt's new book; ``Dutch,'' 
Edmund Morris' long-awaited memoir about former President Ronald 
Reagan; Sue Grafton's latest lettered mystery, ``O is For Outlaw,'' 
and ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris' sequel to ``The Silence of the 
Lambs.''
