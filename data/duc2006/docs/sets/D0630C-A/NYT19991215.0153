BOOKSELLERS WANT CALIFORNIA TO TAX INTERNET SALES

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of California booksellers is urging
the state to be more forceful in collecting taxes from on-line
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering in San Francisco, the group of independent
shopkeepers took specific aim at three giants of e-commerce:
Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand the state's Board of Equalization collects sales tax
as existing law requires,'' said Hut Landon, owner of Landon Books
in Corte Madera. ``This is an instance where the state is handing
major retailers a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The request to the state agency was made by the Northern
California Independent Booksellers Association and the American
Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly discriminatory,'' said Neal Sofman, who hosted
the event at his own store, A Clean Well Lighted Place for Books on
Van Ness Avenue. ``If this imbalance remains, we'll lose our tax
base.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the request of the bookstore owners, Board of
Equalization Chairman Johan Klehs said the state is, indeed,
enforcing the existing tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, the rules for e-commerce are the same as
catalog selling,'' Klehs said. ``If you have a nexus in California,
or employees in California, you're required to collect sales tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce is
considering whether to tax transactions that take place on the
Internet. The 1998 law creating the study commission placed a
three-year moratorium on new taxes targeting Internet services or
Internet access services.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not exempt e-commerce companies from having to pay
state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ross, who owns Cody's Books in Berkeley, said he first
complained to the state in July and has received little
satisfaction from the Board of Equalization so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax policy should not be politicized,'' said Ross, who went on
to accuse the Board of Equalization of bowing to Silicon Valley
pressure. ``Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com are not
collecting taxes in clear violation of the law. It's bad policy and
bad politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The state and national booksellers associations maintain that
the three on-line booksellers have a formidable presence in
California and that should count as an established nexus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that these are not California businesses is just
nonsense,'' said Bill Petrocelli, owner of Book Passage in Corte
Madera. ``Large Internet commerce people are being given a free
ride. That's simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Prem, a tax partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in San Francisco, sides with the on-line retailers, saying
they are doing nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the current tax laws work, the position that Amazon,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders are taking is legal,'' Prem said. ``The
fact that they're not collecting sales tax is perfectly legal. The
companies have set up subsidiaries for on-line retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prem said a little-known or enforced tax, called the ``use
tax,'' could be the answer to the Internet taxation riddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tax that's imposed on a purchaser that buys something
from out of state and brings it into the state to use it,'' Prem
said. ``It's been on the books in California since the 1930s, but
is seldom enforced.''
