<HEADLINE> Small Bookstores Feeling Threatened </HEADLINE>

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Sandwiched between coffee bars and vintage  
clothing shops, the Fremont Place Book Co. has provided the city's 
hip, young Fremont neighborhood with everything from obscure titles 
to bestsellers for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But a sign in the window warns of an uncertain future: ``This  
bookstore is endangered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent  
bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned 
megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles. 
The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes &AMP; Noble -- 
the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the 
world's largest book distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	For independent booksellers, the $600 million deal is the last  
straw. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all just aghast when we heard about the deal,'' says  
Carol Santoro, co-owner of Fremont Place. ``It's becoming more and 
more of a dynasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes &AMP; Noble  
to learn what others are buying. Santoro has responded by shifting 
orders to other suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	But independent booksellers are not the only ones worried about  
self-preservation in a changing industry. Even a giant in the 
business like Ingram says it cannot overlook the impact of chain 
stores and online retailers in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all  
transactions by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	At the urging of several members of Congress, including  
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and independent booksellers, 
the Federal Trade Commission is looking into the deal between 
Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble. The state attorney general in California 
-- home to many independent booksellers -- also is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden took up the cause because of personal exposure to the  
tough circumstances facing small booksellers. His father was an 
author and ran his own publishing house for some years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was raised being skeptical about what is happening in the  
bookselling business,'' Wyden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He supports conditions to the merger so all booksellers have  
equal access to published material. He also favors ``firewalls'' to 
prevent information sharing. Without such conditions, Wyden 
believes the deal could be the death of the small stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this really is a survival issue for them,'' Wyden  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent bookstores have been on the offensive since the dawn  
of the mega bookstore, when giants like Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble 
opened up triple decker shops stocked with thousands of book 
titles, CDs and even cappuccino bars. Because of their high volume, 
these stores were able to slash prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Amazon.com.  
</P>
<P>
	The online retail giant has revolutionized the market, enabling  
shoppers to buy, send and special-order books with a click of the 
mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the American Booksellers Association and other  
independent bookstores filed suit against the two retail book 
chains, saying they have used their clout to secure illegal deals 
and preferential treatment from publishing houses. Another suit 
filed by independent booksellers in August also names Amazon.com 
and BarnesandNoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes  
&AMP; Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and 
reduce the diversity of materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wind up with a smaller and smaller group of people  
deciding who to publish,'' said Len Vlahos of the ABA, based in 
Tarrytown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	While there will always be the John Grishams and other big  
moneymakers, bookstores also need to make room for lesser known 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	``You like to think artistic content matters,'' says Santoro.  
``Not just the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram says it is reaching out to its clients to assure them of  
confidentiality in their transactions. Predictions that the merger 
will reduce the variety of books available are just not true, says 
Mary Ellen Keating of Barnes &AMP; Noble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to make every book available,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Wyden says independent bookstores do more than just sell  
books, and often function as community centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The small stores help make rural life more vibrant,'' Wyden  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrons agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a flavor that you're looking for,'' said Diane  
Kerner of Seattle, making her purchases at Fremont Place one rainy 
morning. ``People love their neighborhood bookstores.''
