<P>
   BOSTON _ Inside the Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop, the e-commerce
revolution seems improbable, like a setting ripped from a Robert
Louis Stevenson novel on the store's dusty shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Vincent McCaffrey would have it no other way. Hence, the
resident cat, Blue, who sleeps in the front window, the classical
music, and the hand-scrawled sign that says ``Please Touch The
Books.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the charming store encloses a hidden world, one where
touching the books is impossible, where silence reigns, and where
Blue is nothing more than a flickering image. It's called
AvenueVictorHugoBooks.com, and last year, it generated 6 percent of
McCaffrey's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to survive, it's very simple: We have to have the
Web,'' said McCaffrey, peering down nearly empty aisles on a recent
afternoon. ``I've got 150,000 books here, and I might offend the
typical Bostonian by saying this, but there aren't enough people
here who read. That's just how the world is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered by chain stores and the on-line giant Amazon.com, one
out of every three of New England's independent booksellers has
created sophisticated yet quirky Web sites in the past two years in
an effort to lure patrons and keep their doors open.
</P>
<P>
   To their happy surprise, the reluctant on-line entrepreneurs are
finding cyberspace fertile beyond their wildest hopes, as readers
in Australia and Japan purchase what locals ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners now admit that the Internet may mean the salvation,
and not the destruction, of their brick-and-mortar book nooks after
all.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, these famously disorganized
capitalists are finding out how tough it is to balance the digital
and the down-to-earth. Successful Internet ventures have begun to
distract owners from the business of selling books to walk-in
customers, eroding the character and charm that made independents
unique, many proprietors fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my bookstore to be the Wal-Mart of the Web,''
said Frank Kramer, owner of the esteemed Harvard Book Store in
Cambridge. ``We want the Web to drive people to our store, that's
the goal. The fact is, we have tremendous potential on the Internet
and could increase our sales tremendously, but we enjoy physical
retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gloss, owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop, in downtown
Boston, takes great pains to ensure that walk-in customers get
treated as well as his on-line patrons, whose mounting orders take
more and more time to process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make
available in the store first,'' Gloss said. ``We don't want our
in-store customers to feel like they're left out.''
</P>
<P>
   What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers
were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on-line
shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web
sellers like Barnes &AMP; Noble's on-line store bn.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shop on line because it's convenient, because I have to,''
said Frances Burke, a professor emeritus at Suffolk University, as
she bought a book at Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop. ``But whenever I
get the chance, I come to the bookstore. I need to touch and smell
the books.''
</P>
<P>
   As a cradle of the high-tech economy, the Boston area was
perhaps destined for the vanguard of on-line book selling.
Wordsworth.com, created in 1993, was the world's second on-line
bookstore, followed closely by Harvard.com, BrooklineBooksmith.com,
and a few others.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement was slow to take off, as shopkeepers either
could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as
a violation of their store's identity. In January 1996, only 10
shops in the region had Web sites, and two years later, 10 more had
joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, nearly 150 of the region's 470 independent
booksellers, many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have Web
sites, according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).
That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California
Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied
association of bookstore proprietors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a six-fold increase in the past two years,'' said
Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, the NEBA's executive director. ``It's a
groundswell.''
</P>
<P>
   For some shops, the high-tech effort consists of little more
than a few pretty photographs, directions to the store, a telephone
number, and some staff recommendations of good reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get
all my books on the Web site,'' said Gloss, whose site holds just a
smattering of his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like
Amazon.com, some owners have instead focused on recreating the
intangible qualities of their shops on-line. McCaffrey has a page
devoted to Blue, for instance. Gloss offers photos of handsome,
leatherbound tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual bookstores, they admit, are pathetic by comparison
with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   On ``the computer screen, there's no texture, no depth,'' Kramer
said. ``I don't care how many graphics you have, it doesn't compare
to the table, the shelves, the overstock area, the books at the
front counter. That has a dimension computer screens cannot
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet, many
storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock,
on-line ordering, and other conveniences. Most now offer search
engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories, or
even to tap into databases of every book in print. In effect, many
tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the
same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes &AMP;
Noble, Borders, or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth's general manager, Sanj Kharbanda, said his store's
Web site now holds about 1.2 million titles, enough variety to
bring in about 125 on-line sales a day. That converts to roughly 9
percent of total sales on a given day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, the minimum expectation is that we would
have a Web site, and being a bookstore, a search function has
become a necessary convenience,'' Kharbanda said.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Boston Book Company, which occupies a
less-than-glamorous second-floor stie in the city's Jamaica Plain
neighborhood, Internet sales now account for half the shop's sales,
co-owner Helen Kelly said. The reason, she said, is the plentiful
title list on the store's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Even the slickest home pages, however, seem hopelessly grounded
in the physical world, no matter how virtual the shopping
experience. Few independent booksellers take the time to create
customer profiles, or track shoppers' habits, and even fewer have
employees dedicated solely to working with on-line customers. As
Richard Howorth, president of the American Booksellers Association
and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi, said, ``I have no
idea how many hits I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated
strategies of Amazon.com is apparent in other ways. Anirvan
Chatterjee, founder of Bookfinder.com, where on-line book buyers
browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the
world, said on-line book indexes like his have helped independents
offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources available to booksellers who go on-line,
there's plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and
doing business solely in cyberspace, Chatterjee said.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, most have kept a foot in the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sellers are finding that their on-line presence
subsidizes their storefront; that just warms my heart,'' Chatterjee
said. ``Book-selling is a great, historic tradition. Amazon.com is
not going to come along and change all that.''
