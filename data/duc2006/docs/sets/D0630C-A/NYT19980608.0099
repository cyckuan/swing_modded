 &HT;    Booksellers gird for continue war with chains

   AUSTIN _ Abe Zimmerman had not been to a trade show in years,
and never to one for booksellers. But as the new president of Book
People, he flew to Chicago for a quick, total immersion at Book
Expo.
</P>
<P>
   He took along experienced guides: the Austin store's buying
director Tracey Tarlton and marketing manager David Hutts, a
veteran of the Book Expos that serve as the American Bookseller
Association's annual conventions. By Saturday night Zimmerman was
eating dinner with author Tim O'Brien, swapping golf stories and
talking about store events. But he found the atmosphere at the
convention perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that's changing dramatically right now,''
Zimmerman said, ``and I'm not so sure how many people know what's
going on and how to react.'' A businessman who helped start Katz's
Delicatessen and was part of a hi-tech start-up company called
Technology Works, he said he found the energy at Book Expo less
than dynamic. ``I felt like these were people who weren't in
control of their fate any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers face tough times. Those who have lasted
through changes in the business continue to quietly look for ways
to do better and more efficiently what they have a reputation for
doing: providing personal service. ``I did feel everyone
understands the importance of independent stores,'' Zimmerman said.
``As an independent, I felt well received (by publishers).''
</P>
<P>
   Last year several top publishing houses, including Random House,
skipped the convention because of tensions with the ABA, which had
sued them for making discount deals with chains. This year most
large publishers came back, though in reduced numbers, and used
less exhibit space. The convention attracted 1,500 exhibitors, with
400 authors promoting their books.
</P>
<P>
   In this era when a recent newsletter from the famed Tattered
Cover bookstore in Denver warned that the big chains are ringing
the independents with stores, attempting to squeeze them out, and
when books are sold at Randalls and Sam's, not to mention on the
Internet, Austin independents face a clear challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer purchasing report released by the Book Industry Study
Group shows that independent booksellers experienced a 1.4 percent
market-share decline last year, down to 17 percent of the books
purchased. Chains accounted for 25 percent. Most books are now sold
in nontraditional outlets _ everywhere from car washes to discount
stores _ or through book clubs and electronic bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for independent bookstores to have a
distinctive flavor and still cover the bases,'' said Tarlton, ``to
also carry the bestsellers people expect to see.'' She spent much
of her time gathering galleys from better smaller presses.
</P>
<P>
   At Toad Hall, children's events including author readings and
special lunches have been a priority to bring customers to the
Austin store, which is owned by Barbara Bonds Thomas, outgoing
president of the ABA. This year the store was singled out at Book
Expo and awarded the Pannell Award for innovative children's
events.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, independent booksellers appear to be facing the
reality that increased service _ the more specific the better _ is
their best chance of keeping customers at a time when sales have
been disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost
half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed. Sales
were flat last year and consumer spending on adult fiction and
non-fiction increased by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An independent bookseller manager in Missouri said that she
realized that with 55 churches in her area the residents had a deep
interest in religion. She came to the convention to check out
religious titles. ``Our customers still don't trust the Internet to
send them books,'' the bookseller said. ``They'll come into the
store with a list they've printed off Amazon.com and want us to get
the books for them.'' Now she is looking at a process introduced at
the convention by Ingram Distributors called Lightning Print. It
allows books to be stored digitally and printed one at a time on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Although conglomerates increasingly control publishing, there is
still room for specialized service, and individual stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bookstore that's enthusiastic can make a book of poetry,''
said Michael Wiegers, managing editor of the award-winning Copper
Canyon Press in Port Townsend, Wash., though he says such a store
might be part of a chain or an independent.
</P>

   The bookseller of the year for the African American booksellers'
group, Blackboard, Michele Lewis of New Orleans started a store in
her mid-20s. She has seen her business grow in a few years to a
second store and stresses personal service to a niche market.
Accepting the award, she thanked God, her mother, and her family
and friends for allowing the business to grow. Emma Rodgers, owner
of Black Images in Dallas and a director of the ABA, said an
African American Booksellers school held in Chicago before Book
Expo was well attended.
</P>
<P>
   During the convention, the sale of Random House to the
Bertelsmann German conglomerate was confirmed and many sellers saw
that as bad news. Avin Domnitz, executor director of the ABA, said:
``Consolidation of books and publishers has never worked to the
advantage of the independent.'' Increasingly, the booksellers
association is involved in litigation as independents fight back
any way they can against changes they see as threatening their
survival in the industry. A suit by the ABA accusing Borders and
Barnes &AMP; Noble of antitrust violations is still awaiting a formal
response. ``We're still in the early stages (of litigation),'' he
said. Though they may be tired from fighting for economic survival,
the booksellers showed their trademark idealism. They rallied
around Bill Kramer, whose Washington, D.C., bookstore refused to
hand over the bookbuying records of former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky to independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Said ABA
board member Oren Teicher: ``There's no more important issue than
that information about books they have purchased is personal and
confidential.'' Booksellers have long seen themselves as involved
in a marketplace of ideas and, as such, different from the owners
of hardware and drugstores. The Kramer case gives them an
opportunity to cling to that while all around them appears to be
changing.
