   The flat, sprawling warehouses of Nashville are leagues away
from a New York literary lunch and repartee with a prominent
author, but this prosaic side of the nation's $8 billion consumer
book market _ packing, shipping and delivery _ has become a key to
its future.
</P>
<P>
   With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of
Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic
effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big
Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement this month that the nation's leading
bookseller, Barnes &AMP; Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the
Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a
shifting field of distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a basic explanation for the dazzle of distribution.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the
conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to
squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
Such top booksellers as Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com are looking
for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by
sending more of their orders through their own distribution
centers.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, this means that delivery will become swifter,
setting a standard of 24-hour service for online bookstores, but
also increasing the speed at which special orders are filled by
stores on terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   While top publishers troll for new alliances to share
distribution, regional distributors are on a spree of buying
smaller independent publishers to spread their costs and to secure
a customer base. Daily there is speculation that Amazon.com, the
e-commerce pioneer, is preparing to buy a wholesaler of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankee Group, a technology research organization,
forecasts that online sales of books will climb to $700 million by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that they will be left by the wayside, restive
independent booksellers fret that a wholesaler owned by Barnes &AMP;
Noble could be manipulated to reduce service to them or to tap into
their records.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to find out what our sales are, what the
profit margin is and then find out just how vulnerable these stores
are and then move in,'' said William Petrocelli, the co-owner of
Book Passage, an independent store in Corte Madera, Calif., just
north of San Francisco. He is circulating a letter among
booksellers to challenge the sale with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Borders Group bookstore chain started building up its
distribution network long ago and now owns nine centers, including
four new ones in Nashville. Last week it also announced the hiring
of a new chief executive, Philip Pfeffer, who, when he was chief
executive of Ingram Distribution Group, presided over the expansion
of the company into the largest wholesale distributor of trade
books in the world. The book and distribution groups are both owned
by Ingram Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always viewed distribution as a strategic asset, but
frankly we used to get hammered for it because our competition
didn't pay much attention to it,'' said Robert F. DiRomualdo,
chairman of the Borders Group. ``We've got to become more efficient
as an industry, so I'm not surprised that everyone is moving in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's purchase of Ingram is just the most visible
example of the industry shift. According to several top publishing
executives, Amazon.com had also been talking with Nashville-based
Ingram about a sale and remains interested in a purchase of Baker &AMP;
Taylor, the No. 2 wholesaler, which is based in Charlotte, N.C.,
and has 5 distribution sites to Ingram's 11.
</P>
<P>
   In response to such speculation, Baker &AMP; Taylor president James
Ulsamer said, ``Anyone at the right time at the right price is for
sale.'' But he added, ``There is nothing in the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was just as cryptic. ``We neither confirm nor deny
rumors, speculation or chitchat about what we may be or may not be
doing,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   One top publishing executive said Amazon had moved to cut its
ties with Ingram, but John Ingram, chairman of Ingram Book Group,
said that to his knowledge no such break had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he sent out more than 5,000 letters to independent
booksellers urging them to trust in the company's history of
integrity and commitment to treat all customers equally. ``We've
never shared information,'' Ingram said. ``I wouldn't have done the
deal without those assurances. Ingram people will continue to run
our business with the same high degree of integrity as we've always
done. Barnes &AMP; Noble would expect nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble chairman and chief executive Leonard Riggio said
his company would ``never, ever'' ask for information from Ingram
about a competitor. ``From my point of view, we're actually rooting
for them and every other good bookstore in America,'' he said,
noting that his company needed the support of other booksellers for
Ingram to grow. ``We don't see this as a Darwinian struggle. So we
see our interests lining up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that many booksellers will break with the company
as they approach Christmas, their busiest and most profitable
season. But Ingram's pledge gives little comfort to the American
Booksellers Association, which is deeply distrustful of Barnes &AMP;
Noble and has sued the company in San Francisco, accusing it of
unfair trade practices. ``I'm having a difficult time finding
solace,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the chief executive of the trade
group. ``It's like putting the fox in the henhouse and taking his
word that he's not going to eat the chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the almost visceral hostility from independent
booksellers, said Albert Greco, an associate business professor at
Fordham University who follows publishing, Barnes &AMP; Noble's move
was born out of its need to remain competitive in ``the face of
potentially damaging market inroads made by online book operators,
which will transform the selling of books.''
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers and distributors are already proceeding as if
the Barnes &AMP; Noble purchase is a fait accompli, yet antitrust
lawyers and even Wall Street analysts are more cautious about how
federal regulators will regard the deal. They predict that it will
probably take much longer for the purchase to be approved than the
30 to 45 days foreseen by Barnes &AMP; Noble executives.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson PLC's purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education division,
announced in May, remains tied up in a second round of review by
the Justice Department, although the company keeps saying approval
could come any day.
</P>

   ``We think the deal was expensive and may be difficult to close
because of regulatory concerns,'' Danielle Turnoff Fox, an analyst
for J.P. Morgan Securities, said of the Ingram acquisition. Ms. Fox
said that unless Barnes &AMP; Noble set up some system of fire walls,
as the new owner of Ingram it would have access to extensive
information about Amazon.com's actual unit sales of books online.
``There are competitive issues that are likely to come under
intense scrutiny,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Cooper, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust cases
at the Washington firm Bryan Cave, said the Federal Trade
Commission would be likely to review the deal because of its
experience analyzing other mergers in the book industry. ``If there
are any real issues when they do their first look, this could take
some time,'' he said, adding that he expected the Ingram purchase
to face a second round of intensive review that could take up to
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, others in the industry are sizing up ways they can use
distribution to overcome sluggish growth. Last year, sales of
consumer, or popular, books grew only 1 percent from 1996, which
means they did not even keep pace with population growth.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Time Warner's trade book division and
HarperCollins, which is owned by News Corp. were in talks about
forming a joint distribution network, but they failed to come to an
agreement, said two top publishing executives who insisted on
anonymity. This month, Random House Inc., now owned by Bertelsmann
AG, announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its book
distribution center in Westminster, Md., while also setting a date
to close its warehouse in Des Plaines, Ill., near Chicago. After
opening a $30 million center near Charlottesville, Va., last year,
the German media conglomerate Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck
is still in the process of adding its publishing houses to the
network.
</P>
<P>
   While publishers strive to streamline distribution networks,
regional distributors that serve independent publishers have in
turn started buying up some of those publishing houses, partly to
secure their customer base and to spread the costs of back-office
functions. Two leading distributors, Publishers Group West in
California and the National Book Network in Maryland, are buying
heavily these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at perhaps three or four different deals,'' said
Charles Winton, chief executive of Publishers Group West, which in
the last three years has acquired four publishers through its
parent company, Publishers Group Inc. ``Right now I have eight
different prospectuses sitting on my desk. It's amazing how much
activity there is.'' He said he expected to double revenue from its
publishing companies to nearly $20 million within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change has been dizzying to publishers, booksellers
and distributors, who talk about these recent shifts and the spate
of mergers and consolidations as a sea change in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process has sped up dramatically,'' said National
Book Network president Jed Lyons. ``In the past, it would take
maybe two or three weeks and the book would arrive. Today consumers
aren't willing to wait two or three weeks. They want it tomorrow.''
