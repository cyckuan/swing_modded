   Independent booksellers are a famously fractious group, as the
name suggests. In their two-decades war against chain stores and,
more recently, online booksellers, they have shared little beyond
common enemies _ Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, Amazon, the price clubs _
and a will to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from one another in neighborhoods across America, they
have fought a guerrilla war with discouraging results. Nearly half
the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according
to the American Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet, the site of so much recent loss for the
independents, will take on greater importance as a battleground in
the next two months. Set to debut are two large-scale Web sites
that seek to promote the independents. But many wonder whether the
sites are jumping in too late and can compete with the customer
service of the online giants Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, the booksellers association will begin to unveil
Booksense.com, a site turning the independents into ``local store
dot-com, closed but open 24 hours a day,'' says Michael Hoynes, the
program's marketing officer. Next to come, in early July, is
Contentville, a site produced by Steven T. Brill, which will,
according to its senior vice president and e-publisher, Annik
LaFarge, make some 40 of the most respected booksellers in the
country the ``heart and soul'' of its book retailing area. The
sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by
booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their
books.
</P>
<P>
   But they are built on very different business models.
Booksense.com is a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual Web
sites created and maintained by local stores. Each will have its
own Web address and set its own prices.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about Contentville's relationship with the
independent booksellers it has recruited _ Glenn Goldman of Book
Soup in Los Angeles, Neal Sofman of A Clean Well Lighted Place in
San Francisco and a former ABA president, Ed Morrow of Northshire
Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt., among others _ is that the
independents will not actually be selling books on Contentville.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will provide editorial content for a fee and will
get an equity stake in the company should Contentville go public.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Farley, an e-commerce analyst at PaineWebber, believes the
biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service, exactly
the territory the independents in Booksense.com, in particular,
will have the least control over. ``The trick,'' she says, ``is
providing a great customer experience. Amazon has spent five years
developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and
fulfillment network. They didn't snap their fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge, the sites have established alliances with
Baker &AMP; Taylor and Ingram, wholesalers that have traditionally
dealt in bulk orders to booksellers and now face the challenge of
shipping smaller orders directly to consumers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, for example, has worked over the last two years to
improve its ability to ship smaller orders to more customers, and
over the last year has developed this operation in earnest
delivering books for Barnesandnoble.com and Buy.com, the two
largest of 20 such clients it works with.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram has a cash investment in Contentville, which ``gives us
reassurance they'll do it right,'' said Brill. Booksense.com has
reached similar distribution agreements with Baker &AMP; Taylor and
other wholesalers. The wholesalers' ability to deliver on their
promises is crucial, says Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant
at Market Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online component of bookselling is difficult for people
without the resources and organizational savvy of Amazon,'' she
said. ``ABA is a trade organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacle, she says, is the same as it was for Barnes &AMP; Noble
when it went online. ``They are trying to jerry-rig entrenched
systems, as opposed to building a Web-based transactional business,
which is what Amazon did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Len Vlahos, director of Booksense.com, says customer service
will be the strength of the program. ``The local store itself will
be point of customer contact,'' he said. ``There's an actual person
in the store, which has many more years of customer service
experience than Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question still remains whether the Internet plays to the
independents' strengths as retailers. Online booksellers can't
replicate the experience of browsing and buying books in a store,
says Jeffrey Fieler, consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Though he acknowledges that ``the independents have to do
something or they will be marginalized'' even further, he is
skeptical that a niche retailer can develop a significant market
share in a category already well-served on the Web. Last year,
according to Fieler, people visited an average of 15 sites a month.
This year, he says, the number has shrunk to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding the places that meet their needs,'' he
says. ``The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so
that people don't need to go to other sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by
technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a ``national marketing
umbrella'' launched by the booksellers association for its
beleaguered members in February 1999. In the last 16 months,
Booksense has attracted 1,154 stores across the country to its
offline program. It offers, among other features, a bestseller list
drawn from members' stores, gift certificates redeemable at any
affiliated store (allowing direct competition with the ubiquity of
the chains) and national advertising promoting independents'
reading recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Booksense.com charges participants a set-up fee, a monthly
maintenance fee and takes 4.5 percent in commissions on orders
shipped from wholesale partners.
</P>
<P>
   The association has earmarked more than $2 million for
promotion. Farley said Amazon had spent $40.6 million in
advertising, promotion and public relations in the last quarter
alone, though Amazon sells more than books.
</P>
<P>
   Local marketing by the independents themselves, together with
significant in-store promotion of the individual Web sites, is seen
as key to Booksense's viability.
</P>
<P>
   Fieler also sees risks in this limited approach. ``Partnerships
with other sites that command large shares'' of Internet traffic,
such as Barnes and Noble's relationship with AOL, or Amazon's
relationship with Yahoo, will be crucial for the venture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research from the American Booksellers Association shows, Hoynes
says, that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an
average of 20 books a year, but only eight of those at an
independent store. Booksense's goal is to build the independents'
share to 10 or 11.

   Contentville has significantly more marketing clout and will
sell more than books: content from newspapers and magazines, as
well as e-books, dissertations and other material. It will spend
$75 million in advertising over the next two years, according to
Brill, who estimates that books will account for 25 to 30 percent
of the site's total revenue. Both NBC and CBS have invested in
Contentville, and the site will be advertised on the networks
beginning in July in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Contentville independents will create a variety of editorial
features, including recommended ``libraries'' of essential books in
various categories, ``If You Ask Me'' endorsements of books they
love and new books they are enthusiastic about. There will also be
store bestseller lists and ``Buzz on the Floor'' notes on local
happenings that have helped sales of certain titles. But Shanley
questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web, where
``virtual communities are more important than land-based ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are complementary _ Contentville will have pages
that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the
programs. Roxanne Coady of R.J. Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who
is participating in both sites, said: ``Booksense as a branding
campaign, Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind
consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice. That
alone is a big deal.''
