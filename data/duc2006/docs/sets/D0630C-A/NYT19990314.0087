INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS PLAN TO OPEN ONLINE STORE  
(DW)

   NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade
association for independent booksellers is creating its own
national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition
from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   The online venture, which is scheduled to open for business this
summer, is the most ambitious element in a series of
countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American
Booksellers Association, the dominant trade group for a beleaguered
fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book
market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition
from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store
owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are
under siege. The electronic bookstore and a planned national
marketing campaign are the first collective efforts of an
ordinarily disparate group of independents. The goals is to compete
against some of the forces that have reduced ABA membership to
about 3,300 from 5,200 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to knock off the Goliaths _ I don't want to
look naive,'' said Hut Landon, a bookstore owner in Mill Valley,
Calif., and the executive director of the Northern California
Independent Booksellers Association, which developed the pilot
concept last year. ``All we're trying to do is retain our market
share. We recognize that we've got to do this in this day and age.
We can't just be quaint little booksellers in our community asking
how the kids are.''
</P>
<P>
   The association already has organized a series of 12 customer
focus groups along with the development of the electronic
bookstore. In its initial stages, the store will feature all the
standard functions of popular online sites, including a search
engine, a stock of 1.5 million titles, credit card fulfillment,
gift wrapping, distribution services and a best-seller list. But it
will also allow individual stores to tailor Web pages to reflect
their individuality with store reviews and features.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do is find the different ways that
we can do what our competitors are doing,'' said Michael F. Hoynes,
the association's newly hired marketing officer. He said initial
interest in the program was enthusiastic because booksellers have
been asking for a collective approach.
</P>
<P>
   The booksellers' association, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will
begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book
Sense brand, which in some ways is inspired by the example of the
independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True
Value label.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to spend about $2 million to develop the
electronic bookstore and about $2 million more on the marketing
campaign _ money that comes in part from its half-share of $25
million that the association won from Penguin Group USA in a
dispute over favorable discounts that were given to large retail
bookstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, where there is a strong and active group
of independent booksellers, the regional association has also spent
about $100,000 to promote a common identity under the name Book
Sense. The brand and a slogan, ``Independent Bookstores for
Independent Minds,'' are appearing in newspaper advertisements and
on decals, posters, and plastic shopping bags in the Bay Area,
where more than 200 bookstores have signed up to participate in the
pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   But the collective approach envisioned by the national
association is broader in scope, conceivably allowing customers to
order books online with the freedom to pick up or return a book at
any participating Book Sense store. The association is already in
discussions with a national wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor, to provide
distribution services, a critical element for an online service
that caters to customers with swift delivery. It is also
considering expanding the electronic title base to include
out-of-print books.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the pricing system still is being determined,
although individual bookstore owners will have great flexibility to
offer discounts on their templates, said Len Vlahos, the
association's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, the association will start signing
up members to participate in the electronic project, which would
cost bookstore owners monthly development fees expected to range
from $175 to $450.

   Several technology analysts said that the move was a vital step
to protect the booksellers eroding turf, and noted that the
independents may be able to capitalize on strengths in ways that
Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble cannot.
</P>
<P>
   David Brodwin, an associate partner with Andersen Consulting who
follows electronic commerce, said the Book Sense venture would draw
on the loyalty of customers who prefer local bookstores over
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independents will feature locally relevant information _
travel, restaurant guides, local history _ with a degree of
sophistication and connoisseurship that the nationwide players may
have trouble matching,'' Brodwin said. He cautioned, though, that
associations often move slowly. That could present problems for
success in electronic commerce, which requires decisiveness and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, the director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research company, said that
independent booksellers had no choice but to act because customers'
shopping habits were changing.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester projects that almost $1.2 billion in book purchases
will be made online this year, she said. Spending will rise in 2003
to almost $3 billion, or about 18 percent of the book market, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book lover in me is thrilled to hear about this for the
independents,'' Ms. Delhagen said. ``Banding together and forming a
network is the only way. This is a huge opportunity for them to
survive, because long term, they're getting eviscerated. There is
an option now rather than shuttering their stores. This development
presents them with an opportunity to say, `I'm sticking around, and
we're not letting Amazon and Barnes &AMP; Noble run us out of town.'''
