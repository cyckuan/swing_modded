3 ONLINE BOOK RETAILERS CUT PRICES ON BEST SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc., the
online retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent
Monday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals,
Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost
certainly lose money on the bargain rates.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for
its No. 2 rival, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., which has imminent plans for
a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But a company spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon.com said the
timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times
best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that drive this business,'' said Bill
Curry, a spokesman for Amazon. ``It's selection, price and
convenience. And we are constantly working on all three of these
things. We've added convenience with distribution centers that will
get merchandise faster to customers. And this is an opportunity to
do something with price.''
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of announcements on Monday, the three electronic
booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices
of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best-seller
lists. That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any
given week.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, publishers offer books to retailers for less than
half of the list price, which means that the electronic rivals will
be losing money with these discounts on best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers, who
offered similar reasons for plunging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace,'' said
Leonard Riggio, the chairman and chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble,
who added that Amazon has ``changed their prices in the middle of a
public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   With a certain element of distaste, Borders.com, a unit of
Borders Group Inc., also announced a price-cut. ``I have to tell
you that this is not the battlefield that we think we're going to
win on in the long run,'' said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for
Borders.com. ``But we're not going to let this distinguish us from
the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50
percent discounts. And, in fact, Amazon was issuing refunds on the
difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books
shortly before its announcement of the discounts.

<P>
   Kate Delhagen, director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm, said the
outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new
competitive pressures.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers
to compare prices through Web site services such as Add All that
instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers. For
example, Monday that site compared the prices for more than 24
bookstores and prominently listed Amazon for offering the best
price for the best-selling children's novel, ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone.'' The list price is $16.95, but with the discount
and a shipping charge, Amazon was selling the title for $12.43.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using these comparison tools,'' Ms. Delhagen said.
``And what Amazon is doing is making sure that they are there. It's
definitely a defensive strategy being deployed, but it's also part
of their increasing energy to add customers to their database.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, Amazon's spokesman, declined to say whether the company
would lose money on the 50 percent discounts. ``We're just not
talking about whether we're selling at a profit or a loss,'' he
said. However, Curry said Amazon has decreased its reliance on book
distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers. Those
efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now
passing along to its customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the
activities of competitors. ``We don't fancy ourselves with the
competition,'' he said. ``We're focused on our customers as opposed
to what the competition is doing.''
