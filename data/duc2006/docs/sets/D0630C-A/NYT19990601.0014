   WASHINGTON _ The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has
concluded that the planned merger between the nation's largest
bookseller and its largest book wholesaler violates antitrust law
and has recommended that the full commission step in to block
Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600 million acquisition of Ingram Book Group, a
person involved in the deal said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, a significant victory for both publishers and
independent booksellers, which have waged a powerful campaign
against the proposed deal since it was announced last year, does
not bode well for the planned acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram, a unit of Ingram
Industries, will try to make their case soon to the full
commission. But the commissioners rarely overturn the
recommendations of their staff. And if the recommendations are
upheld, the two companies will have to decide whether it is worth
waging a protracted and uncertain legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble, said on
Monday night that the company had been working closely with the
commission and was providing information that the agency had
requested. ``These are confidential proceedings,'' Ms. Keating
said, ``and we're not going to comment on speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble proposed the merger during a period of
consolidation and turmoil in the publishing and book-selling
industries. Top executives from the company have hailed the deal as
a rare opportunity to recognize great cost-savings through
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, in particular, has been in the middle of a
buying binge as part of its response to growing competition on
line, particularly from Amazon.com. Amazon.com, which started by
relying almost exclusively on wholesalers to fill its orders,
remains dependent on the services of Ingram. Ingram has been its
leading supplier, filling more than 58 percent of its orders,
according to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would give Barnes &AMP; Noble access to 11
distribution centers, which would help it cut costs and reduce
delivery time for its growing base of on-line customers.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment the proposed deal was announced last
November, it was denounced by groups representing writers and
smaller booksellers. One group likened it to the marriage of
Godzilla and King Kong. The independent booksellers, led by their
trade group, the American Booksellers Association, have waged a
fierce legal and letter-writing campaign, hoping to enlist not only
the federal regulators, but state antitrust officials as well.
Officials in California said they were investigating the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the independent booksellers, the worst fears are that a new
book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble could ultimately
affect issues like credit, speed of delivery and access to popular
titles that are in short supply. Although Ingram, which is based in
Nashville, is a dominant force in book distribution, it does not
disclose its market share. Barnes &AMP; Noble has about 14 percent of
the retail book market.
</P>
<P>
   The American Booksellers Association, along with Amazon.com, the
New York-based Authors Guild, and others had filed papers with the
Federal Trade Commission urging it to intervene and block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal case has hardly been open-and-shut. While federal
regulators have been more rigorously examining proposed mergers
during the Clinton administration than in earlier years, they have
taken on so-called horizontal ones, that is, those between
companies in the same line of business, and have only rarely
challenged ``vertical'' mergers involving businesses in different
aspects of an industry, like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   Oren Teicher, the chief operating officer of the American
Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he had not heard
of the FTC staff's position on the merger but added that the
association would be ``extremely gratified'' to see it blocked. For
the nation's bookstores, Teicher said, the merger would be
``terribly anticompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the smaller bookstores rely on Ingram as the sole source
for books, though the larger stores typically place orders directly
through publishers as well as through Ingram and the second-largest
wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers had organized one of the most elaborate
opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry,
with so many petitions, E-mail messages and telephone appeals to
the FTC that the agency had set aside a special line just to record
calls about the Ingram deal.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has been performing what is known as a second request
review, a fairly uncommon procedure that allows the agency to
extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent deals in the book industry faced intense reviews
from federal regulators but were still eventually approved. The
British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of
inspection for its purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education unit,
which was ultimately approved. Bertelsmann A.G.'s successful
acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also
received additional attention.
