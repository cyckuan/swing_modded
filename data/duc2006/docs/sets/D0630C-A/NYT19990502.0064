   LOS ANGELES _ The reviews are in for last year's books and the
reading is not pleasant. A new industry study indicates that the
popular market for literature declined, with the number of
purchases dropping for the first time in seven years despite the
growing presence of electronic bookstores and the easy availability
of titles.
</P>
<P>
   The widely publicized arrival of online booksellers has failed
so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction even
as demand has fallen for mass-market paperback books and as
affluent, educated readers buy fewer titles, according to the Book
Industry Study Group, a trade group that tracks the reading habits
of 16,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the
top publishers who gathered in Southern California Sunday at the
Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America, the annual and
sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and
their suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the release of the survey on Friday, Peter Olson,
the chief executive of Random House, the unit of Bertelsmann AG
that is the nation's largest publisher, appeared on a panel,
``Bookselling in the Next Millennium.'' During the discussion, he
insisted that book sales on line amounted to incremental growth
rather than a shift of purchases from other traditional outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But the new consumer-research study indicates that sales over
all declined almost 3 percent, to 1.04 billion books purchased _
literary spoils that were divided among a shifting group of
booksellers. For the first time that electronic commerce was
measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the
book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share,
which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent. The
large bookstore chains raised their part of the market slightly to
25.3 percent, reflecting their own slowing expansion of
brick-and-bookshelf stores. The rest of the bookselling market
includes everything from mail order companies to warehouse chains
to food and drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of
titles on the market, booksellers struggled to understand why they
were not reaching more readers. The downturn in sales comes as the
economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent
publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53,400
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York
stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to
appeal to independent booksellers. By necessity, those booksellers
are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of
their own, Book Sense, which has now signed up more than 860
members.
</P>
<P>
   Avin Domnitz, the chief executive of the American Booksellers
Association, said the study reflected other research the trade
group had conducted to prepare for the August start of the Book
Sense site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people, in particular,'' Domnitz said, are ``so busy and
so mobile that the acquisition of these things are just not on
their priority list.''
</P>
<P>
   That group is reading, he noted _ not necessarily traditional
books but perhaps information on line.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the softness in the market is attributable to the
falling popularity of paperbacks; those books once ushered in a
revolution in popular reading because of their modest cost and easy
portability. The weakness of paperback sales took their toll on
used bookstores, book clubs, mail-order companies, even drugstores
_ all of which experienced declines in their shares of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-market paperback sales sagged more than 21 percent at
drugstores and 17 percent at used bookstores _ reflecting a shift
in American reading habits by customers who may prefer the larger
type of discounted hardcovers or more expensive trade paperbacks.
Cost may also have driven away potential customers: the average
price of paid for a paperback book outpaced the rate of inflation
over the last five years, rising to $4.56 from $4.12 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the age factor, the Association of American
Publishers has created an publicity campaign featuring celebrity
bookworms and a slogan, ``Get Caught Reading,'' to try to reach the
young, but there's heavy work ahead. In particular, readers younger
than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20
percent. Older customers between 55 and 64 remained loyal, the
study showed, buying 15 percent more books.
</P>
<P>
   Readers with annual incomes of more than $75,000 are usually
heavy book-buyers, but last year they also cut back. In general,
readers bought fewer fiction titles and pared even more on
nonfiction, like biographies and history, which declined in sales
by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The customers younger than 40 who did shift to online
book-shopping displayed rather different reading tastes than those
of the general market. Popular fiction topped E-commerce sales at
33 percent, followed by 14 percent for technical and science books,
12 percent for cookbooks and crafts titles and 11 percent for
psychological and recovery books. In the general market, popular
fiction has a much more commanding presence _ 51 percent _ followed
by religious titles at 10 percent and cookbooks at 9 percent .
</P>
<P>
   The study notes that religious-book buyers did not seem to
respond to electronic bookstores, but did buy enough titles in
other outlets to expand the segment's share of the market by more
than 1 percent. Over all, customers bought fewer books in every
category except in categories for travel and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Domnitz, whose organization helped finance the study, still
believes there is a potential for expanding the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that about half of the population is not going
to purchase books in the course of a year,'' he said. ``And so we
have to concentrate on those who do.''
