   WASHINGTON _ A plume of fire about to consume a marvel of
aviation, a moment of horror frozen forever in a stunning image: To
Prof. W. David Lewis, who studies the history of technology, the
burning Concorde looked like a zeppelin for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's haunting,'' said Lewis, a historian at Auburn University.
``That long fiery path in the sky, it reminds me, not in detail but
in overall symbolic concept, of the Hindenburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just that both had a fiery end, the Air France jet
as it took off near Paris on Tuesday and the giant German zeppelin
as it was being moored in Lakehurst, N.J., on May 6, 1937. Both
supersonic jet and zeppelin, Lewis pointed out, were symbols of
national pride. Each offered luxury service for a wealthy few, and
both operated at times of rapid technological change that made
their futures uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   And both, it seems, are instructive about the difficulties of
predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the accident last week, which killed 114 people including five on
the ground, will kill the supersonic transports the way the
Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible, when it crashed
killing 35 people on board and one on the ground. But progress _
including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both.
</P>
<P>
   In its day, the Concorde was the ne plus ultra of technology,
the edge of the envelope in speed and altitude. Thirty years later,
the envelope has stretched a great deal, but in other directions,
notably toward safety, comfort and reliability. And though the
Concorde still flies twice as fast and twice as high, the question
is whether it has been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting technological change is hard, and the airlines and
plane builders are not good at it. When the Concorde was new,
Boeing was turning out 747s, the world's largest plane, as a
stopgap until supersonics could become the mainstay of commercial
aviation, and Pan Am was talking about carrying passengers to the
moon. The moon is still there but now is unvisited even by
astronauts. Pan Am is gone. The 747 has only grown to carry more
people more miles, and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of
an endangered species: 20 were built; 12 remain. There are more of
every high-profile thing that flies, except maybe for the space
shuttles and the Goodyear blimps.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced in ways almost unimaginable in 1976,
when the Concordes entered commercial service to the United States.
And while expectations may have scaled back in some areas, like
trips to the moon, they have grown in other ways, almost without
our noticing, especially in the ubiquity and safety of air travel.
In 1969, the year the Concorde first broke the sound barrier, the
total number of people carried on planes in the United States was
less than the country's population. This year, the number of
passengers is more than double the population.
</P>
<P>
   New planes carry entertainment screens in every seat-back. The
Concorde's design does not allow even an in-flight movie. Makers of
new planes boast that they will fly almost continuously, day after
day. The typical Concorde, in contrast, flies 3 hours a day or
less.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is one of the few examples in history of a
technology whose successor was slower. It bears a passing
resemblance to the U.S. nuclear power industry, which used a
technology that looked advanced and attractive in the 1960s and
'70s, only to seem, 20 years later, esoteric and not worth the
bother and expense. It is as if the airlines have decided the
tortoise is sexier than the hare.
</P>
<P>
   Flying is now safer than driving, taking the train or walking,
and almost safer than staying home. One reason is that airplanes
are now mass produced, and their failures protect each other. There
are, for example, about 2,600 Boeing 737s in service, and every now
and then, somebody finds something worrisome in one of them, like a
power conduit inside a fuel tank that has short-circuited and is
giving off sparks. But the result is a swift order to inspect the
other thousands for the same problem and fix it. In contrast, if
the cause of the Concorde crash turns out to be a generic flaw, the
population protected will be the remaining 12 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the grand sweep of technological progress, that may not
be a fair way to consider safety, or even a sensible one. ``If you
do take that approach, we'll never have any advances,'' said John
R. Deakin, a veteran Boeing 747 pilot and safety expert. ``Somebody
has to be out there on the bleeding edge.''
