<HEADLINE> Concorde Investigation Continues  </HEADLINE>

   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators removed two engines from the Concorde
crash site Wednesday in hopes the wreckage of the Air France
supersonic jet will help determine the cause of the disaster that
killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 technicians transported the wreckage to a site at Dugny
near Le Bourget airport, north of Paris, where it will be examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every detail and every placement of the pieces is possibly
crucial,'' said Xavier Mulot, head of Concorde 95, an investigatory
team set up to establish the legal responsibility for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four members of the French national police and three
judicial experts are participating in the inquiry. They have taken
statements from 295 witnesses of the crash, Mulot said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the inquiry into the July 25 crash, investigators
also summoned technical experts from a U.S. tire manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., the world's largest maker of
aircraft tires and the only tire supplier for the Air France
Concorde fleet, sent two specialists to France on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were asked to supply technical assistance to the
investigation,'' company spokesman Chris Aked said Tuesday from
Goodyear headquarters in Akron, Ohio. ''We sent two aircraft tire
engineers ... and they are now working with the investigation
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Aked said he had no information about the cause of the crash or
whether a tire malfunction was involved.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that one or two of the Concorde's tires
exploded and one of the plane's engines shut down, followed by the
partial shutdown of another engine.
</P>
<P>
   France's Accident and Inquiry Office has said flames spewing
from the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came
from a major fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, French authorities decided to keep its fleet of
Concordes grounded while investigators try to recreate the events
that caused the crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately
after the crash. The world's other seven Concordes, owned by
British Airways, resumed most flights after a day's pause.
