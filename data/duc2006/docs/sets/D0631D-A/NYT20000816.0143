BRITAIN OFFICIALLY RULES CONCORDE UNFIT TO FLY 
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON _ British aviation authorities on Wednesday formally
ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its
manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to last
month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris. The French said
on Wednesday that they were contemplating a similar step.
</P>
<P>
   The British authorities said the accident's ``primary cause''
was a tire that burst and expelled debris that ruptured a fuel
tank. The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action
against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately
after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF 4590, which plunged
to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people
in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane.
British Airways, the only other Concorde operator, grounded its
entire fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the
airworthiness certificate would be revoked Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Without an airworthiness certificate, aircraft are not permitted
to fly. British Airways said Wednesday that it had suspended
Concorde flights through September, but gave no clear indication
whether it believed the aircraft _ which crosses the Atlantic in
about three and one-half hours at up to twice the speed of sound _
would ever return to commercial service.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde has been plying scheduled trans-Atlantic and
charter routes for almost 25 years and had come to be seen as an
icon of prestigious travel for executives and celebrities ready to
pay up to $10,000 for a round-trip ticket.
</P>
<P>
   After the July 25 crash, French investigators said they believed
that a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport
outside Paris had caused a tire to burst. The blow-out caused
chunks of rubber to rupture fuel tanks located in the wings close
to Concorde's four jet engines. Concorde's spindly, stork-like
landing gear is positioned directly below the wings and engines.
</P>
<P>
   But, while Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately
after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day
suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service.
British aviation experts said the British Concordes had been
modified to protect the wings from tire blow-outs in the mid-1990s,
while Air France Concordes had not been modified.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malcolm Field, the chairman of the Civil Aviation
Authority, an official regulatory body, said, ``It is clear to all
of us on the CAA that a tire burst alone should never cause the
loss of a public transport aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the authority had asked Concorde's manufacturers, BAe
Systems, Airbus UK and Aerospatiale of France, to devise a plan to
insure that accidents could not be caused by a tire blow-out. Under
aviation regulations, airplanes whose fuel tanks are vulnerable to
catastrophic damage from burst-tire debris may not be certified as
airworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Field rejected the idea that the demand for modifications
effectively meant the Concorde would never fly again. ``We would
wish Concorde to fly again,'' he said.

   Jean-Claude Gayssot, the French transport minister, also said
the measures did not necessarily imply the end of supersonic
travel. ``Anyone who says it's the end for supersonic flights has
got it wrong,'' he told the French newspaper Liberation.
``Traveling fast is going to be increasingly in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A British investigator, Ken Smart, of Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Branch, said the precise links between the sequence
of events that doomed Flight AF 4590 last month had not yet been
established in detail.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the burst tire sent debris flying to puncture one
or more fuel tanks, allowing fuel to spill out and catch fire
within seconds. The airplane, thundering down the runway at around
195 mph for take-off, lost thrust in one engine, then in two. ``The
crew had no means to make them aware of the nature of the fire nor
to take action against it,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the safety issues relating to the tires would take
``some time to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Burst tires have been a worry for Concorde pilots since the
plane entered service, according to British aviation experts. Since
then, there have been seven known blow-outs in which debris struck
fuel tanks without rupturing them, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to the British Airways Concordes in 1993 involved
changes to a water deflector on the undercarriage to ``reduce the
energy'' from a tire-burst, according to Derek Blackhall, the head
of the certification section of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
