<HEADLINE> Experts Study Concorde Safety  </HEADLINE>

   PARIS (AP) -- French investigators met Thursday to try to
determine what new safety measures are required before Air France
can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its
supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of experts, including French aviation authorities and
Air France representatives, was working to establish the chain of
events that led to the disaster and make a recommendation to the
Transportation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The technical investigation into the crash is going quickly,
Gilles Ricono, the top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot, said after the meeting. But he said experts still had to
clarify a number of key issues before a ban on Air France Concorde
flights is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came a day after French authorities established a
special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and
potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were
killed. The unit includes 44 members of the French national police
and three judicial experts.
</P>
<P>
   Air France Flight 4590 smashed shortly after takeoff into a
hotel in the town of Gonesse north of Paris. It was the first crash
ever of the sleek jet, once the pride of French aviation.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways resumed its Concorde flights a day after the
crash. Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday quoted Gayssot, the transport
minister, as raising the possibility that the ban on Air France
Concorde flights could remain in place until the Accident and
Inquiry Office releases a preliminary report on the crash at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Accident and Inquiry Office, which is part of the
Transportation Ministry, has said that flames spewing from the side
of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came from a major
fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   It has also said one or two of the jet's tires exploded, one of
the engines shut down, and another failed twice -- once during
takeoff and again, fatally, about one minute later.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a spokesman for the Accident and Inquiry Office
declined to comment on a report in USA Today that quoted
unidentified sources as saying investigators were trying to
determine whether a piece of Flight 4590's landing gear broke off
before takeoff, leading to a fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, some 100 technicians carefully removed two engines
from the site of the crash to a special location at Dugny, near Le
Bourget airport north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., which is the only tire supplier
for the Air France Concorde fleet, has sent two specialists to
France to aid in the inquiry.
