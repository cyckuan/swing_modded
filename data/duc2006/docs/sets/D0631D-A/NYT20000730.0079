ANALYSIS: FUSING BEAUTY AND TERROR, REVERENCE AND DESECRATION

   It may seem heartless to think about beauty in the wake of human
tragedy. But the aftershock from news of the Concorde disaster was
linked to the emotions beauty can stir up. One hundred fourteen
people died as a result of last week's crash. Compared with a
single life, the plane itself is nothing, just metal, rubber and
oil. These were nonetheless combined into one of the most important
cultural artifacts of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 31 years since the first Concorde was rolled out, only a
select few have flown on it. But this swan of a craft has winged
through the imaginations of millions more. It's not just the French
or the British who look up admiringly when the Concorde flies
overhead. Anyone with an eye looks up.
</P>
<P>
   To see: A masterpiece of contrapuntal aesthetics. The contrast
between thin, elongated fuselage and wide, swept-back wings.
Between the curve of the wings and the rectangular engines beneath
them. The proportions of windows in relation to fuselage. The
triangular configuration formed by the needle-point nose and the
wing tips (or, when on the ground, the birdlike landing gear). The
ugly duckling-into-swan metamorphosis when the drooped nose swings
back into place. The Concorde's elegance arises from these formal
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's beauty is existential. Profit-taking doesn't keep it
aloft. A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000.
Even when full, however, the Concorde has lost money. National
pride is one reason it has stayed in service. The pain of writing
off what it cost to develop the plane may be another. But an
ineffable factor is also at work: a reverential feeling akin to the
impulse to admire an oak, contemplate a painting or gaze up at a
Gothic spire.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is French (or half French) in the sense that the
Chartres cathedral is French, but the plane's appeal is global to
the extent that French civilization is available to others. In 1955
Roland Barthes wrote that cars were the precise modern equivalent
of the great Gothic cathedrals: ``I mean the supreme creation of an
era, conceived with passion by unknown artists, and consumed in
image if not in usage by a whole population which appropriates them
as purely magical objects.'' In the mid-50s new cars could even
satisfy the pangs of aspiration. But by the 1960s the U.S. space
program had raised the stakes. Aspiration now came in the form of
altitude and the skyward thrust of jet propulsion. The Concorde was
Europe's answer to our Apollo mission. Let the Americans catapult
their tin cans, play golf and plant metal flags on the moon. We
Europeans will turn space into a secular idea of heaven: Champagne,
caviar and freshly laundered linen napkins on the headrests.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many brave young souls do dream of becoming astronauts
when they grow up. But a trip to Paris on the Concorde does not
involve settling for less. A rich person I know says that the one
thing she truly enjoys about having money is that it makes
traveling easier. Mass travel, in other words, is what gravity used
to be in the early days of flight: an oppressive condition from
which only the privileged manage to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Concorde has long been trailed by a whiff of morbidity.
Until last week the plane's safety record had been impeccable. But
its status as a cultural icon was always fragile. When the United
States canceled its program to develop supersonic transport for
civilians, the British-French endeavor was left without competition
and the benefits that accrue from it. It is not always so great to
be the only game in town. Without competition there was no
incentive to update the aircraft and none of the improvements that
succeeding generations of supersonic craft might have developed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result Concorde pilots must use their brains to operate
controls that on newer subsonic jets are run by computer. Who knows
whether more advanced controls would have alerted the pilots last
Monday to the flames shooting out of the engines? Or whether
advanced technology could have reduced noise, increased head room,
extended the range of flights or eventually brought down fares? The
craft's obsolescence was thus virtually guaranteed before the first
flight took off.
</P>
<P>
   In this the Concorde resembles the Queen Elizabeth 2, which
began trans-Atlantic service in the summer of 1969. Like the
Concorde the new Cunard liner was launched as a fusion of luxury
and modernity. Unlike the stodgy Art Deco interiors of the Queen
Mary and earlier Queen Elizabeth, the QE2 was fitted with dramatic
jet-black carpets and molded plastic fixtures. But who cared?
Design did not suffice to conquer time. No luxury could compete
with speed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s ads promoting a package deal started to appear in
glossy magazines. Sail first-class to Europe on the QE2, fly home
on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The package, presented as a cutting-edge experience, was
actually an invitation to indulge yourself in not one but two
obsolete forms of travel. Five days worth of shuffleboard and
midnight buffets. Three and a half hours on a plane whose days
became numbered when carriers cast their lot with the 747. To gain
a few hours over regular jets, you had to travel on a plane that
was swiftly becoming a museum piece of aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   For some the Concorde disaster evoked the memory of the
destruction of an earlier legendary trans-Atlantic vessel. On Feb.
9, 1942, while being refitted for wartime use, the French liner
Normandie caught fire at its Hudson River berth. Attempts to put
out the flames filled the ship with so much water that it capsized.
The Normandie lay on its side for the remainder of the war and
never sailed again.
</P>
<P>
   As smoke from the fire drifted over Manhattan, it was understood
that this was not an ordinary military mishap. For many the
Normandie was the most beautiful object created in the 20th
century. It epitomized the style and sophistication for which the
French were celebrated. Some compared it to the Parthenon. And its
destruction was an occasion to look for meanings deeper than the
tragedy's immediate cause. The welder's torch was an instrument in
a ritual enactment of the ancient idea that beauty itself may be
condemned to play a tragic, sacrificial role in human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Our relationship to beauty is not entirely positive. The power
to be moved by it can flow in more than one direction. For
Socrates, erotic attraction was to be directed toward a higher,
moral craving. From there it is but a step toward thinking that
physical beauty is a bad thing. The next step is to regard beauty
as an opportunity to relieve intense rage. Destroy the idol! Crush
Salome!
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Concorde crash I found myself in the middle
of an exchange between Peter Eisenman, the architect, and his wife,
Cynthia Davidson, editor of ANY magazine. Eisenman said, ``Hey, the
Stealth bomber is beautiful, too.'' To which Davidson objected:
``No! The Concorde is beautiful. The Stealth bomber is
terrifying.'' My position is that beauty is terrifying. Like
Homer's Helen or Michelangelo's David, beauty throws everything
into an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   There is pleasure as well as horror to be found in the
desecration of beautiful things. After the French Revolution, the
Sainte-Chapelle was used for storing flour. The Ottomans stockpiled
gunpowder in the Parthenon. The Normandie, appropriated by the
United States from France's Vichy government, was being converted
into a troop ship when it burned. Something there is that doesn't
like art.
</P>
<P>
   There's a risk in dwelling too much on the Concorde's
obsolescence. The risk is that we blind ourselves even further to
the outmoded ways of thinking coursing through culture today. The
Concorde's beauty emerged from the context of the 1960s, a period
interior decorators now call retro. We've given ourselves the
luxury of periodizing progress. At Disney World, the Futureland
attractions have been redesigned as Jetson-style, nostalgic
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   This luxury is turning out to be expensive, and not just because
an original Eames chair can cost thousands. The fundamentals of the
'60s context have not disappeared. As Davidson reminded me, the
demand for speed is greater, not less, in today's world. As
Eisenman suggested, the military faces few obstacles in meeting
that demand. Technically there's nothing to prevent development of
a supersonic passenger craft capable of altitudes from which the
sonic boom would not reach Earth. The Concorde crash, in other
words, ought to shock people out of retro ways of thinking in all
spheres of culture. It could easily be used as an opportunity to
affirm them.
