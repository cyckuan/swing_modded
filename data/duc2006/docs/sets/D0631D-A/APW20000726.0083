<HEADLINE> Survivors Recall Concorde Crash  </HEADLINE>

   PARIS (AP) -- Moments after a Concorde jet slammed into her
hotel, a 21-year-old British woman jumped from a window, escaping
the inferno that engulfed the building.
</P>
<P>
   A busload of 44 teen-agers from southeastern England had been
scheduled to check into the Hotelissimo an hour before the deadly
crash, but was mercifully stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And a group of Polish tourists returned from a sightseeing trip
to find the hotel in ruins, their belongings destroyed -- and their
lives spared.
</P>
<P>
   They were among those who escaped death in the crash Tuesday
that claimed the lives of all 109 people on board the supersonic
jet and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Brooking tossed her suitcases on her hotel bed Tuesday
afternoon and dialed the phone to call her sister in London. She
had just arrived for a summer job in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden I heard a noise. It sounded like a normal
takeoff. It just got louder and louder until the whole building
started trembling,'' Brooking recalled a day after the Concorde,
smoke and flames streaming from its engines, slammed into the
backside of her 40-room hotel, about two miles from Charles de
Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the phone, it sounded as if ''there had been
an earthquake in Paris,'' Brooking's 24-year-old sister, Natalie,
recalled at a news conference Wednesday at the British Embassy in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Flames shot through Brooking's room when she opened her door,
turning it into a smoke-filled oven. ''I leapt across the room,
leapt across the bed and out the window,'' said Brooking, of
Hildenborough, England, who suffered only a burned left hand.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't recall how far she fell, if she landed on gravel or
grass, or if the hotel crumbled or exploded. ''All you could see
was flames. It was just flames everywhere,'' said Brooking, a
student of linguistics at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after her brush with death, Brooking said she
had not yet slept and did not consider herself ''someone that had
survived a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very, very lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, a tour leader, was awaiting the arrival of the Suffolk
Youth Wind Band. Their tour bus, filled with 12- to 19-year-old
band members, was late arriving at the Hotelissimo, stalled in
traffic after the trip from Ipswich, England.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see smoke for some time and there were rescue
vehicles on the road,'' said conductor Philip Shaw. ''When we
arrived at the hotel it was explained just what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The youths, who spent Wednesday at a Paris hotel recovering from
shock, planned to go ahead with their five-day music program in the
concert halls of the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 45 Polish tourists returned from sightseeing to
find their hotel ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were totally unaware of what had happened,'' Maciej Kuznik,
the group's guide, told Poland's private Radio Zet. ''All of a
sudden we see the road blocked, and we hear our hotel is completely
burned down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still in shock and very tired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All their belongings and some passports were destroyed. Air
France paid for their stay Tuesday night in a Paris hotel and
offered compensation for the loss of some possessions.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor wept quietly at the Polish Embassy in Paris on
Wednesday, saying she had lost ''everything ... even my most
beautiful outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed two young Poles, Ewa Lipinska and Paulina
Sypko, both students at a hotel school in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still had illusions that it was a different hotel,'' Danuta
Lipinska, Ewa's mother, told a Polish television station after
flying to the crash site. ''Only dust remained. What will I take
home?''
