<HEADLINE> Rich and Famous Miss Concorde  </HEADLINE>

   LONDON (AP) -- The grounding of the Concorde left a hole at the
top end of the travel market, reducing the rich and famous to the
same subsonic pace as the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, for people who used it, it's a disaster in two
areas: It got you there quickly, and it got you there more
interestingly,'' British film director Michael Winner said
Wednesday. ''And you met a better class of people in the lounge.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by British and French authorities to suspend
certification of the supersonic plane leaves executives,
celebrities and the merely wealthy with no alternative for cutting
the time of a trans-Atlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately
after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people. British
Airways, which has seven Concordes, persisted until crash
investigators discovered that the failure of a tire was the primary
cause of the disaster -- and could threaten other flights.
</P>
<P>
   Opera singer Placido Domingo said he has taken the Concorde many
times and ''always appreciated the fact that it got me to my
destination in a miraculously short time and safely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appreciating it doubly now that they have taken the
precaution of grounding the planes until they know all the
pertinent facts about this terrible tragedy,'' said Domingo, who is
in Austria at the Salzburg festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tragedy and a shattering blow for this country if it
is the end of Concorde,'' noted food critic Egon Ronay told The
Times of London. ''It is such a prestigious brand and something
Britain was known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents already are hearing from customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have only one couple -- a very big philanthropist -- they are
very upset that they have to go on subsonic flight,'' said Rina
Anoussi, owner of The Travel Business in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Grounding Concorde ''will affect a lot of people because of the
extraordinary savings of time. I have a lot of people who love the
London Concorde for the time, for the prestige,'' Anoussi said.
</P>
<P>
   And people love the Concorde for the chance to sit near a
celebrity -- whether it be Michael Jackson, Madonna, Paul McCartney,
Margaret Thatcher or Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, however, are a small slice of the Concorde market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's mainly businessmen, average age around 40 -- sort of
bankers, that sort of thing,'' said Steve Miller of Air News, a
news agency based at Heathrow airport. ''And you get a very small
percentage of people who have saved up their money for a
once-in-a-lifetime treat. You get cruise passengers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways promised Wednesday to seek urgent meetings with
the plane's makers and regulators to get the supersonic jets back
in the air. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority stripped the
airline's Concordes of permission to fly after investigators said a
burst tire probably caused the deadly crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Air France Concordes were already grounded; French aviation
officials also suspended their flight certification Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   British aviation authority chairman Sir Malcolm Field said the
Concorde's certificate of airworthiness would remain suspended
until ''appropriate measures'' had been taken to ensure the safety
of the aircraft's tires.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crash and the actions of French and British
officials, Concorde retained its allure for many flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd get on it in a minute,'' said American film director John
Waters, who confessed he never flew the Concorde. ''What will be
will be,'' Water said from Baltimore. ''I'm scared of cars, not
planes.''
