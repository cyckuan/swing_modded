CONCORDE INVESTIGATORS LOOK AT METAL STRIP AS CAUSE OF CRASH 
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS _ French investigators looking into the crash last month
of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a
16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow
out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering
a fire that brought down the plane.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the investigators had offered a probable
explanation of why the jet caught fire on takeoff and crashed into
a hotel north of Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Accident Investigations, which is looking into the
causes of the crash, said in a statement that the metal strip
appeared to match the shape of a gash found in one of the plane's
left-side tires, and that it was `'probable that this piece caused
the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the disaster 16 days ago, investigators have focused on
the possibility that a tire blew out and that its debris damaged
the plane, starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement Thursday, the investigators said that the
bursting of the tire while the plane was moving down the runway at
about 195 mph threw up large pieces of the tire, some of them
weighing as much as 9 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators steered clear of a final explanation, but they
said that as a result of the debris from the tire, ``one of several
fuel tanks on the left wing was very rapidly damaged, with as a
consequence a very important fuel leak and fire.'' Exactly how this
happened had not yet been determined, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier statements, the investigators had said that tire
marks found on the runway after the crash showed that the aircraft
had veered to the left before taking off. They also said that in
addition to traces of tire marks, pieces of a water deflector fixed
above the left-side tires and debris from a fuel tank had been
found on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the investigators further reported that parts of the
plane's No. 5 fuel tank were found. The Concorde is outfitted with
seven fuel tanks in each wing.
</P>
<P>
   The tires on the Concorde are supplied by the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co., which manufactures them at a factory in Virginia. Last
week, Goodyear officials confirmed that the company's specialists
had been sent to France to assist the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have thus far been unable to determine whether
the metal strip was part of the Concorde. Xavier Mulot, a captain
in the French air transport police who is conducting a parallel
legal investigation of the crash, said at a news conference that he
could not say if the metal strip belonged to the Concorde. Last
week, investigators from the Bureau of Accident Investigations said
they believed the piece was not a part of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Work was suspended last week because of health concerns, after
asbestos particles were found in the debris. But Thursday
investigators resumed work, collecting and sorting out debris from
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been gathering remains from the Concorde's
four engines and seeking to reassemble key parts of the plane to
determine the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Attention has focused on the placement of the engines. A report
in the British publication New Scientist, the contents of which
were released Thursday, stated that a study commissioned in 1998 by
British Airways, which also flies the Concorde, revealed 55
``significant risks'' inherent in the design of the plane's jet
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Among the risks, the report cited the danger of uncontrolled
fire and multiple engine failure.
