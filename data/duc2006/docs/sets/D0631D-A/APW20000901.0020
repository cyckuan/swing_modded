<HEADLINE> Concorde Pilot Conversation Released  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- His supersonic jet aflame and two engines failing,
Christian Marty, captain of the doomed Concorde flight, tried to
gain speed for an emergency landing less than two minutes after
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde zero ... 4590, You have flames. You have flames
behind you,'' the control tower warned.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later came Marty's chilling word: ''Too late.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on the crash posted on the Internet
Thursday by French investigators provides a graphic account of the
final moments of Air France flight 4590 -- a chillingly professional
cockpit exchange that indicates the control tower gave the first
alert of trouble but that the crew was powerless to change their
aircraft's course.
</P>
<P>
   The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of
commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German
tourists, and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-page report by France's Accident and Inquiry Office, the
BEA, underscores that the crew was unaware, then unable, to correct
a trajectory toward disaster. The flaming plane slammed into a
small hotel, decimating it, and was partially embedded in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both France and Britain -- the only countries with supersonic
fleets -- last month withdrew the Concorde's airworthiness
certification while the investigation proceeds. The BEA, which
draws no conclusions in its report, planned a news conference
Friday. Its final report is not expected for at least a year. A
judicial investigation also is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives a second-by-second description of events.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:43 p.m. The sleek supersonic had just lifted its needle
nose toward the heavens after roaring down the runway at
breathtaking speed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven seconds after the message from the control tower at
Charles de Gaulle airport, the chief navigator confirmed,
''Breakdown eng... breakdown engine two.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cut engine two,'' he said, four seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing. But
Marty could be heard saying: ''Too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The control tower was trying to coax the Concorde back to runway
26, where it had taken off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Negative. We're trying for Le Bourget,'' a small nearby
airport, the copilot responded. It was 4:44 p.m. and 22 seconds.
There were some sounds similar to exertion. Nine seconds later all
was silent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crew had neither the means to be aware of the nature of
the fire nor to fight it,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report stresses that it was the destruction of a forward
tire on the left landing gear -- gashed by a 16-inch stray piece of
metal on the runway -- that likely triggered a chain of events
dooming the flight. Yet there was no indication from the transcript
of cockpit conversation that the crew was aware of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's burning badly, and I'm not sure it's coming from the
engine,'' said someone in the control tower. ''Gong'' sounds were
periodically recorded inside the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that heavy chunks of rubber from the burst
Goodyear tire damaged the fuel tanks located in the Concorde's
delta-shaped wings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes had elapsed from the time the tire was
gashed to the time the plane crashed, the report said. The flames
appeared less than a minute after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The highly technical report contains simple, telling
photographs, like that of a nearly 9-pound tire part with a nearly
13-inch gash, the bent metal strip that destroyed the tire and the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   After the tire was gashed, a fire appeared under the left wing,
the report said, followed by problems on engines No. 1 and 2. ''The
plane can neither gain altitude nor accelerate. The crew notes that
the landing gears cannot be lifted.'' Then the motor stops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Concorde has crashed near Le Bourget ...,'' the control
tower said at 4:45 and 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, the control tower sent out a general message:
''For all planes listening, I'll get back to you in a minute. We're
going to pull ourselves together and restart takeoffs.''
