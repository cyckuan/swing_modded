RIP FOR CONCORDE?

   Britain's decision on Tuesday to ground the Concorde following
the first fatal crash of the supersonic transport plane probably
marks the end of the line for what was almost certainly the
loftiest niche in commercial aviation history. If so, it will be a
long time before elite travelers will again be able to hop across
the Atlantic in a mere three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde was never a significant factor in aviation except for
those willing to pay up to $11,000 for a round-trip ticket between
New York and London or Paris. Only 20 of the planes were ever
built, and just 13 of those were still in service, seven with
British Air and six with Air France, which grounded its planes
immediately after the accident. Each Concorde has 100 seats,
compared with more than 400 on the largest conventional jetliners,
and the planes averaged only 800 revenue hours in the air a year,
about a third of a conventional plane's time at work.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde's conversion to museum status will be as much a matter
of economics as safety. Preliminary investigation of the crash,
which cost 113 lives, indicates that a tire was punctured by a
piece of scrap metal on the Charles de Gaulle Airport runway.
Chunks of the tire ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines, which
ignited escaping fuel. Reconfiguring the plane to prevent such
ruptures, by thickening the outer skin, would probably be more
expensive than even such enormous fares could justify.
</P>
<P>
   Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely
restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic
boom on earthlings. But at subsonic speeds, especially during
takeoffs, the roar of its jet engines and after-burners made
conventional jets sound like purrs. Noise-sensitive airports like
Logan banned the craft except for occasional emergency visits.
</P>
<P>
   Speed has always been the driving force in commercial travel.
Concorde's retirement may be unique in transportation annals for
lowering maximum speeds. Supersonic speed has remained a formidable
barrier for most airlines, and no successor to Concorde is within
sight. So millions of air travelers will have to be content with
moving around the world at a pokey 600 miles an hour. Poor turtles.
