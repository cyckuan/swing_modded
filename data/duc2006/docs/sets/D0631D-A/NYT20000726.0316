   NEW YORK _ The flight may not be as comfortable as business
class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies _
or any movies, for that matter _ but crossing the Atlantic in just
over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven to nine
hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative
discomfort, Concorde passengers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of a chartered Air France
Concorde outside Paris, killing all 109 people on the airplane and
four people on the ground, most members of the elite club that is
the Concorde's clientele had few qualms about flying the jet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about the crash, obviously I was horrified,''
said John Demsey, president of Mac Cosmetics, who flies on the
Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris
Wednesday on his way to the island of Capri. His trip was delayed
after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the
airline is convinced the planes are safe. But Demsey said that he
was ready to take his flight even after he heard about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point the plane has had a safety record as good or
better than any other plane,'' he said. ``I would definitely fly it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, the only other airline that flies the Concorde,
resumed its New York to London service Wednesday after having
canceled some flights Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might
smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a
full-fare roundtrip ticket, described as a business tool. But that
is how many of its denizens refer to it. Air France says two-thirds
of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the
rest are celebrities, the superrich or vacationers like members of
the German tour group who died in Tuesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   For business executives, the advantage of the Concorde, which
cruises twice as high as conventional jets and, at 1,350 mph, twice
as fast, is not just the time saved in the air. It is also the time
saved on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde
services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of
modern jet travel. Concorde passengers can arrive a half hour
before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and
immigration. Their luggage is delivered to them within minutes of
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities like the Concorde's exclusivity because it separates
them from the common folk on commercial flights. Executives like it
because they can socialize with celebrities. They can also network,
though that is not always a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's 100-seat cabin is so small it is hard to work
without your neighbors peeking over your shoulder. Wall Street
executives have been known to pick up the whiff of a deal after
bumping into a competitor with a client.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde's speed allows executives to put in a full day of
work in London, hop on the 7 p.m. Concorde and arrive back in New
York the same day at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in
industries like entertainment, finance, telecommunications and
energy, many executives are finding that they are having to travel
back and forth to Europe on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't take it for the luxury,'' said Emmanuel A.
Kampouris, former chairman of American Standard Companies, who had
just arrived on the 7 p.m. British Airways Concorde from London
Wednesday. ``It's not comfortable. Sometimes it is really cold, or
sometimes it is really hot but it is unbelievably convenient. You
arrive before you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason he flew the Concorde Wednesday was because he
had a meeting in London Wednesday and another in New York Thursday.
His wife, Camille, who accompanied him, was pleased because they
now had time to go out for dinner in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early
enough to connect to other destinations the same day. Indeed, the
Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent
in the afternoon. The alternative for many travelers is to take an
overnight flight and try to sleep on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sleep well on planes,'' Demsey said. ``To me it buys
back two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, one of the Concorde's dirty secrets is that few of its
regulars pay the top fare of more than $10,000 roundtrip. Most fly
so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the
airlines for discounts of as much as 30 percent, or the price of a
business-class ticket, which on Air France is $7,050.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the
Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to
swim,'' Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Travel in
Manhattan, said of the customers he books on the Concorde. If they
did not fly supersonic, they would fly first class, which is only a
few thousand dollars cheaper. Most of his customers believe that
the added cost is well worth it since it means they can do more
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who earn millions of dollars a year, it really does
pay for itself,'' he said.
