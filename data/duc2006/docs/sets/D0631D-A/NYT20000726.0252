IN WAKE OF CRASH, CONCORDE PILOTS PONDER A SAFETY PARADOX

   LONDON _ In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of an Air France
Concorde near Paris, some of the pilots who have flown them
pondered a paradox Wednesday. The supersonic airliner, according to
one, is tough and robust, with ``tremendous reserve capacity'' to
power its way out of trouble. But, according to another, if the
plane lost a side-by-side pair of its four engines at low speed
just after takeoff, it would be ``impossible to control.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in France reported Wednesday, that the pilot of
Concorde Flight AF4590 reported the failure of one engine that had
been repaired earlier in the day. But that, a former pilot said,
would not fully explain the flaming contrail of flame that
witnesses saw just after the airplane lifted off from Charles de
Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That great long plume of flame implies some sort of
catastrophic failure, when the engine breaks up and blows apart,''
said John Hutchinson, a former Concorde pilot. And failure on that
scale, aviation experts said, could well have damaged the plane's
control systems, or even another nearby engine housed in the
Concorde's wings close to the fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of both engines at low speed just after takeoff is
impossible to control,'' said another former pilot, Germain
Chambort, in a television interview in London.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have yet to establish the extent of the engine
failure that caused the flame. But pilots from the elite corps of
Concorde aviators, flying airplanes whose value is calculated far
more in corporate prestige than dollars-and-cents return on
investment, insisted that the Concorde's design _ with its engines
much closer together than on most sub-sonic planes _ would not have
contributed to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have complete confidence in that part of the design,'' said
Mike Bannister, the chief Concorde pilot for British Airways. Brian
Trubshaw, the former Concorde test pilot who flew the plane on its
maiden flight over Britain in 1969, told reporters at the
Farnborough Air Show that ``she is in her essence a safe plane.''
He was at the show to promote his autobiography, called ``Concorde:
The Inside Story.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hutchinson, the former pilot, said he regarded the Concorde
as ``a very safe airplane that has got at least 10 years and maybe
15 years of life'' left in it.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the former pilots and aviation experts who spoke to
reporters Wednesday ventured an opinion on how the Concorde might
have behaved in its final moments. But Malcolm English, editor of
Air International, said the drill would have been to avoid a stall
_ when an airplane loses the airspeed it needs to fly _ and seek a
safe landing. If, however, an intense fire burned through the
controls, even the most rudimentary anti-stall maneuvers would be
impossible. ``If that's what happened, then it looks like they lost
flight control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, an airplane would pitch and stall.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot reportedly suggested that if the experience of a
Concorde simulator was anything to go by, a simple engine failure
would be easier to control on a Concorde than on some subsonic
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those, ``keeping Concorde on centerline is a piece
of cake,'' Capt. John Wiley, a USAirways pilot, was quoted as
telling a Farnborough Air Show news bulletin published by Aviation
Week. With a double engine failure programmed into the simulator,
he said, the plane veered to one side while rolling to the other.
But regaining control was ``not even a bad dream, much less a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But how difficult is Concorde to fly?'' Wiley ruminated. ``One
simulator session may not be the best measure for this answer, but
let's just say it takes a lot of commitment to fly Concorde.''
