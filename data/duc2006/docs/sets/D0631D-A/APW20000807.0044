<HEADLINE> All 113 Concorde Victims Identified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTOISE, France (AP) -- Forensic experts on Monday finished
identifying the remains of all 113 victims of the Concorde crash,
nearly two weeks after the supersonic jet plunged to the ground in
a town outside Paris, a French public prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Xavier Salvat also said he ordered experts to
evaluate the jet's tires, motors, tanks and other important
features as part of the ongoing judicial inquiry into the July 25
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Salvat, the prosecutor in Pontoise, north of Paris, who is in
charge of the judicial inquiry, said investigators still had not
pinpointed the chain of events that led the delta-winged jetliner,
streaming with flames, to plunge into a small hotel in Gonesse
north of Paris shortly after takeoff. Four people on the ground and
all 109 people in the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The French government has grounded the five remaining Air France
Concordes while the inquiry continues.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, France's civil aviation ground mechanics called for
the government to rethink its move to freeze Concorde flights,
while the mayor of the town where the plane crashed underlined his
support for the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The national union of civil aviation ground mechanics, known by
its French initials SNMSAC, released a statement demanding a
''rapid lifting'' of the grounding order, saying the Concorde
itself should not be called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy sent a letter to Air
France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta underlining his support for
the supersonic jet's grounding and threatening to push on with
stronger demands.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways has continued to fly its fleet of Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in the French press that a 16-inch
strip of metal found on the runway -- and not belonging to the
Concorde -- could have been at the origin of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Accident and Inquiry Office reported the
discovery of the metal strip without further comment. In their
statement, the civil aviation ground mechanics questioned why
officials revealed this news nearly two weeks after the accident.
