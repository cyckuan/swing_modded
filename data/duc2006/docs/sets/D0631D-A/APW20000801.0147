<HEADLINE> BA: Concorde Demand Still Steady  </HEADLINE>

   LONDON (AP) -- British Airways insists that demand for seats on
its Concorde has not dropped off after the Air France crash a week
ago, despite a series of embarrassing problems since then with the
British fleet of supersonic jets.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single
day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on
July 25, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, British Airways -- the only airline flying the
supersonic jets at the moment since the French fleet is grounded
for now -- said Concorde traffic was comparable in recent days to
the same time period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some days this year are worse, but the airline pointed to one
recent post-crash Concorde flight from New York that arrived with
82 passengers, compared to 32 on the same date a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's performance since the crash, however, hasn't helped
calm fears about its safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's flight to New York, with 33 of the 100 seats filled,
was more than two hours late departing. The first plane assigned to
the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed
on a recently replaced engine, and another Concorde was rolled out.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, emergency services were out on the runway to attend
to the landing of a Concorde at Heathrow after a report of a loud
bang in an engine.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the first flight to New York was delayed by a
refueling problem. The day's second flight got only as far as
Gander, Newfoundland, where it made an emergency landing after
fumes that smelled like fuel got into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways operates a single round-trip flight daily
between New York and London, which the airline said that is normal
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The French disaster was the first in 25 years of commercial
operations for Concorde. But because the Concorde makes far fewer
flights than most aircraft, that one crash gave it one of the worst
safety records for passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Since there have only been 80,000 Concorde flights in a quarter
century, the aircraft now has a rate of 12.5 fatal incidents per
million flights, according to according to www.AirSafe.com, a Web
site that tracks safety data.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 727, with 46 fatal incidents since 1965, has a much
better safety rate -- 0.64 per million -- because the aircraft has
made nearly 72 million flights. The DC-9, which ranks second with
42 crashes, has a fatality rate of 0.72 per million flights.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways has one of the better safety records, at 0.32
fatal incidents per million flights, compared to 1.19 per million
for Air France, according to AirSafe data. American Airlines has a
rate of 0.53 per million, Delta 0.30 per million and United 0.50
per million.
