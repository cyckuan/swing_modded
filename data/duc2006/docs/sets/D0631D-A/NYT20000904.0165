METAL STRIP THAT DAMAGED CONCORDE LIKELY FROM A CONTINENTAL
AIRLINES PLANE 
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS _ A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to
the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came
from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same
runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency
investigating the disaster said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that an identical metal band that is believed to
have gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge chunks of
rubber to pierce the plane's fuel tanks, was reported missing by
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characteristics of the missing piece seem identical to
those of the metal piece which was found on the runway after the
accident on July 25, 2000,'' a statement issued by the French
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from its headquarters, Continental said the piece
could well have come from a Continental plane that was on its way
to Newark, N.J., from Charles de Gaulle airport outside of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative agency's latest statement came on a day when
Air France officials said they believed it was unlikely that the
remaining sleek-needle nosed supersonic jets belonging to Air
France and British Air would fly again before April, at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Air France, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said at a
press conference that a team of 20 experts was working with the
government and the plane's manufacturers to try to come up with
modifications that would insure the safety of the plane. The
modifications would then have to be tested, and only then would Air
France and British Air _ the only two airlines that fly Concordes _
discuss whether to return the aircraft to service.
</P>
<P>
   The French agency described the piece of metal that may have
triggered the crash that killed 113 people as ``a part of a hood on
the plane's reverse thrusters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Continental said the 17-inch by one-inch piece
of metal found on the runway was ``similar'' in shape to a piece
found missing from its DC10. The piece, it said, was ``missing from
the space between the fan reverser and the core door on the right
wing engine.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of such a piece, the statement said, ``does not
affect the safe operation of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, French investigators disclosed that one of three
daily runway inspections aimed at removing debris such as the metal
strip had been skipped on the day of the crash because of a fire
drill. The runway thus had not been thoroughly inspected for about
12 hours before the supersonic jet took off, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that the piece had fallen off the Continental
flight pointed out that the runway inspections would not have
prevented the disaster.
