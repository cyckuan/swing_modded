SCIENTISTS SLOWLY COME TO FAVOR DAM-BREACHING

<P>
   Scientists have reached a tentative consensus that dam-breaching
offers by far the best chance of restoring strong Snake River
salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   But like so much in the Columbia Basin salmon debate, this
conclusion is neither simple nor certain.
</P>
<P>
   Science, in short, offers policy-makers gamblers' odds, not
answers _ and the 20-year debate over Columbia Basin fish runs
grinds on.
</P>
<P>
   The broadest analysis to date comes from about two dozen
Northwest scientists, Indian tribes, federal agencies and other
groups. The scientists' effort, called the Program for Analysis and
Testing of Hypotheses (PATH), analyzed options for improving salmon
and steelhead survival in the lower Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   The team used sophisticated mathematical models and was reviewed
by four leading scientists from outside the region. Under every
modeled scenario, the virtual fish fared better without dams than
with them, even with extra efforts to barge or divert salmon past
the dams.
</P>
<P>
   With dams bypassed, the simulations showed spring and summer
chinook salmon runs recovering to healthy numbers in about a
half-century some 80 percent of the time, compared with half the
time with the dams in place. The healthy margin remained large even
if dams were made more fish-friendly by boosting water flows or
barging young fish.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups greeted the simulation results prepared by
the panel of independent scientists as decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fairly clear that under virtually all assumptions, dam
removal is the only option that meets both the survival and
recovery goals,'' said Tim Stearns of Save Our Wild Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, in a broad review of the science, the National
Marine Fisheries Service cautioned that the apparent advantage of
breaching could evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Under a small minority of the computer simulations,
dam-breaching appeared to afford ``negligible advantages,'' said
the review's director, Peter Kareiva. Moreover, he said, tentative
new findings hint the dam-breaching advantage may be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   The PATH report assumed that salmon that are barged through the
lower Snake River dams are considerably less likely to survive a
round-trip to the Pacific Ocean than non-barged fish.
</P>
<P>
   Initial returns from a new line of research tend to show that
barged fish actually may return almost as well as those that
migrate freely.
</P>
<P>
   If that tentative finding proves right, the mathematical
advantage of dam-breaching over other salmon improvements would
drop from 30 percent to a more modest 11 percent, the Fisheries
Service said. If barging doesn't weaken fish at all, the edge drops
to a negligible 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those caveats aside, the Marine Fisheries Service confirmed that
``breaching meets recovery and survival goals over the widest range
and highest proportion of assumptions'' for the spring-summer
chinook, the best-known and most numerous salmon the Snake River.
And it appears even more advantageous for fall chinook, though less
is known about that run.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said more study might answer questions about barging.
</P>
<P>
   But delay has risk, too.
</P>
<P>
   If dam operations remained unchanged for 24 years, scientists
calculated that the chance of fish runs going practically extinct
would rise about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of Snake River salmon has been sharp since the lower
Snake River dams went up in the 1960s and 1970s. Spring and summer
chinook, which numbered about 1.5 million a century ago, have
fallen to less than 10,000 fish.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem generally isn't with returning adult salmon,
but with juveniles. As they pass the dams on their migration to the
sea, young salmon are bumped and scraped, injured by water pressure
fluctuations, and exposed to lethal levels of nitrogen gas in the
water below the dams. In reservoirs, they are exposed to water that
is too warm for them, and delays getting to sea may affect how they
survive in salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Dam defenders say these problems have been reduced and the
practice of collecting young salmon in the upper Snake River and
barging them below Bonneville Dam on the Washington-Oregon border
is an effective antidote.
</P>
<P>
   But decades of extensive barging of fish have failed to reverse
the salmon decline.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 200 scientists signed a letter drafted by an Idaho
environmental group urging President Clinton to lower the Snake
River to natural-river level to save salmon and steelhead runs.
</P>
<P>
   They included two current members and one former member of an
influential group of scientists that advise the Northwest Power
Planning Council.
</P>
<P>
   The letter concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough time remains to restore them, but only if the failed
practices of the past are abandoned and we move quickly to restore
the normative river conditions under which these fish evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But dam supporters _ and some scientists _ loudly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lovelin, director of the Columbia River Alliance, a
consortium of dam-dependent businesses, claimed that the PATH study
underemphasized evidence that dams and barging may not be as
harmful to fish as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelin dismissed many scientists as advocates for breaching.
And so do many audiences in Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When federal biologist Tom Cooney explained the panel's findings
in Pasco, Wash., in January, he was derided by his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're using assumptions as facts, weighting the inputs the
way you want so the dams need to be removed,'' one elderly man
said.
