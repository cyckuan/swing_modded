<HEADLINE> U.S. Overfishes Pacific Salmon: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. refusal to honor the
Pacific Salmon Treaty is costing Canadian fishermen at least 60
million dollars (42 million U.S. dollars) a year, said Canadian
Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. overfishing undermined Canadian efforts to save the
salmon from extinction, the minister was quoted by Thursday's
Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are taking more of our fish than we are taking of
theirs, and the trend is upward," Anderson said in a speech on the
eve of a long-delayed resumption of talks on salmon quotas.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa and Washington announced Tuesday that the talks will
begin at the end of this month, three months after two special
envoys urged immediate return to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The envoys also asked the Alaskan fishermen to reduce their
interception of Canadian-bound fish in the North Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1985 treaty, neither country is supposed to take more
fish from the ocean than the number that originates in their
waters.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Alaskan interceptions of fish returning to Canadian rivers
last year reached an unprecedented peak, even while Canada was
cutting its own catch to save them from extinction, Anderson
noted.
</P>
<P>
In the south, Canada has also cut its interception of fish
swimming into U.S. waters off Washington state, and helped that
state's conservation programs, he added.
