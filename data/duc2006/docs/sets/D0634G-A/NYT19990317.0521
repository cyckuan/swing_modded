   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's decision on Tuesday to order new
protections for nine threatened salmon populations in the Pacific
Northwest is just the beginning of what could be the biggest and
most expensive rescue effort in the 26-year history of the
Endangered Species Act. It is an effort worth making.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the once-great salmon runs of the Pacific
Northwest ranks high among the ecological blunders committed in the
name of economic growth. The time has surely come to correct that
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the challenge uniquely interesting is its reach.
Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to
save them will have to be regional in scope. The effort will
inevitably require higher taxes to clean hundreds of waterways and
buy open space in crucial watersheds. It will impose tough
restrictions on new construction, farming and logging, and may even
require the costly decommissioning of federal and private dams that
impede salmon runs but have also long supplied the Pacific
Northwest with cheap power. The early response from local
politicians and citizens has been extraordinarily positive. One
reason is that the salmon is not only economically important to the
Pacific Northwest but is virtually a cultural icon. Beyond that,
many local residents are consumed by fears that development will
someday destroy the natural beauty that surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   A save-the-salmon effort, with all the restrictions that
implies, is thus seen as a timely antidote to shapeless sprawl. As
Seattle's mayor, Paul Schell, noted, ``as we work to save the
salmon, it may turn out that the salmon save us.''
</P>
<P>
   But this battle has a very long way to go. It is one thing to
preach salvation. It is quite another to pay the price when the
controls kick in _ when farmers have to stop using pesticides, when
developers have to stop building in sensitive watersheds, when
loggers have to stop cutting trees along salmon-bearing streams.
Today's euphoria could easily become tomorrow's backlash.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many questions surrounding the federal
commitment. Washington moved to protect the salmon only because
environmental advocacy groups threatened to sue if it did not _ an
exact replay of the campaign to save the spotted owl. By listing
the salmon as threatened, the Clinton administration has now
saddled itself with an even more onerous responsibility _ insuring
that Washington and Oregon develop an effective plan to save the
fish. Vice President Al Gore has promised a special appropriation
of $100 million to underwrite a ``cooperative restoration effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the states falter, Washington would be obliged under the
Endangered Species Act to step in with a variety of legal and
regulatory weapons that, in effect, could halt development in its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   An early test of this commitment will come in the next few
months when the administration delivers its long-awaited proposal
for restoring several species of salmon in the Snake River that
were listed as endangered or threatened back in 1991 and 1992. Some
scientists believe that these species will never recover unless the
federal government dismantles or at least modifies eight dams on
the Snake and Columbia Rivers _ a strategy unalterably opposed by
many big consumers of electricity and by Washington's powerful
Republican senator, Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may find other ways to restore the
fresh-water flows essential to the salmon's survival. But what
matters here is the end result _ recovery. How the administration
responds will tell much about its long-term dedication to the other
species listed this week.
