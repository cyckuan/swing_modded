<HEADLINE> Canada Urges U.S. to Return to Salmon Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today called
on the United States to "return in good faith to negotiations"
aimed at solving the Pacific salmon dispute.
</P>
<P>
Canada suspended talks on May 21 when the U.S. negotiator was
unable to advance a position on one of the key southern issues,
Fraser River sockeye.
</P>
<P>
"I am contacting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
today to urge that the United States send its chief negotiator
back to the table with a mandate to reach agreement on the
dispute," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "barring an immediate return to
negotiations, we will consider further options. Any further steps
we take must be aimed at resuming negotiations--not detracting
from them."
</P>
<P>
"On May 21, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans stepped up
enforcement of measures requiring foreign vessels to contact
Canadian authorities as they pass through Canadian waters," said
Fisheries and Oceans Minister Fred Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Minister added that his country will assess the
impact of these measures in the near future to determine their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulations,
vessels that violated the regulations can be inspected, required
to go to a Canadian port or face arrest, depending on
circumstances. U.S. vessels going to and from the Alaskan Fishery
are subject to these regulations.
</P>
<P>
The talks to end the four-year deadlock in the Pacific Salmon
Treaty involve reducing the high levels of U.S. interception of
salmon heading through Alaskan waters in Canadian waters to breed,
and a balanced reduction in Canadian and American interception
each other's salmon stocks farther south off Vancouver Island, in
the Fraser River and Straits of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials say Canada has honored its treaty
obligations to take a limited share of West Coast commercial
salmon stocks.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Alaskan catch, the officials say, has been
continuously excessive and has reached a 500-million U.S. dollars
imbalance in favor of the United States since 1985.
