<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Money To Save Salmon  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A permanent conservation fund that President Clinton will
propose Monday includes $100 million for initiatives to preserve salmon in four
West Coast states, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton gets his way, the money to save salmon in Alaska, Washington,
Oregon and California would be replenished automatically at $100 million each
year for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would go to the states annually without approval from Congress --
if Congress agrees to enact Clinton's ``Lands Legacy'' program into law this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that we've come back and asked for the full $100 million, and
this year proposed in addition that it be made permanent, shows how serious we
are about making this a priority,'' said George Frampton, chairman of the White
House Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Clinton is proposing $290 million for salmon conservation programs
in the West and Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   That includes $91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the
Columbia-Snake river system; $60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty
between the United States and Canada; and $39 million for the National Marine
Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals represent increases of 30 percent or more over what Congress
approved last year for salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon are a cultural icon on the Pacific Northwest and have been suffering
for decades from dams, development, overfishing, runoff and other problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 26 salmon populations are
threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton first proposed the $100 million to help rebuild coastal salmon
stocks a year ago, but Congress approved just $58 million for the effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton declined to discuss other details of the ``Lands Legacy'' proposal
until the administration reveals its fiscal 2001 budget on Monday. But he said
the program will use off-shore oil drilling royalties and other revenues to
create a permanent, dedicated fund for environmental preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Resources Committee last November approved a bill that is similar
to what the administration is proposing. The measure would set aside more than
60 percent of off-shore oil drilling revenues for buying land and conserving
coastline. But that measure, which is pending on the House floor, did not single
out salmon for funding.
