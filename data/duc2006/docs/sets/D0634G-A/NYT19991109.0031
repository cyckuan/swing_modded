REMOVAL OF 5 DAMS HAILED AS OPENING NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>

 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Government officials, conservation groups and
private landowners announced an ambitious plan to revive
California's beleaguered salmon fisheries Monday, claiming it
points to a new era of environmental restoration.
<P>
   Under the pact, five Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
power-generating dams will be removed on Battle Creek, a tributary
of the Sacramento River east of Red Bluff that supports endangered
salmon and steelhead trout.
</P>
<P>
   Three other dams will be retrofitted with fish ladders, and the
volume of downriver flows will be increased tenfold. The project
will open up 42 miles of new salmon spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a pristine watercourse fed year-round by cold,
subterranean springs, Battle Creek is one of the finest salmon
streams in California.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is considered a centerpiece project for CalFed, a
federal and state venture designed to guarantee stable water
supplies for farms and cities while improving water quality and
wildlife habitat in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, their
delta and San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the dams is expected to begin next year, and
should be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday on the Delta King, a restored river
boat docked on the Sacramento River, U.S. Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt hailed the accord as a template for cooperative
environmental efforts that can join government with the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salmon that is driving this happy event is leading us to a
new era in our relationship with the environment,'' Babbitt said.
``The salmon has no fixed address. (It) teaches us we must see the
entire landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the salmon's uncanny ability to sense its arrival
at its natal stream after several years in the ocean, Babbitt
added: ``Its instincts are so finely honed it can taste one drop of
vermouth in 500,000 barrels of gin. That's a fish worth listening
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's ebullience was echoed by representatives of the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation, which donated $3 million to
implement the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in projects that involve the private sector,
projects that sustain a vision of a restored California,'' said
Jeanne Sedgwick, director of conservation programs for the Los
Altos-based foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Oscamou, a spokesman for PG&AMP;E, said the removal of the dams
will cut electricity generation on Battle Creek by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creek currently supplies enough power to supply about
40,000 homes, so that's not insignificant,'' said Oscamou. ``But
this plan allows us to both restore fish and maintain a reasonable
level of power production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been tough to resolve this if we had gotten into
an adversarial relationship (with environmental groups and
government agencies),'' he said. ``A joint partnership is much more
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns about the project were also aired.
</P>
<P>
   Battle Creek already supports the largest salmon hatchery in the
state, a facility run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. About
80,000 mature fall-run chinook salmon now return annually to the
creek's narrow gorge, a number some scientists feel is too high for
the good of other salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kier, a Sausalito fisheries consultant who didn't attend
Monday's event, said the sheer mass of fall-run salmon on Battle
Creek could impede the migration of endangered winter-run and
threaten spring-run chinook salmon, which spawn higher up the
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists from the University of California have also expressed
concerns about the genetics of the Coleman hatchery fish, noting
that some may be inbred and that undesirable cross-breeding has
probably occurred between fish from different runs.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he has very real concerns about the Coleman
hatchery and its impact on wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time for a comprehensive and fundamental look at
the hatchery,'' he said. ``For a long time, fish hatcheries have
been viewed as parts of mitigation packages, as equivalents to
livestock feed yards. That's not how we want to do it here. We want
to do this right, and the time to do it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hamelberg, who supervises north state fish projects for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said agency biologists are
addressing Coleman's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fish and Wildlife moved winter-run chinook hatching
operations from Coleman to a facility near Shasta Dam to prevent
hybridization with fall-run fish, Hamelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Local landowners have also expressed apprehension about the
Battle Creek project _ but at Monday's announcement, they appeared
to give it a qualified endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out scared,'' said Bob Lee, secretary of the Battle
Creek Watershed Conservancy, an organization representing people
living in the creek's watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried that the agencies would come in here and smash
the local economy,'' Lee said. ``Anyone who ranches or works in
timber or agriculture has trouble with endangered species in their
backyard. But people have gradually calmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Lee, the supervising agencies ``have to make sure
they address the surrounding lands, not just dams and water flows.
The riparian areas and watershed have to be protected as a whole,
and the ranches are the biggest key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranchers have been taking care of this land for 100 years,
and they've done a pretty good job of caring for the creek,'' he
said. ``We have to make sure they have a future.''
