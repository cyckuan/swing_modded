GOVERNOR BACKS BOLD PLAN TO BREACH SNAKE RIVER DAMS TO SAVE
SALMON

   SEATTLE _ Lending political momentum to an idea that would have
been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history,
Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored
breaching four large federal dams on Washington state's Snake River
in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber, a Democrat, became the first major political figure
to endorse the controversial dam-removal proposal, which is
passionately favored by many environmental groups, American Indians
and commercial fishermen, but opposed with equal fervor by farmers
and many others in the interior Northwest who now rely on the tamed
Snake River for barge shipping and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress, sometime
after the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams, issues
its own opinion on the proposal next year.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much influence Kitzhaber's stand will have remains to
be seen, but it is nonetheless an intriguing reflection of changing
times in man's relationship with the rivers of the Northwest, where
some hydroelectric dams generate enormous amounts of power but have
also proven lethal on a major scale to the region's fabled salmon
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the answer will be a political one _ informed by
good science _ but based on a set of values and on the degree of
economic and ecological risks the region is willing to accept,''
Kitzhaber said in a speech to the American Fisheries Society in
Eugene, Ore. ``It is time that we shoulder our responsibilities and
develop a blueprint for action.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of Northwest dams was an undeniably epic
engineering achievement, celebrated in Woody Guthrie's songs more
than a half-century ago. But for the last several decades, the
Corps of Engineers has been laboring under federal requirements, to
help dams and the salmon coexist on the Snake but has met little
success.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending more than $3 billion on projects such as fish
ladders, hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging system that a
Corps brochure describes as ``custom-made to make the trip as safe
and comfortable as possible'' for the fish, the salmon populations
have declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and
every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is
now listed under the Endangered Species Act. In the early 1800s,
when the explorer William Clark discovered a river ``crouded with
salmon,'' about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip
back to their spawning grounds, biologists estimate.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ed Bowles, Idaho's manager of anadromous fish, those that hatch
in fresh water and migrate to the sea, said today that 3,276 Snake
River adult spring and summer chinook returned last year, down from
8,426 in 1998. Fall chinook returns were estimated to be about 400,
slightly up from 306 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the dam-breaching proposal now being considered by the
Corps, earth around the dams would be removed, rendering the dams
themselves inoperative and restoring 140 miles of the Snake River
in eastern Washington to a wild, free-flowing condition. Many
scientists and biologists have endorsed dam breaching as the step
that would have the greatest odds of saving the salmon from
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The dams _ Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower
Granite _ would be the biggest federal dams ever slated for
removal. But there is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it
would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the
Pacific Northwest's electricity. (Unlike other dams in the region,
the Snake dams are not used for flood control.)
</P>
<P>
   The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston, Idaho, in the
foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the
Pacific Ocean, into the West's most inland seaport. But virtually
all barge traffic to and from Lewiston would stop if the dams were
breached.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in eastern Washington have lined up against any
breaching. Republican lawmakers throughout the region have been
generally united against the idea. U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
who is running for re-election this year, said taking down the dams
would be ``an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare'' for
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have been non-commital on the idea, but
Kitzhaber, who said Friday that the region should feel shame for
losing what were ``once the greatest salmon runs on the face of the
earth,'' has now become the first major political figure from the
region to endorse breaching.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Kitzhaber said that the region is required
to try to save the fish under the federal Endangered Species Act,
and he warned that if dam-breaching were not attempted, other
alternatives might be even more expensive and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I am saying to you today is that we have to stop deluding
ourselves into believing that our choices will be easier and
cheaper if we just leave the dams alone,'' he said. ``Our choices
won't be easier. They'll be just as tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber, who was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998, also
criticized, by implication, a range of state and federal officials
who have called for more study of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will say that we have not done enough science,'' said
Kitzhaber. ``I say that we can always play that card as an excuse
for inaction and as a justification for avoiding tough choices. But
exactly what additional scientific experiment is necessary to
demonstrate that it is easier for salmon to migrate in a
free-flowing river than to negotiate a several hundred foot high
concrete barrier?''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists praised Kitzhaber. ``The governor is providing
what the Snake River salmon need most right now, and that is
political leadership,'' said Rob Masonis, regional director of dam
programs for American Rivers, a group that favors dam removal on
many of the nation's rivers.
