<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Sign Treaty on Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada
signed an agreement on Wednesday aimed at protecting and building
up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough
negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian
fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs
and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty was signed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas
R. Pickering and Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chtien at the U.S.
State Department's Treaty Room.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishes two regional funds managed by both
countries to improve fisheries management and enhance cross-border
scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the U.S. to spend 140 million U.S. dollars to
restore salmon habitat and other measures to rebuild stocks.
</P>
<P>
The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen
only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and
growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of
chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho,
while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that
have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.
