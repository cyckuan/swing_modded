<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sea walls, bulkheads and other man-made barriers have
transformed more than half of the central Puget Sound coastline,
starving beaches of sand and salmon of food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials are moving to protect these areas,
but they are running into resistance from landowners and local
agencies, turning shorelines into a new environmental battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about the problem. Homeowners and
industries have built walls against waterfront erosion for decades.
Few people noticed. Until recently, few cared.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent survey found that man has reshaped an extraordinary
52 percent of the central Puget Sound coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The damage has gradually accumulated, scientists say. In many
places, sandy beaches have eroded away to cobble or hardpan, wiping
out spawning areas for small fish and beds for grasses that nurture
marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the problem difficult to attack, biologists
say, is that any single wall does little harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the proverbial death by a thousand cuts,'' said Dan
Pentilla, a biologist for the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife. ``If bulkheading isn't controlled or new material added,
the beaches on Puget Sound are going to coarsen and disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   To scientists, beaches aren't the stable features that appear to
the casual beach-walker. They are rivers of sand. They ebb and flow
at the prodding of waves, currents and tides.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkheads and seawalls are retaining walls built a short
distance from shore to slow natural erosion of banks into water by
reducing wave action on the beach. In doing so, bulkheads can dam
the headwaters of these granular streams, with effects that can
stretch for miles. By reflecting wave energy, they also can
accelerate how fast sand is washed away.
</P>
<P>
   This week, protection of beaches was elevated by the
long-heralded listing of Puget Sound chinook salmon as threatened
under the Endangered Species Act. The local chinook is one of
several fish that suffer from shoreline armoring.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are writing rules that will prohibit people
from doing anything that significantly harms the fish or its
habitat unless specifically exempted. That means tighter
restrictions loom over bulkhead-building.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to protect near-shore habitat, and maybe avoid
draconian restrictions, a state commission on shoreline guidelines
proposes to make bulkhead-building a last resort. The panel,
representing government agencies and business, environmental and
recreational groups, aims to make homeowners prove that proposed
bulkheads are needed to protect their homes from imminent danger,
and that a ``softer'' solution, such as adding gravel to the beach
or planting on a bluff, will not work.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal faces an uncertain future. Society's interest
in saving fish and beaches collides at the shoreline with
homeowners' determination to safeguard even small pieces of
waterfront land.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkheads are buttressed by forces of economics and property
rights almost as irresistible as Puget Sound's tides. The real
estate market rewards their construction by boosting the value of
land that is protected. And when conflicts with regulators have
arisen, courts and the Legislature have generally backed
landowners' wall-building.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the Endangered Species Act, once
termed the hydrogen bomb of environmental laws, will shift the
balance toward conservation.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that coarsening beaches by reducing them
to hardpan and gravel affects salmon. When small fish like sand
lance and surf smelt lose spawning areas, their decline deprives
young salmon of food. Sand loss also can eliminate footing for
eelgrass, which provides both food and shelter for to salmon in
what is, for some, a crucial stage of development.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most heavily affected salmon are so-called
``ocean-type'' chinook, which leave streams early to spend as long
as two months in shallow Puget Sound waters, according to Charles
Simenstad of the University of Washington School of Fisheries.
There, in a process he calls ``puberty times 10,'' they adjust to
saltwater and pack on the size and strength they need to evade
predators at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of salmon do not use the shallows as much, so why
not write off the ocean-type chinook? Biologists say the region's
depleted chinook family cannot afford to lose an important branch.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon rely on diverse life cycles to avoid extinction, somewhat
as investors rely on diverse stock portfolios to reduce risk of
financial collapse. Chinook salmon are the masters of diversity,
with some racing to sea, others lingering in streams and still more
hanging around Puget Sound. The payoff in the evolutionary lottery
is clear: If conditions for one type of chinook collapse, others
can carry on the species.
</P>
<P>
   That calculation has focused official attention on Puget Sound
beaches and near-shore shallows. Most of the region's attention has
focused on streams, so some officials are warning that degrading
near-shore areas risk becoming ``the neglected link'' for salmon
between rivers and the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we focus solely on the streams and don't focus on the
near-shore, we aren't going to be successful'' restoring Puget
Sound chinook, says Chuck Clarke, regional administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   State officials hope to upgrade habitat protection by rewriting
state shoreline guidelines, which prod counties to meet minimum
standards for protection. Biologists say the 20-year-old guidelines
are badly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   But some businesses and property owners are resisting change.
Three attempts to upgrade guidelines have run aground, and dissent
continues. The Association of Washington Business boycotted the
current guidelines commission and calls its recommendation
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Terich, a professor of geography at Western Washington
University in Bellingham, empathizes with the opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult situation,'' he says. ``I can understand the
plight of people who paid a lot for their property and want to
preserve it, but in doing so they're creating a lot of problems for
the preservation of beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one expects to tear out bulkheads, so the guidelines
will have little impact on the well-hardened shores of urban areas
like Seattle and Tacoma. Mostly, the commission hopes new rules
will slow the spread of walls across still-developing shorelines,
such as those of rural Pierce and Kitsap counties.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line troops defending these shorelines are habitat
biologists for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. They
issue permits for docks and bulkheads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their authority is limited. The Legislature has directed
them to expedite permits for bulkheads in front of single family
homes. While biologists may encourage less-damaging bulkhead
designs, they say they generally lack authority to deny them.
</P>
<P>
   City and county development agencies exercise the most control
over bulkhead and retaining-wall construction. Wall-builders must
get permits from these agencies whether the project is above or
below high water.
</P>
<P>
   County attitudes about shoreline protection vary widely. Whatcom
and Thurston counties have cracked down on building bulkheads and
retaining walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think they're necessary and they're somewhat
destructive to the environment,'' said Roger Giebelhaus, an
environmental planner in Thurston County's development office.
</P>
<P>
   Some other counties and cities have shrugged off biologists'
attempts to slow bulkhead-building. Ordinances in many places ``are
not strong enough to prevent damage to near-shore habitat,'' says
state researcher Ginny Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brennan, a state habitat biologist, goes further. In Kitsap
County, he complained, ``we're allowing people to build anywhere
they want with no analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in King County, generally one of the most progressive in
enforcing environmental laws, shoreline administrators have butted
heads with state biologists.
</P>
<P>
   The county's Department of Development and Environmental
Services routinely waives environmental review for homeowner
proposals to build replacement bulkheads and docks, which can shade
out eelgrass and harbor fish that prey on salmon.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, state biologists objected, noting that the
replacements often went far beyond the original structure. One
40-foot dock, for instance, was ``replaced'' by an 80-foot dock
without environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Carey, director of land use for the county department, said
he was ``infuriated'' by the second-guessing from the state, which
he rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Even though King County ordered all agencies to re-examine
procedures that could affect salmon, Carey's agency stuck by its
practice. State habitat biologist John Boettner says he once
mentioned to county officials that chinook would soon be listed as
threatened, but got brushed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it wasn't listed yet,'' Boettner said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the county felt the hot breath of this week's listing, it
called for all county agencies, including Carey's, to impose
tighter environmental reviews.
