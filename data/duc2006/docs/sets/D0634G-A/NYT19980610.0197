CALIFORNIA'S HEADWATERS FOREST: TOO MUCH FOR AN INCOMPLETE DEAL

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Look beyond the hype over the deal to save
the Headwaters Forest and you'll see that taxpayers may not be
getting their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the California Legislature will decide whether to
appropriate $130 million for purchase of 7,500 acres of redwoods in
Humboldt County. With an additional $250 million in federal money,
the purchase price of these majestic trees is $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the 7,500 acres of virgin and second-growth redwoods
are not by themselves worth $380 million. This huge expenditure is
justified only if the public can be assured that the side agreement
_ a giant string attached to the purchase, known as a ``habitat
conservation plan'' _ won't imperil the future of endangered
species on the rest of Pacific Lumber's 200,000 acres nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the habitat conservation plan negotiated by
Pacific Lumber and government officials would not only permit the
logging of ancient redwoods. It could also lead to extinction of
the coho salmon population in California.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Legislature's Joint Committee on Headwaters
Forest, which I co-chair with Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, uncovered the following:
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Headwaters habitat conservation plan may not
preserve the other 12 groves of ancient redwoods owned by Pacific
Lumber. Contrary to the ``50-year protection'' allegedly locked in
for these groves, Pacific Lumber is negotiating a separate side
agreement with federal wildlife officials that would allow the
company to seek changes to the habitat plan periodically for the
purpose of logging one or more of these groves.
</P>
<P>
   The coho salmon to be affected by the Headwaters habitat plan
now amount to just 1 percent of their original numbers. In 1973,
there were 40,000 fishing jobs on the North Coast. Now there are
just 5,000. Those jobs disappeared after logging and mining
destroyed the coho salmon's habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed Headwaters habitat plan, Pacific Lumber would
establish a 30-foot ``no-cut'' zone on the sides of streams to
protect spawning habitat for coho salmon. Yet two of the U.S.
Forest Service's top coho salmon experts _ geologist Leslie Reid
and hydrologist Robert Ziemer _ have asserted that the ``no-cut''
buffer zones are inadequate. The scientists noted ``significant
discrepancy'' between the protections in the Headwaters habitat
conservation plan and the two most widely accepted, scientifically
based sources, which recommend ``no-cut'' zones of 170 to 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   To date, officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service,
the agency responsible for survival of the coho salmon, have been
unable to rationalize the inconsistency between the previously
recommended national standards of 170- to 300-foot ``no-cut'' zones
and the Headwaters plan, which requires only 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, politics is the art of compromise. Wildlife biology,
however, is not. If we compromise the habitat of the coho salmon
for Pacific Lumber, we will be forced to do so for other private
landowners up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the struggle for Headwaters Forest has already gone on
for more than 15 years, we must remember that extinction is
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping back to rethink the Headwaters agreement will be a
prudent step. We must ensure that the Headwaters deal does what it
ought to do: Strengthen rather than weaken environmental
protection.
