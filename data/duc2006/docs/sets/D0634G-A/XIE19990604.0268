<HEADLINE> Canada, United States Reach Agreement on Pacific Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
announced here Thursday that they have reached an agreement on the
elements of a ten-year accord to conserve and manage Pacific
salmon.
</P>
<P>
The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides
of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term
viability of their salmon industries, said Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Alberight in a joint statement issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive agreement, reached through vigorous diplomacy
among the responsible parties, is designed to ensure the
sustentation of the five Pacific salmon species through a
combination of scientific co-operation, in addition to providing
new funds to improve fisheries management and aid recovery of
weakened salmon stocks. The agreement is also necessary to limit
on salmon catches, said the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the U.S. will provide 142 million U.S.
dollars to a conservation fund to help rebuild stocks and habitat
on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the
future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. catch of Fraser River salmon will be limited under 16.
5 percent, down from an historical average of about 20 percent,
while U.S. fishermen took 25 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Salmon treaty was first negotiated in 1985 to
divide the salmon catch between U.S. and Canadian fishermen based
on how many fish were spawned in each country.
</P>
<P>
However, sections that dictated how to do that expired in 1992.
Since then, there have been a series of failed and sometimes
hostile negotiations for a new agreement.
