   SEATTLE _ Buoyed by ad hoc accords that have boosted salmon
spawning in both Puget Sound and British Columbia rivers,
Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Canada's fisheries minister, David
Anderson, say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries
dispute up and down the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot deal with problems on this coast, what hope is
there for dealing with the crisis of overfishing worldwide?''
Anderson asked Thursday in a Seattle speech to the World Affairs
Council.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the optimism of Vice President Al Gore, who said in a
February interview that the United States will make a major push
this year to reach a long-term fisheries agreement with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And Locke, encouraged by results of interim accords, said: ``It
is time to come to a long-term U.S.-Canada agreement that focuses
on recovery of salmon in all of our rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Locke celebrated a trio of two-way deals that have
made an immediate, positive impact on several of the Northwest's
most imperiled salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch
of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia,
and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound
for the Stuart River.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the Canadians cut back ocean fishing off Vancouver
Island for Puget Sound-bound chinook and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been much higher numbers of adult spawning salmon
_ particularly imperiled spring chinook salmon in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We successfully concentrated on finding a solution rather than
apportioning the blame,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke and leaders of local governments in the region face a big
challenge in the recent listing of Puget Sound-area salmon under
the Endangered Species Act. The listing is likely to require
multiple measures to improve spawning habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But, Anderson maintained, money done to nurture salmon in
streams will be wasted drain unless conservation measures are taken
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other half of the equation is to get adult salmon back
from the Pacific Ocean to their spawning beds,'' said Anderson, a
longtime conservationist who represents Victoria in Canada's House
of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the fishing dispute has repeatedly
disrupted U.S.-Canadian relations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Canada's fisheries ministry slapped a $1,100
``licensing fee'' on Alaska-bound U.S. fishing boats using waters
of British Columbia's Inside Passage.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, British Columbia Premier Glen Clark tried to have
U.S. submarines barred from a torpedo testing range on Vancouver
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997 a blockade by B.C. fishing boats prevented
the Alaska Ferry ``Malaspina'' from leaving the dock in Prince
Rupert.
</P>
<P>
   However, the past year has seen a major change of policy and
attitude in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hammering at historic inequities in the salmon catch
_ U.S.-fishermen catch millions of salmon bound for Canadian rivers
_ Anderson has put heavy emphasis on conservation. He moved last
year to curtail fishing of coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the two-five million coho salmon caught annually by
B.C. commercial fishermen in the mid-1990s, only 100,000 coho were
caught by all fisheries _ commercial, sport and native _ in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confrontation makes everyone poorer,'' Anderson said Thursday.
``Our constituencies are tired of arguments over who would kill the
last fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's policy has met with opposition from the British
Columbia government and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But his strategy has proven as popular a cause in British
Columbia as the restoration of salmon is south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salmon are a totem of this part of the world,'' he said.
``Salmon are also the canary in the mine as far as the condition of
our environment. If salmon are okay in our streams ... the
environment must be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke agreed, calling salmon ``the very definition of the
Pacific Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said technical discussions between Canadian fisheries
experts and their Alaska counterparts ``are going surprisingly well
... I believe we can get to an agreement this year.''
