<HEADLINE> Canadian Province Sues US in Salmon War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of
British Columbia (B.C.) has launched its lawsuit against the
United States for failing to curb overfishing by Alaska and other
states in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian province plans to seek 325 million dollars (230
million US dollars) in damages for alleged U.S. overfishing, said
reports today.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about an attempt to get money for American
overfishing," B.C. Premier Glen Clark was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is about using the American court system to force the
states to comply with the principles of salmon treaty, conserve
the resource and force them to get back to the table and negotiate
a treaty in both our interests."
</P>
<P>
The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of
Canadian-bound fish this summer violated the basic principles of
conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal government signed the treaty in 1985 and
remains responsible for enforcing it in individual states.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the damages, the suit also seeks a court order
certifying that the U.S. violated its international obligations,
and directing Washington to compel compliance by individual
states.
</P>
<P>
The B.C. latest move reinvigorates the Pacific fish war that
has raged between Canada and the U.S. for months.
</P>
<P>
Yet, a memo leaked later Monday in Ottawa casts doubt on the
province's chance of success.
</P>
<P>
The memo, prepared by Canada's federal government, concludes
that a U.S. court would not likely side with Canadian interests in
such a dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa said it had considered its own lawsuit, but ruled out
the option for various reasons including an interest in focusing
on diplomacy.
