   LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash. _ The big hydroelectric dam sits deep
in a valley framed by softly rounded, grass-covered mountains that
look from a distance as if they have been sanded down and then
covered with beige and blond velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Great expanses of sun-dappled blue water, more reservoir or lake
than river, stretch above and below the concrete-and-earth barrier.
That is part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The once fast-flowing Snake River is now so slow, and Lower
Granite Dam so much of an impediment, that salmon _ totem fish of
the Pacific Northwest and the focus of a landmark political,
economic and environmental struggle _ cannot migrate up and down
the Snake without the help of an elaborate man-made Rube
Goldberg-like system.
</P>
<P>
   So it was on a recent day as a state fisheries biologist, Fred
Mensik, plucked a silvery, six-inch fish from water speeding
through a trough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinook,'' Mensik said, identifying it as a member of the
heftiest of the salmon species. If it lives long enough, the
juvenile smolt, as it is called, could grow to 3 or 4 feet and 40
pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   Mensik measured the fish, entered the information into a laptop
computer and returned the fish to the trough, where it joined other
smolts and migrating young steelhead (sea-run rainbow trout) on
their way to a tank truck parked outside.
</P>
<P>
   The truck would transport the juvenile fish nearly 250 miles
downriver, past seven other dams in the Columbia River system, of
which the Snake is a part. There the fish were released to resume a
trip to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While Mensik and his co-workers were shepherding the fish
downstream, adult salmon and steelhead _ big, powerful veterans of
years at sea _ were climbing a fish ladder a few feet away, heading
upstream to spawn and die.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so few going back upstream that all these fish,
along with all other salmon and steelhead that spawn in the Snake
River, are listed as imperiled under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Will the elaborate, two-decade-old system for moving fish around
the dams prove inadequate to save the salmon? The question is at
the heart of a tense debate over whether to continue to rely on the
transportation system or junk it and remove the earthen portions of
Lower Granite and three other hydroelectric dams on the lower
Snake.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams would help restore the natural flow along a
140-mile stretch of the river, and many scientists say it would be
the single most effective remedy for the salmon's plight. The
concrete portions of the dams, their humming turbines silenced,
would become relics; abandoned monuments to a time when the only
consideration was to conquer and harness nature, and to the dawn of
an era in which coexisting with nature has been made a priority.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the dams, driven by a federal lawsuit brought by
environmentalists, was expected by early next year. If the Clinton
administration proposes breaching the dams, the issue would then go
to Congress, which must appropriate the money.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any conservation problems match this one for scale and
complexity, or for its many connections with the modern economy.
``The salmon involves our whole way of doing things,'' said Dr.
Peter M. Kareiva, an ecologist who is directing a scientific
assessment of the problem for the National Marine Fisheries
Service. ``There is no simple, easily defined enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists and environmentalists say the question of
whether to breach the dams is a no-brainer. They argue that the
population of the Snake River salmon began to decline after the
dams were built in the 1960s and 1970s, and that while the system
for trucking and barging fish downstream and helping adults back up
may have helped, it is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to completion of the lower Snake River dams, Snake River
stocks did as well or better than their downriver counterparts,''
said Ed Bowles, a scientist who is the salmon and steelhead
recovery manager for the state of Idaho, which contains the Snake's
watershed upstream of the four dams. ``Since completion of the
dams, we have every year done much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists, particularly those of the marine fisheries
service, say the situation is more complicated. The service's
studies, which are being reviewed by an independent panel, suggest
that while breaching the dams may be necessary to save some salmon
stocks, it will not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The wild salmon population has also been hurt by the destruction
and degradation of spawning areas, overfishing and the introduction
of hatchery-bred salmon and trout, according to the analysis. (Only
about 20 percent of Snake River salmon today are the progeny of
wild fish.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless these problems are solved, the analysis suggested, the
wild salmon and trout will probably continue to decline, even if
the dams are breached.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching ``is not going to be a silver bullet,'' said Dr.
Michelle McClure, a biologist with the fisheries service who is
helping to conduct the federal analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said the fisheries service, which will draft the
scientific opinion on which the decision about the dams will be
based, the latest evidence suggests that trucking and barging young
fish is more effective than was previously thought. Whether that is
true should become clear in 5 or 10 years, scientists with the
fisheries service said.
</P>
<P>
   One option, they said, would be to wait. But other experts,
including Bowles, said the answer was as apparent now as it would
ever be. The fisheries service said any delay would increase the
likelihood that some stocks of Snake River salmon would become
extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific salmon are different from Atlantic salmon in that there
are several species, and that different populations spawn at
different times. Moreover, they spawn only once and then die
(Atlantic salmon, and steelhead, can return to the ocean and spawn
again, several times).
</P>
<P>
   Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species
of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn
in the same locality, like a specific creek.
