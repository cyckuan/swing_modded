   The decline of the once-great salmon populations off the Pacific
coasts of Canada and the United States ranks high on the list of
the 20th century's environmental disasters. But 1999 may well turn
out to be the year when the fish finally caught a break. In March,
acting under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government set
in motion a regional plan to restore salmon runs throughout the
Pacific Northwest. Then last week, following years of fruitless
negotiations, the United States and Canada announced a plan to set
new limits on salmon catches and establish a conservation fund to
further protect the fish.

   At the core of the complex agreement are new protections for
``intercepted'' salmon stocks _ fish that spawn in one country but
are caught as they migrate through another country's waters. Under
the old rules, fishermen in, say, Alaska or British Columbia were
allowed to catch a fixed number of fish every year, regardless of
the health of the fish population. Under the new agreement, harvest
levels would be adjusted up or down based on scientific
measurements of fish stocks along thousands of miles of coastline.
The agreement also calls for a $140 million fund that would be used
to buy up fishing licenses _ essentially paying some fishermen not
to fish _ and to begin restoration efforts in rivers whose spawning
areas have been damaged.
</P>

   The importance of this agreement is that it finally addresses
the demand side of the salmon equation. The supply of fish can be
increased if the rivers where they spawn are restored to good
health. But these efforts will mean little if the fish continue to
be over-harvested at sea. The agreement is also heartening in
another sense. As David Anderson, the Canadian fisheries minister,
once observed, ``if two friendly neighbors can't agree on this
issue, what does that forecast for diplomacy elsewhere?'' Anderson
deserves much credit for this deal, along with Gov. Tony Knowles of
Alaska _ who agreed to subject Alaska's profitable annual harvest
to the new rules _ and Trout Unlimited, a private organization that
suggested key provisions.

   Vice President Gore played a role, too, which cannot hurt his
environmental credentials. But he has more to do. Money must still
be secured from a Republican Congress for the United States' share
of the $140 million restoration program, as well as for a separate
$100 million fund _ a special favorite of Gore's _ to help the
Pacific Northwest clean up rivers and streams. Beyond that, the
Administration will face a politically risky decision later this
year about whether to dismantle four hydropower dams on the Snake
River, which over the years have had a calamitous effect on salmon
stocks. That decision will tell a lot about how serious this
Administration is about the salmon.
