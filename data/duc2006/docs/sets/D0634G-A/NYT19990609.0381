   SEATTLE _ Once-abundant salmon runs of Canada's west coast have
suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat
destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the
Vancouver-based Pacific Fisheries Resource Council found in its
first report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, our salmon catches over the last five years are among
the lowest of the last 50 years. We seem to have gone from many
diverse fish stocks down to a few strong runs,'' said John Fraser,
the council's chairman and former speaker of Canada's House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon,
species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and
throughout the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The return of coho salmon to British Columbia's central coast,
Fraser said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000
fish to fewer than 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Tuesday said that coho salmon are in danger
from the Skeena River, in northern British Columbia, south to
Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia. Last year, Canada
curtailed both the commercial and sport fishery for coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But even sockeye salmon, although still abundant in the Fraser
River, are in peril elsewhere along the Canadian coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central coast area once supported the second largest
sockeye fishery in British Columbia, after the Fraser. The Rivers
and Smith Inlet fisheries are now essentially closed,'' said the
Council report.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is a quasi-governmental body of experts appointed
last September to advise Canada's fisheries minister David Anderson
on how to conserve and restore endangered salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Its report comes less than a week after the United States and
Canada reached a long-term agreement for conserving and managing
salmon runs from the Alaska border to the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Council said Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans
doesn't have enough money to meet its current conservation mandate
and has lacked resources even to keep track of salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, there is a shortfall in basic (counting) and
assessment monitoring to the extent that only a few stocks,
primarily large ones, have adequate data for their management and
protection,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that fisheries officials cannot account for
what happened to 3.5 million sockeye salmon that swam up the Fraser
River last year but never reached their spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of many salmon stocks is unknown,'' the panel
reported. ``The Council has found that there are such glaring
information gaps ... that no valid conclusions could be drawn about
the state of many stocks. Nonetheless, there is evidence that
salmon biodiversity is being eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 salmon catch along Canada's west coast was about half
the average catch of the last half-century, the Council reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that unfavorable marine conditions, past
overfishing and habitat damage have been significant causes of the
reduced catch,'' it found.
</P>
<P>
   The Council pointedly delivered its report to both the Canadian
government and British Columbia provincial government, which have
bitterly feuded over fisheries policy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson on Wednesday defended his department, saying it spends
$220 million (Canadian) in the Pacific region and has invested
major work on restoring salmon habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the streams and logged-over areas needing
restoration fall under the control of the British Columbia
government, noted Sharon Chow of the Sierra Club of British
Columbia, which endorsed the Council report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a huge problem between the province and the
federal government, and between Anderson and (British Columbia
Premier) Glen Clark,'' she added. ``And that is not good for
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser noted, however, that the United States and Canada have
managed to come together after an often-bitter five year dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created some stability and set out in the direction of
much closer Canada-U.S. cooperation to save fish,'' he said. ``Now
it is time to get our own house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In a future report, the Council is expected to discuss
breakdowns in Canada's fisheries enforcement, particularly
overfishing in ocean waters and failure to catch poachers once
salmon have begun their upstream migration.
