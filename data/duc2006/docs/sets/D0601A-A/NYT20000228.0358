   NEW YORK _ Nancy Smith, 28, croaks about the cold weather with a
smoked-out voice. Dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans, her puffy eyes
tell a story of chronic alcoholism, an all-too-common syndrome
among Native Americans like her. After returning from a cigarette
break in sub-zero temperatures, Smith flops down on a couch, curls
herself into a ball and falls asleep. One of New York City's
homeless, she has come for the treatment of her drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their
substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest
of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New
York area. ``Where else can I go for help?'' she asks. ``Any place
else, they don't understand you like they do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans around the country are leaving reservations and
relocating in urban areas at a dizzying rate. With economic
opportunities on reservations lagging behind those available in big
cities, and with the unemployment rate among Native Americans at
three times the national average, thousands of poor, often
unskilled Native Americans are rushing off their reservations. Many
find their new urban locales strange and forbidding and often turn
to drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City
metropolitan area. Of that number, nearly 7,000 come to the
Community House each year for drug and alcohol rehabilitation,
health counseling or for job training, according to Rosemary
Richmond, executive director. This is up from around 3,000 just
seven years ago. With the vast majority of its $1.5 million annual
budget, mostly federal funds, going to substance abuse treatment
and job training, the Community House finds itself at risk of
losing the attendance of those in need of cultural support.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some urban Native Americans feel driven away.
Richmond and her 30-member staff have been inundated with work, but
less and less of it involves cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go there all the time and hang out, meet new
people,'' says Carlos Rodriguez, 48, a Navajo who works as a
librarian at Columbia University. ``Now most of the people there
have drug problems, so they don't even let you in without an
appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Community House, established in 1969, relies on volunteers
like Rodriguez to participate in rallies, organize religious events
and educate the public about Native American culture. In recent
years, problems of illiteracy and addiction have become the major
part of the organization's workload.
</P>
<P>
   The social problems faced by Richmond and her staff are not
unique to New York City. From 1980 to 2000, the urban Native
American population has more than doubled. With this drastic
increase came a surge in urban Native Americans in need of
substance abuse treatment. In 1980, approximately 4,000 Native
Americans sought treatment for substance abuse in the San Francisco
area, according to the Indian Health Service, a branch of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. Today, that number has
more than doubled, to 9,200. In Seattle over the same period,
addiction cases rose from 3,500 to 7,300. Over all, the rate of
substance abuse among Native American adults is over 20 percent
nationwide. And the migration from the reservations continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, it's economics,'' says Joanne Dunne, a spokeswoman for
the Boston Indian Council, a nonprofit cultural group. ``The
reservation typically doesn't provide you with any real
opportunities.'' Also, many Native Americans travel between the
reservation and urban areas. ``Some tribes traditionally go from
one place to another,'' says Dunne. ``The Micmacs always crossed
the border from Canada to come from time immemorial.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, city and state governments have created
agencies to specifically deal with the Native American population.
In Detroit, for example, the municipal government runs the Detroit
American Indian Health Center, while the state of Michigan runs the
Bureau of Urban Indian Affairs. ``There's also American Indian
Health, which is nonprofit and state supported,'' adds Alycia
Atkinson, an administrator at Urban Indian Affairs. ``They do youth
programs, alcohol, tobacco and drug intervention, and other health
services. Then there's American Indian Services, which does mental
health, and also has a youth program, and they're run by the city.
And the state also supports the National American Indian
Association here.'' As the state and city governments slice up
their services, Detroit Native Americans, already a small group at
20,000, find themselves without a cultural or political center.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, at Dunne's Boston Indian Council, attendance lags
because it does not provide substance abuse treatment, legal
services or on-site training programs. Still, it creates a sense of
community among members of 36 tribes from all over the nation.
``Indians are drawn together the same way as everyone else,'' she
explains. ``You look for people who look like you.''  &QL;
