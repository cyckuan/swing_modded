   BERNALILLO, N.M. _ With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio
Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation.
Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled shores and face north
from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado
once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in
the sky to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is
a giant neon star bearing the words ``Star Casino.'' Next to the
casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole
championship course. And just beyond that, construction is under
way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to
help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one
are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their
reservations. But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts,
gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these
people have for generations cherished and protected from outside
intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their
religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a leisure virus,'' said Jose Lucero, a member of the
Santa Clara Pueblo tribe located about 60 miles north of here. His
tribe is divided over whether they, too, should develop a casino
resort. ``We're trading our souls for money,'' he said. ``Some
tribe members say `Hey, it's OK. It's glamorous.' But that's not
what we are supposed to be. We are supposed to be stewards of this
land. And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this
stuff to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have
brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been
publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations. But a
once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder. Critics worry
that tourists will trample across what they consider to be
religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes
are forming are increasingly being operated by outside
professionals and managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino
and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member
of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe. But the
medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and
culture, he added, ``are getting pushed aside in a way.'' Leon, who
voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed
emotions. ``Things seemed OK at first,'' he said. ``But then more
of the Las Vegas types started moving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what
appears to be progress. Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now
operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than
$350 million a year in gambling revenues. And although there is
still poverty on the reservations, jobs are plentiful, recreation
centers and libraries have been built, and major investments are
being made to augment the success of gambling. Several tribes are
expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts,
and the tribe that is leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt
Hotels Corp. to build what is being billed as ``New Mexico's first
major golf and spa resort.'' The 350-room resort hotel will occupy
a picturesque section of the 61,000-acre reservation, which is
located 15 miles north of Albuquerque. The tribe will own the
resort and Hyatt will manage it. Additionally, the tribe is
doubling the size of its adobe-style Star Casino and adding a Las
Vegas-style theater. A retail shopping center is proposed for a
nearby section of the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana
Pueblo tribe is operating a gourmet restaurant on the reservation,
next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse. This year,
the tribe will host major golf tournaments, including the U.S.
Women's Amateur Public Links Championship and the PGA Western Club
Championship.
</P>

   As the tribal members who are leading the development boom see
it, they are doing more than investing the casino's profits to
increase economic opportunities. With pending lawsuits and other
initiatives that could shut down their casinos or lead to heavy
taxes on their revenues, they say they are creating an industry
that can survive even if the casinos do not. ``There are so many
attacks on Indian casinos,'' said Roy Montoya, who as chief
administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business
development. ``What the new resort represents is another step
toward self-sufficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils
comprised of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to
private business has created two camps. The traditionalists are
leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the
business leaders like Montoya are pushing to expand.
</P>
<P>
   As the profits from gambling began to add up, ``we considered
two approaches,'' Montoya said during an interview in his plain but
comfortable office on the reservation. ``Some people said stash the
money. Don't do anything with it. But we chose to put these
different ventures in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by
the economic growth. ``Our culture and religion was very strong
when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the
reservation,'' he said. ``Then when the economy started changing
and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak. But
with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with
your family and in 15 to 20 years the religion and culture will
become stronger again.''
</P>
<P>
   The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning. When
the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members
bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from
``The Snake Head,'' one of the reservation's many ancient religious
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the business types said they needed that site next to the
river, overlooking the mountains,'' said Leon, whose grandfather
held the revered religious title of medicine man. The business
interests prevailed. As a result, Leon lamented: ``The religious
people are upset with us. They worry that the public will wander
over the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   One planned aspect of the Hyatt resort that might appease the
religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the
tribe's history. Such museums are becoming a common element in
casino and resort developments on reservations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles
north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to
buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing
casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's
reservation. But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the
growth. Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former
security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has
prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values
and customs. ``I've noticed a complete lack of participation in
ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with
diversions like the casino,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in
the opportunities that have been created.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles
south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member,
was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across
Highway 47 from the tribe's casino. Although he has been playing
golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap _
better than most golfers will ever play _ and the golf
professionals operating the course have high hopes for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business
enterprises and train their people,'' said Brent Townsley, a
teaching professional at the course. ``But our goal is to see
someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers,
accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl
around the reservation is unnerving to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking a lot of the control of the economic
development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe
itself,'' said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of
South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe. ``I'm amazed that many of the
tribes have turned into what they've deplored all their lives.
They're bureaucracies and they're being run by attorneys and
accountants _ white attorneys and accountants.''
</P>
<P>
   But if appearances count for anything, Roy Montoya appears to be
in control at Santa Ana. One day recently, he walked into a
closed-door meeting of casino executives because he wanted to have
a word with the casino's general manager, a Las Vegas transplant.
Minutes later, he was at the reservation's planning offices,
interrupting another meeting of architects and developers who were
huddled around a conference table. When Montoya entered, they all
popped to their feet, smiling broadly. ``We own everything 100
percent,'' Montoya said. ``All of these people are on contract,
just like out in the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya oversees a staff of more than 400 employees, and in two
years, when current development projects are complete, that number
is projected to reach 700 _ more employees than tribal members.
``When I started this job in '84 I had nine employees and I was
just called Roy,'' said the 58-year-old Montoya. ``Now people call
me sir. But I'm still Roy. I get uncomfortable with sir.''
