   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Micah McCarty rises with the sun and slips
into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream from the
untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   With each stroke, he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes
to slay this fall with a hand-carved wooden harpoon. And he prays
that the gray whale will be ``a kind brother or sister.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is preparing himself for the Makah tribe's first whale
hunt in more than seven decades. He hopes it will renew the Olympic
Peninsula tribe's spirit and traditions. Opponents call the hunt
butchery, saying it has no place in a modern world where whales are
protected by international law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty wants to be the ``chosen one.''
</P>
<P>
   The harpooner will stand in a dugout canoe, steady himself
against 10-foot Pacific swells, heft the barbed lance, take aim and
plunge it into the back of a 38-foot leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   The kill will be a sacred moment for the Makah, honoring the
great whale. But the eight men in the canoe _ keepers of a ritual
dating back at least 100 generations _ will be encircled by an
armada of outraged animal rights activists, a swarm of
international media and a thin phalanx of security.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt's notoriety stems from a controversial decision by the
International Whaling Commission that granted the Makah the right
to kill up to 20 whales through 2002. Animal rights activists fear
the hunt will spark a wholesale return to commercial whaling,
presently banned by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach,
he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800
people living in his fishing village. Instead, he meditates and
prays to make his spirit pure to receive the whale, ``an honored
guest of the village.''
</P>
<P>
   He anchors his feet in the sand of the beach and heaves hunks of
driftwood in hopes of being chosen the harpooner.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty is one of 16 men selected by Makah families to compete
for eight spots on the first tribal whaling crew since the 1920s.
He feels the excitement building on this 44-square-mile reservation
of heavily logged rain forest and spectacular wilderness beach
located at the extreme northwest tip of the contiguous United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the
Makah, whose real name _ which cannot be written in English _ means
``people who live by the rocks and the seagulls.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty comes from a long line of whalers. His grandfather and
great-grandfather participated in the last hunts before whaling was
suspended, because gray whales had been stalked almost to
extinction by non-Indian whalers. McCarty's father, John, until
recently was executive director of the tribe's whaling commission.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in Olympia, Micah McCarty came
home to Neah Bay and immersed himself in the maritime life, working
with his father as a commercial fisherman. ``It became a passionate
connection with the waters my ancestors plied,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Makah whalers before him, McCarty prepares by purifying
himself in frigid streams such as the Waatch River. ``We look upon
the water as its own being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While bathing, McCarty said he ``thinks about the whale moving
gracefully through the water, and I swim as gracefully as I can.
... And I pray that our whale crew will be one mind, one body, one
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, secrecy guarded every aspect of Makah whaling from
the hunt to the communal butchering and feasting, according to
anthropological texts. Tribal members today remain guarded about
saying too much about the hunt to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is usually taboo to even talk about,'' McCarty said.
``Usually, you just prepare yourself and go whaling.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, like his father and the rest of the tribe, is acutely
aware of the international controversy surrounding this fall's
hunt. ``In this day and age, it's important to say something about
it,'' McCarty said.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate that whaling still defines the fabric of Makah
life, McCarty shares a few words from sacred whaling songs that
have been passed down from generation to generation and are still
sung today.
</P>
<P>
   One song says ``my canoe travels with killer whales as an
escort,'' and another says ``my canoe travels with lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I might get in trouble for telling you that, but it's not a
direct translation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time, long
before they became news to the outside world. An accomplished
carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont,
McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to
whaling and the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I learned about our oral history, some of the songs and
dances we do, my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and
where we come from.''
</P>
<P>
   The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell
Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they
practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called
the Hummingbird.
</P>
<P>
   ``The songs keep your mind off the pain'' of paddling for hours,
said Don Swan, a powerfully built man who, like McCarty, would like
to be the ``chosen one'' to heft the harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is
struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep
poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and
domestic violence. McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide
inspiration and a new focus for the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example,''
he said. Whaling ``involves so much concentration, so much
preparation, that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle
(substance abuse or violence) would have to drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a rare sunny spring day, McCarty and seven other members of
the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice.
</P>
<P>
   A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie
Hunter trailed the canoe. Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr. sat near
Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern. In the
background, a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting, two-note
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Eric would like to be a whaler someday. ``Yeah, I'm thinking
about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights,'' he said,
becoming very serious. ``I think I would want to be the harpooner.
If you're the harpooner, you have to have a lot of strength so you
can stick it in the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to take after my ancestors,'' said Eric, one
small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah
with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of
unemployment or Jim Beam.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came
alongside. The men passed little Eric between boats. As he
scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe, a luminous smile
transformed his serious face.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a
.50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor. It will
deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned, explained
Johnson, hefting the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by
the Makah. The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick
kill. Says McCarty: ``They want us to do a humane kill. That
necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to
the next world. I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a
sacred way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the
gun, but also of the hunt itself. ``What are we building our
culture on by going after something we don't want to eat?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly
opposed the tribe's return to whaling has been used by opponents of
the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not
representing the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American
communities do not have a single, monolithic viewpoint any more
than other communities.
</P>
<P>
   John McCarty also notes that in December's tribal council
election, two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson
Jr. and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office.
</P>
<P>
   But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more
than 70 years is a daunting challenge. So the Makah are turning for
advice to other indigenous whalers.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew
traveled this winter to Barrow, Alaska, for the native whaling
captains convention. They attended seminars on topics such as
effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still
allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission. The tribe
is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to
learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber, said Keith
Johnson, president of the tribal whaling commission.
</P>
<P>
   The whaling crew members are also training together. They run
together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they
built behind Arnie Hunter's trailer. The young men are learning to
function as a team, said rifleman Wayne Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice
``sneaking up and backing off'' whales, said McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   But many training methods will not be shared with the outside
world. For example, beginning with the first day of a new moon, the
nascent whalers will do a ``special type of training,'' said
McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown,'' said
McCarty without offering further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is
the bridge it creates between generations. For example, John
McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son
Micah.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Makah Bay, they harpooned this whale, a big bull,'' said
John McCarty, recounting the tale he heard from his father. ``He
was big enough and strong enough that they couldn't get close
enough to give him another harpoon. He went straight out to sea
(dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one fierce ride. The whale was relentless; the toughest
whale they had ever seen. They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just
a tiny bump. They gave up, cut him loose, lost their harpoon and
floats. Fortunately, there was a west wind, so they set sail and
headed home. The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the
bottom of the canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the telling of such stories across the generations that
defines the Makah. When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed
when the men passed him into the whaling canoe, Keith Johnson said:
``These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth.
How can we describe that to the world?''
