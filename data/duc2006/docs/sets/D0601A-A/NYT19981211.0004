 &HT;    
 &HT;    By now we are all familiar with the Republican debacle and the
psychological triumph by the Democrats in the recent election. What
about the elections in Indian country?
 &HT;    Selection of leaders by a democratic vote in the Indian nations
of America has a profound impact on the lives of the residents of
those Indian lands.
 &HT;    The recent loss of the leader of the Mescalaro Apache people in
New Mexico, Wendell Chino _ a man elected to serve his people for
more than 40 years _ makes it quite evident how hard such leaders
are to replace. Chino died unexpectedly Nov. 4 of heart failure at
the age of 74.
 &HT;    On the largest Indian reservation in America, the Navajo Nation,
where political chaos has been the rule, Kelsey Begay, former
speaker of the house, was elected in a landslide vote. Over the
past 10 years the Navajo people have seen one of their greatest
leaders, Peter MacDonald incarcerated, their last duly elected
leader, Albert Hale, resign, and have witnessed tremendous
instability in tribal leadership. The Navajo people hope this is
now all behind them and that Begay will get their tribe back on
track.
 &HT;    The problems on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona
finally came to a violent head this past summer. Although the
voters of that nation elected Raymond Stanley to serve as their
chairman, dissident residents blocked his efforts to take office.
The latest election proved once and for all that the people have
spoken and once again they have chosen Stanley as their leader.
Most residents of this troubled reservation hope the minority
dissenters will accept the vote of the people and allow Stanley to
get on with governing the people.
 &HT;    One of the disturbing elements in the conflict was that Stanley
supporters invited outsiders (members of the American Indian
Movement) onto their lands to assist them in regaining the
chairman's rightful position. Any reservation rocked by internal
squabbles has discovered, much to its dismay, that when outsiders
are invited to their land to help solve internal problems, the
problems only intensify.
 &HT;    On the second largest reservation in the land, the Pine Ridge
Reservation in South Dakota, former chairman Harold Dean Salway won
over incumbent John Yellow Bird Steele. Former chairman Wilbur
Between Lodge was chosen as vice chairman of the tribe after a very
tightly contested race with tribal secretary Theresa `Huck' Two
Bulls. It would appear that Two Bulls has a very bright future in
tribal politics. It was the first time she ran for such a high
office and her strong showing stunned many tribal residents. The
Oglala Lakota people have never elected a woman as tribal
president.
 &HT;    In the great Northwest an ominous storm blew through the land.
Washington state joined California in passing legislation stopping
affirmative action. Indian tribes in Washington are pondering the
wording of the initiative which would prohibit preferential
treatment based on race or gender in state or federal government
hiring, in awarding state contracts and in admission to public
colleges and universities.
 &HT;    Passing this legislation in Washington state comes at a most
inappropriate time for minority journalists planning to hold a
Unity '99 convention in Seattle. Members of the National
Association of Black Journalists voiced concerns prior to the
election and now, with the passage of I-200, many are considering
boycotting the state of Washington.
 &HT;    Passage of this initiative could have a devastating impact upon
the ability of the 21 Indian tribes in Washington state to get
state and federal jobs and to receive preferential treatment in
seeking higher education opportunities.
 &HT;    In California minority enrollment in major colleges and
universities has dwindled considerably. Many tribal members see
this initiative as a backlash against successful operation of their
gaming casinos.
 &HT;    Tribal leaders fear the retaliation could jeopardize their
compacts and agreements with the state government to operate legal
casinos. They feel the state could retaliate by claiming gaming
compacts are based upon race.
 &HT;    When Arizona fought against proclaiming a Martin Luther King
holiday, African American, Hispanic and American Indian
organizations boycotted that state. In fact, a meeting of American
Indian lawyers was moved to another state in protest.
 &HT;    I would advise the members of the National Association of Black
Journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, National
Association of Asian-American Journalists and the members of the
Native American Journalists Association to look into their hearts
before holding their Unity '99 convention in Seattle. Consider the
serious damage I-200 will do to all minorities in the state as well
as to the Indian nations.
 &HT;    I always try to practice what I preach. Although I am the
founder of the Native American Journalists Association and my
editor, Avis Little Eagle, serves on its board, I will not attend
the Unity '99 convention in Seattle. I believe I owe it to all of
the racial minorities in the state of Washington who will be
damaged by the initiative that would deny them affirmative action.
