   MACY, Neb. _ There was no Christmas vacation this year at the
Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either. Instead,
the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the
school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first
week of May.
</P>
<P>
   This was his attempt to stem a chronically high truancy rate
that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of
the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in
school.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely successful. In the math class taught by
Chessmore, for example, only five of the 36 registered students
were showing up by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a country used to stories about struggling public
schools, many of those in Indian country stand out. Last year, the
average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the
15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half
scored below the 10th percentile. Fewer than half the students in
grades three through 12 came to take the test, Chessmore said. And
while this year's graduating class of nine is bigger than those of
a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students
enrolled in that class in ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed
in Indian schools around the country. On average, 36 percent to 51
percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to
the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any
ethnic group. Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to
college, and most do not finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest
rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of
entering college,'' said Dean Chavers, director of the Native
American Scholarship Fund. ``Whatever test you're looking at,
Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th
percentile. The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent.
Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 _ no
geometry, no trig _ and people wonder why they're failing out of
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups
like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing
states and the federal government for more money for academics and
crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support
for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave
them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school
and achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The effort reflects the Indians' increasing ability to assert
itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and
a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos. But
it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
</P>
<P>
   Some reservation schools have done well and others, including
the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago. But
many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian
teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and
overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of
government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the
relationship between being academically rigorous and being
successful on the reservation. These difficulties only compound the
isolation and poverty of reservation life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the future of the tribe,'' said Denine Parker,
an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy, where
60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed. ``I see too
many kids not getting an education. What happens to them? All you
have to do is walk Main Street and then you know.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, state and federal officials are responding.
President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest
increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs _
$1.2 billion _ which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to
train 1,000 Indian teachers. Currently, most teachers in
reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are
extremely high, and many believe the teachers do not understand
Indian culture and learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   And in August, a task force Clinton created will present plans
to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90
percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is that what the government is doing says
it's OK to be an Indian,'' said David Cournoyer, director of
external affairs for the American Indian College Fund. ``Before the
philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically
educate him to be a white person. Now there's a recognition that
the Indian's background and identity and self-esteem is important
to them being good students.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Beaulieu, the Education Department's director of
Indian education, called the effort unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have schools that are literally falling down around the
heads of Indian children,'' Beaulieu said. ``In the 1990s we had
the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as
existed 20 years before.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, the efforts of Chessmore and others got the state
to hold an Indian education summit meeting and appoint a task force
to improve state policy. The Legislature passed a bill this session
changing the state aid formula so tribes, which have very little
taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they
cannot raise the required amount from property taxes. The bill was
vetoed by Nebraska's governor, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago
school districts plan to sue the state.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Johanns, said that
while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he
also believed ``it is time for the state and federal government to
step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is
hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education
expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation
communities,'' said Christensen. ``In two of our reservation
schools there are 44 kindergartners but only two seniors, and in
one case those two kids should not be graduating. They are two
18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save
their soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north
of Macy, said ``some parents see formal education as important,
others see just being with the family as education. We have parents
who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a
haircut in the middle of the day.''

 &LR;  Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher who regularly sees only 15 out
of 26 students in her largest class, sent her daughter to sixth
grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa. Recently, her daughter
returned to Omaha Nation school to find she was ``way ahead of the
sixth graders here,'' Parker said. ``If I never would have sent her
away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at Omaha Nation, Chessmore has made many improvements,
from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as
superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help
girls who have babies stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   He started a training program for Indian teachers that will
increase their numbers from 4 to 20, made the curriculum more
culturally relevant, and has applied for money for a social
services center with probation officers and a mental health
counselor. He received a grant for a reading program for elementary
students, which has produced ``fourth graders who are reading
better than half our high school.'' And he is lobbying the
telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students'
families without them.
</P>
<P>
   To build trust, Chessmore, unlike most superintendents and
teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his seven children at
Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students. He and
his wife also raise four Indian students from troubled families.
</P>
<P>
   He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell from
31 percent to about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member,
scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school. In a Buick
with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Oldman
visited one boy's father and the trailer where the other boy lived
with his grandmother. He scaled a chalky ridge called Million
Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees,
scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an
algae-choked creek strewn with old tires.. The truants were nowhere
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are smart _ they arrange tree branches so they can
scoot underneath but we have to work to get through,'' Oldman said.
He said tribal court has begun fining parents whose children were
chronically truant, and the school sometimes tried to get their
welfare benefits cut. ``Some parents are really concerned, but some
of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the
kids to school.''
</P>
<P>
   One chronic truant was Janice &UR;  &LR; Baxter's 16-year-old son. She
would take him to school in the morning, but said that ``in the
afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends.'' Baxter
said he kept ``coming home drunk'' and she sent him to a treatment
center.
</P>
<P>
   Some students show promise but don't follow through. This year,
it looked like Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would
graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really want to come to school no more,'' said Jason,
18.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been successes.
</P>
<P>
   One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate.
But a few weeks ago, Chessmore refused to let his daughter double
date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate.
She did.
</P>
<P>
   And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was left back in ninth grade and
was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks,
turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her
she would have to help pay the bills if she wasn't in school. Now
she'll graduate and plans to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally realized what I should be doing,'' Adrienne wrote in
a class essay, ``getting my education.''
