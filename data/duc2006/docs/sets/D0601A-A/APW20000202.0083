<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1.2B For Indian Country  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian reservations would get an infusion of
$1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement
under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the
largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded
programs in nearly all federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking
about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after
she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and
Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the spending initiative in his State of the Union address
last week, but did not mention any specifics. Those will be included in his 2001
budget proposal, to be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new
reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about
$300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to
reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main
agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't
address all the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all, I don't think it's anything to have a party over, because the
needs in Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton
picked to head the BIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and
chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does
wonder why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a
look at Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the
estimated $4 billion backlog of needed repairs. And, according to an Interior
Department report issued last year, $1.2 billion is needed to repair or replace
170 Indian schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know half-a-dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's
a drop,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reservations are home to some of the gravest poverty and worst health care
in the country. The unemployment rate on reservations is about 10 times the
national average and only about two-thirds of Indian adults have a high school
diploma, compared to three-quarters of the general population. The Indian Health
Service reports the Indian death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the
population.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31 tribal
colleges, Cutler said. The colleges, which serve 26,000 students in 12 states,
are a vital part of efforts to improve education and economic opportunities on
reservations, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be released today says tribal colleges have created jobs and
helped increase education levels on the reservations where they operate. The
report from the Institute for Higher Education Policy and the American Indian
Higher Education Consortium said median incomes for women on reservations with
tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster between 1980 and 1990 than for women on
reservations without colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler said other details of Clinton's proposal include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for a Treasury Department program aimed at attracting
companies to reservation areas.
