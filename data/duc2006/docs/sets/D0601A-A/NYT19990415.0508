 &HT;    
 &HT;    Imagine if you will, being so poor that you lived in a shanty
without running water or an indoor bathroom. Your welfare checks
and the monthly rations of government commodities barely kept the
wolf from the door. Unemployment ran as high as 80 percent, and the
average life span was 47 years. The automobile used for
transporting your family to the hospital or grocery store was held
together with baling wire.
 &HT;    This is the way it was in Indian country a short 12 years ago _
before the casinos came.
 &HT;    But today, on some reservations an explosion of sudden riches
has been nearly overwhelming. The jump from extreme poverty to
extreme wealth happened so quickly it was as if every member of the
tribe hit the million-dollar lottery. That is what the advent of
gaming in Indian country has created, an unparalleled phenomenon
that astonishes, excites and frightens many.
 &HT;    In other more isolated reservations, poverty still grips the
community and little has changed.
 &HT;    For those tribal leaders caught by the unprecedented overnight
leap from rags to riches, the endeavor to adjust rapidly became one
of trial and error.
 &HT;    And some tribes, in their haste to get on the gaming bandwagon,
threw all caution to the wind and brought in casino management
companies of dubious reputation. Others signed compacts with state
governments that nearly shredded their status as sovereign nations.
Many tribal leaders made mistakes.
 &HT;    That is what happens when people accustomed to living in poverty
are suddenly thrust into wealth. Every snake oil salesman in the
country with a get-rich-quick scheme suddenly converged upon tribes
long treated as `out of sight, out of mind.' So it was that tribes'
education to the world of high finance had begun.
 &HT;    In the past I have been critical of some of the better-off
tribes _ a few of them signing legal documents with state
governments that would eventually impact all of the Indian Nations.
My mistake was not allowing them to learn and to grow using their
errors as educational tools.
 &HT;    This month an 84-room hotel will be opened by the
Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe on the North Dakota-South Dakota
border. This is the first phase of a $10.8 million plan that will
feature a new casino and resort. Another new casino twice as large
as the current one will open in the fall. The tribe hopes to have
an RV (recreational vehicle) park open by midsummer.
 &HT;    The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Tribe of Minnesota, who owns the
extremely successful Mystic Lake Casino at Shakopee, and whom I
have also criticized, financed this entire project.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the Mashentucket Pequot, owners of the richest Indian
casino _ the Foxwood Casino at Ledyard, Conn. _ has begun to hire
Indian people from all over America to management positions. Thus,
they are now using their prosperity, as are the Shakopee
Mdewakanton, to reach out to other tribes less fortunate than
themselves.
 &HT;    I attribute this dramatic change to the painful learning process
both tribes have experienced and to the stability in their tribal
governments that has allowed them to invest wisely and to feel
secure enough to extend a helping hand to others.
 &HT;    I also applaud the replacing of much of its non-Indian
management with Indians from its own and other tribes, a process
undertaken by a tribal leadership that is much more sensitive to
the conditions on other reservations and have a strong desire to
help weaker Indian Nations.
 &HT;    Gaming has brought about extraordinary success _ and
extraordinary doubts and fears _ to Indian country.
 &HT;    As a result, understandably, there are those Nations that have
chosen not to have gambling.
 &HT;    Conditions of extreme poverty exist today on those Indian lands
where gaming has not been embraced. The Hopi (Arizona) and Navajo
Nation (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah) are two good
examples. Neither tribe has looked to gaming for their salvation.
 &HT;    The Navajo voted against gaming in a reservation-wide referendum
about two years ago. The Hopi, who are very traditional and
spiritual in their beliefs and lifestyle, voted in a special
election in 1994 not to open a casino. Hopi Chief of Staff Eugene
Kaye said simply, ``The people decided they didn't want gaming so
they just voted it down.''
 &HT;    Twice, the issue has been on the ballot of the Navajo Nation and
twice, it has gone down to defeat. Former Chairman Albert Hale
said, ``When an issue as important as gaming comes up, we cannot
afford to leave it in the hands of the politicians because many of
them would look at it as a revenue producer and probably favor it.
We left it up to the Navajo people and they said no.''
 &HT;    The Navajo and Hopi are politically astute. They have observed
the good and the bad of Indian casinos on other reservations and
they fear a casino would interfere with their cultural and
traditional way of life. For the most part, the Hopi and Navajo
still speak in their native languages. They see more evil in gaming
than good. They are fierce protectors of their sovereignty and they
have watched other tribes diminish their own sovereignty in order
to gain wealth.
 &HT;    Both tribes maintain very rigid social management units within
their matrilineal clans. This tightly knit management process
ensures continuity and gives the tribe as a whole a means for
survival even when facing destructive natural elements or the
extreme pressures exerted upon them from the encroachment of modern
society. It is this concept of a communal, sacred responsibility
that has allowed these people to look sudden wealth in the face and
turn their backs to it.
 &HT;    Anyone who visits Chinle, Window Rock, or Tuba City on the
Navajo Nation or Shongopavi, Shipaulovi or Oraibi on the Hopi
Nation, will not fail to observe the quiet dignity the people carry
in their poverty.
 &HT;    Thus far, even though they are the poorest of the poor, the
Navajo and Hopi have not succumbed to the temptations offered by
that green god called money. Dignity is something money cannot buy.
