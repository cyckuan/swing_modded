<HEADLINE> State's first witnesses says New York was looking out for Cayugas  </HEADLINE>

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - New York acted honorably in acquiring
Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to
protect the Iroquois tribe, a Canadian anthropologist testified
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied,
bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre
reservation, U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different
historical perspective from the state's first witness, Alexander
von Gernet.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the
Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the
tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act,
which required Congressional approval for all Indian land
transactions. Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in
February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to
decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to
understand New York's behavior dealing with Native Americans after
that time, said von Gernet, a Native American expert from the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over
Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said.
Historical documents show that as early as 1684, the colonial
governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That policy was carried forward in other treaties, laws and
proclamations enacted over the next century, von Gernet testified.
It was a policy also included in the state constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress was a newfangled institution. Colonial New York had a
longrunning relationship with the tribes,'' von Gernet said. ''The
idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in
New York. It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary
War.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War
and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal
government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a
conquered people and make them wards of the state, von Gernet said.
</P>
<P>
   However, then Gov. George Clinton ignored the warnings and
instead decided to broker a treaty with them, von Gernet testified.
Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership
of Indian lands, the treaty also ensured reservation land would be
set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous
individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Gernet also testified:
</P>
<P>
   -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for
22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about
buying their reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   -That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the
Revolutionary War, leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each
follow its own course. The Cayugas' witnesses have testified that
in agreeing to the 1795 treaty, New York knowingly ignored Iroquois
tradition, which required the Grand Council's consensus to make the
treaty binding.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, von Gernet said, following the war, the Cayugas
split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position
through achievement as opposed to inheriting them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in
diplomatic discourse,'' von Gernet told McCurn.
</P>
<P>
   He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to
Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas
lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal
by state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The minority faction, led by Steel Trap, returned to the Cayuga
Lake area, where faced with an onslaught of settlers, it eventually
worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe's lands to New York
except for the 64,000-acre reservation.
