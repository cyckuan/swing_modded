<P>
   SPARTA, Ga. _ By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning,
Hancock County is almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   A few children play in overgrown backyards full of junk cars and
rotting timbers, and older people fan themselves on sagging
porches. But almost anyone who works has left the county hours
before, because there are virtually no jobs in Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``pocket of poverty'' cannot begin to describe the
overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted
roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and
overgrown. Every employer of any size has left, and new ones
seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics _ more than half
the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to
unwed mothers _ and say no thanks. Unspoken in most of those
decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent
black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment
descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month. But only 80
miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7
percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is
a third less than the rest of the state. The county's leaders have
begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants,
a landfill, a waste incinerator. Everything has fallen through
except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago
outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's
9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the
South these days, that Hancock County would place its hopes for an
economic future on the ultimate last resort _ an Indian gambling
casino. For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian
tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents
have talked of nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last chance for our county,'' said Lesley James
Roberts, Hancock's special projects director, who is spending
almost all his time on the casino project. ``Think about what all
those tourists could do for us. We'd have the money to restore all
those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts
in town and maybe do historical re-enactments. It would give our
people a chance to become independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino is a long way from becoming a reality. Among other
hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact
for a reservation, and Gov. Roy E. Barnes has said he was opposed
to casino gambling, although the state runs a lottery. (The federal
government could approve the project if the state refuses.) But in
the meantime, an instant bond has been formed between two groups of
impoverished people, each of whom is relying on the other to
achieve a dream of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The Kialegees, numbering about 450, are a landless tribe,
sharing space in Wetumka, Okla., with the much larger Creek Nation,
to whom they are related. Along with several other Creek tribes,
they trace their origin to northern and central Georgia, from which
they were forcibly resettled 160 years ago along the Trail of
Tears. The tribe has tried several times to build casinos elsewhere
but has been rebuffed, most recently in Carroll County, Ga., on the
Alabama border west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll County residents, close enough to Atlanta to benefit
from its boom, said they feared crime and disruption from the
casino, but the reception has been very different in Hancock. Most
residents here are descendants of slaves who once worked the
plantations in the area, and Hancock is one of a string of largely
black counties stretching from Virginia to East Texas known as the
Black Belt. Most of those counties are significantly more
impoverished than their neighbors, even in a time of national
bounty.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after R. Allen Haywood, the editor and publisher of the
weekly Sparta Ishmaelite, noticed an article about Carroll County's
rejection, he suggested to Hancock County officials that they
contact the tribe. Kialegee leaders were immediately interested,
and received a warm reception at an overflowing town meeting here
last week. They were even more intrigued when they learned that
there are several large Indian mounds in Hancock County, of unknown
origin and dating back hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an almost instant camaraderie between the tribal
members and the citizens of the county,'' said Kenneth R. Baldwin,
who runs an investment group in McAlester, Okla., that is
representing the Kialegees. ``They both have an understanding of
what it means to have to struggle, to not have the opportunities
you'd like to have. The tribe felt more welcome there than anywhere
else they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the county have heard all of society's warnings
about gambling, and are aware that it is not always a pathway out
of distress. But they have also seen marketing studies showing that
there is no other full-fledged casino in Georgia, Florida or the
Carolinas, and are convinced gamblers will make their way to this
nearly abandoned county once the lights flash on the proposed
casino, hotel and golf course. Considering Hancock's current
situation _ in which the largest employer is its public school
system _ the county's leaders say they could hardly do worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where people are struggling to keep a roof
over their heads and clothes on their backs,'' Roberts said. ``Our
history hasn't put us in a position to be very selective about what
we want.''
