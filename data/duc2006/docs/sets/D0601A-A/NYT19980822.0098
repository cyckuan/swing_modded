   ETHETE, Wyo. _ In the face of cutbacks brought about by the
overhaul of welfare programs, members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe
on the Wind River Reservation have started a seven-acre community
garden with donated land, seeds and equipment to grow vegetables
for themselves and for the elderly and disabled who cannot work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that when time runs out, when they are no
longer eligible for government assistance, what are they going to
do for food?'' said Glen Revere, a nutritionist with the Indian
Health Services on the 2.8 million-acre Wind River Reservation,
about 100 miles east of Jackson, Wyo. ``Then we came up with the
idea for this community garden, and it's been bigger than we ever
expected in so many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when
potatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil,
and five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and
white kernels ripening inside. The conditions on these wide plains
near the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with
high winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season
to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the
Northern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed
produce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge
Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people
were stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions,
squash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this?'''
she recalled. ``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy. Many
of them didn't have food in their house when I showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather
of nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks. We dried some
things, boiled some. Just ate all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in
World War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one
daughter and one grandchild. They receive food stamps for a
$300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often
fed members of their family who stopped by. Soldierwolf estimated
they saved $70 with the free vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of
the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom
49 percent are unemployed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates
that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty.
Soldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all
right,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps.
``It's worse than in the Depression.'' Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded,
with tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern
Arapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare
cases in Wyoming. The reservation population of 12,000 _ including
6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal
members and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent
of the state's population of 480,000.
</P>
<P>
   Revere and Ms. Houser say the community garden can help reduce
dependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops,
traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.

<P>
   On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be
planted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the
garden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use
here or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal
member and nutritionist with Indian Health Services. ``Indians are
not horticulturists. They were hunters and gatherers who were
forced to garden when they were put on the reservations. There is a
lack of knowledge about how to plant and water crops.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ethete (pronounced EE-tha-tee), the school is adding
horticulture to its natural science curriculum, and students take
field trips to the community garden for hands-on experience growing
their own food.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lujan, a father of four, used seeds Ms. Houser gave him
to grow ceremonial Indian corn in a little garden on the side of
his house. ``I will give this corn to anyone who wants some,
because it is part of our religion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lujan, an Arapaho tribal member, said he would use all parts of
the corn, including the husk to wrap tamales he plans to make the
staple of a catering business he is starting. He is also growing
pumpkins, onions and cucumbers. ``I'm pretty sure we're going to
save a lot of money this year with what we've grown,'' he said. &QL;
