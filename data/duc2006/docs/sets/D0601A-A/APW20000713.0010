<HEADLINE> American Indian Youth Crime Rises  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They come into Elaine Newton's court by the
dozens, charged with underage drinking, using marijuana, fighting.
Some are as young as 11.
</P>
<P>
   They are children without a childhood, being sucked into the
vortex of drinking and despair that destroys too many people on
Colorado's remote Southern Ute Indian reservation. Newton, the
tribe's chief judge, sees more of them every year.
</P>
<P>
   Many, Newton said, are victims themselves, either of abuse or
what she calls ''emotional incest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where children basically are left to feel responsible
for their parents' own emotional needs,'' Newton said. ''They feel
it's their fault that mom is drinking or dad leaves, when it's
really not their fault.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we forget they are children.''
</P>
<P>
   As crime rates fall nationwide, they are rising in American
Indian communities, especially among the 43 percent of Indians
under age 20. Indian youth are far more likely to be arrested for
alcohol-related crimes than their non-Indian counterparts,
according to a report released Thursday by a government advisory
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Juvenile Justice report said 3 percent of
juveniles arrested for liquor law violations are Indian, though
Indians make up just 1 percent of all juveniles. The coalition, a
nonprofit group of state advisory boards created under a federal
juvenile justice law, recommends expanding programs to fight Indian
alcoholism, depression and gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In states with significant American Indian communities,
American Indian youth are found far too frequently in the back of
squad cars, rather than in the front of classrooms,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile crime is one strand in the web of social problems
facing urban and reservation Indian communities, the report said.
High reservation unemployment is one factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are limited opportunities on the reservation, especially
those in rural areas,'' said Kevin Shendoe, a member of New
Mexico's Jemez Pueblo who started a group to help youths develop
leadership skills. ''Given that and the history of alcoholism and
poverty, I think it all plays into students getting depressed and
frustrated -- and in certain serious cases, violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is abuse passed down from generation to
generation, often starting with Indian children forced into
government or religious boarding schools where tribal culture was
suppressed and abuse and neglect were commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cultural oppression has taken a heavy toll on Native Americans
for years,'' Newton said. ''There's been a lack of parenting
because of boarding schools. Parents don't know how to be parents.
... In society today, you're in between two cultures. They lost
their Indian culture and they're struggling with trying to figure
out where they fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians have some of the worst health care and highest death
rates from alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicide in the
nation. That means many young Indians are repeatedly traumatized by
deaths of friends and relatives, said Sandi Ernst, a psychologist
who ran the White Mountain Apache Tribe's child mental health
programs from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of children affected by alcohol in their mothers'
wombs also contributes to the crime problem, said Ernst, who now
practices in Phoenix. People exposed to alcohol in the womb are
more impulsive and often cannot understand consequences of their
behavior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That increases the likelihood they're going to do stupid
things,'' Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal programs, which must rely on federal funding, are too
often shortchanged, the report said. Newton said getting enough
money to help the children she sentences is a constant problem.
Children who have enough Indian heritage to qualify for some
federal programs but are not enrolled members of the tribe often
fall through the cracks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It often seems like there's no funding available to help us,''
Newton said. ''If we need treatment for sexual abuse or domestic
violence or alcohol treatment, there's no one to help us. It's kind
of like these problems never get resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton also thinks that Indian communities must take
responsibility for ending the cycle of abuse and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us are in denial about what has happened,'' Newton
said. ''We cover up things or say nothing's wrong in our families.
We don't make our families accountable for the wrongs we may have
done.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is we need to validate what has happened, grieve and
then move on. Until you can do that, you just don't resolve
anything.''
