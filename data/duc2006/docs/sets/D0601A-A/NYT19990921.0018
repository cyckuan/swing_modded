 CONGRESS STUDIES RAPIDLY CHANGING FACE OF iNTERNET AND iNDIAN (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As legalized gambling spreads, industry lines are
starting to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Marriages of tribal and corporate casinos, slot machines and
racetracks, the Internet and everybody come at a time when the
nation's gambling laws have never been murkier or more
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal lawmakers' plates are heaped with hot-potato
gambling issues, and none is hotter for Congress than deciding
whether to ignore, regulate or outlaw the explosion of Internet
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers also soon must sort out the muddled state of
American Indian gambling, which has pitted tribes desperate for
casino revenue against state governments resistant to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Both topics were discussed last week at the World Gaming
Congress convention, along with the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission report, which was issued in June.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, after spending $5 million and two years
researching the state of gambling in America, cooked up a casserole
of 76 recommendations that ranged from criminalization of Internet
gambling to the need for more research and public education.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not answer the big question of whether America's
infatuation with wagering had become a malignant obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it called for a nationwide ``pause'' in gambling
expansion while states and gambling-host communities conduct their
own economic- and social-impact studies and then reach their own
hard decisions on whether to expand, contract or even abolish
regional gambling activity.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly what the gambling industry _ or its opponents _
wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking whatever they want out of it to advance
their own position,'' said Rick Hill, chairman of the National
Indian Gaming Association, which represents 168 of the 195 U.S.
tribes that offer legal casino or bingo gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of the commission's own members acknowledges a lack of
interest by the American public and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the report will disappear,'' J. Terrence Lanni,
chairman and chief executive of MGM Grand Inc., said last week in
remarks to delegates at the international gambling industry's
largest annual trade show.
</P>
<P>
   But at its heart, Lanni added, the commission's work did reflect
the mood of the American public _ compassion for addicted gamblers
but a demand for legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the report fades away, those paramount issues will not.
As wagering becomes ever more widespread, Congress must resolve the
profound issue of Internet gambling and the politically touchy
matter of tribal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 nations, mostly in the Third World, license and tax
online gambling enterprises that operate through 700 sites on the
World Wide Web. The number grows almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, the most watched developments are in
Australia, which recently permitted its states and territories to
individually license and regulate sports and racetrack betting on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. gamblers are beginning to discover these legal bookies Down
Under who gladly accept wagers from anywhere in the world _
seemingly daring legal retaliation from Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sports book American Wagering Inc. of Nevada holds one
of the Australian licenses. American is the only online Australian
operator not accepting U.S. bets, but only because that action
could jeopardize its U.S. licenses.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bother American's CEO, Vic Salerno, who said he was
convinced that his company had taken the Internet plunge in the
right nation and at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   And if the United States never joins the global cyber party,
Salerno said, so what? ``There's enough money left out there
outside of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robust international betting on events such as World Cup soccer,
Formula I auto racing, cricket and rugby ``makes the NFL (sports
books) look like child's play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gordon, an Australian territorial government gambling
regulator, predicted at one World Gaming Congress seminar last week
that Australian regulatory and consumer protection statutes would
become the model as other rich nations, one by one, accept the
inevitability of worldwide cyber gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the First World's foremost society debates whether to
ban Internet gambling and almost certainly usher in a new
Prohibition era _ this time featuring bootleg e-commerce sports
bookies and slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Current U.S. law on gambling by ``wire'' communications was
written in the 1960s, tying the hands of federal prosecutors with
statutes that never imagined the legal complexities of offshore
cyber casinos and bookies with toll-free phone lines, and bank
accounts that can afford huge U.S. advertising budgets and platoons
of silk-tie lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona, for two years has been
pushing for outright prohibition of such high-tech gambling, and
his Senate Bill 692 is heading toward a floor vote this fall. House
action is not expected until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri is a co-sponsor of the Kyl
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bond spokesman Dan Hubbard acknowledged
the technological challenge of enforcing a nationwide ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's no reason to throw up your hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has concerns about the spread of gambling that defies
international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these are based offshore,'' Hubbard said. ``You can't
regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier failed versions of the Kyl bill would have made
criminals of Internet casino executives and their customers. In the
latest version the public is let off the hook, as are
fantasy-sports players and some pari-mutuel wagering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The national commission bolstered Kyl with its own call for a
ban, criminal prosecution and even diplomatic pressure from the
United States on nations that ``harbor Internet gambling
organizations that prey on U.S. citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have serious doubts the Internet can be controlled by the
federal government,'' Lanni said.
</P>
<P>
   One idea out there would make cyber-gambling police of the U.S.
banking industry, whose plastic accounts are the currency of choice
for many in the online betting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the use of U.S. credit cards for Internet wagering would
certainly put a damper on casual gamblers, but such legislation
could be difficult to pass and would be a nightmare for the banking
industry to implement.
</P>
<P>
   And for serious gamblers, there still would be many ways around
a credit block _ money orders and Australian or European
bank-issued credit cards, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, commercial casino companies such as Station
Casinos Inc. are aggressively positioning themselves for the
cyber-gambling era by teaming up with online operators.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes are in court fighting for the right to establish
multistate bingo, lottery and casino games that offer big jackpots.
One such tribal Internet lottery case is scheduled to be argued
Thursday in a Kansas City federal courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so un-American to back away from a challenge,'' said
Jacob L. Coin, executive director of the tribal gaming association.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (in Congress) fear the Internet because they don't
understand it. So they are just going to ban it ... run and hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look to what Australia is doing. Let's learn from them.
Let's find a way to benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to a court ruling, Congress in 1988 laid out a statutory
framework allowing American Indian tribes to offer high-stakes
bingo games and casino-style gambling on their historic reservation
lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since, almost no one is satisfied with how those
laws have played out. A congressional revision of the law seems
inevitable in the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are tangled ones.
</P>
<P>
   Few states receive taxes or significant revenue from what has
blossomed into an $8 billion-a-year industry.
</P>
<P>
   The states' regulatory role is often minimal. Worse, governors _
Kansas' Bill Graves among them _ increasingly argue that states'
rights have been trampled in a headlong rush to nurture needy
tribes with this ``new buffalo'' of tribal sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, meanwhile, interpret assertion of states' rights as
an assault on their sovereignty as legally independent nations.
</P>
<P>
   That stance irritates the commercial casino industry, which
competes with the tribes but must pay taxes and conform to tight
state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, each tribe regulates itself in conformance with
broad federal rules that demand very little public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Native American tribes need to be a little less geared to
using sovereignty to protect themselves,'' said MGM's Lanni.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have to disclose information like the rest of us.
Native Americans should come into the (gaming industry)
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk also rankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribes feel under attack,'' Coin said. ``Instead of applauding
the early successes of Indian gaming, there are those who are
trying to undermine it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Coin said, ``is that the quality of life on
tribal reservations is improving'' solely because of gambling
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal law expert and Minnesota lawyer Tom Foley told World
Gaming Congress delegates that Indian gambling was entering a new
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game of politics now,'' he said. ``Tremendous
dollars are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial casino industry and state officials will push
Congress to level the playing field with tribal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes will resist.
</P>
<P>
   Coin stated the tribes' case eloquently last week in Las Vegas
in remarks that defiantly recalled centuries of injustice:
</P>
<P>
   ``When our children are as healthy as yours, when our futures
are as bright as yours, then we can talk about a level playing
field.''
