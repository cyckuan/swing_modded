<HEADLINE> Indian Tribes Work To Be Counted  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to get a more accurate count of the
country's American Indian population, the Census Bureau is turning
to tribal leaders and residents on reservations to help overcome
long-standing feelings of wariness or anger toward the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship hasn't been stress-free, tribal leaders say,
but there has been marked improvement from 1990, when Census
officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American
Indian population. The national undercount rate was 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation
that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in
eight Navajos were not counted in 1990. The tribe is determined not
to let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the
Navajo nation has profound control over the count, by way of hiring
our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate, and the maps for
enumeration were created by Navajo chapters,'' said Mellor Willie,
spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye.
</P>
<P>
   More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians
governmental affairs director Jack Jackson, Jr. is that an
estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on reservations were
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was
that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may
have been unaware of tribal customs, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos
today. Willie said the Navajos missed out on $110 million in
federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think a lot of Navajo people within the last census
count knew this was helping in their communities,'' Willie said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, the Census Bureau sought more input from tribal
governments five years ago, said Tom Beavers, partnership
specialist for the regional census center in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we hire now, we want to hire people who live in their own
communities to work in their own communities, and we have told
Indian leaders in our communities that,'' said Beavers, himself an
American Indian, who in his job works with tribes in Oklahoma and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census
data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs,
grants to local education agencies for Indian education, and family
violence prevention and services.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has gone smoothly though. Earlier this month,
leaders on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana threatened to
arrest census workers after complaints that local census managers
failed to keep him informed of hiring decisions and other business
on the reservation. The order has since been rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Others like Brenda Boyd, census liaison for the Mille Lacs Band
of Chippewa in Onamia, Minn., complain that at times, there is too
much red tape in getting simple answers from regional census
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees, though, that they are better off than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''This census is much better,'' Boyd said. ''Last time, the
count was way off.''
