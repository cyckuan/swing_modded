   HIGHLAND, Calif. _ A century after Indian wars roiled the West,
another battle is raging here over a ballot measure that would
expand the state's $1.4 billion Indian gambling industry. It pits
California's gaming tribes against an unlikely coalition of Nevada
casinos, unions, church groups and other businesses in what may
become the most expensive fight in California political history.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino on a patch of
tribal land 60 miles east of Los Angeles makes the stakes clear.
The afternoon sun is still high, but the parking lot is filling
fast, and inside the smoky 90,000-square-foot gambling hall, the
hopeful already sit glued to most of the 1,000 video slot machines
and to row after row of bingo tables.
</P>
<P>
   This 24-hour no-frills casino is an economic miracle for the
tiny San Manuel tribe, which once scratched out an income raising
apricots and lived in shacks and trailers on a dusty 648-acre
reservation. Now, 40 landscaped houses dot the hillsides behind the
casino's walls, and security officers on bicycles patrol newly
paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Manuel Indians have a problem: They and about 40
other tribes began installing slot machines over the last decade
without first reaching compacts with the state, as required by
federal law. So Gov. Pete Wilson and federal prosecutors consider
their casinos illegal and have moved to shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the gaming tribes are sponsoring a hotly contested
ballot measure in the Nov. 3 election that would allow broad
expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands statewide. In a
potent illustration of the power of gambling money in politics, it
seems likely to set a new record for spending on a ballot
initiative here.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the two sides have raised at least $60 million and
spent about $53 million, mostly for a barrage of competing
television commercials. About $43 million has been raised by
tribes, $22 million of it from the San Manuel tribe alone, while
opponents, led by the casino operators at Hilton Hotels Corp. and
Mirage Resorts Inc., who fear untaxed Indian competition, have
raised $15.5 million and spent $1 million more. The previous
spending record for a single measure was $57.5 million on a
securities fraud proposal two years ago; $84 million was spent on a
group of competing insurance reform measures in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Public polls have shown the gambling measure, Proposition 5,
winning majority, but not overwhelming, support among voters, many
of whom are sympathetic to decades of Indian privation in a state
that paid bounties for Indian body parts in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming tribes contend that nothing less than their historic
sovereignty and economic survival is at stake, and their
advertisements feature members attesting that Indian gaming has
broken the cycle of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our livelihood,'' said Ken Ramirez, 38, vice-chairman
of the San Manuel tribe, who grew up on the reservation when it
held only a handful of families, with water too fetid to drink. He
declined to disclose the tribe's revenues from gaming, but noted
that about 110 people now live on the reservation, where, with
gambling proceeds, the tribe has drilled 16 deep wells and plans to
market bottled water commercially.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of Proposition 5 accuse the gaming tribes of scare
tactics. They say the tribes' campaign exaggerates the threat to
Indian welfare and obscures the real menace of a measure that would
allow the spread of gambling throughout the state, divert business
from privately operated theme parks, racetracks and card rooms and
yet provide few economic benefits over all, because Indian casinos
pay no taxes on their profits, though gamblers pay income taxes on
their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it's an incredible con game,'' said Frank
Schubert, who is managing the ``No on 5'' campaign for the
Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling, which has run ads in which
a jogging couple is stunned by a volcanic eruption of garish casino
signs in their neighborhood. ``We've had millions and millions in
TV ads bombarding the state for months now about reservations
getting electricity and being able to be linoleum on a dirt floor,
when in fact it's a handful of tribes spending a fortune to keep a
special deal.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation,
including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer
some form of gambling. The 1988 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act affirmed tribes' rights to offer bingo, and, subject to
negotiated compacts with individual states, slot machine games. But
some governors have complained about vagaries in the law and
Congress has debated making clarifications.
</P>
<P>
   In other states where Indians are either seeking gambling
compacts or negotiating the renewal of existing ones, the
California debate is being closely watched.

   ``From a national perspective, many states and tribes have
already resolved this,'' said John Dossett, general counsel of the
National Congress of American Indians in Washington, which
represents 250 tribes. ``If this issue were to be resolved in
California, there'd be less pressure in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But resolution here seems unlikely any time soon. Opponents of
Proposition 5 warn that if it passes, it will immediately be tied
up in years of litigation, and could well violate the California
State Constitution's ban on ``Nevada or New Jersey-type casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for a long battle here instead of a politically
negotiated solution in which both sides say, `Let's make this
work,''' said Cathy Christian, counsel to the Coalition Against
Unregulated Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming tribes say they are prepared to fight. They complain
that they have been caught in an impossible situation because,
eager for revenue, they began offering gambling while their right
to do so was still being litigated. Since then Wilson, a Republican
and a foe of gambling in general, has refused to negotiate a
compact with any tribe that was already gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Proposition 5, the gaming that currently exists on
Indian lands in California could be taken away from the tribes,''
said Waltona Manion, a spokeswoman for the tribal alliance known as
Californians for Indian Self-Reliance. ``Why remove something
that's working, and that's proven to have taken these tribes off of
welfare dependency and put them on the road to self-sufficiency?''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson has offered a clear alternative. Last spring, he
reached an agreement with the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San
Diego County that would allow a new form of video slot machine but
outlaw those now used by gambling tribes. In the months since, 10
more tribes, some of them under threat of federal action, have
signed the Pala compact, which limits each tribe to 199 of the new
machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to
other tribes, up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe, with a
statewide cap of 19,900. The State Legislature ratified the
agreements in August.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gaming tribes contend that Wilson, who is barred
from seeking a third term this year, refused to negotiate in good
faith, as required by the 1988 federal law. So Proposition 5 leaves
little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact
allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted
them, though, as is now the case, the measure would only allow
games in which players bet against a pool of other players' money,
not against the casino house itself, as in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to
protect Indian gambling, and to hammer home the point, they are now
running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo, head of
the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, which signed the Pala compact
and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing all this without Prop. 5,'' Ms. Lorenzo says in
the 30-second commercial as she walks through the construction
site. ``No tribe needs Prop. 5 to operate casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, supporters of the measure have accused their
fellow tribes of being turncoats recruited by ``the big Nevada
casinos,'' to oppose the proposition, in an echo of internecine
betrayals of the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Manuel Casino, which draws 3,000 to 4,000 gamblers a
day and where the card dealers now wear bold ``No on 5'' T-shirts,
players said they supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen to these people if Proposition 5
doesn't go through?'' asked Ruth Kennedy, a retired nurse who comes
every day to play bingo and the slots from late afternoon until the
wee hours of the morning, and who once won a $40,000 jackpot. ``Why
is Vegas and them so upset with the Indian halls? You can't tell me
this place doesn't do things for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Steven Lengel, the casino's customer
services director, it sponsors a range of school and community
programs in Highland and the neighboring towns of San Bernardino
and Redlands, and its uniformed security force of 250 is bigger
than those of the three local cities combined. It sells no alcohol,
allows none on the premises and employs more than 1,400 people, the
vast majority of them local residents.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure, including the California Labor
Federation AFL-CIO and the United Farm Workers, complain that it
would exempt the Indian casinos from environmental and worker
health and safety laws, and calls for distributing a maximum of 2
percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling
machines to non-gaming tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea that they're somehow spending all of their money to
help their poor brothers is just not true,'' Ms. Christian said.
