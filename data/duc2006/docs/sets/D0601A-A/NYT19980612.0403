<P>
   PHOENIX _ Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining
about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers
to stop asking how she spends that money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because
there's only enough money for one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
</P>
<P>
   And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua
Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear
apart a computer and put it back together.
</P>
<P>
   It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to
compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult
and indifference.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by
the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American
communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from
welfare to work. White Mountain Apache community's welfare program
started in April.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to
take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996
federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 Indian-run programs across the nation are
designed to emphasize education and soften the punitive nature of
many state programs. And most are in need of more money.
</P>
<P>
   The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're
training their own.
</P>
<P>
   By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa
community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
</P>
<P>
   On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce,
welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for
their elders in exchange for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of
personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo,
a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to
development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best
position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis
on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis'
program and the state-run program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not
someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina
and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job
and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
``These people have always been on the fringes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S.
Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need
more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort
by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders were invited to report their welfare reform
progress and problems to Arizona's Congressman J.D. Hayworth and
Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida, chairman of the U.S. House Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing in the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arizona tribes are grappling with the opportunity to
cushion their members from the harsher blows of the state's welfare
reform and to refocus their own bureaucracies to aid their neediest
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique opportunity the state can't begin to do because
they have thousands of people,'' said Lillia Castaneda, who is in
charge of putting the Salt River community's 250 to 400 adults now
receiving benefits to work. ``They're not numbers to us, they're
people. They're families.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to
work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies
distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown,
Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at
Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He also isn't sure that the federal government is ready to pay
the price of putting people to work on the nation's poorest
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent
or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family
limit on welfare benefits. That limit is pressuring states to move
quickly with reform. Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a
reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown. Expensive
problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol
addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and
lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year
limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to
pay for solving those complicated problems.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents
who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program,
are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate
and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
</P>
<P>
   He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to
prepare for work, some are older with more children and less
education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these
families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have
waiting lists. There is little money and staff to help find
families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because
of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems _ families Garcia is
unwilling to let go.
</P>
<P>
   As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short
funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo
Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain
dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and
distribute cash benefits for their members.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it
state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the
entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of
cash benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three
different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working
with three different federal regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe
is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the
state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a
little more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are
still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have
eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and
will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the
Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has 350 welfare families, or about 10 percent of its
membership, some of whom live in in Scottsdale and Guadalupe. This
tiny, small-town program can provide face to face encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Molina and her other classmates only agreed to commit to the
two-year computer course after people they knew knocked on their
doors, tapped them on the shoulder, gave them a little push and
took them by the hand to prove to them they could compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge (Garcia) came to my house,'' said Molina. ``I was
cleaning. I told him, `I'm not even dressed.' He said, `Just go
like you are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia drove the nervous Molina to the tribal offices to
interview for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Molina said. ``I've just been having kids and
staying home and didn't feel I had the knowledge to learn
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina's classmates and teacher said she's now the first to
volunteer to wrestle the insides of a computer she was once afraid
to touch.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Molina's children who keep her coming every day. She
renewed her friendship with her distant 13-year-old daughter with
conversations about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling everybody `My mom's in computer class. My
mom's building computers.' '' &QL;
