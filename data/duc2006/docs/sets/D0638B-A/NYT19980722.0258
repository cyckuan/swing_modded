   WASHINGTON _ From the accumulation of bits and pieces of fact,
scientists are beginning to think that a small planet-like body
just millions of miles from Earth may harbor conditions that could
support life.
</P>
<P>
   On Europa, a moon that races through dim sunlight in an orbit
that takes it around Jupiter every three and a half days, there
appears to be enough heat and water to support forms of life
already found in some of the Earth's more inhospitable places.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows whether Europa has the third ingredient: the
organic material necessary for life as it is understood on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is becoming more than a matter of scientific
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the
Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that
surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and
metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft might carry a small landing vehicle, said Carl
Pilcher, NASA scientific director for Solar System exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The central reason for the agency's interest in Europa, he said,
is the feeling that this, above all other extraterrestrial places
in the solar system, could be the home of some kind of living
organism.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that there are no plans ``for decades to come'' to
attempt to retrieve material from Europa's icy surface and return
it to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this
month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to
take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the
planet with extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Importantly, the task group found that there is significant
potential for a living entity to be present in samples returned
from Europa or Ganymede,'' another moon of Jupiter, the committee
stated.
</P>
<P>
   It added that the biological potential on Europa _ which it
called ``one of the most interesting objects in the solar system''
_ appears to be greater than on Ganymede.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, scientists at NASA have been intrigued
by new evidence suggesting that a vast body of salty, liquid water
lies beneath Europa's frozen crust, a sort of ``buried'' ocean that
may be as much as 60 miles deep.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to
peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has
rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by
Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of its gravitational field, scientists are
pretty much convinced that Europa is composed of a metallic center,
possibly iron, which is surrounded by a shell of rock. The rock
shell is surround in turn by a layer of water.
</P>
<P>
   The question they need answered is whether the water is all
frozen or consists of a liquid ocean on which floats a layer of ice
that may be several miles thick.
</P>
<P>
   From Europa's surface, Jupiter would appear as a huge, dark body
in a mostly black sky, said Gerald Schubert a planetary physicist
at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an
interdisciplinary scientist on the Galileo mission.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, Europa is wrenched by
the tidal forces of Jupiter's overpowering gravity, Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it orbits Jupiter, it contracts, expands, twists and
contorts,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a hell of a lot of heat in the interior as a
result of this tidal effect,'' he said in an interview. ``There
could be a tremendous amount of volcanic activity because of this
internal heat. Whether there actually is or not, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of heat could explain why the surface of Europa is
covered by fractures and ridges. The criss-crossed lines look much
like the broken ice that covers the Arctic Ocean and coastal areas
of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks also could be caused by Europa's flexing tides.
However, some of the cracks show signs that something from
underneath has oozed out and has been deposited on the surface,
Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured
magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons. This has
produced still more intriguing information about Europa.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic field of Jupiter varies as Europa orbits through
it, he explained. The effect is not unlike conditions inside an
electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   When a material that can conduct electricity passes through a
varying magnetic field, an electric current is generated in the
moving material. That current then generates its own magnetic
field.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding Europa are magnetic patterns that are typical of
fields generated by electric currents, Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   The currents could be generated as Europa moves though Jupiter's
magnetic field. But the key question is what could be conducting
those currents. The metallic core of the body is too far from
Galileo to produce magnetic fields the satellite could detect,
Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   And the rocky shell would not conduct electricity well enough to
carry the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears these magnetic fields could only be explained by
electric currents in a salty liquid ocean near the surface,''
Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilcher said the space mission planned for 2003 would carry a
laser altimeter, capable of very precise measurements of the
satellite's distance from the surface of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jupiter moon is covered with solid ice, then tidal
variations on the surface might be no more than a few meters, but
if there is a large body liquid water sloshing around beneath that
ice, then the tides would be much greater.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter also would carry infrared imaging equipment to
examine surface features and a sounding radar capable of examining
the subsurface several kilometers deep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no specific plans for a lander, such a device
might be added as a technology-testing prototype.
</P>
<P>
   If that is done, instruments to test the surface for the
presence of organic chemicals might be added, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sending a lander to the surface of Europa and retrieving a
sample of the ice or perhaps of the ancient ooze laying along the
sides of the moon's criss-crossed fractures is something that
hasn't even been seriously considered, Pilcher said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the same gravitational stresses that knead Europa
like a big ice-covered doughball would create almost unthinkable
obstacles to launching the vehicle when it has finished collecting
its samples.
