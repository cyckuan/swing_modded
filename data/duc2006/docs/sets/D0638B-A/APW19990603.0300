<HEADLINE> Life on Jovian Moon Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jupiter's moon Europa probably could not  
support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely 
support single-cell organisms, let alone complex species such as 
those found on Earth, researchers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists had suggested oceans exist beneath the frozen  
surface on Europa, boosting theories that life could develop on 
Jupiter's fourth-largest moon. The ocean theory was suggested by 
data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	But a layer of ice at least 6 miles deep blocks the sun's  
life-sustaining energy from the water, according to a paper 
published in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to find fish swimming in the Europan ocean,''  
said Joseph Kirschvink, one of the authors and a professor of 
geobiology at the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Organisms could live in the oceans heated by the strain of  
Jupiter's gravitational pull, researchers had said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hate to throw cold water on it, but ... it's basically a  
smothered planet,'' Kirschvink said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible that Europan organisms could derive their energy  
from rust, which is oxidized iron, or through some other source. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are talking about very simple organisms that can live  
on these energy sources,'' said Eric Gaidos, the paper's lead 
author and a geobiologist at Caltech.
