   SAN FRANCISCO _ In close-up photos, the many moons of Jupiter
appear eerie and alien. But scientists believe that three moons
probably have something in common with Earth: ice-covered oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a giant fault like the San Andreas Fault in California has
been discovered on one of the icy moons, Europa. The 500-mile fault
has a large, 30-mile-plus displacement similar to that along the
San Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparisons between this ... fault (on Europa) and faults on
Earth may generate ideas we can use in studying earth movements
here on our planet,'' University of Arizona space scientist Randy
Tufts said Monday at the American Geophysical Union conference
here. He displayed the photos taken by the Galileo space probe.

   Galileo's measurements of the magnetic field of one Jovian moon,
Ganymede, indicate it contains electrical conducting layers
characteristic of an ocean, said Margaret G. Kivelson, a space
scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by
robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the
latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, ``when I'm saying `oceans,' I'm not specifically
getting out my surfboard,'' Kivelson said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, scientists and engineers at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration hope to launch a robotic probe
to the Jovian moon Europa. The lander would settle on the icy
surface, then melt its way through to the hidden ocean. That ocean
might contain life forms warmed by undersea volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jovian moon Callisto also probably contains an ocean, based
on theoretical studies of its known composition, said space
scientist David J. Stevenson of the California Institute of
Technology. He estimates the ocean is roughly 60 miles deep and
lies under about 90 miles of ice.

   Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system
_ has earthlike aspects. Lightning and auroras are among them, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter even has super-lightning. The most energetic bolts are
1,000 times as powerful as the average terrestrial bolt, Caltech
space scientist Andrew P. Ingersoll said. And Jupiter's hurricanes
are mammoth _ as big as Earth itself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these slight similarities to Earth, Jupiter and its
moons are far stranger than anything seen on this planet. Jupiter
has faint rings, for example. Joseph Burns, a space scientist at
Cornell University, said the Jovian rings are formed from dusty
debris knocked off moons by meteoroids.
</P>
<P>
   And Jupiter's little moon Io _ where ferocious volcanoes spew
lava night and day _ may have a weirdly shaped magnetic field, said
Gary A. Glatzmaier, a space scientist at the University of
California at Santa Cruz. Because of Io's hot, bubbling interior
and its gravitational and electromagnetic interactions with
Jupiter, the moon may have four magnetic poles, Glatzmaier said.
Earth has just two magnetic poles.
</P>
<P>
   Hence a traveler carrying a compass around Io would tend to get
lost.
