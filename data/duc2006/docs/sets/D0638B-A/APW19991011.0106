<HEADLINE> Aging Probe Makes Jupiter Flyby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The aging and glitch-prone Galileo spacecraft  
successfully flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, overcoming 
huge doses of radiation and a computer problem just hours before 
the approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe made the closest-ever flyby at 10:06 p.m. PDT Sunday,  
said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled that the spacecraft handled this flyby so well,  
particularly because it had to endure such a strong dose of 
radiation from Jupiter,'' he said Monday. ``It appears everything 
went well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are  
studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic 
properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known 
actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us the opportunity to do comparisons between a  
non-Earth volcanic system and the Earth,'' Erickson said. ``We 
learn something about both of them in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Success was not guaranteed. Just 19 hours before the flyby, a  
memory error in a computer caused the spacecraft to enter a safe 
mode, and engineers worked up until two hours before the close 
approach to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Had attempts to recover failed, no science data or images would  
have been returned from the spacecraft 327 million miles from 
Earth, said Nagin Cox, deputy chief of the engineering flight team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was at home about 3 a.m. Sunday when she received the news  
of the error from JPL's flight control center. She quickly canceled 
plans to take part in her best friend's wedding and instead drove 
to JPL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing that occurred to me is that we're in that  
window where we have a chance to recover if we start acting right 
away,'' she said. ``We went through a period of a few hours where 
we were trying to get information on what had happened while we 
simultaneously put into motion the recovery plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours after the problem cropped up, engineers determined  
that it stemmed from a memory error, likely the result of the 
spacecraft's long exposure to high levels of radiation near the 
giant gaseous planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours of programming paid off, and the spacecraft is believed to  
have captured about 75 percent of the images and science data from 
the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo has sent mission engineers and controllers scrambling on  
several occasions since its 1989 launch, which itself was delayed 
for years by the 1986 Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists overcame the failure of the probe's main antenna to  
open properly and a malfunction of its tape recorder. Galileo still 
achieved 70 percent of its science goals during its $1.5 billion 
primary mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe is scheduled to make an even closer approach of Io on  
Nov. 25, flying within 186 miles of the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, completed its  
primary mission in 1997 and will finish a $30 million, two-year 
extended mission in January.
