JUPITER PROBE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW PLANETS FORMED

   A probe that plummeted into Jupiter's atmosphere late in 1995,
sampling its composition for the first time, found more than twice
the concentration of volatile elements like argon and nitrogen than
expected, raising questions about standard theories of how the
planets formed.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which a team of scientists led by Dr. Tobias Owen
of the University of Hawaii is reporting in Thursday's issue of
Nature, suggest that at least some of the rocky, icy bits of dust
and ice that crashed together to form Jupiter _ cometlike bodies
called planetesimals _ must have originated under cooler conditions
than prevail in the region of the solar system where the planet
orbits now. Otherwise the planetesimals would not have been cold
enough to trap the volatile gases, which would have been dispersed
among the other tenuous matter in interplanetary space.
</P>
<P>
   The observations, some researchers said, could mean that some
planetesimals rained down on the forming planet from the colder,
outer reaches of the solar system that are farther from the warmth
of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Other planetary scientists suggested that the results imply that
the whirling disk of dust, gas and rock in the young solar system,
called the solar nebula, simply shaded the sun's light more than
expected in standard theories.
</P>
<P>
   There is even the bizarre possibility that Jupiter formed as
much as 10 times farther from the sun than it is now, and somehow
lumbered inward to its present position. Most scientists dismissed
that possibility as extremely unlikely, but said the results
nevertheless posed a challenge for theories of planet formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specific pattern they find is puzzling,'' said Dr.
Jonathan I. Lunine, a professor of planetary science at the
University of Arizona, ``and it seems to require that the
planetesimals that carried these materials into Jupiter came from
very, very cold regions.''
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion could mean that the planetesimals came from near
where the more distant planets Uranus and Neptune are now, or from
still farther out, said Dr. Alan P. Boss, an astrophysicist at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, he said, is that the strong gravity of the forming
planet pulled in objects from slightly outside its present orbit,
and that the nebula was shaded more completely than earlier
estimates had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a new constraint saying, `Well, it had to be
cooler yet,''' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
   The data was collected in December 1995 when a probe set loose
from the Galileo spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, plunged into
the planet's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A device in the probe sorted the gases by mass and transmitted
data that, after extensive analysis, yielded concentrations of
carbon, sulfur, argon, xenon and krypton as compared to that of
hydrogen, the most common element in the cosmos, said Dr. Sushil
Atreya, a planetary scientist at the University of Michigan and
another collaborator on the work. A different technique determined
the nitrogen content, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the concentrations were two or three times as high as
those observed on the sun, Atreya said. Since the solar
concentration should reflect the composition of the warm, inner
portion of the solar nebula he said, the overall results were
unexpected.
