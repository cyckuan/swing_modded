	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ The Galileo spacecraft has solved
the mystery of Jupiter's faint rings, revealing they were formed
when cosmic debris smashed into four small inner moons, scientists
said Tuesday.
	   The rings _ which are nearly invisible to even the best
telescopes _ clearly show their relation to the moons' orbits,
scientists said.
	   ``Pictures are the smoking gun that allow us to say this theory
works,'' said Joseph Burns, the Cornell University astronomy
professor who arrived at the explanation for the rings.
	   It was long thought that the only ringed planet was Saturn, with
its prominent, icy bands, but the Voyager spacecraft revealed in
1979 that Jupiter also was surrounded by rings.
	   A more detailed look by the unmanned Galileo revealed the rings
are more numerous and complex than previously thought.
	   Michael Belton, an astronomer with the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Arizona, joined Burns and
Cornell colleagues Joseph Veverka and Maureen Ockert-Bell to
release the findings and images during a media teleconference from
Cornell.
	   The material was jointly announced with the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, which manages the Galileo project.
	   Dust grains and particles of comets and asteroids drawn by
Jupiter's strong gravity stream toward its irregularly shaped moons
at about 25 miles a second (40 kilometers a second) _ 100 times the
speed of a bullet, Veverka said.
	   They slam into the moons, creating explosive dust clouds that
eventually turned into orbiting rings so tenuous that the stars
shine right through them.
	   Because of Galileo, ``we now have a definitive answer to the
origin of this ring system and we now understand the processes
which lead to their appearance,'' said Belton, leader of the
Galileo imaging team. ``It's a big step forward.''
	   Galileo, launched in 1989, arrived at Jupiter in December 1995
and began a two-year tour of Jupiter and its four largest moons.
The current two-year mission extension is focusing on the moon
Europa.
