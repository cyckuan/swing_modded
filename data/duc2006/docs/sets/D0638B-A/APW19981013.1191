	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ More than 30 volcanoes spew lava, an
eerie blue light erupts from torrid fountains and a natural dynamo
generates more electricity than every power plant in America
combined. That's Io, a moon of Jupiter that is sort of an energy
hell.
	   New photos from the Galileo satellite show lava glowing in red
pools, scattered like an angry rash across the face of Io. There is
a bluish color from some eruptions, and, in black space just above,
there is an arc of light generated by power surges estimated at
more than 400,000 volts.
	   It all comes from a combination of volcanism, magnetic field
power generation and the enormous gravitation forces of Jupiter,
the monster that is Io's mother planet, said Paul Geissler of the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
	   Tidal forces from Jupiter twist and contort little Io, creating
frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes, he said.
	   ``Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system,''
Geissler said Tuesday at a meeting of the planetary division of the
American Astronomical Society.
	   There is enough lava flowing every year on Io, said Geissler, to
cover the entire surface almost a half inch (more than a
centimeter) deep. For this reason, the little moon is the only
major body known in the solar system to have no evidence of
asteroid craters. The lava erases the impact mark, he said.
	   Pillon, a major Io volcano, spews lava that is about 2,600
degrees F (1,400 degrees C), hundreds of degrees hotter than
volcanoes now active on Earth, said Geissler.
	   As it orbits Jupiter, Io intersects powerful magnetic field
lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical
generator. This natural dynamo creates more than a trillion watts
of power _ greater than the total output of all U.S. power
stations, he said.
	   The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter.
Pictures from Galileo show the moon with a glimmering halo.
	   Near the surface, the combination of electricity and gases from
the volcanoes create an even more unusual sight, said Geissler.
Sulfur dioxide venting from the volcanoes is energized by the
charged particles from the electrical fields. The gas then glows in
a brilliant blue.
	   Geissler said it works in the same way electricity causes
chemical vapor to glow in street lights that use mercury vapor,
which shines bluish white, or sodium vapor, which makes yellowish
light.
	   Io also has fields of red and green, generated when charged
particles energize molecules of oxygen and hydrogen and other
gases.
	   ``This light show has been going on for a billion years,'' said
Geissler, ``and this is the first time it has ever been seen.''
	   Galileo, orbiting Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will
continue taking photos of the planet and its satellites for at
least another year.
	   Io is 2,236 miles (3,598 kilometers) in diameter, slightly
larger than the Earth's moon. Io is one of four Jupiter moons
discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, one of the first
astronomers to study the heavens with a telescope. The other major
moons are Gannyede, Europa and Callisto. Jupiter has at least a
dozen smaller moons.
